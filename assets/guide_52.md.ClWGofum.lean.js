After the Kargs tried to hurt the village people that where Ged lived at and everyone tried to flee. His aunt taught him different kinds of powers here also. He used some of those powers to make some fog go away and almost died but the mage saved him and he became his. Ogion also gave Ged his name which was first Sparrow hawk.This brings me to chapter two. This is when of course Ged is now with the mage and is living with him as his prentice but wonders about it because the mage hasn't taught him any powers. He meets a new girl and she asks him to turn himself into another form and he runs home to look through hidden book to do the spell and the mage catches him and tells him that the girl was probably a witch. Ged confesses about what is troubling him and the mage asks him if he wants to leave or go to Roke and he chooses Roke! The mage is also known as Ogion.Chapter three and four are when Ged has arrived in Roke now and he goes to live with the Archmage Nemmerle. He is now there and he meets his friends Vetch and Jasper. They try to get him to do spells but he gets upset because he can only do illusions. This is a kind of turning point. It was spring time and Ged was studying with the Master patterner in the secrecy of the immanent grove. He didn't see his friends much. This is a time when he starts to become mad with jasper. He was sent home by the master and at the little party. Jasper was getting a lot of shine which made Ged very upset and Jealous.Chapter five and six are very interesting because Vetch and Jasper tried to get Ged to do some crazy and dangerous magic. Bring a dead person back to life. Ged did it and he brought back an evil force. A woman, she tried to kill him and everyone. Ged created a magewind to help move the ship. After that Ged traveled to Oskhill to go to court of the Terrenon to get a sword to fight shadows with. The Gebbeth escaped by going through a door of some kind.This part of the book gets very good because Ged awakes in a big bed and Hoeg was gone. Ged met a woman names Serret which was the wife of Benderesk. Ged refused to touch the stone and speak to it because it can work great evil. Serret wanted Ged to talk to the stone. Ged escaped successfully from the creatures of the Stone. Ogion gave Ged some advice, he said go back to the place where he was harmed. Read the rest! You will enjoy it!So this brings me to the end of the book, there is more I can say but I want to make this short. My group liked this book very much. We recommend it if you like the Harry Potter series. It's an easy book to read and it keeps you wanting more. We recommend this book to ages 13-16. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"If you like fantasy, A Wizard of Earthsea, by Ursula K Le Guin, is an enjoyable read. Le Guin creates a wonderful world of wizards, dragons, heroes and villains, where a young boy, Duny, grows into a man and a wizard. After saving his village from maurauders, Duny is given his true name, Ged, and leaves with the Mage Ogion to gain the knowledge to fulfill his destiny. When Ged's pride leads him to unleash the evil shadow, he must face himself and his fears to restore the balance he has upset.A Wizard of Earthsea is fun for those who enjoy entering a world where anything is possible, however, the story is predictable and at times tedious. Le Guin inundates the reader with the names of the various islands, mountains and seas in which the story takes place. It becomes rather like a Geography lesson as one follows Ged on his journeys. Le Guin is exhaustive in her descriptions and histories of the people and places that comprise Earthsea.Because A Wizard of Earthsea is at times a tedious read, I would not recommend it to readers who do not enjoy fantasy. For those who do, A Wizard of Earthsea, and the remaining books in the series, will be a pleasurable excursion into a world of wizards and magic."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Rarely that one finds a book so simply written, yet so beautiful. The characters are not larger than life. A wonderful few hours of escaping reality. A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"It may sound crazy, but I first read the Earthsea trilogy when I was in sixth grade. I have read all four of the Earthsea books at least once a year since then and, when people ask me what got me interested in literature, so interested that I'm now studying for my PhD, I tell them it was this book. Enough said."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I have all four of the earthsea books, and have to say that the first one is the best. We are introduced to the major character in the series, Ged, and his beginnings to becoming an archmage. I remember reading this many years ago in high school and just being in rapture while reading it. The chasing of the shadow...very metaphorical. Although the next 3 in the series only get 3 stars from me, this one is definately a 4."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This series is fairly interesting. I would not recommend it for adults. I would recommend it for kids under the age of 14. The books are far too short, there is little plot or character development. Frankly I was disappointed at how the books related to each other, there were too many major gaps in the series. In reading a review that said: &quot;If you liked the Hobbit you will love these.&quot; This is a poor characterization. These books are not even in the same league as Tolkien. They would be good books for kids just getting into fantasy, but for the veteran fantasy buff recommend Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series or Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn or something of the like. The premise behind the plots of these books is good but is not developed well."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The Wizard of Earthsea was an incredibly difficult novel. Ged's coming of age story lacked the necessary pieces to form a great work of art. The lack of excitement and character development made for a tedious reading. Earthsea's stop and go, choppy presentation created even more difficulties. The climactic scenes were few and far between and without those couple of events, the book would have been a complete failure. The two main confrontation scenes held the most excitement and this enthrallment simply festered out of the need for action and longing for an interesting facet to this book.Another fault within the confines of this book was the poor depiction of time. With all of the sea travel and moving around, the time frame seemed to extend to decades. It appeared to be much like an epic, extending over an incredible amount of time. However, in actuality the lapse was only a couple of years. There was only one instance where the time passed was given an amount. The time between the first encounter with the shadow and the running into Vetch towards the end of the novel was two years. In those two years, Ged had traveled far and encountered much, so much it seemed impossible that it had only been two years. For this reason, it was extremely difficult to give age, appearance or understanding to the character, Ged. The similarities between Earthsea and Harry Potter were amazing, however, Harry Potter was written well with character development and exciting, adrenaline-rushing scenes. Despite the similar aspects Earthsea fails to live up to Harry Potter or Tolkien's Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"If you are reading this book for your Harry Potter fix, you will find next to no similarities. Yes, the main character is a young wizard and he does spend time in a wizard school, but that is where the similarities end. This story is more serious and told more like a fable and has none of the fun, sometimes whimsical nature of a Potter story.I enjoyed the story and it was over before it even got started coming in at a thin 196 pages in paperback. Alot of Ged's life is breezed over, sometimes covering years in a paragraph or 2. About halfway through the story, you know pretty much how it will end and it seems to drag out the inevitable with a very short final conflict.The world Le Guin creates is a huge island based realm with boats and water in abundance. Magic is ubiquitous and wizards are highly respected members of society. I was drawn into the story by the legends and lore as well as fantasy elements like dragons, but didn't care much at all for any of the characters who are never given much depth.Maybe in the 60's this book was a breath of fresh air in the fantasy world, but it just doesn't hold up over time to current books with much better drawn characters, more fantasic worlds and more engrossing plots."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is a classic book and with good reason. It takes the standard concepts good vs evil, becoming a better person or become the person you are meant to be; and Le Guin makes is it feel fresh and inviting you want to know more. The reason for only 3 stars is due to my personal bias of finding the writing style a bit cumberson. This will however not stop me from reading the rest of the series because I want to know Ged's journey."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read fantasy to escape the mundanity of life and to escape the human body (with it's limited capabilities).

As soon as I started the Earthsea Cycle I had a third.The world of Earthsea is very brilliantly created. Rather than learn about the world up front you discover each land through different characters. As Ursula mentions in the book, she doesn't have a complete picture either and discovers though the eyes of the characters. The books should definitely be read in order to get the full experience. The other wind provides a fantastic ending, but much is left to be imagined. I almost don't want to pick up another series just so I can live in earthsea for a bit longer.I definitely recommend this series for anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" the year it was published, just after returning home from my own odyssey as a peace corps volunteer in India. The lyrical language, the adventure upon the open water travelling to the unknown, the voyage to the personal unknown--and perhaps unknowable--all resonated with me.Upon a second reading, it is still a strong and vibrant story, though I became a bit bored with the repeated hopping from one port town to the next and the multiple close calls. I could certainly relate to her descriptions of walking to exhaustion, and pushing oneself to the limits of one's endurance!There was a plot hole which I felt was not sufficiently explained and upon re-reading still feel that it is a bit wobbly, but a minor kvetch for a marvellous book. I thought it very clever of her to introduce the \\"stubs\\", the unresolved questions from which other books will take their start, woven into the narrative and not just plugged in at the end.I know it's a YA book, but don't let that description deter you. It's beautiful and enduring, a work of art."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is a decent book, and part of a great series. There's something really timeless and innocent, but philosophical, about Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea novels.Unfortunately, when I first read A Wizard of Earthsea, I found it to be slow and a bit boring. I didn't get what all the fuss was about. It's short, and definitely a classic heroic journey. However, it didn't excite me. I didn't fall in love with the characters. Actually, that's probably an understatement, I was more or less turned off to the whole idea of Earthsea. I shoved the book somewhere in my garage (where my books go to die) and thought I'd never pick it up again. In my mind, I wrote it off as \\"The Hobbit, Lite.\\"My second reading was different. I had gotten and read a used copy of The Farthest Shore (Book 3 of the Earthsea series) at a hostel book exchange, and was somehow blown away. I devoured the other Earthsea books, and loved them. Finally, I dusted off this book and read it again. This time, I found it much more charming. I loved the characters by then, and found the story much more exciting as a result.So, though I know this book is chronologically first in the Earthsea series, I (personally) do not like it as an intro to the Earthsea world. I would read the other books first. Because, on its own merits, A Wizard of Earthsea is only ok. But, as a prequel featuring characters I already love, the book is an absolute treat."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I first read this book in 1984 when I was 12 years old and I have returned to it many times over the years, re-reading either parts of it or the entire novel. A Wizard of Earthsea has few peers in the fantasy genre. As relevant for mature readers as young ones, this book works its spell on you by capturing your imagination. Its themes are timeless: the individual's search for meaning in the face of uncertainty, friendship, maturity, and most importantly redemption and acceptance. Although there is a good bit of action in this story, the real action of the story plays on a deeper level: self-discovery."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"No wonder this is a classic. This book is truly a work of genius--creating not only a new realm, but philosophic underpinnings for it in a natural-seeming way. It almost feels like an authentic myth that developed over time, not like a work of contemporary fiction. I could hardly put it down. Moreover, while many fantasy writers tell good stories, their style is often lacking. LeGuin balances plot, character, and style perfectly.I won't go into more detail, as there are so many other reviews, but I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes fantasy and adventure."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book was recommended to me and I really liked it.

The story is good, but there isn't a lot of dialogue or character interaction. It's a good story, but while reading it I felt like there was something missing.

One very interesting trick that , for me, seemed brilliant but so simple you'd miss it if you weren't paying attention was the uncomplicated way magic was used in the book.Many fantasy novels go to great lengths to create whole languages and spend tremendous effort on the explaination of how magic works and why. In this book the author jsut says, \\"Ged laid a charm upon it and the brackish water ran pure.\\" Another example would be, \\"He had to hold his boat together mostly with magic.\\" It's very simple and in itself uses the magic of giving enough information to paint a detail, but leaving enough out so that the reader's own imagination can fill in the gaps instead of being beaten over the head with details until it submits to the author's pre-envisioned ideal of how the story should appear.Kudos to the author for she has given us a delightful book that is fun to read and not so hung up on itself that it becomes a fantasy physics piece. Kudos for keeping it simple but rich."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The world of Earthsea is so rich, textured, and well developed that it is hard to force yourself to leave it once the book is over. I know this is suppose to be a book for young adults but it doesn't read like a young adult book at all. The themes and topics addressed in the book really explore the universal state of humanity in a way that makes you think about your worldview.

In rivalry with another student, he abuses his new powers, unintentionally unleashing a dark force. He pays dearly for his foolish dabbling and is scarred for life. He feels great remorse and wants to make things right, vowing to use his powers only for good, but he can't seem to outrun the shadow spirit he awakened. Finally, Ged comes to understand that he'll have to pursue the shadow and conquer it, or it will plague him and Earthsea forever.With his steadfast friend Vetch, Ged makes a long journey \\"to the coasts of death's kingdom.\\" He faces down his demon and becomes \\"a man: who, knowing his whole true self, cannot be used or possessed by any power other than himself, and whose life therefore is lived for life's sake and never in the service of ruin or pain, or hatred, or the dark.\\" (Best description of manhood I've ever found---ever.)This book has all the elements of the traditional fantasy questing tale: developing magical powers, fighting the dragon, lonely travels, loyal friends, sinister enemies, and venturing into the great unknown for a final showdown. A Wizard of Earthsea is set apart from others in the genre by two things:1) its strong literary quality (Harry Potter it ain't).2) its understated wisdom, often shared by the older mages and wizards who train Ged. Ged's first teacher, Ogion, is especially wise, and he also happens to be my favorite character.If you like critters, you'll want to acquire some new pets after reading this story. I'll start my Earthsea menagerie with a harrekki, a miniature dragon that lives in oak trees and dines on wasps and worms and sparrows' eggs.

Le Guin is about a powerful wizard in the archipelago of Earthsea who, in his quest for mastery of all words of power, unintentionally unleashes a terrible shadow upon the peaceful lands. The all-powerful wizard, who is named Ged, is also called Sparrowhawk in his bumbling as well as awe-inspiring youth. When the Kargs, the people from the island to the north of his attack, Ged conjures up a fog spell he learned from his aunt to hide the townspeople from the Kargs. When Ogion hears about this, he exclaims that he believes Ged will become one of the greatest wizards ever. Ogion then takes Ged to the Isle of the Mages to learn all he can about wizardry.At the Isle of the Mages, Ged, who is now named Sparrowhawk by Ogion, learns much at a high rate. Being a young and naive wizard, Sparrowhawk challenges his arch-rival, Jasper to a dangerous if not forbidden duel to the death. During this pride instigated battle, Sparrowhawk attempts to use a spell too difficult for him to control and greatly injures himself. The enchantment he attempts summons a spirit from the dead which was, after attacking Sparrowhawk, loosed upon the lands of Earthsea. Soon, much evil happens across the lands. Sparrowhawk was sent to the island of Low Torning to battle newly hatched dragons and, upon his arrival, found the head dragon. Because the mage guessed the dragon's name correctly, he then controlled the dragon. The wizard forced the dragon to tell the others to not attack the people of Earthsea, which turns Sparrowhawk into a dragonlord. Then the wizard feels obligated to finally destroy the black shadow. He tracks the shadow down and calls it by its real name, Ged. He reasons with it and it returns to the wizard's body because Sparrowhawk realizes that the shadow is only a part of him that he was scared of. He realizes that there is always going to be an evil side to him to balance everything out. This book was very good and I can't wait to read the next one in the series.I liked the different turning points in the book. They were very original and there were a lot. For example there were points like when Ogion comes to Gont and tells him that he will be one of the greatest wizards ever. Two other big turning points were when Sparrowhawk unleashes the shadow and becomes slightly disabled and when he finds his yew staff which brings him back to his normal self.Another thing I really liked about this book was watching the changes and big decisions Sparrowhawk made in his life. A big decision he makes is when he goes to the Isle of the Mages instead of staying in Gont with his family. Another big decision he makes, which was also a risk, is to stay on the island of Low Torning to battle the dragons. Even though he was urged to leave, he knew what he had to do. At the island, while he is battling the dragon, the dragon offers to tell him the name of the shadow with the price of releasing all of the dragons and letting them destroy the East side of Earthsea. Sparrowhawk refuses the offer and decides to learn the name of the shadow himself.The other thing I really liked about this book are the lessons it teaches to the readers. It teaches to the readers as well as the main character that there will always be a good side and a bad side of any given human being. The thing that defines a person is the way they balance it out. As long as you realize this and attempt to control it, you will always be considered \\"good\\".I liked this book a lot and thought it is one of the best fantasy books I have read. I did not expect it to be so good because all I did was go to Barnes and Nobles and picked out the first book I could find. It turned out that I made a good choice. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"\\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is the first of a trilogy set in the World of Earthsea long ago, during a time when dragons, wizards and magic were not uncommon, nor yet extinct. The island of Gont, located in the stormy Northeast Sea, is a land famous for its wizards. Gont's most famous native son was Ged, called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage. His life is told in the \\"Deed of Ged,\\" in many other stories and songs, and in this book.Duny, a boy from the village of Ten Alders, was fascinated by his aunt's small \\"women's\\" magic. She was the local witch, no dark sorceress, but someone of use to the townspeople with her herbs and simple spells. The boy seemed to have a natural inclination for magic, and his aunt taught him a variety of tricks. His innate skills were put to a test when hordes of vicious Kargs invaded his homeland. His quick thinking allowed him to tap into his limited repertoire and come up with a spell to enshroud the village and its inhabitants in fog. Thus they were invisible to the enemy and almost everyone was saved. Word of the deed spread until Ogion the Silent, the great mage of Re Albi who tamed an earthquake, finally heard of Duny. Ogion comes for the boy on his thirteenth birthday and gives him his \\"true name,\\" which is Ged. And Ged takes the use-name (nickname) of Sparrowhawk. Very few in this world know a person's true name, \\"because who knows a man's true name, holds that man's life in his keeping.\\"Ged travels with Ogion to Re Albi as his apprentice, learning to read and write the Six Hundred Runes of Hardic and proves to be an adept student. He finds he has developed a power which allows him to call animals. However, Ged is tempted by magic clearly forbidden to one so inexperienced, and makes a terrible mistake. From this incident, Ged and Ogion learn that he has become too powerful at too young an age and is not able to control the magic within. The boy decides to leave his beloved mentor and travel to Roke Island and the School (for sorcery). Here he studies under the Archmage Nemmerle, Warder of Roke and the nine Masters of Roke. He finds that a wizard's life is spent learning the true name of things in the old tongue. Power to a mage must be kept in balance. Every action has a reaction. Again, training goes extremely well for Ged until pride and willfulness cause him to step over the line again, and foolishly use power which he not yet mastered. This time the consequences are truly horrific and will have a lasting effect on his life.Ged must move on, past this trauma to body and spirit, and continue to seek wisdom while he prepares to confront his monsters. He must also serve as sorcerer to the people he made a contract with. His adventures along the way are thrilling, as is the novel's extraordinary climax. This is a phenomenal book!Although this novel, and the entire trilogy, have been classified as children's books, I don't know whether I totally agree with the label or classification. The plots may well be appreciated by children and adults alike, but the prose, the very language used to form the riveting storylines, is as rich and flavorful as dark Belgian chocolate. I had to stop several times to read descriptive passages aloud, to listen to the music of the narrative. The author paints a universe of landscapes with words, and they're as vivid in the mind's eye as seeing the real thing. The narrative voice is bard-like, as if relating a legend of long ago. Ms. LeGuin's exposure to Native American legends as well as Norse mythology is evident in her writing. She is the daughter of anthropologists and throughout her fiction there seems to be a deep understanding of how societies work, how they are built and evolve. Ursula Le Guin is an artist, pure and simple, as well as a magical writer.JANA"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The Earthsea Trilogy (now five books total, but originally A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore) is part of the fantasy canon and the first book is by far the best.From headstrong and impatient youth, to upstart schoolboy to true wizard (wizard derives from the words \\"wise\\" and \\"one\\"), A Wizard of Earthsea follows the rites of passage of Ged who learns to control his power, his emotions, and his knowledge as he journeys through his adolescence -- he becomes a greater wizard and better person with age and adversity, a lesson LeGuin imparts to her primary readership in this book (teens and young adults).There's a lot here in this small book: a fully developed world, a system of magic (the true name concept that one can obtain power over something or someone by knowing its true name) that has spawned similar magic systems in other fantasy worlds (Black Company's true name of sorcerers, Belgariad's Will and the Word), a school of magic, a plethora of dangers and adventures, and one of the great mage-mentors, Ogion the Silent. All of which is evoked simply, swiftly and without authorial self-indulgence.Plus, this is a rare fantasy series because its heroes are not European-esque Caucasians. The Earthsea islands seem like North Sea chains, but Ged (reddish-brown skinned), Ogion (same) and Vetch (black-skinned) are the main heroes and none is a typical Caucasoid male.This is one of the great books of fantasy fiction.

Although the story is fantasy, I found Ged's journey to remind me somewhat of the journey of the hero of \\"The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,\\" another great coming-of-age story (although a real-life one). This indicates to me that Ged's story, despite its fantasy setting, is firmly grounded in real emotions and ethical concerns.LeGuin has created a complete and compelling world. Masterfully woven into her narrative are geology, meteorology, linguistics, racial diversity, oral and written literature, dragon biology, and other aspects of this world. Her prose style is simple but elegant, often poetic and mystical; the book has a timeless, classic quality. If you only know LeGuin as the author of classic science fiction, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" will reveal her to you as a master of the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Hallo fantasy lovers,I am a girl from a Eastern Europe, Latvia, and in love with le Guin's books. I have read the Earthsea trilogy, that's the only of her books that has been translated in my language, but English books are unfortunately hardly available here. Yet I would like so much to read them in original... I think English is much more appropriate language for tales and fantasy... and of course, to possess them... But they are long since out of print in Latvia. Now they are publishing mostly trash that I do not read.I could, of course, have the books through Internet but there's a problem that my student's scholarship does not quite coincide with the normal Western prices. ( If somebody's interested, the scholarship for excellent marks is around 15 dollars a month - is it not ridiculous?). That's why I am writing this review hoping to find a friendly readerly heart. Is there anybody out there who has has got a spare copy of le Guin' s works that he/she could share? It can be old and suffered, of course. I only want to read them desperately. If there's a kind soul that thinks of a possibility to help me, my email address is brr81@hotmail.com I would really be most thankful, indeed, for any kind of interest in my plea.

It is rich, deep and well worth the time of a serious reader, as well as being a great read for someone looking for entertainment. The previous comments about the descent into the subconscious and the search for the Anima (etc.) are welcome insights to carry during my frequent re-readings. As true and important in its own way as Dione Fortune's The Sea Priestess and Moon Magic for its sensible treatment of real magic. [And it isn't about the spells described in the book or the (quote)language of the Dragons(unquote)that I'm talking about.] Thank you Ursula."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea - Ursula Le GuinThis is a story of a young boy named Sparrowhawk and how he grows into the man (and wizard) that he will become. Sparrowhawk begins as a young goat herder on the island of Gont. He is being trained by a witch there, but when he uses his powers to defend his island from attack, he attracts the notice of a powerful wizard named Ogion. Ogion tells Sparrowhawk that his true name is Ged. (a true name holds great power in Earthsea for it permits the speaker power over the named) and takes him on as an apprentice. Ged learns quickly and is reckless in both his learning of magic as well as his application of magic, and this eventually gets him in trouble. Ged desires more knowledge and goes to the school at Roke. It is here that Ged truly excels, but it is also at Roke that he casts a spell that calls a shade (best description of it without spoiling it) that is much stronger than Ged.This begins the quest portion of the book as Ged both flees from the shade and later confronts it (that's not a spoiler, you had to know it's coming). There is magic use, a really nice fight against dragons, and some adventure. Overall, I wasn't too excited about this book. I know it is a classic in the fantasy field, but it was a little slower and less interesting than I had hoped. It was well written, certainly, but it also lacked a little something to make me want to keep turning the pages. Honestly, I didn't care what happened to Sparrowhawk. And so, I can't really recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book kept trying to make me think about the power of language, the balance of good and evil,and being responsible. Because of those reasons, I wanted stop reading it at page34, but unfortunetly it was required for school. Why can't a book be both preachy and entertaining? The only time I sit down and ponder the theme of a book is when the story didn't need the theme and was just intresting itself.This book failed at that. The plot of this book is also lame. Its about a young powerfull wizard who unleashes something terrible unto the world and goes hunting after it. Nothing else happens except this part involving dragons."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I had heard high praise on this book from many people, so I thought I would give it a try. I am always up for reading a new book, whatever genre it may be. I started reading it. The plot was a little vague to begin with, but I can name a few good books that have a slow beginning, so I gave it the optimistic approach and continued reading. But it never picked up my attention. I always felt disconnected from the characters and plot, and I never felt that I knew anybody's personality. Important people died and people cried and villages were saved and burned, etc. I just didn't care. I felt that this was the story of some random person that I didn't need to be reading. But don't let my review scare you off from reading the book. Different people have different opinions. You might see some entertaining prospect of the book that I have not found, so have at it. Happy Reading."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is the first in a series of books. There are 4 novels in the series and two collections of short stories. It follows the life and career of Ged a young man from the Island of Gont. Le Guin has created a very unique world, a world that is mostly water and each nation is a collection of islands. This book is also one of a few that has children's teens and adult editions in print.Ged apprentices to the local Wizard on God, and is eventually sent to the school for wizards on Havnor. There in anger during a fight with other youths he releases a dark shadow, an evil. The Masters of the school appear and banish it from the island. However this shadow and Ged are now tied together in a very unique way.After leaving the school Ged becomes haunted by the shadow he has released. He tries to return to the protection of Havnor but cannot return to the island the magic protecting the island will not let him approach. So he decides to head south.The shadow is getting closer and closer to him, and he must discern it's true name or else he will not be able to defeat it. Can he solve the puzzle, will he wrestle with his shadow and win or will he succumb to the evil he has let loose.This is a book I first read back in highschool. Then a few years back had to read it for an English literature course at the University of Waterloo I was about a third of the way through it when I realized I had read it before and that is when I found our that the story continued. Since then the two collections of short stories have been published in this world.Le Guin deals with some big questions of life in this book. Such questions as:Who am I?Do I have a role or purpose in life?Can I defeat the darkness within me?Can good conquer over evil?Why am I here?Can I make a difference?This book will be a good read for anyone who has ever struggled with some of these questions. Or who wants to use a novel to help them grow to have a deeper understanding of themselves."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The earthsea quartet was wonderful. I've read it many times. It takes you on ups, and downs. You see suspence, fear, humor, love, anything you could ask fore. Ged is my hero! These were such great books, and I think everyone should read them!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"While I have not read any of Le Guin's other works, this book sorely tempts me to try. As others have said, the fast and furious action of sword fights and magic battles is somewhat lacking. It should be stated, however, that the book never pretends to offer that. It is more a story of growth and personal development and this is what Le Guin clearly accomplishes. She writes in such a manner as to engage readers of all ages over 13 with solid writing, incredible plot and character development, and extremely good dialogue. The action, when it is present, is appropriate for the scene and is never the focal point of the chapter. Call it the psychological drama/thriller of fantasy, I just call it a really good book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Has alot of strange things in the begining, but there are enough explainations and descriptions in the later chapters. Great for any person just begining fantasy, this would be the book to start reading. McCaffrey and Tolkien and Le Guin are my favorite, they all seem to be of a parallel, if not the exact same types of fantasy. Gives great insight on nature of person, world, and our feelings, actions and thoughts.

I read it quite a while ago but It made a big impact on me. I like how the main character developed throughout the book. It also showed that we all go through trials even the most powerful of us, Sparrowhawk had to respect the power of words and keep the balance. This, in my opinion, was the best book in the whole series. The rest were very good too. It delved deep into the mind of the main character and kept me captivated the whole time. Her writing style is very good, and so is her ability to describe. I loved this book. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to read the whole series, if not they can still enjoy the one book but I would find it impossible to not continue with the series. Buy it and savor every page!!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"LeGuin creates a completely believable world reminiscient of the days when Viking pirates plundered European settlements. Earthsea is an archipelago of small and large islands, ruled by island kings threatened by seagoing marauders and the occasional dragon. It is a region still subject to the creative power which formed the islands out of the sea and still endows a few of its inhabitants with some degree of magical power. From amongst these some are drawn to train as fully fledged wizards on the island of Roke so as to serve the island kings or attend to woes of the island people.Into this world the young rustic boy Ged is born with exceptional powers which after their initial wonder and excitement prove more of a burden to him and serve instead to separate him from his family and people. LeGuin writes an intriguing tale of the loneliness of power and the terrible consequences of our actions, even if it is unintentional or well-meaning.LeGuin demonstrates clearly that she is one of the few writers who appreciates that power even of the magical kind has its own rules and limitations which may set us on a path which taxes us to our limits and may deprive of us of life's simpler pleasures and the gift of peace of mind. And so Ged discovers that simple pranks when dabbling in magic have fateful consequences which pursue him to the ends of his world and that a wizard is not the master of his world but very much its servant with his hands not only full but tied.Why and how is explained carefully and ingeniously through the course of the three novels, teaching us why magicians deserve our respect and our pity.But LeGuin can be merciful and Ged's lonely life finds unexpected peace and comfort in the concluding novel Tehanu."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This Wonderful book 'must' be read by all.If anyone thinks they are getting dull and/or boring, then they should read this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"As a devout Tolkien fan, I've looked long and hard for a book that can grip my imagination like any of the famous Lord of the Rings trilogy. I thought I'd found the cure to my fever when I purchased this book that was glorified as &quot;a classic of high fantasy...compared to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis's Narnia stories.&quot; I was well disappointed.As I trudged through the story of Ged the boring one dimentional wizard who is always glum, I began to realize that I may never find a story that satisfies my need to replace Bilbo, Frodo or Gandalf. There is no development of other characters in Wizard of Earthsea. Only an agonizing depiction of a wizard who chases his shadow day after day. However, there is one bright light for this story (the reason I was able to give it 2 stars), it's well written. That in itself is a rarity these days.If you are looking for an engaging story, I recommend skipping the Earthsea trilogy and trying something fresh with George R.R. Martin's trilogy starting with A Game of Thrones. Although the tiny Earthsea books are easier to carry around with you than the mammoth Game of Thrones or Clash of Kings, you'll be much more satisfied in the end!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I don't often read books that combine a fantasy setting, spare, evocative prose with ideas of such great depth and - dare I say it? - universality. There is no real need to intellectualize about this book: there is a real case to READ it.The young Sparrowhawk, wizard aspirant falls afoul of the shadow of his own hubris and spends the rest of the tale trying to master the consequences of his arrogance and ignorance. Earthsea is a beautifully realized setting - with a minimum of verbiage, which so often in fantasy can overwhelm with its detail. The ideas - psychoanalytical, existential and drenched in an Eastern-style holism - speak gently through the simple language. I love this book and the first two sequels. Read 'em all."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"There are a lot of positive things that can be said about this book, and this series. One thing many reviewers seem to be overlooking is the simple beauty of LeGuin's writing. She employs a simple, almost monosyllabic vocabulary, to give her tale the feel of a song, or a poem. Compare her use of language to, for example, the frenzied addiction to long-winded, Latin-derived vocabulary used by Poe, and you will see why her writing conveys an almost mythic calm. I also like the way she has such beautiful sentence structure -- many sentences are like terraced waterfalls, with the reader's mind tumbling lazily down a series off steplike prepositional phrases. If you want to study writing, and the use of language, you could do a heck of a lot worse than start with this book.The story is of a young man's growth to wisdom. There is Taoism as well as Jungian ideas all through this story -- if you can get a copy, (which would have been very difficult if you live in a small town, until Amazon.com and its competitors came along), I recommend picking up the &quot;Tao te Ching&quot;, by Lao-Tzu. You will recognize many quotations from this story.You can have a lot of fun with this story, and hopefully get a lot out of it. Check it out!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"It is a strange thing, reading a fantasy novel written decades ago. It is one of the most forceful reminders of how tastes -- and styles -- have changed. This is not a slambang, sword wielding fantasy, the kind many of us have become accustomed to in the past few years. Nor is it the cute, elfin, or funny sort of fantasy, either. There are no cute creatures and only a few scary ones. In other words, this is not a book for the reader looking for instant gratification.The world of Earthsea is composed of groups of islands, each with its own history, and often with different languages. The sea is the highway between them, with boats of various sizes and shapes moving over it from place to place. But the sea is more: it is a character that influences eventsLeguin tells the story of Ged and his search for a dark entity in a lyrical and languid way. Here the beauty is as much in the words as in the setting. Certainly, the characters are less than sympathetic, at least in the beginning. Ged, a young, soon-to-be wizard, somewhat brash, not caring about the consequences of his actions. Ogion the Silent, who knows all and tells nothing. The Dragon of Pendor, hugely ominous and dangerous. And Vetch, Ged's friend and confidant. None of these are well-drawn at first. But, when the book ends, the reader feels that he or she knows each.This, the first in the Earthsea trilogy, published in the 1960s, reflects the inward looking of that time. People trying to find themselves and their place in the world. Before Ged is named, his own search begins as he grows and changes, becoming a person to be reckoned with in his own world.Readers of this book may also like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, by C.S. Lewis, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I thought A Wizard of Earthsea was a pretty good book. Because it isn't modern, it wasn't very humorous, but sometimes books don't have to be funny to be enjoyable. Ged (Sparrowhawk) travels through some pretty interesting adventures, and he learns about courage, wisdom, friendship, and masters the art of wizardry along the way. The mysterious and evil magic he encounters almost takes him in, but with the help of his friend Erastarriol (Vetch), he overcomes it and learns that their is nothing better in life than friendship. This book wasn't your typical Harry Potter or other type of magical book, it felt much more ancient as I was reading it, and to me that made it more mythical and enchanting.

LeGuin, A Wizard of Earthsea (Atheneum, 1968)The first volume in LeGuin's celebrated Earthsea quartet, this volume follows Ged from his boyhood through his early years as a full-fledged wizard. (Those unfortunate enough to have watched the recent Sci-Fi Channel abomination will be rather surprised at a few key liberties the adapters took with the text.) I'm usually a huge fan of LeGuin's young adult work (Very Far Away from Anywhere Else was on my twenty-five-best list when I read it in 1997), but her tone here is a bit on the didactic side, a far cry from the natural prose she normally uses. Not that it'll keep me away from the other three in the series, as the characters are well-drawn and LeGuin laid her hooks for the next books quite neatly in a row in this one, but if you're new to the wonderful world of LeGuin, I'd suggest starting with one of the adult books before trying these out. ***"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Nor does each volume have to be 1000 pages long!

As I read, the personal conflicts and complexity of her characters was amazing. You get to feel for their struggle and understand it intimately. This is a classic book and a wonderful read.My only criticism is simple, I wanted more. The writer has a wonderful ability to describe the surroundings and situations, but I felt wanting to know more about the character and the situation. Sometimes, it felt like the story jumped from one point to another without a clear connection. None the less, it is an awesome book, worth reading.

I found myself enjoying it a lot. It is a very complicated tale about limitation and about fighting one's own personal demons.The cast of characters is deliciously real and every character has many aspects:Ged is torn in two, his bravery and courage is being tested, his honesty and goodness even more so, as he releases a great evil and must fight it with both sides of himself. His teacher is wise and tries to remain as objective as possible, yet he loves his pupil dearly and his icy manners are not as solid as Ged initially thinks. Serret is as beautiful as she is deceiving.

After discovering that he has some power, Ged goes on a quest of trying to see what else he has power to do. Ged was not satisfied with a few things he had to learn and do more.

On the other, I just didn't find this book engaging, particularly in the second half. When I take an entire week to get through a 200-page book, it tends to be bad news.My conclusion: This book just isn't for everyone. A lot of reviewers seem to have been referred to it because of their enjoyment of Tolkein or Rowling, and were understandably disappointed. Stylistically, reading A Wizard of Earthsea is akin to reading a myth or fable, rather than a popular novel. Anthropology, worldbuilding and thematics are its strong points; heart-pounding action nowhere to be found; and bits of dialogue few and far between. Characterization is solid, although we see little of anyone other than Ged.No, I didn't really enjoy reading this book, but then I tire of reading Greek myths, biographies, and history texts as well. A Wizard of Earthsea is a well-written book, and if any of the above appeal to you, you'll probably like it better than I did.

Doubtless this comparison has been made so many times that it must be hackneyed by now, but while Harry Potter can be fun, it really is playing with the trappings of magic while these guys give you the real thing. An absurd thing for me to say when talking about fiction, but I suspect many readers know just what I'm talking about.Part of way Le Guin gets us there is in the simple dignity of her narration (cf.The Left Hand of Darkness). But there's also the skill in spoiling us with a powerful wizard (something everybody does) but tempering this with an awareness of the cost. Ged is set up for a fall, sure, but this makes it no less tragic and potent, and informs the rest of the story. It doesn't just have him as an enigmatic brooding figure - we know why he now deals with people the way he does.Oh, by the way, Le Guin capably creates a world, throwing in original ideas among some of the familiar ones. Not a bad trick that - she's deservedly a professional writer - but this isn't what sets her apart."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"While the Eartsea series was written for adolescents, it is a wonderful search-for-self journey that adults of all ages can enjoy. LeGuin's love of the philosophy of Taoism is prevalent in all of her works, but this book really focuses on the concepts of Yin and Yang, how to recognize them in our daily lives, and how that recognition (and acceptance) helps make us \\"whole.\\" Her use of images of light and dark wonderfully underscore Ged's journeys into the threatening unknown and then back to places of \\"safety.\\" As Ged's emotional crisis intensifies, so do the images of darkness, of things considered \\"evil\\" because they are separate, alien, unknown.While you don't need any knowledge of Taoism to enjoy this series, with a little research, the text takes on a whole new life. Every image is significant; like peeling an onion, there is layer after layer of meaning.Although this is the first book of a trilogy, the story doesn't come full-circle until the fourth book, Tehanu. LeGuin's writing comes full-circle as well; in the many years between the books, both she and the characters have gone through many life changes. The maturity and reflection that has resulted is obvious in the voice she writes with. If you enjoyed the triology, keep reading! She just keeps getting better."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I picked up A Wizard of Earthsea, by Ursula Le Guin, in a moment of weakness in a beautiful bookstore in Montrose, called Once Upon a Time. I had promised myself that I would not buy anymore books, and instead borrow them from the library. But this particular bookstore had a whole section of \\"We recommend\\" books, with bookmarks inserted, each with a compelling description of the books' best assets. I just couldn't resist picking up a couple books to read (I mean, to add to my pile of books to read.)A Wizard of Earthsea was described on the paper insert as a Harry Potter-esque story that takes place in another world of Arthurian magic. After reading it, the only resemblance between the two stories seems to be that the main character is a young wizard coming of age and discovering his power and importance in the world he lives in. The cadence, the adventures, even the kind of magic used in this novel is not at all similar to that of Harry Potter. I wouldn't even put them in the same category of literature. I would say that it's much closer to The Lord of the Rings type of storytelling, with much less detail and much less bloodshed.Earthsea is a Homer-esque adventure of a wizard who has opened the door of the dead and must find a way to restore balance. All the while, he learns who he is, and teaches the reader about the lands in which the story takes places. The story does not unravel like the tightly woven story of Harry Potter, rather, in rolls out as a timeline-an adventure story where the main character has a goal, but is met with one thing after another that keeps him from reaching it.The writing style is sprinkled generously with Old English turns of phrase and the cadence of the story is uneven, interweaving meticulous description with quick-paced action in an unexpected manner, making it a little difficult to initially find a reading rhythm. But this inconsistency contributes to the story's charm; seldom is the story boring despite the fact that many of the trials and tribulations of the main character do not strongly contribute to the overall storyline, being merely descriptions of interesting things that happen along the way.In this way, I think it would a wonderful book for a child (perhaps 8-10 or older, depending on their reading ability) to be introduced into the genre of fantasy novels; the story can be easily read a page or two at a time without losing the storytelling rhythm, and the events in the book are interesting and even a little frightful, although not indiscriminately gory.But perhaps the most important aspect of A Wizard of Earthsea concerns the maturation of the main character, Sparrowhawk. His path to wisdom is a universal message that many young readers (or even adult readers) would find inspirational. It conveys a message that how we respond to pain and mistakes is an important way to wisdom-a message which resonates from the beginning to the end of this account of Sparrowhawk's adventures.Even though the story was well written and compelling, I don't think that I'll be reading the next books in the series (there are four). However, I'll keep it on the shelves for the kids when they are old enough to start to read this kind of fiction. My husband will probably also enjoy it; this is the kind of story he likes to read-lots of adventure, running around and exploring, in a world of magic and dragons."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Among other things, I am a great fan of fantasy, and among my favorite books are those in the Dragonlance series, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and various other Middle Earth tales, and other such books. This book, A Wizard of Earthsea, however, stands apart from the rest, and by far outshines all those save, perhaps, Tolkien's, compared to which it is on an at least equal footing.Perhaps most importantly, this by no means should be considered merely a \\"young adult\\" book, or even a simple \\"adventure/fantasy\\" book. This a tale which explores some rather deep aspects of the human psyche, and when read closely is not a work to be taken lightly, much as Tolkien's works explore deep aspects of spirituality.Set in a fantasy world that seems to resemble more the ancient world of the Hebrews, Hittites, and other such peoples than the more common medievalesque setting, Le Guin uses a style reminiscent in tone and atmosphere of the Viking Sagas to tell the tale of Sparrowhawk, or Ged as his \\"true\\" name is (in this book words have substantial power, as people of many ancient civilizations believed - in this case in particular, your true name is the word that allows others to have power over you). Specifically, this tale covers the parts of his life from early childhood to early adulthood (it is continued in the next three books of the Earthsea cycle).It begins with Sparrowhawk's childhood on the Island of Gont, and like the stars of many tales from the ancient world, he has a rather special, bordering on \\"miraculous,\\" childhood. Even as an untrained youth he has noticeable power, and it is substantial enough to aid in the rescue of his village from foreign invaders.Sparrowhawk then goes on, through various twists and turns of plot, to become apprentice to a mage named Ogion, who, to use the words of history/politics in the world of magic, walks softly and carries a big stick. Impatient, however, to learn slowly but surely, he goes on to learn at an island called Roke, on which there is a school for Wizards (where he meets, among others, my favorite character, the Otak).It is at this school where the plot really takes off, for it is here that, through a series of unfortunate but necessary events, Ged, who's power surpasses his judgement and is made dangerous by his youthful pride, releases a shadow upon the world. From here, much time is spent on his part running from the shadow, and thus he begins a series of adventures, including a showdown with a family of dragons. Eventually, though, Ged realizes he must confront the shadow, and it is his quest for the shadow that forms the climax of this tale, which I will not say anything more about.Underpinning all of this is a wonderful synthesis of concepts from antiquity, mythology, psychology, and philosophy, and teaches several valuable lessons. One is the notion of not disturbing an abstract entity called the Equilibrium, which can be applied to our current lives in many ways, including (though certainly not limited to) care for, if not conservation of, the environment. Another is self-acceptance and the sense of self-efficacy, and more so spiritual/psychological fulfillment, which comes from that.In short, this is by far and away my favorite book, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for either a simply good read or a philosophical treatise."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Modern fantasy writers should take a day and reread Mrs. Le Guin's novel with the hopes of gaining perspective on what makes a good fantasy novel. In about 30% of the length of most new novels, the author builds a world rich in detail and history, and still manages to keep the story driven by the characters, and not by the world itself.The central character goes through a six-year span of his life in this book, from the age of his naming to when he's nineteen and a full-fledged wizard. During that time he studies and grows and faces his most inner demons. The author fleshes out that inner turmoil that every teenager goes through and turns it into a great adventure of self-discovery. This would have made an even more fantastic read when I was in high school.The book is definitely a fantasy, but in the classic sense. Magic and such is not he backbone of this book. It is more of a backdrop.I recommend this book to all adults and young adults who have 5-6 hours to immerse themselves in a world of fantasy adventure and friendship."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"With the recent Sci- Fi Channel miniseries, there is bound to be renewed interest in LeGuin's classic first book in her Earthsea series, as there should be. This remains a classic fantasy for good reason. The world within which the characters move is fully developed, having a sense of past, present and future as well as a sense of a larger \\"there there\\", as opposed to some fantasies that feel like a Hollywood stage set, as if nothing exists beyond the narrow social/geographical worlds the characters move through. Such is not the case with Earthsea. One feels it is real from the start and the ensuing books in the series only deepen that feeling with regard to its social and political structures, its people, its mythic past.The characters are equally strong, especially Ged, the young boy who grows to adulthood in true coming-of-age fashion--through pain, loss, self-destruction, and eventual slow growth of wisdom. The depiction of his younger years as he first learns of his wizardly power and potential, apprentices to a single wizard then rejects that slow, dull path in order to attend the more exciting wizardry school (do not think Harry Potter here, style, tone, and environment are quite different) is right on. He is impatient, cocky, self-sure, quick to anger, impulsive, moody. In short, he is an adolescent. As such he has no time for the slow pace of his masters, for their constant warnings about the \\"balance\\" (the universe is in constant equilibrium and one change someplace effects another change, for good or ill, somewhere else) and its restrictions on use of power. The idea of the balance is the more you know, the less likely you are to act. Ged, in impetuous and realistic fashion sees it as the more you know, the more you can act.As one might expect, his blithe self-confidence sets him up for a major fall, as he accidentally opens a portal, allowing an unknown \\"shadow\\" to enter the world. Roughly the first half of the book leads up to this event, the second half follows what happens afterward, as Ged is hunted by the evil he has let into the world, an evil that can cause great harm unless he does something about it. Along the way, he slowly grows in wisdom (the steps toward adulthood are gradual but nicely marked), helped along by his former tutor whom he rejected for his dull passivity and his closest friend from the wizard's school at Roke, Vetch.The end, without giving details away, is simply perfect in its resolution, in its tone, and in its complexity. Don't expect simplistic happy ending or heroic battles against overwhelming odds; this is a personal journey, a personal victory, though it has larger repercussions.The book succeeds in pretty much all it does. Its world creation is rich and full and three-dimensional. Its characters are sharply detailed, realistic, complex beings. Its plot exciting, its language vivid (sometimes classified as young adult--I'm not sure why--it does not talk down to a perceived younger audience, in terms of complexity of language or philosophy). And in the best test of a good book, it leaves the reader wanting much more; luckily LeGuin provides with several more books in the series. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read this book in about 3 days, on and off, and I was so inspired by it. It wasn't my first fantasy book, but it made me want to read more and more of the genre (despite my decision to read all fantasy series years ago). It is so exciting to read this book. I read it at age 13, and am saddened to think I hadn't read it earlier. It has all of the elements of a fantasy book, but is written better than most. It doesn't overkill with words like Terry Brooks (whose writing I do love, especially Shannara) or say too little. You love the technique (Le Guin is the best female fantasy/science fiction writer in the world, in my opinion). I can't describe the feeling you have towards Duny/Sparrowhawk/Ged, and are saddened when it ends after, what, 160 pages? That is the only downside: This book is so short. At least there are 5 others in the series, though. This is a piece of literature that every elementary school student should read. I am happy to say I will introduce this to my nephews/nieces when they grow up. It will be worth it for them.Darn it, this review made me want to read it again. I knew that would happen...."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Simple yet elegant. Le Guin's writing is economical - sparse on the descriptions but it's more than adequate. Refreshing change from the typical Anglican sword-and-sorcery settings, with dark-skinned islanders as the main focus and the Caucasians as the far-off enemies.Ged is an endearing and interesting character. We recognize his mistake when he leaves Ogion, and sympathize with his realization of his foolish pride and it's terrible price.The magic system LeGuin has created is interesting and consistent. The lore is intriguing and helpful. The first in a wonderful series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"While LeGuin's prose is beguiling and her characters believable, somehow I felt a little more removed from the scene than I like to be when I'm reading a novel. I'm not sure why that is. I would have preferred to get more deeply inside the heads of the characters than I did. Otherwise, an excellent book - I felt that things were happening even without the bloody battles and lurid affairs that so often are used in fantasy novels in place of good writing to hold the reader's interest."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book is good and so are the other two books after it. It talks about this boy saving a girl from a life as a nun among other adventures. The fourth book is rather a disappointment. It takes place years later so I recommend that you don't read it.

LeGuin put into it. I found the characters very appealing and real. Also I enjoyed how fast the story was. The characters did not spend a lot of time on useless talk or stupid love affairs. It was straight to the point of the matter. It is a high fantasy classic that deserves to be shared with all. Ms. LeGuin rates up there with such authors as Tolkein and Anne McCaffrey. I'll never need to read another fantasy as long as I live. In A Wizard of Earthsea I have found the perfect one!!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"One of the very first fantasy books I read, &quot;A wizard of Earthsee&quot; brings conflicting emotions to me even now. At the time I first read it, I definitely didn't understand it and found it slow and unpictoresque. Now some 15 years later, I find it a great work on human nature and the &quot;stuff&quot; of which human relationships are made of. Indeed, when you think of somebody, you think about a name and a mental picture of what the persons represents for you; so, the idea of imbuing the name with the essence is in my opinion a nice one.

I'm never going to be able to read somthing that big!&quot; And I shoved it aside for a copple of months.Untill finally I decided that I would at least give it a try and read the whole thing. Well when I'd finished it I thought &quot;Is that all plese god I hope that Ursula K.

Sparrowhawk is a masterfully created hero and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"In all seriousness, this is one of the best fantasy novels available for purchase -- Ursula Le Guin is a fabulous author, one of the best out there, and this book and its following sequels are absolute classics. Ged is a truly marvelous character, and the story, world and much else are incredible!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula Le Guin is the daughter of Alfred Kroeber, an anthropologist, and Theodora Kroeber, a psychologist and writer. It's easy and accurate to say that her parents' interests inform her brilliant writing, and that cultural anthrpology and Jungian psychology are at the core of Wizard of Earthsea and its three sequels.But the book isn't a treatise. It's a wonderful, well-told story of a young man, Ged, coming of age in a world where words can have the power of magic and dragons are as real as earthquakes. There is nothing didactic about this story; Le Guin's writing is compelling and her characters are vivid: Ogion, the Mage of Silence, whose word had stilled an earthquake; Vetch, who helps Ged on a deadly quest for no reason but friendship; Murre, Vetch's sister; Yevaud, the dragon of Pendor; and Skiorh, possessed by a gebbeth.Earthsea doesn't exist in a vacuum. Le Guin constructs a deep and textured history, and her characters act in ways that are consistent with that world. She manages the trick of writing a mythic tale without falling into the traps and foibles of sounding like you are trying.The climax is straight from Carl Jung, but you don't need to know Carl Jung from Steve Young to appreciate it.From time to time, religious groups call for this book to be banned from school libraries, claiming it promotes witchcraft. Nonsense. This is a book every teenager should read. It speaks to self-understanding, nothing more.And some feminists criticize Le Guin because Ged is a male character. Again, nonsense, Ged is an archetype, and his gender matters not at all.This is an important book. It's also terrific fun. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Not only is the &quot;Earthsea&quot; trilogy a wonderful series for adolescents but it also contains profound wisdom for adults seeking their own path to individuation. Rich in timeless myth, the series has the young mage Ged surmount many trials on his way to understanding himself and therein lies the key to his ultimately becomming the Archmage of Roke. Each book in the series has the main story turn on the issue of trust between two people and upon Ged's courage in facing dark issues either within himself or in the enviroment. Ged is a powerful role for young people developing a sense of their inner integrity and for middle-agers every where beginning to deal with their shadow issues. Of course there are plenty of dragons, battles, transformations and journeys which can be enjoyed simply as a good storey, but don't pass up the chance to re-read to catch the deeper meaning. This series is too good to be eclipsed in popularity by LOTR and the Chornicles of Narnia, &quot;Earthsea&quot; stands on its own! If I haven't convinced you, please read the essay by Noel Perrin in his book, &quot;A Child's Delight.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin's \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" comes from a different place then the other two fantasists with whom her Earthsea trilogy is so often compared. Tolkein's so-called fantasy was a real attempt to capture what Tolkein believed the languagues lost before the beginnings of early English, while his Oxford colleague wrote his Narnia fantasies from a Christian viewpoint. LeGuin's fantasy novels derive from her background in anthropology and show it in every way.The story concerns the Wizard Sparrowhawk and his education. Sparrowhawk comes from a desperately poor village in the mountains, from among illiterate peasants (compare to the world of the hobbits, where, though illiterate, there is no squalor) who live with their goats. His home island, Gont, is the birthplace of Goatherds, Pirates, and Wizards, and from an early age Sparrowhawk shows his powers. After saving his village from an invading army, Sparrowhawk is apprenticed to Ogion, the great Mage. There Sparrowhawk begins to learn what Wizards know: the names of all things. He also is drawn to showing off, including calling up the dead.Too powerful and curious for Ogion, Sparrowhawk goes to the isle of Roke to attend the school there ( Rowling only stole from the best) and finds he's not only the best pupil, but he can make enemies. In a boast, he calls up a spirit and brings out a sort of un-him. The un-him scars Sparrowhawk and kills the school's Archmage who uses his power to try and undo what Sparrowhawk has done.Ged, Sparrowhawk's true name, must now pursue this unhim while fighting dragons, evil stones, and gibbeths, people the unhim have entered and destroyed.Finally, Ged turns on his pursuer to fight an epic battle on the unsea and reunite himself.LeGuin's spare prose is based on folktales, and myths, and Earthsea's theology of balance, true names, and magic is clear: Ged has disturbed the balance, so he must restore it. Like Tolkein's and Lewis' books, there is a sexual innocence here: Ged is a mage first and foremost: he feel attractions, but no lust. Of course, Heros of Myth are too good to be lustful; chastity preserves their power.Unlike the other fantasies, the Earthsea Trilogy is not England, but an actual mythical place, albeit medieval in a European sense. Ged is no Englishman either, being copper-colored.The deep understanding of what makes a culture a culture underlies everything LeGuin has written, from \\"The Dispossed\\" to \\"Terhanu.\\" The intelligence behind these books is impressive, neither sentimental nor baroque, almost clinical in its portrayal of an premodern world where magic does work, and where every action has personal consequences and real pain."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I'm writing this review because JK Rowling's books about the Hogwarts School of Magic reminded me of this, one of the few perfect novels I've ever read.It's not a light-hearted fairy tale, though it is &quot;high fantasy.&quot; It's the story of Ged, from his childhood discovery of his wonderful yet terrible magical powers; to his education at the School of Wizardry on Roke Knoll. There he makes a misstep; overstepping his powers, he accidentally lets loose an evil creature from a shadow world. His self-imposed exile, journeys, and eventual maturation and triumph are written with a deft flair for the beauty and wonder of magic; yet Ms. LeGuin is even more masterful in depicting Ged's character: the young high achiever who must finally make his peace with his inner demons.As a child, I loved it for the idea of a school of magic. I grew older, reread it during a dark teenage time, and cried when Ged finally confronted his inner shadow creature. Later, studying anatomy in medical school, I recalled Ged's long days in the Namer's high tower, learning the true names of things; and bent cheerfully to my task.It still bears re-reading to this day. Readers who enjoy Tolkien, JK Rowling, or Alice Miller's &quot;Drama of the Gifted Child&quot; ought particularly to read it; and readers who didn't like &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; or &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; should give Ms. LeGuin another try, in this, her finest work. . It is one of my favorite novels and I recommend it to you wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I first read this book two years ago when i was 22 and away on holiday with my fiance. It is one of his favourite books, and he has read the whole series time and again. I enjoy reading all types of literature, although science-fiction and fantasy books are my favourite. I have always favoured sci-fi, especially Asimov and Clarke, and my fiance fantasy, particularly Tolkien and Le Guin. This book, along with The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, have made me as passionate about fantasy as sci-fi.The book works on many levels, as a good story, as escapism, as a gateway to an incredible fantasy land, and as something far deeper. The story is thought-provoking and compelling, rich and meaningful. The book examines how we consider ourselves and the world around us. What is our real self ? What are we capable of ? How do our actions influence the world around us ? How do the names that we apply to objects affect how we view and understand them ?A brilliant book that i would recommend to anyone of any age. I think its ridiculous that great literature such as this, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Alice in Wonderland, C.S. Lewis, and so on get classified as &quot;childrens books&quot;. They are books for everyone with imagination, who enjoys good story-telling, and interesting and unusual characters. They are tales which leave strong images for years after reading, which make you want to go back to read again and again, which offer something new each time they are read, which make you want to tell other people about them, which enthrall and inspire you, which leave you with plenty to think and talk about, and which push back the boundaries of your thoughts and imagination."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula Le Guin made fantasy history with \\"A Wizard of Earthsea,\\" a spare but strangely entrancing story about a young wizard coming of age. Despite a rather distant writing style, Le Guin's story is still a classic that is generally put on the same shelf as Lewis and Tolkien.Ged was born in a village in Earthsea -- a grouping of many, many small islands -- in Gont. The boy soon shows signs of great power, the ability to call animals and to laugh even when his tongue has been bound by a spell. A mage named Ogion apprentices Ged--who is known as Sparrowhawk, as knowledge of his true name would give anyone power over him. But Ogion's discipline and lessons are full of silence and self-examination, something which soon sends Ged to the school for mages in Roke.A rival finally mocks Ged into a magical duel, and a monstrous creature made of shadow attacks Ged, nearly killing him. But upon the completion of his studies, the now-wiser wizard sets off to an island to seek the Dragon of Pendor. As the shadow closes in on Ged and his life becomes increasingly imperiled, he must discern what -- and who -- it is, to make himself truly whole.Le Guin's book has a lot of things in it that tend to annoy readers -- several years are skipped in a few pages, and little of Ged's thoughts and emotions aside from \\"Ged felt this\\" and \\"Ged thought that\\" are revealed. But the spare mythic style and quiet philosophical bent add an extra dimension to a straightforward fantasy story.Le Guin's story spans several years in Ged's life, taking him from a little boy in a dirty village to a powerful and respected mage. But she also spins in Eastern philosophy, in the form of the \\"shadow\\" that stalks Ged for many years -- in some ways, the final explanation for what the shadow is seems fitting.Ged has the makings of a classic hero: he is talented and initially hot-headed, but through his misfortunes is tempered into a more selfless, albeit scarred person (both physically and emotionally). Most of the supporting characters don't appear long enough to get much development, although Ged's buddy Vetch comes across as a sweetheart.Ursula Le Guin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a memorable story about a boy becoming a man, and a man coming to terms with himself. A unique story, and one worthy of being called a classic."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"When I was about 7, my uncle gave the Earthsea Trilogy to my mother (a reading teacher) for her students to read. I remember reading a couple of chapters of one of them (Tombs of Atuan, I think) and finding it very exciting and mysterious, but also a little hard to understand (probably because I was starting in the middle of the series and because I was 7). Since then, I have often wanted to read the trilogy, but I had difficulty finding the books, which were out of print for most of the 1980s. I also was a little turned off because many people classify the trilogy as &quot;young adult fiction,&quot; probably because they are relatively short.I just finished a Wizard of Earthsea and I was surprised to find that it was one of the best fantasy book that I have ever read. Le Guin's narrative style in this book (which differs greatly from &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and its progeny--a style that I found to be a little plodding and self-indulgent) is very lean, almost minimalist. In this respect it reminds me of Michael Moorcock's Elric series. Unlike Moorcock, however, Le Guin conveys a rich emotional life for her characters. (This is not a criticism of Morcock, I think that he intentionally meant for the characters to remain somewhat distant and enigmatic--making them more like characters of myth and legend).The back of the edition that I read claims that Le Guin has dethroned Tolkien as the ruler of epic fantasy. I wouldn't go that far. But she certainly deserves share the upper eschelon of fantasy writers with Tolkien and a very few other authors."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"It is an insult to the genius of this book to try to describe it in layman's terms.

Le Guin always proves that she has a unique outlook on the world, and the Earthsea books are no exception.The Wizard of Earthsea is the first part of a series of (now) four books. This part details the origins and youth of Ged - a boy from a backwater village in the great archipelago world of Earthsea. With a magical feat that saves his entire community from barbaric invaders, he shows himself to be greatly proficient in the Art. He is apprenticed to a sorceror (who nevertheless hides under the guise of a simple healer), and makes his way to the Academy on the Island of Roke. There, out of his great pride, he unleashes a shadow-thing in a contest of forbidden magics. Injured, scarred both physically and mentally, he now must flee the thing he brought into this world - or confront it.One of the most surprising and masterful twists is the terse, epic writing: Le Guin does not spend time to write whole descriptive paragraphs; she sets the scenes with broad strokes of a few sentences, focusing on the most important events. This book is very quick reading.Ged is an inspiring character. He can be crudely compared to Ender from Orson Scott Card's writings, or perhaps Taran from Lloyd Alexander's, in that he wields great power, by which he is burdened. The reader quickly becomes attached to his grim, brooding persona, as his quest takes him through the world. Ged is also a powerful role-model: he must acknowledge his undeniable talent and shed his fears of losing control of his powers.The Wizard of Earthsea is undoubtedly a classic, a powerful work of high fantasy and spiritual development."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Le Guin enjoys no press, no fanfare, no fan clubs. She has no movies (until now the mini-series), no trading card games, no computer games. Her writing is not flamboyant: it is thoughtful, considered, and quiet. Her books are generally short and are closer to novelettes. Yet she remains as one of the principle authors of the fantasy genre and her work survives. It will outlive, we suspect, a great deal of those novels that enjoy such extraordinary popularity today. JK Rowlings is the Frank Baum (Wizard of Oz) of our generation. Le Guin is the CS Lewis (The Chronicles of Narnia) of our generation. The distinction is in decibels and the scope. Earthsea, we believe, is one of those rare series of books that will quietly fill every library of every parent who has a child who loves to read. Incidentally, we feel that the later books Tehanu and The Other Wind detract from the series rather than add to it (as is the case with many sequels). Those later books are better avoided.WHO SHOULD READ THIS:As we mentioned, the series is aimed at grade levels somewhere around 5th to 9th. These are a series of books that are invaluable for this age group. It is mythology--both relevant and exciting--that teaches us not didactically how to live but shows us what it means to be alive. Many critics have said many different things about her books but the (overused) phrase \\"deeply human\\" seems just about right. These are books that--if the reader can meet the level that Le Guin sets in--will be revered for many, many years. People who have enjoyed Ender's Game, Tales of the Otori, and The Chronicles of Prydain will find these books very special.WHO SHOULD PASS:As we often say about books that are especially good, this is a novel of introspection. There is a bit of death but you won't see blood sprayed across the page. There are no great battles, sieges, or other events of great war. There is no overt sex. The magic is not \\"Terry Magic\\" (that is, Terry Goodkind or Terry Brooks type that shoots forth as fire, lightning, and death in the air) but rather a magic of language, of truth, of world harmony. To use a video game analogy, don't start playing Myst expecting to have whatever enjoyment you get out of playing Grand Theft Auto.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Le Guin's works, in my opinion, may very well top even The Lord of the Rings in their greatness (although the next 10,000 Tolkien fans who read this review will probably jump on me and rip me to shreds for saying so).A Wizard of Earthsea is quite an incredible work of high fantasy. It's a classic tale of wizardry and magic, but with twists along the way.A Wizard of Earthsea is the story of the Archmage and Dragonlord Ged. Long before Ged had become Archamge and Dragonlord, he was known as Sparrowhawk, an intelligent, but reckless youth, power-hungry and lacking in wisdom.Ged begins learning simple magic from a local witch before being apprenticed to Ogion, a quiet mage from the other side of the island on which he lives. After spending several years with Ogion, he travels to Roke, to attend the school for wizards.However, he soon becomes rivals with a fellow student. One night, intent on putting his rival to shame and establishing himself as the superior magic-user, Ged accidently lets loose a shadow on all Earthsea. For the rest of his life, it will follow him, hunting him down trying to kill him and posses his flesh so it can gain form and substance with which to wreck havoc upon all of Earthsea. In order to prevent this, Ged must confront and defeat this evil, but the quest cannot be accomplished easily, but Ged must try, at risk of his life so that he can save his soul."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is the first in a series of books. There are 4 novels in the series and two collections of short stories. It follows the life and career of Ged a young man from the Island of Gont. Le Guin has created a very unique world, a world that is mostly water and each nation is a collection of islands. This book is also one of a few that has children's teens and adult editions in print.Ged apprentices to the local Wizard on God, and is eventually sent to the school for wizards on Havnor. There in anger during a fight with other youths he releases a dark shadow, an evil. The Masters of the school appear and banish it from the island. However this shadow and Ged are now tied together in a very unique way.After leaving the school Ged becomes haunted by the shadow he has released. He tries to return to the protection of Havnor but cannot return to the island the magic protecting the island will not let him approach. So he decides to head south.The shadow is getting closer and closer to him, and he must discern it's true name or else he will not be able to defeat it. Can he solve the puzzle, will he wrestle with his shadow and win or will he succumb to the evil he has let loose.This is a book I first read back in highschool. Then a few years back had to read it for an English literature course at the University of Waterloo I was about a third of the way through it when I realized I had read it before and that is when I found our that the story continued. Since then the two collections of short stories have been published in this world.Le Guin deals with some big questions of life in this book. Such questions as:Who am I?Do I have a role or purpose in life?Can I defeat the darkness within me?Can good conquer over evil?Why am I here?Can I make a difference?This book will be a good read for anyone who has ever struggled with some of these questions. Or who wants to use a novel to help them grow to have a deeper understanding of themselves."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I first read the original Earthsea trilogy over 20 years ago, and it has stood the test of time. If you like your fantasy with action, this will not be your cup of tea&#8230;but LeGuin is a master and a unique voice. The best part is that the books keep getting better and more moving. Read this so that you can get to Tehanu, which I think is one of the best books ever written about the nature and meaning of love."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"No fan of fantasy should go without reading this. It's that simple.Without question, Earthsea stands alongside Middle Earth, Narnia, and the other \\"classic\\" fantasy worlds with amazing strength, holding its own throughout.And like those worlds, the tales of Earthsea are accessible to young readers, and yet offer layers of depth and meaning for older readers.Le Guin weaves a tale in a language seemingly pulled our dreams, gorgeous prose throughout. She tells her tale of good against evil and of the triumph of man over his fears in such a way as to make one think that this is not a story that was written in the 20th century, but rather a story that always was. Perfect craft. A Wizard of Earthsea is a timeless work telling the tale of one man's struggle with magic, and himself.Modern fantasy lovers beware, this is not a typical swords and sorcery romp. Fans of the Dragonlance and TSR books will miss the cartoon-like action, and fans of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind will miss the endless meandering that dominates so much modern fantasy. Instead, you simply get a tale crafted of magic and wonder that gets right to the point, never pausing, never dragging, always engaging. Truly remarkable, even decades later."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"In \\"A Wizard of Earthsea,\\" Ursula K. Le Guin has a very distinctive tone that shines out and makes the book different from other works of fantasy. From the opening page you see how Le Guin is like a storyteller that is reading or telling something to you, as the story that is being told is very descriptive and easy to follow. This makes this novel a classic of the fantasy genre, among other things which will be discussed later on.Our main character, Ged (Sparrowhawk) is a resident of Earthsea, a huge world of islands. He is blessed with a gift in magical arts, and he is sent to work as a prentice of Ogion, the master wizard of Gont. Ged feels that he is leading a humdrum life with Ogion and doesn't think that he is learning anything that could advance his gift in magic. Ged decides to go to a wizardry school on the island of Roke to study with other young men of his age. But before he leaves Ogion, Ged attempts a spell and unleashes a shadow that will follow him and try to take over his soul. When Ged gets to the school he makes a very good friend, Vetch. After graduating from the wizardry school Ged goes and fights dragons and does a few other things, but mainly is trying to defeat the shadow that is trying to take over him. Up until the climactic finish that will leave you ready for the following \\"Earthsea\\" books, this novel will entertain.In a way this book is a lesson on life. The novel shows how our main character, Ged, goes through the first stages of his life and must cope with things that come up. At the wizardry school he must deal with the vile Jasper and come over this boy's tauntings. When he travels on a boat throughout the sea he has to survive and cope with stresses from the shadow. This book shows how people could overcome the odds when everything seems like it is going against them.Most of the novel is descriptive and there is not a whole lot of dialogue, which I happen to love. Although Le Guin's writing style may get a bit tedious at times this book was written by a master of not only fantasy, but also the English language, so the book is still great.That said the description of the novel makes the book feel very realistic. Le Guin's world is very believable and is fun to read. In addition, the characterisation for the main character Ged is wonderful and I'm sure that as the series progresses I (and you, if you pick up this book) will feel more for him.\\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a short novel but don't think that this book isn't good because it is not as long as other epic fantasies. In fact, it is better than most of today's fantasy. I am wholeheartedly looking forward to reading the next two novels in this trilogy, and possibly the others of the series.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I first read A Wizard of Earthsea when I was in seventh grade. I could not put it down at the age of twelve. The way Ursula K. Le Guin writes reminds me of a fairy tale told by my grandmother on a rainy Saturday morning. The style is dreamy and reminiscent of old fashioned storytelling at its best. I was able to lose myself in the story, in the people, and in the land. I read A Wizard of Earthsea the second time at the age of 24. The book again captivated and mesmerized me. I am now 32 and I still love this story.A Wizard of Earthsea is the story of Sparrowhawk, a goat herder from the island of Gont. Sparrowhawk develops an unusual power, which gives him the ability to call animals. When Sparrowhawk learns that he has more power than he can safely control, he leaves his old life behind and travels to the School on Roke.What we might call magic is referred to and separated from wizardry in this book. Wizards are specially trained (and male) on the island of Roke. Magic is the realm of witches and not held in high esteem. A wizard's life is spent learning the true name of things in the old tongue. Power to a mage must be kept in balance. Every action has a reaction.To me, this sense of balance is the real beauty of the novel. Sparrowhawk, or any wizard for that matter, cannot unthinkingly use a spell without facing consequences. I think this is wonderful way to look at our own society. We have all but eliminated our social sense of consequences. Sparrowhawk finally understands the balance at great cost to his soul and power. What will it take for us to face the consequences of our actions?"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Well, it sems that this is one of those books you either love or hate.Personnally (and you may be able to tell from the rating!) I think that Ged, and the world Ursula Le Guin created is one of the best I have ever read.Tehanu was not the greatest, but the Wizard of Earthsea was a fantatastic story, showing the samll details, and the story was not an end-of-the-world type, just the posible end if Ged's world.Tolkien, Feist, Jordan etc follow the dramtic (ie. global) picture when writing, guin wrote a story from a more intimate perspective, and for that we can only applaud her vision.everyone who likes fantasy must read this!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This series of books is phenomenal. Much like the popular Harry Potter books, they're written at a young-adult level. The difference, though, is that the plot, characters, and magic is much more dark and mature. I recommend the Earthsea books to everyone I can; you won't regret reading them. I think one or more also won the Nebula Award. Go get it!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I would give this story 10 stars if I could. I read this when I was in grade 7 and it became my favorite book, now after university I still think this is one of the greatest fantasy books I've ever read. Le Guin takes you into her little wonderful world of islands with strange exotic names and builds a tapestry of characters and places with histories and cultures intertwined in a tale about a young wizard who meddles with the forces of darkness and has to deal with the consequences for the rest of his life. It is truly original in the same way that the Lord of the Rings was, and the Wizard of Oz was, and Alice in Wonderland was; a story that children can enjoy but that grows with you as you grow in life and learn to appreciate what good story telling is, and Le Guin is one of the best in the world."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"It's been months since I've read a book.I'm a college student who has been juggling school, full-time work, a frequently updated web site, and attempts at having a life--and with sleep, that doesn't allow great amounts of time for pleasure reading.This book, however, has taught me that this time, somehow, must be set aside.This Earthsea that Ursula Le Guin has created easily kept me glued to the book for hours on end and prompted me, within fifteen minutes after finishing, to order the second in the Earthsea series.Fans of Tolkien, tales of the middle ages, or the magic of the power of everything, this is a book for you."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read the series for the first time when I was about 12, and have gravitated towards it every couple of years since then to re-read. I just can't help myself. This isn't typical kids' stuff, it's brilliant writing. I recently started to re-read a Stephen Donaldson book that I remember liking as a teenager 15 years ago and was amazed at how poor the writing was--bad grammar, convoluted sentences and inept metaphors. I immediately reached for A Wizard of Earthsea, fearing I'd similarly misremembered its greatness--I had not. It was as great as ever.

His true name is revealed to be Ged, and he journeys to be trained as a wizard at a school. He becomes a rival with Jasper and a friend with Vitch. This rivalry results in the releasing of a strong shadow and the death of a loved one. He runs from the shadow for most of his life. He then chases it with Vitch to the ends of the Earth.A great book, a story of hate and frienship, sadness and fear, an unbelievable outcome, and much more. I highly recomend this book to any fantasy or sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"In the Wizard of Earthsea, we are introduced to the character Ged who has to find out who he really is. He grew up abandoned (to some extent) by his family and denied the type of love that could only be given from a family. He accepted by the one societal institution that should have shaped him into an adult. Ged then finds acceptance and in the form of control over nature by learning a being's true name. This is the form of control that is exerted over nature and coincidentally is the way in which Ged makes himself accepted.Ged learns a powerful lesson in his drive for acceptance in the novel that readers can use in everyday life. He releases a demon of catastrophic proportions that will later become his greatest rival. A very powerful and great master of magick is killed when this demon is released and tried to kill Ged. This event brought a certain mortality to Ged which was not present before. He entered into an awakening of sorts and vowed to do right by his master and comply as he was being taught in magick school.The real life lesson is the death of the great man who selflessly saves Ged's life. He realized that he cannot control everything and that there are rules to life that must be respected and follwed to maintain harmony. This is true to real life because in our society, rules are set up to protest our race from self destructing. When an individual breaks the rule and laws, things happen that are not favorable to both the society and the individual. As humans, we learn from tragedy after adolescence leads us to believe we are indestructable. Ged learns this by accepting a dare of his classmates and performing the spell that released the demon."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A world steeped in mystery. A world where a name gives you power over a being. This is the world that young Ged, also known as Sparrowhawk begins his epic journey. After calling a mist to protect his village, young Ged is chosen to be an apprentice. The wizard he is first apprenticed to does not teach him the power words he wishes to know. An ego combined with bravado and ambition lead to great danger for our young hero.Using his power and a magic he does not understand, young Ged summons a great evil into this world after having his ego bruised. Full of himself and overconfident, he loses control of his spell and launches his own great tale of victory.This is an interesting book as it actually deals with the consequences of misusing magic. Ged suffers drastically for his \\"crime\\" and must set his wrong right. Not an easy task, he doesn't seek fame after his encounter, he merely seeks to make it right. This grand adventure that he undertakes and the taming of the dragon make him famous which is an ironic twist to get what he really desired despite the fact he gave up on it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I thought that this book was a very well written book. The story of a young man growing to be more than he expected more or less by accident is an excellent example of perfect fantasy writing.

The magic is unique. Instead of your standard 'Abracadabra' with a wave of a magic wand or a twist of willpower from a special 'kind' of person, a mage has to TRULY understand the object of his wizardry.The world is also believable. I've read books where the author made the whole world seem smaller than Chicago, and other books where the world seemed bigger than the galaxy, but very few authors I've run across that can do both at once. Earthsea is a vast place where the peoples of different lands are inextricably tied together, resulting in a believable vision of a reasonably sized world.My only objection would be that magic comes a little too easily to Ged. He's just a bit too much of a natural, with no particular area where he excels or struggles. He is just THAT good."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I was forced to read this book for a literature elective and absolutely loved it. It is an awesome fantasy with a plot similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but utterly unique. Le Guin gives her world a feeling of everyday reality as well as believable fantasy elements.

I certainly recomend this book. I kept my copy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I saw the movie so wanted to read the book.

While it was faster and easier than Tolkein, it didn't quite wrap me up in it's story the way the Lord of the Rings did. Le Guin gives us the story of Ged, following his hero's journey. Book 1 tells of his humble beginnings and the mistakes he made. I recommend this to any big fantasy fan as a foundation stone of modern fantasy. But in the later books I hope to get more of an addictive feel. I didn't feel enough sympathy for Ged, the story was told from too much distance."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I have tried the Harlan Ellison audio book and didn't like his reading style.

It's a much nicer reading in my opinion."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This woman is a master. Simply put, for those who've never heard of it, this is story of a wizard and his shadow. Sparrowhawk is a boy in small farming village when his aunt, the village witch, notices he has some aptitude for spellwork. She begins to train the boy herself, teaching him all the craft she knows. When his village is attacked by brigands, he manages to thwart the bandits by weaving together simple spells that he knows. This feat, especially by one so young and untrained, draws the attention of many, including the mage, Ogion the Silent. Ogion takes the boy on as an apprentice, but finding his tutelage under Ogion slow and exasperating, Sparrowhawk decides to leave his master and go to the school for wizards on the isle of Roke. It is on Roke that he finds the best and worst in himself and others. Le Guin's writing is pure poetry:\\"As their eyes met, a bird sang aloud in the branches of the tree. In that moment, [Sparrowhawk] understood the singing of the bird, and the language of the water falling in the basin of the fountain, and the shape of the clouds, and the beginning and end of the wind that stirred the leaves: it seemed to him that he himself was a word spoken by the sunlight.\\" p. 35, paperback.I realize this sort of high language is not everyone's cup of fantasy, but Le Guin has a way of getting under my skin like few other authors can manage to do. This is my go-to book for Harry Potter fans who need something new.I have read the book many times, but I highly recommend that if you can find it, listen to it on audio as read by Harlan Ellison. The man is obviously in love with the story, because he brings such a fine energy to the telling - he gets into every character, every description, every word, with everything he has.And of course, the story doesn't end there, although it can stand on its own, without sequel, the other books, especially the ones that primarily concern Sparrowhawk, The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore, are just as enchanting and engrossing as A Wizard of Earthsea. Be aware that the later stories, Tehanu, The Other Wind and Tales from Earthsea are little darker in subject and tone, and are not as accessible to younger readers.And, please, for the love of Jeff, stay away from the movie produced a few years ago. Ged is not white. Le Guin made it a point to have people of many races represented, and the filmmakers did not honor her intentions."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula Le Guin is a good writer. She has a good command of the language, and is able to develop a story very effectively, with a good buildup in terms of character growth. However, the story seems a little boring. After all, Ged's interactions with other characters are few and limited, and the world has a very sombre, lonely feel to it, with little to differentiate the various races and cities.Perhaps the sense of drama and excitement is completely lacking because of Le Guin's motivation to tell a story within a Jung-style paradigm. There is little in the way of development of the individual characters, until the last fifty pages. I read this book once when I was around fifteen and then again 18 years later, and both times my feeling was the same. Well written, beautiful, but a little dull for such a short book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Growing up with the Harry Potter series, I am so surprised that it took me so long to even hear of this writer and series, but I am glad I finally did.

It is super awesome, to the max. The main character overhears his aunt casting a magic spell, so he goes out and tries it for himself. After finding this out, his aunt teaches him more and more magic in exchange for him agreeing to help her. He then saves his village from being destroyed by evil marauding bandits, but uses so much power he drained all of his energy. Then a great sage comes to heal them, and the boy starts his real magic training under the watch of the sage.This book was really fun for me to read because I love fantasy stories. Basically anything with dragons and/or magic in it will draw my attention and keep me occupied for a great deal of time. This book spent a lot of time developing the characters, which usually turns me off, but they threw in a great deal of excitement and interesting events, and making them feel real while still having a fair amount of action in it.

I am looking forward to reading the other books in this series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book was very interesting. To me, it's a mixture of fantasy and anthropology(mostly human culture). The story's main character is Ged, also called Sparrowhawk. He goes to the island of Roke to train as a mage(if that's the correct term) and has many different encounters. He creates an evil creature called a gebbeth by accident. The creature is black and formless, has no head, and the body is shaped like that of a beast. But later on the gebbeth can change into different people Ged knows. In order to defeat the gebbeth Ged has to speak the creature's true name. Ged also encounters dragons, but I don't remember what the main dragon's name is. Men cannot look into the eyes of a dragon. But basically this book was interesting because it has many different cultures and different skin colors of people, not just one \\"race.\\" The fantasy of this book is quite odd because it doesn't seem to be true fantasy. There's no aliens, dwarves, or elves in it. Just humans, dragons, and other formless creatures(such as the gebbeth). The only thing I didn't like was how short the encounter of the dragons were.

The world of the book is consistent and the reader will be startled by how much seems familiar in this fantasy Archipelago. But beware - the &quot;fantasy&quot; label may not preapre you for the author's insights into good, evil, the nature of adulthood and the need for self-acceptance.

The plot - wizardry and defeating evil, seems like a very common theme in fantasy novels, so it doesn't seem extremely original or out of the ordinary. However, this book was published in 1968, when this theme was not so well explored, seeing as Harry Potter, Eragon and many other fantasies of similar theme had not been published, or would not be published, for many years. That makes the book different, and makes this review slightly less critical, seeing as there had not been as many books like it in the past.However, the book itself was nothing extremely special or amazing. Although it, at the time was \\"new\\" it lacked anything to make it less than a forgettable, everyday, dull book to read. The writing itself was dry and not lacking anything to drive the reader on.The general theme of this book is a young wizard born humble and poor, learning that he holds much power. The young wizard goes to a prestigious academy for young wizards, and being so ambitious and proud, accidentally unleashes a dark power that he must stop before it takes over. We are introduced to a huge world of Earthsea, which has many -full- maps of itself, which have about 500 tiny islands scattered about them - and the titles are almost invisible.The story itself does not seem original or different in any sense. It is predictable to the point it is not fun to read, and none of the characters are explored in depth. There are many side characters who barely have a few lines and not much influence in the story, only serving to carry on one plot point and not standing out as original people. It is as if the characters don't have thoughts, as we never really hear them thinking or having many emotions. They don't seem like real people at all, making the story even less convincing and unpleasant to read. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, as they all seemed generic and without a personality or many flaws. They were grim, without any interests or hobbies, just dull people carrying out heroic quests. Especially the character of Ged followed through with this.The writing style was another thing that made the book hard to enjoy. Although some people love extremely descriptive, long, fancy sentences, I can't say I do. I like descriptions, but the authors descriptions don't add anything to the story. It seems as if she does not think dialogue adds anything to a story, because there was almost zero conversation among characters. It seems the whole story could be summarized into about a page without all the needless detail.LeGuin created a huge world, yet she used very little. She spent pages and pages talking about all the different islands and geography of them. Yet they played a small role in the real story, and it seemed like she should have used all those pages making the characters, and the storyline, come to life."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is the first in a series of books.

The first was its originality. The magic is well explained and thorough, as well as many other things including the geography of Earthsea and a touch of its history (actually the history was unsatisfactory...it gets much better in book two). LeGuin has clearly developed a very detailed world, and though it is not quite as in-depth as Tolkien's it is still beleivable.I also loved the characters. Though a couple were a bit shallow (like Jasper...why does he hate Ged?) overall they were compelling and interesting.I really liked the action scenes, of which there were quite a few, and they all were exciting wihtout being monotonous. A flaw in some books in my opinion is that action scenes drag on for too long without any new details.The major flaw in this book is that it is meant to be a series. The sequel, \\"Tombs of Atuan\\" takes us deeper into Earthsea into the Kargad lands. It explores the history of Earthsea and we are introduced to new characters and learn more about old ones. Sadly, though, Vetch does not reappear. \\"The Tombs of Atuan\\" shows what happens to Ged when he grows up. The results are very satisfying."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I'm sorry, but I have to say I didn't like this book at all.

What in the name of heaven is Earthsea? Where is the plot? Has postmodernism become prehistoricism? This is not a book.

It simply doesn't measure up to Middle-Earth in terms of depth of detail, grandeur and beauty. No doubt it is an excellent product of artistic imagination on its own right, but one can't help but feel a sense of dreariness and bleakness in it.

It passes over months of the characters life with barely a word. It left me with a feeling of com,plete and utter lack of connection with the main character. The fact that someone would even compare this book to Tolkien let alone praising it over him is rediculous.

Nothing could be further from the truth. This book was full of sullen, unsympathetic characters and the silliest dragons in the history of fantasy literature- dragons that you can defeat merely by calling their name. Moreover the book is obsessively concerned with the balance of magic- an interesting concept, but one which the author handles badly. The magic of Tolkien's Middle-earth is inherent in the characters- it's not what they do, but what they are.

Le Guin's short novel about a young man learning to confront his own flaws in judgment and inner turmoil could have been a powerful, moving journey of discovery. A strong tale of adventure whose focus is on the development of the protagonist, rather than the excitement of confronting evil monsters and wizards, surely has the potential to be a well developed and rewarding work of fantasy.Unfortunately, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" does not achieve these aspirations, primarily due to the lack of substantive connections between the events helping to move the plot along. The most important developments that occur to young Sparrowhawk seem to rise out of nowhere, without warning or explanation. Rather than sharing the reader's surprise at the incredible events developing so suddenly and swiftly in his life, the young mage takes everything with an eerily cold acceptance, distancing him from the reader and masking his motivations.The plotline of the story is full of adventurous twists and turns, which, when viewed before their resolutions, seem acceptably fresh and creative, if not earth-shattering. However, the methods Le Guin uses to solve the problems presented in the story horribly mar the established sub-plots, as the problems are solved too easily and without warning. This lack of \\"realism\\" does not encompass solely the ordinary unrealistic elements one expects in a work of fantasy, such as the use magic or fantastic creatures. This surreality comes from Sparrowhawk suddenly gaining knowledge he never learned, or magical ability he never revealed or practiced, and these mysteriously-appearing powers are the keys to solving all of his greatest problems. If this were used once or twice, it would be acceptable, but this is the method by which nearly all of the protagonist's troubles are assuaged.This lack of logical plot development extends beyond damaging the credibility and power of the tale. By not allowing us to see Sparrowhawk's struggles as he learns to master the great magics he wields so freely near the book's end, nor allowing us to see how he decides what tactics to use when battling great foes or navigating uncharted seas, Le Guin flattens Sparrowhawk's character into an unknowable, archetypal hero. Reading about such a character is similar to reading a history text book, but far more illogical, as in history, problems arise due to defined causes and are solved in a realistic manner.Unfortunately, the lack of deep characterization is not limited to the characters themselves. On the surface, Le Guin's world seems a unique realm with much potential. The archipelago-like setting provides a wealth of different islands, each ready to support its own unique culture and teach Sparrowhawk about different facets of the world and himself. Thus, it almost comes as a shock when the young man journeys from island to island, meeting only people and cultures identical to his own. This dearth of fantastic lands to explore is unusual for a fantasy novel concerning a man's great journey. While the argument may be made that this tactic focuses the reader's attention on Sparrowhawk's internal developments, it actually lessens the scope and impact of these same developments. Truly, how much can one learn, even about oneself, if one never goes anywhere containing people unlike those who live in one's own home?While individual characters may have defining traits that help them stand out from their background to a degree, these characters are few, far between, and frequently abandoned by the wandering mage, forcing Le Guin to continually begin building up new characters from scratch. Through the beginning of the book, this is a natural and effective part of the exposition, but abandoning well-established characters (such as the teachers and most students the mage meets on the isle of the wizards) cuts Sparrowhawk off from the few people that caused him to reveal his inner feelings, leaving the remainder of the tale emotionally dry and empty.A Wizard of Earthsea attempts to fill many of the niches presently occupied by the great fantasy epics of J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Jordan, and Terry Goodkind within the space of under 200 pages. Unfortunately, the effort is a failure: the characters are flat, the many lands Sparrowhawk visits are similar to one another, and the plot elements are unrealistically and unfulfillingly resolved. In the realm of high fantasy, Le Guin has been outdone by Tolkien and her successors."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read this book for a scifi/fantasy lit class I was taking at the time. The teacher started off with this book because it was one of the first real popular fantasy books that was non-tolkien. I have varying tastes, but all I really desire in a fantasy book is enough detail to make the world feel real, characters that I can care about, and a unique story. This book seemed to be lacking all of those things. I guess it was just to simple for me, and too short to really get invested in the story. I believe it was written in the late 60s and you can really tell, it shows it's age compared to more modern fantasy.

A classic in its own right, this book gets credit for much of the heavy lifting necessary to propel fantasy up to its respectable and meaningful niche in modern literature. Geared towards the younger reader, being an easy read, this book nonetheless tells a powerful story with serious and important lessons. Any reader will enjoy this story, and many will be truly inspired. As Ged matures and faces a myriad of challenges in a dangerous (and wonderfully imagined) world, he learns life lessons that we all do at some point on our journey, eventually coming to face hard truths about his own self and about his role in life.A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA begs to be read out loud. Simple enough vocabulary spun in a lyrical way gives this story a magical feel. Its on the short list of fantasy books that I picture myself reading to my future kids. Very little violence and no sex means this is a book appropriate for any age. The vivid images and powerful emotion will make a lasting impression on young minds, and the story will teach them positive lessons as well.

My only complaint is that, unlike some epic fantasy novels that are so ridiculously long they overstay their welcome, A Wizard of Earthsea is too short. However, for those readers who like their fantasy smut-free and are tired of five-hundred volume long series that really go nowhere, I highly recommend this book, not only because it's one of the great-grandparents of the surge of fantasy seen these days, but also because of its timeless story and the beauty of its language.Mrinta Quest: A Tale of Zeheryfel (Tales of Zeheryfel)"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"It has been over a decade since I read this book in High School, but it's fantastic storytelling and powerful themes always draw my mind back to it's pages. LeGuin here created a world where power HAS to come with responsibility or suffer the consequences. Nowhere in these pages will you find wizards who are practically demi-gods. The magick of Earthsea must always be used with a sense of balance or the consequences can be dire. Every word spoken in the language of dragons must be said carefully, lest you regret the unintended consequences. This great theme of personal responsibility and awareness of the consequences of ones actions had a profound influence on me. Another theme you will found within these pages is the Conquest of the self. To accept, but also balance, all the different facets/passions/aspects of yourself to remain an integral and whole person.

The final battle with the darkness that has stalked him is the most powerful picture of the Shadow in my experience."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The Earthsea trilogy is among my favorites. Top 5 at least. I read it several times as a teenager and several more times as an adult. Whenever I read them I never want them to end. They should be a trilogy of trilogies instead of just 3 books."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"In A Wizard of Earthsea you will witness and accompany Sparrowhawk through what is to be his rite of passage. He discovers his true name while facing great challenges, such as an almost deadly battle with a terrifying and powerful creature, only to realize that the monster may only be his own shadow.This is a truly original story that quickly captures your attention, imagination and heart. It won't be any easy one to put down, and you won't be able to get you hands on the next book in the series fast enough. It is full of action and symbolism, and represents the authors exceptional ability to create things that the rest of us never dreamed of. This novel will not dissapoint."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I don't usually read sci/fantasy. However, suffering from a cold and lacking any other easy reading material in the house, my husband handed his copy of The Wizard of Earthsea. I didn't really think that I would like, but ended up pleasantly surprised. The Wizard of Earthsea is basically the story of a young man with exceptional talent and an equal measure of stupid pride. As you might expect, this stupid pride ends up getting the young man into trouble when he releases a 'something' from the underworld. Of course, the young man is then forced to 'go on quest' to force the dark shadow back into the underworld. In the end, the shadow ends up being himself and a valuable lesson is learned.While I wouldn't call this original material or fabulous writing, it is still well worth your time. The story is enjoyable and the characters likable. Being ill when I read it, I was able to finish it in the course of a day. This book would also make worthwhile reading for those who are young adults and not quite up to the challenge of The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I think this book is a great trilogy because it is filled with adventure and excitement. This book actually makes you feel like you are there with the characters inside the story. I would recommend this book to kids between the ages of eleven to eighteen.Ged was once known as Sparrowhawk in his youth. He was the greatest known wizard of all of Earthsea. He was a reckless child that was hungry for power and knowledge. One day he learned of a life-long held secret and had loosened a shadow upon Earthsea.He also tamed an ancient dragon because the city was afraid of the dragons were coming to eat their life stock. They were starving because they had not eaten for years.

LeGuin The other two books are about magic as well.I liked Harry Potter better, however."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Along with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn, this is one of my favorite fantasies. The first volume in Leguin's Earthsea Trilogy, A Wizard of Earthsea recounts the journey of Ged from village goat-herd on the island of Gont through apprenticeship to the wise Ogion and on to the school for Wizards on Roke Island (long before Rowling's Harry Potter and Hogwart's School).Much of the charm of the story is the beautiful and elemental world which Leguin's evocative prose creates, a world of heights and depths, darkness and light, beauty and terror, dragons and magic -- a world that has its own spiritual integrity which Ged must learn to respect. This is &quot;high fantasy&quot; at its peak, graceful and spare and profound in its ability to move the reader.The second and third volumes, The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore, though they may be read independently, continue to reveal this unique world and further develop Ged's character. Leguin has in fact written two additional volumes which take up where The Farthest Shore leaves off. Read these books if you love literate, original fantasy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard Of Earthsea (1968) is one of the finest coming of age novels written during the 20th Century. Grim and unsparing in its depiction of the harshness of existence, the book is nonetheless incredibly wise and beautiful, and should be read by audiences of all ages and backgrounds. With the exception of Tolkien's magnum opus, critics have called Le Guin's initial three Earthsea books the greatest fantasy novels ever written; but the simple truth is that Le Guin's trilogy surpasses Tolkien's achievement, since, without damaging the integrity of her fantasy world, Le Guin infuses her work with ample deep truths that are applicable to all individuals, all times, and all cultures.A Wizard Of Earthsea is the story of Ged, called Sparrowhawk, a young Healthcliffian loner who unwittingly discovers that he has an innate potential for extraordinary magical power. Leaving Gont, the gray, windswept island of his birth to seek training on Roke, the island of wizards, the rough - hewn, sensitive boy foolishly accepts a dare from an envious senior comrade, and thus brings an irrevocable disaster down upon his head.The balance of A Wizard Of Earthsea concerns Ged's comfortless flight from the horror he has raised, as his careless action is one so terrible that its resolution is beyond the power of the even the greatest of Roke's wizards. Earthsea's far - dwelling dragons, of unsurpassable age, erudition, and power, can likewise do nothing to buttress or assist him. Physically and psychically scarred and exiled from mankind by the singularity of his predicament, Ged courageously and responsibly accepts his fate. Accompanied only by a small shrew - like animal that nests in his hood, Ged takes to Earthsea's endless oceans and becomes both the hunted and the hunter of the black, faceless, and unknowable parasite he has unleashed.The fantasy also astutely reflects the psychological truth that archetypal \\"monsters\\" are often, if not always, disenfranchised, wounded, and needy remnants of the very individuals and societies they ostensibly assault and violate.Ged is clearly a Christ figure (Ged / God) and an everyman, and it is to Le Guin's great credit that she conveys both the existential nature of his character and his inexorable destiny in a manner in which the reader can readily identify. Few novels of any genre communicate what it is to be young, ignorant of self - knowledge, misunderstood, emotionally isolated, guilty, and bearing up resourcefully under a terrible burden as powerfully as A Wizard Of Earthsea.As presented, Le Guin's fantasy world is a starkly romantic, autumnal, pre - industrial land of innumerable small islands set in an endless gray sea. The author's sparse, plain - spoken, and nuanced prose combines the stern, unyielding strength of Hilda Doolittle's early Imagist poetry with the psychological profundity of Jung's Memories, Dreams, And Reflections (1961) or Collected Letters (1973). Never less than insightful, A Wizard Of Earthsea is a sad, dynamic novel imbued with the genuine power to educate and inspire its audience about the fundamental difficulties inherent in living."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This wonderful fantasy book stars Ged on his quest to undo his wrong that he unleashed upon the world. A powerful story with moral, sorcery, dragons, friendship, and everything you want from a good book. A fantasy story like no other, I highly recommend it. It is one of those books that makes you think apon your own actions and the effect of them. I may not know alot about books. For I am only 12 years old, but I know when a book makes me feel good. Young or old this story gives a person a chance to go into the unknown."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" about twenty or twenty-five years ago and had completely forgot the tale. However, last week I was in search for something to read, and pulled this paperback off my bookshelf. So here is my fresh perspective having just completed this story moments ago:Note: there are some plot spoilers in my review.First, I could not believe the amount of narrative LeGuin used in this book. She writes about lot of things rather than shows the reader how it has happened (or is happening) as the story unfolds. Now, to be fair, LeGuin does this with very beautiful and poetic language, of which I was able to appreciate and admire, but it is narrative just the same. If you cannot stand this style, I expect you will have a hard time with this book.The first chapter goes contains (mostly) fifteen pages of exposition, and breaks into short dialogue less than 20 times. The narrative usually stays out of the thoughts of the characters and remains rather distant. Many of the remaining chapters follow this model.I can understand that LeGuin was attempting to generate a feeling of ancient lore, since use of her wonderful narrative voice adds to that overall effect, but it make this book read less like a novel and much more like a short section of Tolkien's Silmarillion; a book that was never intended to be read as a novel but more as a history of ancient lore in a style that resembles parts of the Bible.The narrator's voice also avoids deep characterization - seldom do we fully appreciate the thoughts and the full motivations of most of the people that inhabit Earthsea. Due to this style, the only chapters that were very interesting and entertaining to me were Chapters Two through Four - the part of the story in which Ged becomes apprentice to the Mage Ogion and later leaves him to train on the island of Roke in a school for Wizards. In these chapters there is quite a bit of dialogue and interesting interplay between characters. Particularly, there is an intense and interesting wizardly rivalry between Ged (a poor boy raised in poverty) and an older student named Jasper (raised in privilege and wealth) [1]. It is from this contest of wills that brings forth the evil shadow that occupies Ged for the remaining chapters of the novel. It is too bad that LeGuin completely drops this Ged-Jasper conflict utterly once the shadow is let loose on the world, as this was one of the best parts of the story.There is what should have been an interesting \\"side trip\\" in chapter six and seven. LeGuin has Ged venture to a land called Osskil in search of a way to defeat his enemy. Again, here are two more chapters of the story that had great potential, conflict, and mystery that ends abruptly for Ged, who flees without fully understanding what has happened or what powers have contrived to entrap him. The reader may also be likewise disappointed as LeGuin writes the set up very well, and the mystery of the stone is well presented, but the sudden flight ruins the suspense. Ged and the reader do not learn enough through this encounter. Did Ged's shadow drive him to Osskil or did the spirit in the stone pull him there? Did the shadow serve the stone or are they the same; are they part of the same darkness? How and why did this happen? Unfortunately, Ged makes a couple of assumptions ex-post-facto, but it is not satisfying or critical to the plot.The remaining chapters describe conflict, between Ged and the evil shadow released (or created?) by Ged's foolish one-upmanship of Jasper at the wizard school. Long before the end of the book it is quite clear as to how, exactly, Ged would manage to defeat this thing. The reader also will likely understand exactly what the shadow represents as well -again this realization will likely happen before the final chapter.Overall, I think this book is entertaining enough for those that are not put-off by such a narrative style, but it certainly pales in comparison to Tolkien, of which it is constantly compared. There is no valid comparison in A Wizard of Earthsea the rich characterization and sheer storytelling ability contained within The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. As I said earlier, if this work is fairly compared to a style of Tolkien, then it must be compared only to a chapter or section the massive Silmarillion: a collection of unfinished writings and narrative history."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula Le Guin knows how to write about wizards and dragons in such a way that your imagination lives in her words. This is a gift not many authors have and some readers are not aware of. This is a book to read before you die."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Exciting and well written from start to finish. I can't wait to read the following books in the Earthsea Cycle."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I picked up this book for my love of fantasy and the reputation of Le Guin. I found the story to be very simple and standard fare for fantasy. The young hero sets out on a quest to save himself/the world. During the quest, he increases his skills and matures emotionally. There are many similarities between this book and The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss (one of my favorites). La Guin does break the mold a bit by subtly including non-white lead characters and strong female characters which were tough to find in the genre at the time this book was written."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"\\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" may come off as following the traditional archetype of a wizard coming of age in wizarding school and fighting evil, but there are quite a few things that make it unique.For one, when Le Guin wrote the book, that wasn't an archetype. Young adult fantasy didn't really exist then.Also, the book doesn't feature war. Le Guin thinks that stories of wars between good versus evil are over-told and that there are more important stories to tell. The story is about Ged, the protagonist, coming of age, realizing his shortcomings, and overcoming and accepting his personal demons. The conflicts are no less epic and the victories no less sweet for the lack of war.One of the reviews that I read before reading \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" included the line, \\"A 1968 book with a non-white hero! LOVE.\\" Being a white person, I might not have even noticed that fact if I hadn't read the review, but it was both true and heartening.The writing style was different than I'm used to. It had an old-fashioned fantastical lyrical storybook feel. It was interesting seeing a different style, but I think that, while I appreciated the lyricalness, I prefer less whimsical styles.Overall, a very good exploration of humans and meaning."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I came back to this book after a long bout of urban fantasy and dystopian novels in my read pile, and I must admit it was a bit jarring. I read this book for the first time as a young girl, so to be fair to the book, I feel like my review is a combination of my feelings from both times I read the book.A Wizard of Earthsea is a true fantasy book distilled to its purest form. LeGuin does not use many words, and does not waste time with fluff. The me now found this a jarring transition because I find that most of the modern books I read are very descriptive, and focus more on the showing of events and worlds than the telling of the story. At some times, the lack of pronounced downtime and character development felt a tad tedious. Younger me, I felt, had more of an imagination to feel in the gaps. I really do enjoy the story itself. I like that in the Earthsea novels, magic doesn't come from the elements, or pseudo-Latin words, but from holding the power of a things true name. I think that is one of the things I find appealing about faerie mythology, so I enjoy seeing the theme here in a different light. One of the things I like most about this novel, both now and in the past, is it a parable that warns of the consequences of having power and of abusing that power.I'd recommend it if you have a good imagination (or don't mind terser books) and like true fantasy books (wizards, magic, dragons)."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read The Chronicles of Narnia, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings when I was a kid. I had heard about A Wizard of Earthsea but for some unknown reason never bothered to pick it up. Now, 20 years later, I finally decided to because of the reputation the book has acquired as a fantasy classic.A Wizard of Earthsea certainly deserves its reputation. Although geared towards a young adolescent readership, who will probably be drawn into and affected by the book the most, I found that it pulled me in as well and kept me immersed right to the end. Although the book is relatively short by fantasy standards, the world of Earthsea is beautifully constructed and Ursula LeGuin's writing is spare yet evocative. The story is also compelling and philosophical, drawing on Buddhist/Taoist concepts of the underlying unity of existence and Jungian psychology for an original and thought-provoking fairy tale.I challenge contemporary fantasy authors to whittle down their massive tomes and endless sequels into a tale as simply told yet as powerful and meaningful as A Wizard of Earthsea."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"O.K. you are a middle grade to younger ya reader. You've done Harry Potter, and while you had to trudge a little to get through it, you're now done. What next?Everyone says \\"Narnia\\". People who love it love it like crazy. Some, like me, don't think that much of it. Read the first volume and see if it strikes a chord.There's the Eragon cycle. First volume is very, very clever and well done. I can't get through the rest. They seem sketchy, rushed, shallow and obvious.\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is the gold standard, but you know what? You may have to try that two or three times before it grabs you and draws you in.Then there are dozens of other current fantasy sets. from obvious successes like the Riordan Percy Jackson books to less well known ones like the Bemis \\"Clockwork Dark\\".What to do? Well, I was in that place and realized that even though I knew of the Le Guin series, knew the story, and knew of its huge fan base, I had never actually read it. (Sort of like \\"Treasure Island\\", \\"Kidnapped\\", and so on.) The great news is that while the word \\"classic\\" is used pretty carelessly on these pages, it is appropriate here.The biggest problem is that \\"Wizard\\" is such a touchstone that many of its original elements have been copied so many times that it will feel familiar. Don't let that bother you. This is in many ways the original and the best."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This has always been one of my favorties. Le Guin creates an independant world where magic is truly real. The characters are well written and believeable and the plot depth is excellent.

Don't forget the follow up books, The Tombs of Atuin and The Farthest Shore.

The plot is about a person who was born with wizardian qualities and subsequently had to learn how to use this preternatural gift that was inherited through childbirth. The author, Ursula K. Le Guin, manifested the foundation of Ged's character as having the ability to become a great wizard and eventually led him to acquire knowledge of the Hardic tongue (language). Le Guin took a very clever idea and a synergistic journey by presenting both the combination and separation of the notion of psychological awareness of thought process through illusion, mystery, and language. This conveniently enabled the readership to view the personality of Ged precisely as Le Guin portrayed and presented him.This book also signifies the importance of one mastering the skill and knowledge associated with his specific, identified, and chosen profession. This book further conveys that if one desires to gain power and become skillful in his craft, he must be committed and dedicated to his teachings, coupled with the willfulness to achieve a certain goal. Ged accomplished this when he went to the Isolated Tower and was released early due to his quick learning ability.Notwithstanding, I view this book as sending a profound message, that, \\"in order to be a profectionist, regardless of what gift you may have acquired, there must be a great deal of devotion and sacrifice.\\" Furthermore, the characterization of Ged and Jasper amplifies how a certain personality may not be compatible to another, allowing controversy and conflict to surface. Finally, I found this book to be quite interesting because of the author's ability to vividly express the correlation between reality and illusion, compiled with power and the desire to achieve knowledge through the art of language."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Well, in a way. Just as Captain Ahab hunted the White Whale, so does Ged hunt the black shadow that he has loosed upon the world of Earthsea. Of course, this is all after we read about Ged's childhood on the island of Gont and how he went to Roke and became a wizard.One thing that really surprised me with this book was how poetic it was. There are literally dozens of sentences that have alliteration in them, making this work much more beautiful. And yet, I felt a little let down by the storyline. I guess I was expecting a little more action, such as expecting Ged to became the wizard in command of some army that must turn away the foes from some other island--but it's not so. That's not to say that the book is boring, though. It really is interesting, but just not excellent enough for a harsh critic like me to give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea ranks among the Chronicles of Narnia and the Wizard of Oz as the the best fantasy series I have read.

That said, I still love the &quot;Wizard of Earthsea&quot; series. These books (especially the first and the third) really have something for everyone... children, teenagers and adults alike. LeGuin is a master at alliteration (if you don't know what that is, look it up), which gives every sentence a dreamlike, poetic quality. These books are not &quot;adrenaline pumpers&quot; but mature, thoughtful high fantasy written in the spare but beautifully poetic style of Hemingway.

And given that, I was let down by the story. The characters leave much to the imagination and are uninspiring. With a story so short and so full of adventure I would have though that I would grow to care about these people. But, that wasn't the case. The story is about a young wizard and his life to maturity, through all the trials of being a child and through manhood. I would say interesting. But, nowhere near the best sci-fi book of all time."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula K Leguin has certain exceptional talents as an author. Her best, and most lovely, talent is an unsurpassed style and prose. She is a poet in disguise, quite frankly. Her beauty in expressing herslef is the greatest joy to be found in reading these books. Her style distills meanings without being didactic- the hardest task an author has when trying to convey some message to the reader. The book is a multi-layered story about a boy reaching manhood. The process is standard- a sort of twist on the sorceror's apprentice- a trial the main character (Ged) undergoes to achieve an inner peace. If you read a little deeper, not too simple, you could also catch glimpses of a man struggling with power, and how to deal with great power and not upset delicate balances. A sort of 'playing with fire' tale, if you wish. Leguin creates a charming world, if a bit sleepy (thats part of the charm i suppose). Its not terrifically detailed- it is a novel about a character, to be sure- and its best quality is its mysterious nature. Its a strange place with strange powers and few comforting laws. As i said, Leguins best talent is her beautiful prose. She is, however, not without flaws. Her world is her chief liability. Its not only sleepy- at times its rather dreary. In fact, after reading the book, I came away with the feeling that the world was very chilly and grey, with constant fogs, dreary skies and no sun. It certainly casts a bit of a pall on the events in the book. And the interminable sea rides- riding over a grey sea under a grey sky- can really depress you. I certainly wouldnt want to live in the world she describes here (it gets a bit better in the second book- a desert- barren, but at least not chilly). Finally, Leguin fails in writing a good conclusion. Ged defeats his gnawing shadow in a sort of 'trick' ending that gives the impression of Leguin wiggling out of a problem she created for herself. But, the books are a nice read in the long run. it certainly gets better in the second book (with a character much more interesting than Ged). Fantasy fans who can live without adrenaline will love this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book was a great book. It was slow in the beginning, but once I got through the first three chapters it was really good. I could not put this book down."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"after reading a lot of dragonlance and tolkien, earthsea was a whole new look on fantasy. one of my favorite subjects in fantasy is magic, and in the earthsea series i found a new, much more realistic side to it. the bookis written in children-style but for those who look deeper into it, it reveals deep and sofesticated messages. the power of words is shown here as a magical power which controls the things in the world of earthsea, when in our reality it is quite close to that as words can be a very powerfull thing in comunication with other beings. there are more of these thoughts buried deep or shallow in the series and in this book there maybe are more than in the others. therefore i dare put Orsula K. Le-Guin on one plain with J.R.R Tolkien which, untill now, i thought the best fantasy writer. tolkien's greatness was in his language and sofesticated details, le-Guin's is in the messages behind the story itself which is nevertheless an interesting, mystical adventure which anyone will doubtless enjoy.it's a great loss that the series wasn't as detailed as tolkiens novels, i sure would like to know much more of the ancient language(especialy the runes), and the customs of earthsea... our loss."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"My favorite book, the second being the last in this trilogy. Ged the wizard.. his adventures mirror my own in so many ways, unleashing a shadow of my own vanity or anger or aloneness, for whatever it was, it was made of himself. I related to this story in so many ways, and the peace of the final pages somehow was my own. The long voyage over the sea, and the description of the land of death, running down the hill to save the dieing child... It is all so vivid, original, and living. I read this book often. I loved the first time I met the wizard school, and all the long studying to learn the crafts of bringing from the invisible to this world ones intention. Ged is the moral compass, who does only what he must do, and so follows a pathvoid of desire, and filled with the will of the shadow he follows. His simply cottage and the pleasures of being warm in old weather, of having a friend to talk to in long lonely seasons is here described with perfect simplicity. The fact that he is a magic wielder .. well lets say its far more elequent than the cartoon animation of the book.I was sad that Harry Potter took so much from this work and yet it did not enjoy any of the big attention. Perhaps because it is a deeper, greater work. Or maybe because it was one of the first of its kind, before things we marketed. I think of it, of the writer, like Rickie Lee Jones, having created so many things in her work that were taken by others and yet she seems to have received little credit for the paths she forged. Ursula Le Guin might be associated with leftist politics but they really have nothing to do with the story. The fact that the protagonist and most of the characters are black and brown never made me think twice. They were as easily heros to me as any Tolkien .. and maybe more so, for his only flaw was to include the terrible British social hierarchy that is at times embarrassing, but understandable, for we cannot suddenly become what we have never been. We must walk a path out of the dark. So his remarks of ' tell your master' and so forth can be forgiven, if only a little bit, for he had no imagined a world in which these things we not necessary to his characters... Ursula carefully wove her characters from classless, or from what at the time of the writing were the lower classes. But it does not come off that way. In future times, as now, no one will know that the idea of black protagonists was rather revolutionary. In factI still have not seen many in fiction, but of course I do not read much fantasy anymore."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Before I started reading this book I was unsure weather this would be a good investment of my time. While I usually like books like this, for some reason I was not expecting much from it. I was happily proven wrong however and it turned out to be a highly addicting book,and I ended up plowing through it in two nights reading. Sadly it is very short coming in at just over 180 pages, but it was good enough I am going to give the other books in the cycle a try, and if you are into fantasy books I would not hesitate to recommend this to anybody that can appreciate a good fantasy book.Oh, and I forgot to mention, this book covers a VAST landscape, you will NOT get bored of the scenery lol."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I liked this book because it's orgianal and it has charm to it. the book is hard to put down it's so good.

I read this book when I was a child, but I found it much more interesting as an adult. Le Guin creates a world with it's own definition of magic, where the highest power is commanding something by wielding its true name. one of Ged's classes is simply learning the names of everything, and I found this simple but powerful. Some people will compare this Harry Potter. Potter is more detailed and comprehensive while Earthsea is more thematic and brief. I recommend reading them both."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I thought A Wizard of Earthsea was a great book. It was THE fantasy book to read. It was full of magic, action,and friendship. The theme of the story was that you shoudn't be arrogant. I'd recommend this book to anyone, ecspecially people who like fantasy.(If you think you're intrested in reading it, check out my overview)A Wizard of Earthsea was about a boy named Ged. At birth, he was gifted with extraordinary powers. At the age of 13, he crossed into manhood and was taken as the prentice of the Wizard Ogion. Ged decided that he would rather go to a school of wizardry, so he went to school on the island of Roke. After about a year on Roke, Ged challenged an older boy to a duel. Thinking that he could surpass what the others said he couldn't do, Ged attempted to raise a spirit from the dead. In doing so, he failed and loosened a \\"shadow\\" of neither the realm of the living nor realm of the dead. It is now Ged's duty to rid the world of it--before it rids the world of him."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This was magical book with lots of cool meaning. In this book there is a very delicate balance and as a wizard Ged had to understand the boundary of being in this balance. Obcourse Ged is a very haughty and challanging kid that does not respect this balance. Because of his obnoctious character, Ged lets off a ghost (his evil shadow) and through the story he runs from it in the dark but cant get rid of it. He then learns the way to defeat it is to say its name. However he cant figure out what its name was. Ged finally gets older and wiser and figures out the ghost is himself and he must face it...

Actually the whole series is. When I was in the fith grade, I read this book. I adored it. I wouldn't read anything else but the Earthsea Cycle for maybe a year of more. It haunted me. I didn't realize, though, what the book was really about until much, much later. I recently replaced my old copy of this book and reread the series. Now, as I am older, I realize what about this story really struck me. Not only does this book have strong elements of balance and harmony in it, but I think it is poignant and meaningful when it comes to Ged and the darkness he must face. It is very hard for us to recognize the darkness that is within all of us, and even harder for us to name and then make it a part of ourselves, but the only place evil can truly be vanquished is by recognizing it and understanding it, even the evil things within ourselves. The scene where Ged faces down that formless, horrible monster is quite scary. I read several reviews, from mostly children, about how this book wasn't any good, which while they are entitled to their opinions, I do hope they try reading this book again. I see this book shoved in among books by modern fantasy authors like Robert Jordan or R.A. Salvatore of Tanya Huff (all of whom I like), but it really belongs in the literature section, which I think, is why so many are so confused. It is not the type of story they are looking for. I remember when I was little, my uncle saw me reading the Dark Elf Trilogy by R.A. Salvatore. So he gave me The Fellowship of the Ring. Right then, when I wanted more Drizzt, I hated the Lord of the Rings. He had told me it would be like the Drizzt novels, and he wasn't right. They are different kinds of stories. When you want something like the Lord of the Rings, you don't pick up Harry Potter, but Beowulf. The Wizard of Earthsea is also like that. I remember a co-worker of mine directing a young library patron to the Wizard of Earthsea after hearing she like Harry Potter. I stopped the little girl and told her that while she might like it, it isn't at all like Harry Potter and maybe she should try So You Want To Be A Wizard, the Bartimaeus Trilogy, or the Chrestomanci Chronicles. I was right, she hated Earthsea and loved the others. So, in summation, if you read this book and disliked it, give it another try, and if not go see Goro Miyazaki's adaptation of The Farthest Shore and Tehanu in July, and then try again! Remember, there are more types of wizards than the fireball flinging kind and Gandalf!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea is (and deserves to be) a classic of modern fantasy literature. It is a serious-minded allegorical HIGH fantasy. Gone are the comical cavorts of house-elves, or the liberal spell-slinging of Dungeons and Dragons. This book delves into man's identity as the dust of the earth, and how he comes to terms with that.The story follows the early life and coming-of-age of Ged Sparrowhawk, who will become (according to the book) one of the greatest wizards of all time. Ged is proud and lustful for power, and eventually sets an undead shadow loose on the world---one which only he can stop.Two of Le Guin's achievements in the book stand out above the rest. The first is the ability of her style to spark the reader's imagination. Her description of the physical world is extremely sparse, often focusing on characters' immediate feelings. This allows the reader to fill in the gaps of description in his or her own mind, making the world belong more firmly to the reader. This aspect of her writing is mirrored in her choice to focus on \\"slices\\" of Ged's life by quickly passing over periods of a few years. Finally, she actually gives relatively little description of the world, but hints at it enough to give the reader the feeling that there is more going on \\"out there\\" than the book details. This might be frustrating to a reader who felt they were missing out on action, but the book's themes of cosmic balance and tranquility smooth that over somewhat.Which is a nice segue into her next achievement: well-done literary expression of the idea that power requires caution. This idea has been repeated so oft lately as to seem clich&eacute;d---Spiderman, Star Wars, the World of Darkness, Jurassic Park, even Harry Potter---but earlier works only dealt with the caution that must be taken against those with power. While there are examples of the theme before Le Guin (the stories of Icarus, Prometheus, and Epimetheus come to mind), hers was one of the first in the modern era.I ought to stop writing, though. In the words of Ged's master and teacher---\\"To hear, one must be silent.\\""},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula Le Guin made fantasy history with \\"A Wizard of Earthsea,\\" a spare but strangely entrancing story about a young wizard coming of age. Despite a rather distant writing style, Le Guin's story is still a classic that is generally put on the same shelf as Lewis and Tolkien.Ged was born in a village in Earthsea -- a grouping of many, many small islands -- in Gont. The boy soon shows signs of great power, the ability to call animals and to laugh even when his tongue has been bound by a spell. A mage named Ogion apprentices Ged--who is known as Sparrowhawk, as knowledge of his true name would give anyone power over him. But Ogion's discipline and lessons are full of silence and self-examination, something which soon sends Ged to the school for mages in Roke.A rival finally mocks Ged into a magical duel, and a monstrous creature made of shadow attacks Ged, nearly killing him. But upon the completion of his studies, the now-wiser wizard sets off to an island to seek the Dragon of Pendor. As the shadow closes in on Ged and his life becomes increasingly imperiled, he must discern what -- and who -- it is, to make himself truly whole.Le Guin's book has a lot of things in it that tend to annoy readers -- several years are skipped in a few pages, and little of Ged's thoughts and emotions aside from \\"Ged felt this\\" and \\"Ged thought that\\" are revealed. But the spare mythic style and quiet philosophical bent add an extra dimension to a straightforward fantasy story.Le Guin's story spans several years in Ged's life, taking him from a little boy in a dirty village to a powerful and respected mage. But she also spins in Eastern philosophy, in the form of the \\"shadow\\" that stalks Ged for many years -- in some ways, the final explanation for what the shadow is seems fitting.Ged has the makings of a classic hero: he is talented and initially hot-headed, but through his misfortunes is tempered into a more selfless, albeit scarred person (both physically and emotionally). Most of the supporting characters don't appear long enough to get much development, although Ged's buddy Vetch comes across as a sweetheart.Ursula Le Guin's \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a memorable story about a boy becoming a man, and a man coming to terms with himself. A unique story, and one worthy of being called a classic."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book, being probably Le Guin's most famous fantasy novel, is also one of the strangest. It is different from Lewis' Narnia series and Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in that it sees to lack a coherent, unified theme throughout the course of the story. Le Guin takes us down side plots and round-about courses to reach the final destination. I found that it was similiar to V.S. Naipaul's halting, slow, and somewhat dull way of revealing his insights to the reader in many of his non-fiction books. However, like Naipaul, Le Guin is able to finally bring everything together. Very few details and side paths are frivolous; in fact, they reveal deep insights into the protaganist's inner character. The use of foreshadowing (Ged summoning the shade on Gont) and the use of raw, stripped-down writing is something to be admired in this day, when many books lack a true natural, organic feel.Le Guin's use of minor details (the bauble given to Ged by the strange Kargish woman on the abandoned island) set the stage for various other adventures of Ged. Also, Le Guin creates an elaborate world, the likes of which is only rivaled by Tolkien's Middle Earth.Le Guin truly created a masterpiece in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; and, as such, should receive the praise for her works. However, a newer generation of readers and fantasy novels seems to have swept her writings away. Nevertheless, she ranks only second behind Tolkien in my personal fantasy favorites."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I don't think that many people truly understand what the term &quot;high fantasy&quot; means. For example, I have heard people refer to Anne McCaffrey as high fantasy, when that is not the case. High fantasy is when the author creates an entirely new world, with new languages, new societies, and new realities, which, strangely enough, allows the author to get closer to the truth about human nature and the ways of the world. I know of few authors that really live up to that definition, and one of them is Ursula LeGuin. Although she draws from ancient folklore, as well as basing some of societies in Earthsea on our ancient societies and cultures, a great portion of her work is straight out of her imagination. The book is not for those who like their fantasy light-hearted and with witty or sarcastic comments made by the characters every few minutes. Although there are moments of comic relief, most of the book (and the series) is rather austere and dark. This is because the world that she tells of is harsh and unforgiving, much like Europe in the middle ages. Back then there wasn't a lot to smile about, so you had to find you light in strange places. The good guys aren't always good-looking, and a happy ending sometimes requires that you don't end up with what you want. There is another book that was written ten years after this series, called Tehanu, and it continues where the saga left off, tying up some loose ends, and giving closure. I would definately reccommend Earthsea for those who prefer their fantasy raw and un-sugar coated. It is gritty, and not for the faint of heart, to the point where I wouldn't even really call it fantasy, because it gets about as close to the truth as I have seen any book get."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"THE STORY: is about a reckless, awkward boy named Sparrowhawk who becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. The boy comes to realize that his fate may be far more important than he ever dreamed possible. Readers will witness Sparrowhawk's moving rite of passage--when he discovers his true name and becomes a young man. Great challenges await Sparrowhawk, including an almost deadly battle with a sinister creature, a monster that may be his own shadow.MY FEEDBACK:1) This book isn't for everyone. The majority of the book is complete narration and very, very little dialogue. Some might find this borning and be tempted to skip to the next piece of dialogue. If you do, you'll miss 90% of the story.2) I had no expectations going into this book except that it is highlye praised by the majority. Even with the long narrations it somehow captured my attention and held it there. Seeing the transformation of the teenager Ged through the story was the core of the book. Teenagers may relate and thus enjoy the story further.3) Ged against a bunch of dragons. Way cool! Need I say anymore.4) I agree with other reviews that Ged is really the only character we get to love and care about (Vetch is also likeable). Ged is the only character the author spends time on getting into the persona and motivations of. The postivie note is Ged as a single character does carry the story well.5) I like how the world is made up of hundreds of little island townships vs. a large continent here or there. This added some nice man vs. nature conflict, as the battle with the wind and sea are a constant thing in this world.OVERALL: Very quick and enjoyable read. You will not waste your time getting your hands on this because you'll know real quick if the narration style of writing is boring for you or not. I enjoyed it so well, that I'm excited to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I loved \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" when I was younger and always remembered the book in the back of my mind as a creative influence but hadn't realized until I recently heard about the Sci-Fi channel mini-series that apparently a lot of other people feel the same way. It seems to be universally compared (in scope and accomplishment) to the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Narnia series, the fantasy genre big boys. I've read LotR (but not Narnia) and think that, at least for the first Earthsea novel, the accolade is justified.Instead of comparing Earthsea to LotR, however, I'm going to compare it to a more contemporary wizard series, Harry Potter. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is also about a young boy wizard who (for part of the novel, at least) goes to wizard school and who faces great evil, but aside from that Harry and Ged (Le Guin's protagonist) are complete oppisites. In fact, when considered against some of the negative attention Harry Potter has gotten for either promoting anti-Christian occult or for teaching kids to disrespect their parents, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is even more starkly contrasted. The novel is almost a morality tale about how pride is wrong and can lead you down the wrong path towards great evil, how one should always listen to elders, how study, humility and respect for life are the ways of a good person. I'm sure there are some religious people out there who would object to Earthsea simply because of the presence of magic, but, in reality, the magic in the novel is all found through the understanding of the balance of the world (which is very religious) and through the \\"true names\\" of things, which, in my opinion, is very much like the word of God. Le Guin is not heavy handed and she is not preaching religion (unlike, as I have heard, the Narnia books do) but there is no lesson in Earthsea that can be said not to align with a Judeo-Christian morality.Harry Potter and religion aside, it is a wonderful story and a wonderful book. I started reading it at dinner and stayed up late to finish it because I couldn't stop, and it's always nice to feel a little bit guilty and excited about staying up past your bedtime to read, probably the way I did the first time I read this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I was surprised by this little excellent book! A young boy named Sparrowhawk is born with tremendous power but has no training or discipline to handle it. He is taken by the Wizard Ogion to be trained but, Sparrowhawk, impatient to use his skills asks to be sent to the Island of Roke to the famous Wizard School.There he encounters other boys with skills like his own. He comes to face his own weaknesses and greed for power when a classmate whom he hates dares him to cast a spell he is forbidden to do. This results in a tragedy and Sparrowhawk's near fatal injury. Upon recovery, he vows to change his ways and right what he has done.Although this book was recommended for ages eleven and up, it is by no means a book for young adults only. It has some very profound life lessons that adults will identify with. I loved the fantasy world that Le Guin creates. Her writing is taut, suspenseful and imaginative.

It was straight to the point of the matter. It is a high fantasy classic that deserves to be shared with all. Ms. LeGuin rates up there with such authors as Tolkein and Anne McCaffrey. This was brilliant book that i would recommend to anyone of any age. I think its ridiculous that great literature such as this, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Alice in Wonderland, C.S. Lewis, C.M. whitlock's The Price of Immortality and so on get classified as \\"children's books\\".

In the first five chapters, I only found one adventure that truly kept my interest. It was not until the sixth or seventh chapter that I became interested in Ged, the protagonist, and his adventures. The storyline reminds me of the typical teenage boy who wants to be free and not live by the rules that are set for him until he gets himself in too deep and eventually must find his way home again. Le Guin throws some magic in the mix and comes out on top with A Wizard of Earthsea. In this story, Ged is the young man that does not want to live by the rules. He allows his jealousy and need to impress people with his skill as a mage to get the best of him, until he unleashes an evil that wants to crush his soul. Ironically, Ged realizes that home, which for him is with Ogion his Wizard Master, will set him free. I did find some passages too tedious to even read that I would skim through those dry parts, but I held out and finished the novel. I am glad I did because by the last chapter, I could not wait to find out how Ged conquers his demon.

WhileI don't remember the details of the earlier books, I do remember thefeeling I had entering her world. And the blend of moral insight, magical powers and occult dangers seems like a familiar and slightly disquieting scent.Le Grin undoubtedly is a skilled myth-maker. Her protagonist is a young man who is learning to use his magical powers. Her world is sparsely but I think rather well realized. (Her maps are more real-looking than Tolkien's.) The outline of the book is rather similar to the great Chinese classic Journey to the West: a hero of great power overreaches himself and is forced to set out on a journey to learn (among other things) humility and self-control. Along the way Le Grin drops the reader thoughts to chew on for a while. &quot;Magic consists in this: the true naming of a thing.&quot; (How does that apply to modern genetics?) &quot;The price of the game is the peril of losing one's self.&quot; (True whether the game is business, the occult, or modern science.)The ease with which Le Grin's hero, Ged, works magic, I think, threatens the plot and the imaginable quality of her world sometimes. Ged flits from island to island so easily that the world becomes rather too dream-like. He is in danger of becoming too strong to have adventures. The story is about his taming to good, like the Monkey King. Yet one gets the feeling that in Le Grin's world, evil is ultimately stronger. Perhaps this is why her world feels less real, and less enjoyable, to me than those of Tolkien or Lewis, based on a Christian psychology, or that of Journey to the West, based on a rather cheerful Buddhism. Nor do I think her insight or imagination can really be compared with Tolkien in Lord of the Rings or Lewis in Till We Have Faces. And her world seems to have less humor than the other three. While I enjoyed the creative realization of her story, and felt as if she were bringing me near to some depths of psychological insight, I felt a little dizzy from the journey, and was glad to be back on terra firma.

It is my most favorite book of all time up to date.\\"The legends of Earthsea\\" is about a young boy named Ged who lives in a small village on the isle of Gont. Ged does not like his lifestyle on the island at all, because all he does is help his father smith. Ged knows that his abilities far exceed that of a mere smither, because he continuously has visions. These visions show a girl in a dark labyrinth, and she is running away. Ged has no idea what this means, but he knows that he has special abilities.Ogion, a wizard that resides on Gont, advises Ged that maybe he should go to the isle of Roke. Roke has a school for people with wizard-like abilities, and only accepts those who have specially written recommendations from Arch Maguses. When Ged gets there, he becomes quick friends with Veg, a student who has enrolled there. However, he is also challenged, challenged to a duel in wizardry, by Jasper. In this challenge, Jasper says that Ged could never summon a spirit if his life depended on it. However, his life would have been much better off he did not summon one. Ged summons a dark spirit and releases it into the world.Throughout the book, Veg and Ged seek the demon, flee from the demon, and seek it again. Ged knows that the only way to defeat Debith is to confront it and speak its true name.The story line of this story is good because it always leads you along on the hunt. It's a story that takes you with Ged on his journey to defeat the Debith, and as he does this, he learns many lessons and skills along the way. From sailing across many oceans, to evading the wrath of dragons, Ged travels all over earthsea for the answer he needs to defeat this evil he has released.I would recommend this book to everybody because this is not a boring book at all! Also, read the entire trilogy, because it gets better after the first book, much better."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Simple and poetic. The story flows like a song and grows like a tree into something complex and moving. The protagonist's struggle with lust and arrogance are so believable that you feel his story and power are yours."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Today's readers have different expectations than when this book was published.Today we want fast-paced epics with character-driven stories easy to relate to. A Wizard of Earthsea doesn't quite fit the bill.Not that it's bad.Le Guin is a great writer. Her use of language is terrific, very reminscient of Tolkien. However, like Tolkien, the narrative favors the story rather than the characters. The story is episodic in nature, and the characters (there's really only one main character) are not developed the way we're used to in today's fiction. Don't expect Charlie from Lost.Still, a fascinating story."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The story is decent, though it suffers from the third person omniscient pov. Most of it is exposition, with very little feeling from the characters.But my primary review, and the rating of one star, is because of the narrator. His voicings are terrible. Even worse is how he speaks, screaming, stuttering, breaking up words and pronunciations in ways that no one would ever speak. Picture a high schooler who has just taken his first acting class and thinks he is a great Shakespearean actor. But it's even worse than that. Egads, what was the publisher thinking?"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Although often described as a childrens book, A wizard of Earthsea should be read by people of any age, and any who read it will be changed by the experience. Its one of those books that inspires and changes your entire perspective on life. Ged, whose humble beginnings as a goatherder fail to deter his destiny as a Wizard, unleases a terrible evil while training to be a Wizard on the island of Roke. What follows is a journey that changes Ged's life forever. Chased and persued within an inch of his life, Ged soon becomes a hunter, learning about wisdom, power and ultimately himself along the way. There is magic in the pages of this book, and it definitely does not deserve to be dissmissed as a childrens book, although the kids will enjoy it immensely."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Though obviously written for adolescents, this is a beautifully crafted story that should appeal to all thoughtful readers. In prose that is spare yet visually evocative and resonant with meaning, LeGuin creates an exterior journey of adventure that is also a deep personal journey toward maturity, with all the pain and loss, the failures and successes, and ultimate balance that such a journey involves. Her note-perfect narrative voice enhances the archetypal nature of Ged's quest for purpose and values. His journey takes place in a world as diverse as our own, for the richly envisioned archipelago of Earthsea contains different languages, remote islands and trade centers, rural folk and city sophisticates, cold lands and hot lands, wealth and poverty. Along with several powerful main characters, the novel has many nicely observed minor players and some charming animals, such as a little dragon the length of a girl's hand that lives in oak trees and eats wasps, worms, and birds' eggs. And of course there is the Shadow that Ged accidentally releases in a dangerous ritual, spurred by his own ambition, that goes terribly wrong. Magic appears only when needed, and the descriptions of it are very effective, such as when Ged creates fog to confuse invading warriors or transforms himself into the sparrowhawk that is his namesake in order to make a long journey fast. Beyond its exciting adventure and the theme of self-discovery, the novel is also about how language creates reality, for magic is controlled by language, and language dictates how individuals perceive themselves and the world around them. This is the best -- the purest -- of the four books in the tetralogy, which is saying a lot because all of them are good. Like each of the four, it is a complete story that doesn't depend on the others. My personal favorite among the other three is The Farthest Shore, in which an older Ged takes on a younger version of himself as a kind of apprentice."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I chose this book a long time ago for a school report. And suprisingly, liked it. I still remember the story, though it's a vague image by now.The story of a young boy getting deeper into forbidden secrets and magics, until finally he unleashes an evil shadow. More philosophical than action packed, more thought provoking and concentration required than most fantasy novels. This is the first in the Wizard of Earthsea quartet.Leguin writes with an abstract quality that makes the reader know the story as a WHOLE never in part. A style that fascinated me at the time - and still does. Like a giant jigsaw puzzle, the more you read the greater the picture. But you can never *see* what and where that single piece fits in. Though I kept searching, I never did find the rest of the series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This was, I think, my first fantasy book. Aside from knights and dragons type of thing. And ever since the first time I read it, come to think it was for a school report oh so many years ago, the book has stuck with me. This is my all-time favorite fantasy book and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This was a lovely book. It is quite thoughtful,creative, dramatic, and even kind of bonechilling in some parts (such as when the boy first discovers the spell for calling up the dead). Le Guin also did well at creating a mood for this darkish story, which takes place in a fascinating land known as the Archipelago. My only complaint is the lack of strong female charachters, and the confusing balance of magic. However, this only slighty takes away from the story. My favorite part in the book was probably when the boy was being taught at Roke.Followed by three sequals"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"In the realm of fantasy there are several names that stand out: Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, Susan Cooper, Diana Wynne Jones (and more recently, Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling and Garth Nix). Ursula le Guin also belongs into this category, contributing to the world of fantasy-literature her beloved \\"Earthsea\\" novels, chronicling the life and times of the wizard Ged.The strength of the storytelling comes in the unashamed use of archetypes and symbolism. The story as a whole could be easily aligned with Carl Jung's theories or Joseph Campbell's \\"Hero's Journey\\" complete with Departure, Initiation and Return, and archetypes such as the wise mentor, the female temptress and the shadow. It's practically a textbook case, but rather than being predictable and dull; le Guin's skill as a writer means that the series is densely packed with meaning and intrigue.But the use of archetype has its downside too, particularly in the portrayals of men and women; Ged attends a wizarding school that is populated entirely by males, in a later book \\"The Tombs of Atuan\\", he is pitted against a cult of malevolent priestesses. Le Guin has recently expressed regret for these borderline-stereotypes and in later books makes the conscious effort to balance out the gender inequality that permeates the earlier books. For me however, (and probably to most readers) it is no big deal - we are, after all dealing with traditional archetypes and in one very important way (that I probably shouldn't even be mentioning) le Guin completely breaks the mould on typical fantasy stories. Ged and nearly all of the other characters have copper complexions. Can you think of any other major fantasy novel in which the protagonist is not Caucasian? I can't.Le Guin's finest creation is her world of Earthsea, a world made up of ocean currents and a myriad of different islands, each one with their own cultures and customs, rich and detailed. It is second only to Middle-Earth, and only becomes richer and deeper with each passing novel. Likewise is le Guin's system of magic, based on the power of names and speech; the reason why Ged goes through so many name-changes (he is born as Duny, given the name Sparrowhawk at puberty and has Ged as his \`true name', his name of power). It is a powerful and consistent system and based on real ancient beliefs (read some Egyptian mythology if you don't believe me).Ged is born to a poor farming island, though with immense potential for wizardry which he is all to eager to engage. After he assists in saving his community through the instigation of magic beyond his years, he is approached by the great wizard Ogion who offers to mentor him. Enraptured with dreams of power and glory, he follows Ogion only to be frustrated by his slow teaching methods, opting instead to travel to Roke and enrol in the great wizarding school there.It is there he enters a friendship with fellow student Vetch and a rivalry with another student named Jasper. Letting his pride and resentment get the better of him, Ged attempts to summon up a spirit from the dead, but only manages to unleash a terrible shadow upon the world. Now hunted by his own creation, Ged takes to the seas, hopping from island to island, in the attempt to escape - and then destroy - the evil he has unleashed.Despite my praise, the story isn't perfect; I always felt that the prose was a little stiff and un-involving, almost as if we were reading a detailed overview of the story rather than one told from a person's intimate point of view. Likewise, the story takes forever to really get started - since the chapters are quite long, it takes a while before the shadow is unleashed. However, the patient will be rewarded, in this and subsequent books."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I think that this a good book for kids in fourth grade who like magic and fantasy. I'm in fourth grade and I loved the book.

The characters remain undeveloped as the very modest storyline unfolds itself. For readers of younger ages (10-12) this book would be very interesting because it poses no intellectual difficulties. It passes over months of the characters life with barely a word. It left me with a feeling of com,plete and utter lack of connection with the main character. The fact that someone would even compare this book to Tolkien let alone praising it over him is rediculous. I would actually reread sewctions of the book figuring i must have left out an entire chapter since seemingly important sections of a characters life were just passed by. I would not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13 unless you have an afternoon to waste."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read. I'm 15 so that might change. I had to read this book a year ago for my English class and I loved it. I went out and got my own copy and I plan to read all the other books in the Earthsea saga."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"With a limitation of five stars maximum, I cannot possibly give this story all the credit it diserves.I am a dedicated fanatic of Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; which I devoured nearly four years ago in third grade. So far, I've seen nothing but the Harry Potter series come even close to those three marvelous books and &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; I was very pleasantly surprised upon readin this book.LeGuin starts by introducing the child Duny, called Sparrowhawk, who has some very remarkable abilities. When Duny is given his true name, Ged, by Ogion the mage, he becomes his prentice, and is eager to learn the ways of magic.Eventually, he comes to Roke, and becomes a student in a school for magic. He befriends a kindly boy called Vetch, but also makes a great enemy -- Jasper. Ged, proud and thirsting for power, attempts to outdo his rival by attempting a very dangerous piece of magic...raising a spirit from the dead. In doing so, he accidentally unleashes a deadly and mysterious shadow into the world. Although he is nearly killed during his first encounter with it, Ged knows it is up to him alone to destroy the unnamed evil he has leashed upon the world.This first book of Earthsea is about Ged's passage from boyhood into adulthood, his mastery of magic, and the journey he undertook to restore Equilibrium to Earthsea."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The Amazon review compared this story to Tolkien's Middleearth and C.S. Lewis' Narnia, but the only thing this story has in common with those books is that it stole the basic concept for the Earthsea series from those classic fantasy series. There is nothing original about the story or the main character. It is obvious the author was trying to write it like it was an epic fantasy soon-to-be classic but to me it was so contrived and cliche. The story was so boring and lifeless that I forgot most it as soon as I finished it. Don't bother reading it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I expected more from this book, given the reputation it's received over the years. It's difficult to read..the reader has to really concentrate to read the countless paragraphs without action. The whole evil shadow thing is very confusing."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I seem to be one of the few people who hated this book. I can see how it would make a half-way entertaining children's book, the kind that third graders are forced to read for school, but I can't understand what all the adult reviewers see in A Wizard of Earthsea. There are a hundred things that annoyed me about this book- I'll list a few.1) The names. It seems like a minor thing, but GED?!? I felt sick having to read that name a million times, over and over and over. Earthsea? Wow, imaginative! Not really. All the names of the islands on the little map provided seemed to be random combinations of letters, barely pronouncable and utterly meaningless. I'm not even sure why the islands were named, since only a very few of them are mentioned.2) The language. There actually are places with good description- but very, very few of them... Most of the language that Le Guin uses is dull and boring. Even though the shadow is a main part of the book, she couldn't be bothered to find a single synonym. The result is that the word \\"Shadow\\" is used, on average, about once per page. And these are tiny pages with big writing. Sometimes even if a plot is horrible, I can read and enjoy the book anyway because the descriptions used are interesting and I like the wording used. Not so in this book.3) The characters. Ged is the only character who has any depth whatsoever, and what personality he has is trite and cliched. The other people in the book seem to be there just to move the plot along, without any real effort to make them worthwhile or original.4) The storyline. As a few other people mentioned, the story just hops around. One second Ged is four, then in the next paragraph he's thirteen. You can't skip reading a single word if you want to have any clue as to what is going on, because in just a single sentence, the plot will shift hugely and the reader will be left confused. I was, anyway. Even a seven year old should be able to predict the end right from the beginning- there are no surprises to this book, besides the conspicous lack of attention to details and the poor writing. Another thought for you to consider- since the ending is so completely obvious to just about everyone, is it really necessary to use foreshadowing to \\"tempt\\" us toward the conclusion?5)Problem-solving. How does Ged solve every problem that he faces? With magic, of course. Magic that we never see him learn. It always does seem convenient to have a main character who is a wizard, because it's no longer necessary to actually figure out how things get solved- just write \\"Ged waved his hand a bit and all the bad things went away.\\"6) Useless information packed into the corners. It's often good to have information about the character aside from what is absolutely required to keep the story going. In this case, the author WAY overdoes this. Example: He finds an otak somewhere, who then follows him around. Nevermind that it was specifically mentioned that otaks DON'T like people. But it did anyway, because Le Guin wanted Ged to have some worthless, helpless little creature randomly decide to follow him around so it could lick his face later on in the book and wake him up, even though there was no reason for a lick to have done that.Overall, I say read this book if you want to, since a ton of people seemed to like it, but my personal opinion is that it is one of the most pointless books I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A lot of people (usually the sort of techies that read sci-fi to jerk-off over descriptions of gadgets-mankind-has-never-seen-before) totally mis-understand this book. A lot of very young children who are asked to read under the misconception that it is for them, get confused. You'll find reviews from both sorts on this web-page.The reason is that this is an allegory of emotional life. Ged is a fallible hero who has done something wrong and goes out to try and redeem himself. It's about adolescence and discovering your power and how to apply it to society. It's full of little gems of wisdom like the Arch-mage who dies quietly,going slowly down the road to the land of the Dead, as one who is familiar with that road. Wise men have faced death and have come to understand it.People who have not lived do not understand this book. It is not really fantasy at all, but about a human being's emotional life. Not surprisingly it does not appeal to those who do not know how to live.Unlike the simplicistic (racist, class conscious) plot of Tolkien, this book actually gives you something lasting to apply to life. And don't be put off-it does have odd moments of supreme drama. It develops at the pace that life develops for most of us fast and exciting at puberty / adolescence, quieter echoes later on. And it manages all this in a tiny slim paperback. Tell that to Tolkien.The film-maker Powell/ Pressburger of A Matter of Life &amp; Death fame (another superbly crafted allegory) wanted to make the film. Maybe this detail will afford an inroad to understanding to all those techies who couldn't find a logical, step by step plot that poked two fingers up their nostrils and dragged them thru the book?This review is of the first book only."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Maybe I'm biased against this book because I was required to read it for school, but most of the other books we have read I have loved. This one just annoyed me. It seemed like when you read it there were always certain parts in the book that just didn't need to be there. Filler. If I had taken out all the filler in this book, it would have been at least half as thick. Maybe I'm just not into these kinds of books (although I like most books no matter what they're about), but I found it hard to focus on because of all the unnecessary information, and kind of boring. I personally do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I (12 year old...just above average person) found this book quite challenging and difficult...I didn't understand it but there was some bits that I did understand! the bits I understood where pretty good (they were battle scenes)...only read this book if you are really desperate!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"For those who don't know already: This book is the literary description of some important part of C.G.Jung's psychology: get to know (your own) shadow, the dark side. Fight it, struggle with it, find out that you can't run away from it and ultimately accept it as part of your-self and thus grow and develop with it. I wonder how much the author knew about Jung.Nevertheless, if it comes to fantasy, i prefer Tolkien. He is more skilfull in describing all the details necessary for developing a whole world of its own. Some 200 pages are just not enough for that. Still there are a few sparks of wisdom to be found.a few quotes: Chapter 5 - \\"...From that time forth he believed that the wise man is one who never sets himself apart from other living things, whether they have speech or not, and in later years he strove long to learn what can be learned, in silence, from the eyes of animals, the flight of birds, the great slow gestures of trees.\\" / \\"...Master Herbal had taught him much of the healer's lore, and the first lesson and the last of all that lore as this: Heal the wound and cure the illness, but let the dying spirit go.\\"Chapter 4 - \\"...And the truth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do...\\""},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is no Lord of the Rings!!!!

I came here to review the book, which I give four stars. Very original, very creative.I was however disturbed at the comments made by \\"R. M. Fisher \\"Ravenna\\" \\" praising the books inhabitants for being non white. While this is certainly not a problem, I find it disturbing, that this person is disturbed that the majority of fantasy features Caucasians in main roles. Fantasy, at least the Kind portrayed in Tolkien's work and in Earth seas work, as well as a majority of the fantasy genre are based upon the archetypes of the European folk soul. Much fantasy is a celebration of Caucasian indigenous roots. Our way before Christianity. Our spiritual path before our conversion. Much fantasy allows us to celebrate this lost, but somewhat returning past. Le Guinn has written a good book in which her characters are not Celtic types (even though the universe is based upon the Celtic peoples) and this should not be a major issue. However it should also not be an issue, that most fantasy celebrates European culture, and therefore casts Europeans in its main roles. Would the author also be upset after reading an entire corpus of Arabian Jinn tales, and go on to mention that it is disturbing that all the main characters were Brown ? I doubt it. Europeans are quite allowed to write books about their past and heritage, and they should not be chastised for that, just as any other race would not be chastised for celebrating its roots with fiction. Celebrate your roots, whether you be black, brown, yellow, red or even *Gasp* white.All and all a great book. Good for kids as its easy to read. I read it for the first time almost 10 years ago. Avoid the film if you are looking for an exact conversion, but its still fun (as long as the look of white people don't offend you)"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read the first chapter of this book and I thought, \\"Wow! This is really going to be a great book\\". I was wrong. The first chapter of the book was exciting, well described and emotional. However, the rest of the book was a steady decline from there.In the middle of the book there is an encounter with a dragon. However, it's glossed over and much of the detail is left out. A lot of detail is given in sailing from this island to that island. Personally, I would like to gloss over all the sailing and spend more time on the conflict with the dragon and the final conflict at the end."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"One of the basic tenets of writing good fiction is \\"show me, don't tell me.\\" An example: Tell - \\"Ged didn't like Jasper.\\" Show - \\"Ged felt a strong urge to punch Jasper right in his sniveling little face every time he looked at him. Every snide remark, every condescending look, increased the power of that urge.\\"Both of those examples convey that Ged didn't like Jasper, but which one brings you into the story and adds character development? That's the problem with the author's writing--pages and pages of narration. Too much telling and not enough showing. It makes the pace of the book very fast, which is nice, but it feels like watching a movie with the fast forward button pressed--you get the basic idea of what's going on, but none of the finer details. That's how reading this book feels."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The story is slow and plodding. Granted, it was written for teens, but it felt as if someone where reciting a parable instead of telling a story. The ending was not engaging (like much of the book) nor was it much of a surprise. There is supposed to be some sort of environmental message. If so, it's a weak one.I give it two stars as I am a big fan of this genre, so I don't write it off as a complete waste of time. This is certainly not Le Guin's best work. The Lathe of Heaven was much better."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I know some have raved about how great this book is.

It takes forever to get started, and I really didn't like the main character (and he had too many names to keep track of). But Le Guin's writing is beautiful to read, so I kept at it, and the story improved steadily. You can see where JK Rowling got the idea for Harry Potter--straight from this book. The magic is very well defined and limited (a must for fantasy/magic). The tension in the was tight--when it happened finally--and there was a sound message with subtle symbolism (the yew tree and yew staff) below the surface in a Tolkien way--often missing in contemporary fantasy.This is a must-have for any library, it only misses the fifth star because it failed to hook me into reading it straight through."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The book tries hard to be something of a Lord of the Rings story, but it rarely succeeds. We are quickly told about Ged and in the first few chapters he has lived about 4 years of his life, we rarely get a second to breathe or really know anyone, but Ged. And we hardly understand him either. It is quite a tedious read and uninteresting from this perspective. There are a few attempts (well, quite a lot actually) to capture the reader's attention, but unfortunately that is just what they are, attempts. This book isn't awful, but it is just like any other Fantasy book or Trilogy and doesn't stand out like Tolkein or Rowling's books. Read it if you like, but I would reccomend something with a deeper storyline, more colorful and dynamic characters, and events that keep the reader's attention and entertains them. This book doesn't do that."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea books are hailed by many as an outstanding example of the fantasy genre. I am personally going to withhold judgment on that until I have had the opportunity to read the other two books in the original trilogy because while I enjoyed A Wizard of Earthsea I felt that there were some things missing that could have made it a much better book. My hope is that those missing pieces will be filled in by The Tombs of Atuan and The Farthest Shore and that together the three books will make one outstanding tale.My first thought upon finishing A Wizard of Earthsea was, \\"That's it?\\" I really felt that it was far too short. I enjoyed the story a lot, but it seemed as though I was just getting into it and things were really just beginning to happen when all of a sudden things were being wrapped up and before I knew it, the book was done.One thing I would like to have read about is more of the magic theory of the world. There was lots of talk about classes in magic, but nothing that gave me a glimpse into how the magic really worked. There were enough different branches and classes to imply that there is a magic theory, but it was never elaborated upon. I would also have liked to know what differentiated the wizards from the sorcerers. I know that they touched on it in the book, but I never truly understood the difference. That is definitely one thing that I hope will be expounded upon in the later books.Actually, I hope just about everything, including characterization, will be expounded upon in the later books. Like just about everything else in A Wizard of Earthsea, I felt that there was a good start on characterization, but that it could and should have gone a little farther for it to be truly complete. The only character I felt that I knew at all well was Ged, but there were a few, like Vetch and Ogion, who I felt as though I should have known better than I did, because they were important to Ged. In addition, I felt that the squabbles Ged had with some people would perhaps have had more meaning if I had known more about the people involved.The only thing that I didn't really like about A Wizard of Earthsea was was Ged's reaction to what I thought should have been a traumatic event. I felt as though the whole incident was rather pointless because it didn't really affect Ged at all. He didn't really mourn as far as I can tell, and though it was mentioned that he was upset, I didn't see any signs of Ged being more than somewhat disappointed. Perhaps that was due to the fact that I didn't know him as well as I would have liked, but it did seem odd that I was more upset than Ged was.Other than that, however, I found A Wizard of Earthsea to be a very enjoyable book. I wished that it was longer and that there was more to it, but that was because I was enjoying the book.

Deeper and more introspective than Tolkein's albeit unassailable 'Lord of the Rings', the characters here are alternately frail and strong, struggling with their humanity, both chained and enriched by their mastery (or lack) of sorcery.

There is a sense to magic, and Ursala gives a scientific meaning to it. It is very interesting and deep, what I mean by that is there is a whole meaning to the word Magic. She explains everything precisly and clear, which makes you wish you could zoom into the book and become a wizard, because it is not about being tadaa! a wizard and you learn spells and stuff, there is history behind it, and science. I recommend this book to 10 and up, (even though Amazon.com puts Young Adult) because I'm ten and I understoood it well...mothers who don't know what to buy for their fantasy lover daughter and son, buy this!

LeGuin, was when I read Legends, and there was this short story called Dragonfly. That made me want to read more by LeGuin, and I got A Wizard Of Earthsea, and then I was hooked.The Book is the story about Ged, whose usename is Sparrowhawk, a young man, and it tells the story about Ged's quest for being a Mage first, in that how he unleashes a thing of great evil, and the rest of the book is about his quest for stopping that thing.A very great book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"but definitely not as good as Tolkien, Patricia McKillip, or Susan Cooper"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Here is a book where I can recognize the literary excellence, the sparse but aesthetic prose, and the overall quality of the story but totally reject the worldview presented. LeGuin's world is one where magic operates in the occultic sense. Her fantasy writings are often grouped with the works of Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, and while it is true that they are all \\"fantasy\\" writings, whereas Tolkien and Lewis were writing from a Christian worldview, LeGuin is writing from a decidedly pagan one. What she means by \\"wizard\\" and what Tolkien means by \\"wizard,\\" for example, are as different as night from day. The story itself, however, is top-notch. The \\"Wizard of Earthsea\\" of the title is an extremely flawed and self-conflicted character. In the end you find that the major plotline essentially boils down to a great struggle the protagonist has between the different parts of his nature. I always thought that the endless glut of fantasy novels that have been churned out over the past half-century owe their existence to the popularity and influence of Tolkien. I see now that this is partly true, but much of their existence is owed to LeGuin as well. This is unfortunate. If modern Christianity had a writer of speculative fiction who could produce works as potent and popular as those of Lewis and Tolkien, it would help to counteract the pagan influence of modern fantasy novels, most of which follow LeGuin instead of Tolkien in this regard."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Le Guin has written one of my favorite short stories, \\"The Ones who Walked Away from Omelas\\", and I picked up this book hoping her experimental narratives and beautiful world creation would translate well into novel form.Long story short, they did - but other more novelistic elements came somewhat more sketchy. The book's main character, Ged, sometimes seems as faceless as the horrors he confronts - he simply doesn't have much personality, even though the third-person narrator seems to be lodged near the back of his mind. His emotions are real, his development as a human being is real, but he never seems to conjure up any sort of lasting, memorable personality. None of the characters excel very much, from Ged's master to his kind-of sort-of love interest, except for maybe his best friend. Don't be expecting the likes of Frodo, Aragorn, or Gandalf from Earthsea.However, the world is brilliant, and as a high fantasy adventure it certainly captivates. The system of magic Le Guin creates for her universe is intuitive and frightening - everything has a very, very real price, and the best mages are those who scarcely use magic. The beasts, from island-sized dragons to lovable (if violent) dog-rat familiars, are exemplary and the world they inhabit lives and breathes with them.This book is worth reading, definitely - but it could be better. The ending alone makes it a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Reading the Earthsea Trilogy was one of the highlights of my childhood. Discovering that it had become the Earthsea Quartet and now Quintet is one of the highlights of life today. Why it's still being featured as a trilogy when there are two further books to be read, I don't understand!Le Guin is the daughter of anthropologists and through all her fiction there is a deep, ingrained understanding of societies work and how they are built and evolve (or disintegrate). It's very interesting to see how her own interests have matured and deepened over the decades of writing this series - the latest Earthsea Title - The Other Wind is a fabulous rendition of concerns about gender/sexism/prejudice and the very nature of things. BUT that's for the grown ups, what really matters is that underneath all her incisive intelligence Ursula Le Guin tells a gripping, exciting and devastating series of stories that come at one in a rush of tight telling and delicately realised plots. She is simply one of the greatest writers for older children - or anyone! So start with the Wizard himself, then read on and on...."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I have say I was not so impressed with A Wizard of Earthsea. Reading the editors' reviews of the book on Amazon, they compare it glowingly to Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, but I just don't see it. Granted this is only the first book, and I will likely read the second, but it certainly was not the caliber of Tolkien. The book is rather choppy and written in a sort of third person narrative that gets annoying after time. I also felt the plot and writing were rather immature. This was one of Le Guin's early works, but it still needed a good editor. I can see, however, why The SciFi Channel has opted to make it into a mini-series, the story is simple high fantasy -- nothing too difficult, nothing too mind boggling. It will probably do well."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Granted, this is only my personal opinion, but here it is: this book is amazing. IF you read it with an open mind, that is. I read it not knowing what to expect, and I would recommend you do the same. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is not a thrilling, by-the-seat-of-your-pants, entertaining novel in a Harry Potter sense, so don't expect it to be. This doesn't mean it won't be a thoroughly enjoyable read, however. It's archetypal, it's philosophical, it's profound, it's timeless; it will make you think about good and evil, failure and success, and the powers we have as individuals in a vast, [mostly] empty universe.I think the best way to describe the novel in general is \\"mythological,\\" for if you observe take into account the plot, characters, setting and history found in the book, you'll notice that the story as a whole resembles many tales of heroic figures from various mythologies. Also, if you've ever studied Zen, I think you'll enjoy it :)So, in summary, don't expect a lot of description about the characters' histories, physical appearances or the setting, for they're not central to the story. LeGuin knows we, the readers, don't need explicit details about the hero's history or appearance to understand the novel - we've met \\"the hero\\" hundreds of times, in every novel we've ever read, and I think she'd rather leave it up to our imaginations.No, the center of the story is the philosophy, the explanation of which I'll leave to the author."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is the first in a series of books.

Le Guin has written one of the greatest stories in fantasy literature. As the first book of the Earthsea cycle, A Wizard of Earthsea has such imagery that pulled me into the the imaginary world of dragons, wizards, and the balance between good and evil. I thought that this book would be the same as the Harry Potter books, but with a twist of the Middle Ages, I was excited to find out where the story would lead.The main characters had so much tension that you can understand what they were feeling. For example, when Ged was being criticized by Jasper that he was better than Ged, He wanted so much to embarrass Jasper in front of everyone by beating him in a duel. As the tension between them got darker, Ged would not resist any longer and do the unthinkable thing to strengthen his reputation and put the world in chaos.Ursula K. Le Guin tells a story of a young man who finds himself by learning from his mistakes and how he mastered the powerful words of sorcery, tamed an ancient dragon, and restores the balance of good and evil by putting his life on the line.A young man named Sparrowhawk would be known as Ged, the greatest sorcerer in all of Earthsea, but until the then he is a troubled young man who was anxious for power and knowledge. He meddled with forbidden secrets and set loose a terrible shadow upon the world of Earthsea. Now he must face the consequences and learn the most valuable thing in being a great wizard.I would recommend anyone who likes a magnificent sci-fi fantasy, to read this first book of the Earthsea Cycle and the next three books of the Earthsea Cycle."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin occupies an unusual place in the world of science fiction and fantasy largely because she refuses to do what is expected in the genre. Where fantasy is defined largely by the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, which involves grand battles, mighty wizards, and vast armies contesting matters of simplistic good vs. evil, Le Guin constructs her fantasy world around shades of gray, around the complexity in single individuals. The result is work that reaches outside the genre even as it alienates some within.\\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is such a book. Ged defies the stereotypical Gandalf-type wizard in that he is young and foolish, his wisdom not appearing at the beginning of the story but growing through it, much as wisdom in real people does. He can fight great monsters, and he does, but this story is about the monster within, about the dark side found in each of us. Le Guin brings this to life through magic and faces her protagonist with a choice that we each, at some point in our lives, must face: will darkness consume me?The result is a work quite unlike anything else in fantasy. Like all great writers, Le Guin does more than tell a story. She makes you think as you read, challenging your easy assumptions, using the unreal world of myth to illuminate the real world of now. If the ethical simplicity of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Harry Potter\\" leaves you unsatisfied, come to Earthsea and discover yourself, shadow and all."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The Wizard of EarthSea, the first of a trilogy by Ursula K. LeGuin, is the compelling and fantastic story of a wizard in the making.Fun reading for all ages!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"In A Wizard of Earthsea, Ursula LeGuin creates a high-fantasy story that has these strengths:--accessible to young readers--a hero whose pride is his downfall and whose downfall is his salvation--a sense that love, power, and justice will conquer in the end--an appreciation of the power of names--wise and clever characters like Ogion and the Doorkeeper--an interesting island-based world and possibly the first fictional \\"school of magic\\"Off-setting these strengths are these weaknesses:--a phony high-English tone that doesn't belong to a writer from Portland, Oregon and makes it very difficult for me to read the first three books in the series (esp. this one)--a partriarchal power system that LeGuin doesn't even consider questioning until the fourth book, Tehanu--a flaw in the basic plot: ambiguity about what the evil force really is that the hero is struggling with--an ambiguity that gets cloudier the more one thinks about it after finishing the book.In spite of these flaws, I would recommend The Earthsea series to readers of all ages, esp. the Tombs of Atuan and my personal favorite, Tehanu. It is necessary to read all the books to appreciate the later ones."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The most negative thing I can say is that this book isn't for everyone. It's different. A reader expecting a Tolkien photocopy will be disappointed - but a reader looking for serious fantasy won't.Pluses: Dynamic, structured magic. This is one of those rare books where magic actually rules, instead of brute might as is especially common in FANTASY. The plotting is what I'd call lean, but hardly rushed. The world of Earthsea is stunning and believable at the same time, mainly because of the speed(and care) with which Le Guin establishes individual islands and people. This book has characters, not clones. Another particularly good thing is that the main conflict never stretches too high, trying too hard to be epic and dramatic; rather, the story is down-to-earth. Ged is especially meaningful and the scale of the story supports him well.Overall, everything fits together. The characters, places, events and magic are meshed as only Ursula Le Guin seems to know how. This book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula LeGuin writes with style and wonderful imagination. A Wizard for Earthsea is a wonderful coming of age story that presents a lot of very wonderful lessons in personal growth and maturation without losing the core of being a story.LeGuin's Ged is a well thought out main character who's existence and eventual life story are extremely well developed. His early beginnings are well founded in actual conditions that set a tone of realism in the book. This is especially important because LeGuin writes more than just this book.I enjoyed the philosophical points that she makes in pointing out some of the flaws(pride, vanity, overconfidence) that are so common among adolescents and can lead to some very real problems. The development and personal growth of the main character is not so sudden that it becomes unrealistic. This is, to me, a part of what makes her writing very special."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A wonderfully written tale that is enjoyable at many levels. It is highly readable, flows well and has some profound lessons about human nature, death, good, evil, etc. LeGuin's choice of names leaves something to be desired (i.e., Ged, Vetch and Jasper) and the characters are not developed as fully as one might expect.

Not many stories do that, and sometimes the ones that do don't do it realistically.The story was really good as well. There was always something to look forward to and you always wanted to know where it would lead. The writing was great in my opinion, sometime Ursula went off on tangents that I found incredibly boring, but when she stuck to her story and didn't try to do. . . whatever you want to call it (boring prose?). . . then it was great.

Ged is a character who really resonates with me for some reason I haven't quite completely pinned down yet (nor do I particularly want to). The narrative is taught and inviting, giving just enough world building and dialog to bring the story to life, but never feeling tedious. I am amazed with every reading at how rich of a story this is for barely being over 200 pages. Le Guin is a truly gifted writer.

So I reread the original trilogy and I've started on the newer ones. They are still powerful, wonderful stories, and they only get better: the latter books are more mature and even more powerful, and LeGuin's skills in description and characterization have improved as well.There is an omnibus edition that includes the first four books under one cover, and I would recommend it over this edition, both for savings in cost, and because the omnibus has fewer typos."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book may have had a good moral but I think it couldv'e turned out a lot better if it wasn't so borring.

Perhaps it would have been more persuasive read by a woman or a more juvenile voice."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A Wizard of Earthsea was a confusing read. This particular book was filled with many examples of courage and bravery. Ursula Le Guin used a creative mind when writing this book. Her amin charcter Ged was based on one with courage. Ursula Le Guin used this character to show a brillant example of bravery. This book showed how one faced their fear head on no matter what the consequences. Ged faced fear and uncertainty in its face.Although I did enjoy this book and it was relatively short in read, I did find fault in Le Guin's use of names for her mystical places. I found it hard to focus or keep the names straight. The names were a little diffcult to comprehend and to remember which place was associated with the charcters. I do understand that the names of her places bring a sense of fantasy and mystery to the book, whereas the reader is pondering whether these places actually existed but again the titles of these places I found hard to remember.I do give credit to Le Guin when it comes to her writing. She expressed herself and her ideal of bravery/courage by getting straight to the point. She did not let the story linger or draw it out which is good in some instances due to the fact taht some storyines you like for it to linger and take it's time to get to the point and you want it to take its time (e.g. romance novels.)She got straight to the point and showed her example of what it means to have courage and be brave whatever the cost. I would recommend this book to other readers especially high school students who could always use an example of what is means to be courageous and brave."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"After reading a lot of second rate books I hope Earthsea would be a whole new look on fantasy. It still came out a disappointment, the book is written a little to childish for me. Therefore I am disgusted now when people compare Orsula K. Le-Guin to J.R.R Tolkien, Robert Jordan or George R.R. Martin. Tolkien's, Jordan's and Martin's greatness strength's are detailed stories and worlds. Le-Guin's skills are stuck at a childish level in this book and not fully developed. (Her only excuse is that she was a women stuck in the 60's, and forced to waste her Sci-Fi talents this way).My opinion might be skewed by the high praise this series got, ( given it was probably earth-shattering when it came out) It got a three because everyone will say &quot;You haven't the series yet?&quot;"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"After being forced to read this book not once, but twice, once for seventh grade English and once for high school English II Honors, my verdict is the same. It is an uncompelling, poorly written waste of ink, paper, and most of all my precious time. Comparisons to Tolkien are entirely undeserved - like comparing Jewel to Bob Dylan. The characters are all unsympathetic, poorly drawn, and distant, the kind of interchangeable, assembly-line sorcerers and kings who inhabit the trashiest of dimestore fantasy novels. The writing and action are muddled and lack fluency - but there is no great contemplation or presentation of ideas to fill in the gaps between what passes here for action. The concepts at hand - the balance of magic, the evil within oneself - could be and have been better expressed. If these are themes you wish to explore, do not attempt to do so by reading this sophomoric, boring folderol. Rent &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and get a truly fine treatment of these themes."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The story begins with a kid called sparrowhawk, but his real name is ged.

I plan to teach in the high school in a couple of years and it really took me a while to get into this book. However, I noticed that Ursula LeGuinn is very descriptive and my goal was to figure out what my students would get out of this book. There are many morals to the story. Ged, the main character, has to find something that makes him who he is. He finds himself through magic and the meaning of his name. This is good, but it can take the reader a while to realize what the story is about. When reading the book in the beginning I thought it to be very boring and didn't see a reason to encourage anyone to read it because I was focused on what was where and how it might have looked. Then an idea suddenly came to me! The idea that I came up with was an art class. Because of the descriptiveness, it would be very interesting to see how students would draw the land of earthsea and the people that live there. I would advise students who are into art and imagination to read this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I seem to be one of the few people who hated this book. I can see how it would make a half-way entertaining children's book, the kind that third graders are forced to read for school, but I can't understand what all the adult reviewers see in A Wizard of Earthsea. There are a hundred things that annoyed me about this book- I'll list a few.1) The names. It seems like a minor thing, but GED?!? I felt sick having to read that name a million times, over and over and over. Earthsea? Wow, imaginative! Not really. All the names of the islands on the little map provided seemed to be random combinations of letters, barely pronouncable and utterly meaningless. I'm not even sure why the islands were named, since only a very few of them are mentioned.2) The language. There actually are places with good description- but very, very few of them... Most of the language that Le Guin uses is dull and boring. Even though the shadow is a main part of the book, she couldn't be bothered to find a single synonym. The result is that the word \\"Shadow\\" is used, on average, about once per page. And these are tiny pages with big writing. Sometimes even if a plot is horrible, I can read and enjoy the book anyway because the descriptions used are interesting and I like the wording used. Not so in this book.3) The characters. Ged is the only character who has any depth whatsoever, and what personality he has is trite and cliched. The other people in the book seem to be there just to move the plot along, without any real effort to make them worthwhile or original.4) The storyline. As a few other people mentioned, the story just hops around. One second Ged is four, then in the next paragraph he's thirteen. You can't skip reading a single word if you want to have any clue as to what is going on, because in just a single sentence, the plot will shift hugely and the reader will be left confused. I was, anyway. Even a seven year old should be able to predict the end right from the beginning- there are no surprises to this book, besides the conspicous lack of attention to details and the poor writing. Another thought for you to consider- since the ending is so completely obvious to just about everyone, is it really necessary to use foreshadowing to \\"tempt\\" us toward the conclusion?5)Problem-solving. How does Ged solve every problem that he faces? With magic, of course. Magic that we never see him learn. It always does seem convenient to have a main character who is a wizard, because it's no longer necessary to actually figure out how things get solved- just write \\"Ged waved his hand a bit and all the bad things went away.\\"6) Useless information packed into the corners. It's often good to have information about the character aside from what is absolutely required to keep the story going. In this case, the author WAY overdoes this. Example: He finds an otak somewhere, who then follows him around. Nevermind that it was specifically mentioned that otaks DON'T like people. But it did anyway, because Le Guin wanted Ged to have some worthless, helpless little creature randomly decide to follow him around so it could lick his face later on in the book and wake him up, even though there was no reason for a lick to have done that.Overall, I say read this book if you want to, since a ton of people seemed to like it, but my personal opinion is that it is one of the most pointless books I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The book is about a kid who becomes a wizard. Anti climatic from beginning to end. He is bullied and mocked, ends anticlimactically. He is tasked with dispatching a massive old dragon and its spawn, ends anticlimactically. He unleashes an evil on the world, spends half the book trying to bottle it up, ends anticlimactically. The character is not self absorbed, the story about him is. There is nothing epic about this story in the least, it could have been a biography about a kid who grows up to become an architect, and its about as interesting as that."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is a fun story for the younger crowd to enjoy (8 years and up). There is good character development in this story of a young boy growing up that sweeps you into the high adventure of wizards and magic and dragons that is sure to keep one riveted to this page turner."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This being my first Ursula LeGuin book, I wanted to finally understand the mystique surrounding this Portland based (according to her 1968 bio) author. Any friend of Portland, Oregon is a friend of mine. At first, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a little slow going. Beginning the book I was overeager, unfortunately, to lump LeGuin into that much scoffed at group of Tolkein wannabees. Here we had all the makings of a different world with the usual cadre of Anglo-European mythological people and creatures. LeGuin's talent isn't a sparkling wit or a magnificent explosion of plot. But it has a slow burn that ever so gradually makes it so that the reader cannot help but want to know more. Reading further, I found that my Tolkein based assumption was farther off the mark than I'd anticipated. Here we have a world where magic is almost a science. Unlike Harry Potter or Gandolph, when Ged (the hero of this tale) weaves a spell it requires making calculations, assumptions, and particulars about the objects he enchants. He must know the names of the objects he is influencing. In many ways, the spells in this book are like long written thesis. They require research and patience. The people also have some significant differences from those found in other tales as well. For one thing, they're not all white. Remember all the black people in the Lord of the Rings saga? No? How about Dean Thomas from Harry Potter (a character that in the original British editions was never declared black)? With few exceptions (Nancy Farmer being the greatest exception of them all) the world of fantasy is white white white. Unless of course you count the horridly stereotyped cannibals in Edward Eagar and E. Nesbit's fantasies, of course. But what was never made fully clear to me until now is that the protagonist of \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is not white. Nor is his companion, Vetch. Nor, to be honest, most of the characters in the book. No big show is made of this fact. LeGuin is too much the lady to ever say loudly, \\"Hey look! I wrote a book in 1968 about a wizard that isn't white and I never made a big deal about it!\\" But it's true.Now, admittedly there is a significant lack of one particular group in this book. Women. If women in \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" have the ability to work their own brand of magic they're either labeled witches or evil sorceresses. And this from a female author? So I cannot wholeheartedly give it five stars. Just the same, on the whole this book deserves its praise (a fact that fills me with amazement). For someone who was fully ready to mock and downplay the book's achievements, I say here and now that it is worth reading by anyone who thinks they have some sort of a grasp on the kiddie lit fantasy scene. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is the first one of the books I've read by this aurther. And It's not a dissapointment.

I read this book in English last year and found the plot very hard to follow. This was not only my opinion, but the opinion of 30 other students. This book is definately not a page turner. I would only recommend this book to those of you who have very open imaginations, LOVE fantasy, and have the time to sit down and carefully read this book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"While not as detailed or as ornate as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, LeGuin's Earthsea Cycle is considered among the finest of the Sword and Sorcery classics. A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA is the first book in the Cycle.Ged, a young adolescent, is taken as apprentice by Ogion the Mage shortly after Ged's magical abilities manifest themselves. A difficult, awkward, vain but brilliant student, Ged is soon sent to the School For Wizards on Roke Island, where he summons up a spirit from the Dead on a bet. Due to his foolish and destructive motives, an evil shadow enters the world through the doorway Ged has created. Dedicated to undoing his evil act, Ged's quest becomes one to somehow find the shadow and master it.Despite a very weak plotline that wanders from its path as far as does Ged, LeGuin's characters are memorable, and many of the scenes in A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA are enthralling, even though LeGuin spends too little time developing the historical and mythological backstories of Earthsea, and is sloppy with her invented language, Hardic. These flaws weaken the Cycle and keep it from the true greatness evident in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Katharine Kerr."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Before I start, I have to admit that my review of this book is sort of biased because I usually would not read literature that deals with fantasy and as you probably guessed, I did not like the book. I will, nonetheless, attempt at giving a fair review.The book is about a young man named Ged, who is known as Sparrowhawk to the rest of the world, and his journey to become a grand wizard as well as a learned man who knows how to conquer his fear. The journey is a worthwhile read for the message that it gives but, at the same time, the plot is long and drawn-out. My last thoughts were, \\"I'm sure the author could have found another way of getting the message of conquering fear across to her readers.\\" Once again, though, I must say that my statement may be biased. Looking back at the events that took place in the book, I don't believe that any one was insignificant. Every event in some way brought the protagonist closer to the story's final message. The plot may have seemed long and drawn-out to me because I am not accustomed to reading this genre of literature and, of course, every event in a fantastic story is going to seem far-fetched which is a quality that I do not look for in the novels that I choose.So, I will conclude by saying that I would only recommend this book to lovers of fantasy literature. Otherwise, readers are in for a long, tiresome ride."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The Wizard of Earthsea was hardly the book of excitement I expected it to be. Ursula K. Le Guin follows the life of a young wizard Ged, as he learns to cope with the responsibilities of being a wizard. The story manages to simultaneously fly through the first nineteen years of his life and drag on. Many of the characters and adventures Ged encounters last no more than a few pages and hold little, if any, bearing in the story as a whole.The beginning of the story seems to lag as we wait tofind out what exactly Ged's great adventure will be. When he finally finds it, there is still some confusion as to what \\"it\\" is. It does pick up a bit from here, and the reader can get more involved in the story. However, then Ged is off on another adventure and the one the reader was interested in is pretty much lost.The end was unfortunately predictable, though I was not disappointed by it personally. It seemed that is was the only real way to end it. The final showdown does prove to be a satisfying read and I finally found some of the excitement and magic I had anticipated. Whether it makes up for the rest of the book, I am unsure, but it does open the possibility of a more successful second and third book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is the first volume in the Earthsea quartet (followed by The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore and Tehanu).After his mother's death, young Ged gets to live with his father, a smith, and his aunt the village witch, who teaches him some minor spells, such as commanding to animals, until one day he uses this magic to save the village from barbaric invaders.Impressed by the boy's potential powers, the mage Ogion takes him as apprentice. But as the days go by, Ged becomes bored and when the choice is offered him, he decides to go to the wizards school of Roke. There he meets with two other scholars: Vetch who'll soon become his friend, and the arrogant Jasper who always looks down on him, and who'll become his rival.And after several months spent in the school, with hatred steadily growing between them, Ged one day challenges Jasper in a magic duel. And as Ged, in a surge of immoderate pride, is trying to wake the dead, he accidentally unleashes an evil shadow, also almost managing to get himself killed in the process. The story goes on to describe Ged perpetual flight from his shadow.Ursula LeGuin's style is elaborate and poetic, but maybe a little bit too much, too old-fashioned, for my liking. As a result, the novel somehow failed to fascinate me, and in the end I realized I didn't care much about what happened to the characters. I'll read the rest of the quartet anyway, in hope it gets more gripping."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I picked up this book when I had nothing else to read. My mom had read it ages ago,when she was really into fantasy and reccomended it to me. I could not put it down.It was complex,magical,and at many points exciting.Le Guin developed and amazing culture ,yet she did not go too far ,like other authors (David Eddings). I adored how Le Guin put an anti-racist thing in,very slyly.The Kargs ,had pale skin,and a good deal of Earthsea didn't(the Kargs are \\"evil\\").This book made simple classes of wizardry ,which in most books would be amazingly boring,was extremely interesting.Most of the boring parts were when the character was bored,not when you for some reason were supposed to be interested. I have to say ,besides Ged,my favorite character was the otak.So cute ,yet so loyal.Le Guin can make little things wonderful. Alright,I suppose I'll need to go to the plot now.Ged ,a young sheephearder on the island called Gont,discovers that he is a wizard.He is sent to the Isle of Roke to train.Soon he becomes powerful,but while trying to summon a dead spirit ,he unleashes a shadow upon Earthsea.That Shadow is after him."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I tried and failed to read this book a couple of times in my teens, but over a decade later I recently picked it up again and it charmed me. Your typical swords and sorcery this is not, so skip this book and its sequels if you're looking for another Tolkien clone. Le Guin is as original a sci-fi/fantasy author as you can find, and A Wizard of Earthsea is pioneering fantasy. Le Guin has a background in anthropology, and it shows here: A Wizard of Earthsea succeeds best in subtle characterization and gently sculpting the fantasy setting: an island archipelago whose mythology and mysteries are sparsely described but nonetheless captivating. The book will give you many original and refreshing delights: the practice of magic is more about learning the true names of things than memorizing incantations, death is a traversible landscape, and dragons are the true masters of the ancient language of magic, which binds ordinary mortals to truth. Read the series with an open mind and you will find ample rewards."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"In a genre dominated by 800+ page tomes, the Earthsea books are a refreshing and delightful change. Ursula Le Guin is a master of flowing, lyrical prose. Each book is relatively brief, but chock full of all the elements that are required for a great fantasy story. She accomplishes this feat by keeping things simple and uncluttered. She doesn't need an appendix to list all the characters and their relation to one another. Her world is well-realized, her characters well-fleshed out, and the story captures you from the first pages. Take a break from the massive tales of Jordan and Martin et al. (not that there's anything wrong with them) and read an author whose writing is as magical as her story."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"If I could give this series 10 or 20 stars I would. These books are dense, rich and beg to be read and re-read. I first read these books in my 20's; many years later, I still become engrossed in the wonderful imagery. Ms. LeGuin is the BEST writer I have ever encountered who can write with a 'sense of place' that makes you know that the book's world indeed does exist, and boy do you wish you could visit.I had trouble reading the Harry Potter books. They are boring and juvenile compared to this award-winning series. I can't understand the hoopla surrounding the Potter books when this series is a magnitude better. I'll bet people in their 40's will not be re-reading the Potter books. They will re-read again and again this superb series.My only complaint is that there aren't another dozen of books in this series.A stunning accomplishment from a truly gifted author."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"In the book, A Wizard of Earthsea, you encounter a wild young man named Ged. His mother died when he was born, his father has no use for a baby that can do no work, and his aunt merely looked after him until he could fend for himself. Ged has no family support and no friends. He is looking for acceptance and he finally finds a way to gain some form of respect when his aunt, the local witch, recognizes his natural talent for magic. From that point on, Ged has found the path that he must take in life. That path finally brings Ged to the doors of the School of Roke and into the company of real friendship.Magic was Ged's deliverance from his small little town, it was his means of saving his townspeople, but it also has a darker side. Ged glimpsed this dark magic once while under the tutelage of the great mage of Ogion, and while at the School for Wizards, he gets a horrifying view of it that nearly takes his life. Due to his proud, boastful nature, Ged accidentally looses a dark demon into his world and the balance is not offset and a great man dies in order to save him. Everyone can see that there is a great powerfully potential in Ged, but he, so starved for acceptance, is careless. Now that he has disrupted the balance of the world, he has to live up to his potential, temper it with wisdom, and right what he has set wrong. The demon Ged let loose will eventually seek him out to destroy him and Ged must be equal for the fight.This book depicts Ged as an imperfect hero. He is greatness within him, but he does not know how to manage it. The events in his life have molded him into an impetuous child that answers to no one. Ged had no guidance as a child. No one paid him any attention until he saved the town with his spells. He led a life not necessarily in the shadows, but one of invisibility until someone saw him. Ged, like any other child, wanted to be noticed. He wanted to be a part of something. The only chance that he had was to become a wizard for with that title comes the respect and acceptance that he yearns for. In order to handle this responsibility, Ged also had to learn humility. He had to understand that greatness does not come solely from sheer skill. It is a delicate balance between skill and an ongoing search for and acquiring of wisdom."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The Earthsea series is one of the greatest works of high fantasy, and A Wizard of Esrthsea is a good start to the series.

Her interaction between the characters is interesting and at times inspiring. I particularly enjoyed the conversation between Ged and the Master Summoner, where the Master tells him, &#34;You thought, as a boy, that a mage is one who can do anything. So I thought once.

Le Guin's A Wizard Of Earthsea, the first book in her long standing Earthsea Trilogy, is the spiritual grandparent of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This story, about a boy training at a school for wizards who will one day go on to become the greatest wizard of his age, seems like a more adult version of Rowling's story. Certainly the implications of magic and the responsibility of having such powers are given greater weight in Le Guin's story. Sparrowhawk becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. Later, Sparrowhawk having been sent to a school for wizards, unleashes a terrible apparition of evil during a prideful contest with another student. His quest to destroy the apparition makes for a compelling right of passage story.Preston McClear..."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Storytelling never loses its place at the forefront of this, the first book of the Earthsea Trilogy. This series has always been one of my favorites ever since I read it. Ms. Le Guin creates a believable world with characters that ring true on every page and the way she discusses and develops the importance of language and words in these novels is not only unique but powerful. Please read this series. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"If it hadn't been for the first chapter, I would have given the book 4 stars.In the first chapter, indeed on the first page, the author choses to reveal the entire future history of the main character. I hate that. When I read it, I nearly threw the book across the room; why read it if I know what's going to happen (I know, lots of people don't care, but I'm not one of them)?After the first chapter, though, things get going, and really pick up as the chapters roll by.I give this book good marks for including a map (fairly common for the original publishing period, but something sadly lacking in most modern fantasies; removing a major component of believability).It also has a fabulous magic system. The primary drawback is that the author doesn't go into it broadly enough, despite the main character spending considerable time at a school for wizards.I've read it twice, and consider it to be fairly good."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"It's sad that every work like this has to be held up to Tolkien for comparison; the Earthsea trilogy (excepting, of course, the fourth and much later book) is a great work in its own right. It seems works like this are less popular now, whereas writers like Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan, who've ripped off a good portion of their ideas from older works, are more popular."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book is one of the best in the fantasy genre. Although no match for Tolkien, this series comes close. Anyone who says it is too complex is just to simple."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book may not be a lord of the rings clone, but it delivers. This fantasy is unique. Le Guin creates a believable world and wonderful characters. My only regret was finishing, thirsting for more. Her prose is artful and inspiring. One of the top five sci-fi/fantasy series of all time. Get this book, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"REVIEW From my 11 yr. old son: This was an awesome book with lot's of mystical things.I liked all the magic that young Sparrowhawk got to learn.When he tried to outdo his rival he released the worst thing in the world ,his own arrogance. He went to learn wizardry from the best wizardry school in the world so he could defeat it.This is a world where names are powerful and useful."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"With , maybe , only the Lord of the Rings trilogy to rival it. The Earthsea trilogy creates a world which will envelope you. A great work of literature."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Let it be known; Earthsea stands aside Middle Earth, Narnia, and the other &quot;classic&quot; fantasy worlds with amazing strength.Le Guin weaves a tale in a language that is set in all of our dreams, and tells her tale of good against evil and of the triumph of man over his fears in such a way as to make one think that this is not a story that was written in the 20th century, but rather a story that always was.Modern fantasy lovers beware, this is not your typical swords and sorcery romp. Fans of the Dragonlance and TSR books will miss the cartoon-like action, and fans of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind will miss the endless meandering that dominates so much modern fantasy. Instead, you simply get a tale crafted of magic and wonder. Truly remarkable."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I like fantasies and this was one of the books that I truly liked. The only strange thing that I noticed was that it is in the Earthsea trilogy, which so far I like the rest of the set, but there are four books instead of three. Could anyone explain this to me?"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Yes, there was a time when a fantasy book could end before 200 pages and still tell the whole story. There was a time when a series could be read one volume at a time and the plot was never left hanging on. The Earthsea saga is one of the finest products of that mythic, golden era. This, the first of the four books, is as fine an adventure as you'll ever find, but it's also a deeply philosophical book about life. Le Guin tells us that evil is inside, it can't be slain with ordinary weapons. A gem of a novel, I say."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book was about the best and most interesting book that I ever read. Once I picked it up it was hard to put down."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"My ThoughtsI am restarting my journey of reading the hundreds of books on my bookshelves that I have purchased over the years that I have not made time to read. This book was the start. I have been wanting to read this book for years. I bought it quite some time ago and finally found some time this weekend to give it a read.This book was published in 1968. I was interested to read the book to see how many elements of fantasy have been taken from her work. The book is short being under 200 pages. In the fantasy world it is not uncommon to read a 500+ page book in a long series.I will admit that I struggled at first stay interested in this book. It is all about personal taste. It was not so much about the writing or story line as it had everything I typically like. However, it just did not grab me. I almost felt bad for thinking this way as hundreds of people just rant and rave about how great this series is. I posted at about page 109 on Goodreads.com that I was thinking of putting the book down.I am glad I did not. I decided to finish the book to give it the proper time it deserved. One Ged finally turned himself around and went after his main voyage I became quite interested. I think it was because the journey paralleled the many thoughts and ideas of my personal goals I create for myself. I was able to relate to his mindset. I am actually in the process of applying this novel to some principle of my GETTING IT DONE blog series and book I am writing.I am glad I read this book. Not a favorite of mine, but one that I think deserves to be read by and fantasy fan. I can see why so many would like this book and series. I think many middle grade students would love this story. It is a great stepping stone to the much larger volumes. Despite myself not liking this story as much as I had hoped for, please don't let that deter you from reading. I think many people will really like this story. I guess I need to jump back into the A Song of Fire and Ice series and begin book two to satisfy my cravings."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I started reading A Wizard of Earthsea briefly after finishing the first Twilight book. The drastic shift between writing styles had me staggering for the first two or three hours of reading. I realized that, unlike when I read young adult fiction, I had to pay attention because this book is written as darn near to a history as would still allow it to be interesting and readable.This book is full of rich descriptions and a steady development of the meaning of power and what it is to wield it. I marvel at Leguin's writing and will definitely continue reading this series. 5 stars for a unique, engrossing tale."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The most exquisite book of fantasy ever written. You must have taste to truly appreciate how beautifully told this story is. Elegant and memorable, like a five star meal or a scent of rare perfume, it will linger in your mind for years to come. I first read it as a child, later as a college student, and as an adult I have revisited this novel, each time with renewed pleasure and admiration for the uncluttered beauty of this book. The author mercifully refrained from adding kitsch and characters ad infinitum without thought of future theme park possibilities or products to be placed or plastic replicas to be sold from here to eternity. A truly original tale as well, with nothing borrowed, overused, hackneyed or hijacked from countless cliches found in contemporary fantasy series that leave so little to the imagination. A true treasure."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I had seen the miniseries on SyFy a few years ago when it used to be the SciFi Channel. I enjoyed the miniseries, so I thought I'd like the book. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book was drastically better than the miniseries.Le Guin's writing style is distinctive. In most of the other books I read, dialogue is the main driver of the action. Usually, the formula is: set the stage, provide a lengthy exposition of something that occurs within a brief amount of time, then provide a transition to get to the next lengthy exposition.For example, consider the six Star Wars movies. They each fit into a chronology where a lot of time passes in between each movie, but each one movie concentrates on events that transpire over a few days.Le Guin does the exact opposite. There is amazingly little dialogue in the book, and we rarely get a full conversation. Rather, we get to see important snippets of what's said. Le Guin instead concentrates on the overall story arc of Ged/Sparrowhawk's life. She tells the story as one relating a legend while sitting around a campfire. The words are flowery with plenty of metaphors. With the lack of dialogue and other fillers, the writing is dense, and the pace can be very quick at times. At the blink of an eye, a year or two can pass. Even with only twenty or so pages left to read in the book, I wondered how she could finish the book with so little paper left, but I should not have feared - she ended it well.Le Guin has the talent of describing concepts that otherwise wouldn't make much sense - but somehow she makes sense of it. For example, here's an excerpt of her explaining the strange coldness of the Court of the Terrenon.\\"From these windows Ged looked out, as he kept by himself in his high tower-room, day after day, dull and heartsick and cold. It was always cold in the tower, for all the carpets and the tapestried hangings and the rich furred clothing and the broad marble fireplaces they had. It was a cold that got into the bone, into the marrow, and would not be dislodged. And in Ged's heart a cold shame settled also and would not be dislodged, as he thought always how he had faced his enemy and been defeated and had run. ... And he would watch the snow falling, thin and ceaseless, on the empty lands below the window, and feel the dull cold grow within him, till it seemed no feeling was left to him except a kind of weariness.\\"Doesn't that just give you the shivers? Oh, and did you notice how much time had elapsed in that short passage? It's impossible to know exactly how much time passed, but it certainly feels like a long time. (Okay, now I'm feeling a little depressed.)I recommend this book for anyone seeking a fantastic epic with vignettes that will stick with you for years."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Duny is no ordinary boy. He has a true name, a nickname, and the one given to him at birth. He's a boy shaped around words. In this world words have become very important, especially when it comes to naming. When he leaves for Roke, the magical island renown for its school of magery, it's with youthful fantasies of turning himself into any creature he desires, of changing mundane objects into marvelous ones, and unrealistic ideas of power--with none of responsibility. In the land of Earthsea, names are very powerful; language is the very thing used to harness the world's greatest strengths and manipulate reality the way it was never meant to be.A Wizard of Earthsea (first published in 1968) has the lyrical and romantic command of a legend. It's one of those books I wish I had read as child. I'm sure I would have fallen in love immediately. How could I not? I've already fallen in love. It's adventurous with magic and wonderfully sentient creatures, and a map I found myself placing my finger on to trace the path of Ged's boat. Oh, the map. Earthsea unfurled beneath my fingertips. I could almost feel the mountainous terrain of Gont, the saturated grasses of Roke Knoll, the wintry court of Terrenon. Surprisingly, the map gave a vast scale to a journey that was now measurable by sight as well as description. But description alone would have done the job quite well.Le Guin doesn't seem to waste a phrase. She's mastered her diction and molded a narrative that invites a measured reading. There is no rushing here. The language is poetic; Le Guin's prose lingers long after the book is closed and lifts my mind to the beyond--to worlds we can inhabit only in our dreams and imagination. And what an imagination she has herself--what beautiful writing. Le Guin is at heart a story-teller. She has the type of narrative voice easily read aloud (in fact, I couldn't stop thinking that someone should be reading this to me). There's something organic about her writing, something wonderfully intoxicating that reaches up from the very depths of a tradition that goes further than the printed word.As I read about Ged and his magical quest, finding friends and making enemies along the way, I suddenly found myself feeling as enchanted with the story as I have by only a handful of stories since I was a child. The Hobbit, The Once and Future King, these are books that speak to the soul with some mysterious and intuitive soul language; A Wizard of Earthsea deserves a place of honor next to both. It's as much a coming of age story as it is a tale of a young boy who learns how to test his limits. He develops lasting friendships and comes to understand the darkness deep within himself is tempered only by the light, which he must also recognize.This is a difficult book for me to write about. I don't just want to talk about it, I want to share it with you. The characters sometimes fall into these difficulty childish roles influenced by misunderstandings and jealousies. Ged clearly and quickly identifies Jasper as an enemy, if at first only as a rival in his seniority, due in part to his curiously cultivated, subtly sarcastic attitude. These are characters we must see through Ged's eyes to best understand his motivations and weaknesses. And he is nothing if not prideful and impatient, eager to impress others and become recognized for the glory he imagines in the talent and accomplishments of magery, rather than temperament or restraint.His actions are not only influenced by who he is (or who he thinks he is), but by his intentions. This is a book that contains such subtle and non-subtle messages of responsibility and kindness, honoring the sacrifices of friends, and the intrinsic relationship people share not just with each other, but with all creatures and objects of nature. Ged has to find his place in the world, but to do so, he has to discover his limits. And so he reaches out by islands and boats, on foot and through air, at times running away from or toward his fears, back into the arms of friends and out into palaces of those that wish him no good. He travels everywhere and back again, even to the ends of the world, determined to find equilibrium without ever realizing that is what he yearns for the most. To be at peace is to find balance within one's soul and to accept that which is good and that which is bad. Knowing when and how to act is Ged's most difficult journey and harshest lesson.A Wizard of Earthsea may be a short novel, but it leaves a lasting impression. It's a type of bildungsroman with an awareness of itself as the stuff of fairy tale and legend. The text even refers to itself through the narrator as a story we all must have heard before, concerned with characters we might know in bits and pieces. Whether or not Ged's tale is true, or if different versions conflict with each other, we have this one here which even references other legends and tales outside of itself, but altogether within the realm of Le Guin's fantasy. Surely there's darkness and adventures with perilous and light-hearted outcomes, but Le Guin has created something cognitive and tightly woven. Anyone, no matter the age, will find something to enjoy about it. You never know. Perhaps it will be the dragons."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Ursula LeGuin is that rarity in fiction writing: a writer who takes a genre and treats it as serious literature. More, she has done this not merely in science fiction, with novels like \\"The Left Hand of Darkness,\\" but here, with the first of her Earthsea series, fantasy as well. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is a novel that puts ideas first, characterization second, and world building and plot third (plot and world building are usually the first and main focus of fantasy-- see \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"). Most remarkably, though, is the fact that LeGuin succeeds spectacularly at all levels in this novel.Written like a myth rather than a straightforward narrative, the story of Ged is one of acquired wisdom, learning that power-- in this case through magic-- is itself dangerous to the one who wields it. LeGuin visits this again in later books of the series, but never as well as she does here, and it is a point usually missing in the heroic fantasy that focuses on battles and quests. If I had to guess, I'd say this is why LeGuin is taken seriously as literature and most other fantasy authors are not. Again, this is a novel of ideas, and it tells us clearly that the greatest enemy we will ever face is ourselves and our own failings. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" may be a fantasy, but its ideas could not be more real."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I have nothing to add to the glowing reviews that already make up the body of this catalogue. This book made the same sort of impression on me as a child that the Bible, Torah or Koran might make on a religious person. It is, in my opinion, a superior example of flawless storytelling and I cannot praise it highly enough.Buy two- one for yourself and one to give to someone you love deeply."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I can see why many people love the book and many people don't.Story:The story follows the early years of Ged, and how he became the greatest sorcerer of Earthsea. Throughout the adventure, there are a lot of timeless themes: Good vs. Evil, Light vs. Dark, self discovery, friendship, growing up, compassion... Because Earthsea deals with self discovery, your age and life experiences will shape the way that you view the story. Younger readers can grow up with Ged and older readers can reflect back on their childhood memories. These themes transcend generations so everyone should be able to enjoy the story to some degree.World:Earthsea is a medieval fantasy world mostly covered by water. Think of the Earth that you know, if the seas rose about 100 feet. There is a magic system based on willpower and knowing the 'true names' of things, but there are also dire consequences for those who don't respect its power. Dragons also exist in the world of Earthsea, so if you've got a place in your heart for dragons, that's a plus.Writing Style:The story is linear and chronicles the major events of Ged's life. Each 10-20 page chapter represents a challenge that Ged faced: Saving his village from raiders, going to magic school, confronting a dragon... Nearly all of the major events are wrapped up neatly in each chapter. Because the book is so fast paced, the details are used sparingly (but effectively) and at times the story just whizzes by. The pacing is good for readers that just want to know what happened to Ged. But, if you're the type of reader that wants to visualize the whole adventure and craves depth, then you're not going to like this book at all.Characters:There are a few interesting characters in the book and most of them are likeable, but they really don't get much screen time.Action:There is a bit of action in the book and it's suitable for all ages.Overall:This is a good story that mostly breaks the, \\"Show, Don't Tell\\" Rule. On the plus side, it's incredibly easy read and the events in the story are good. The fast pace of the book and universal themes are good for younger readers. (This book could easily have been 500 pages instead of 197.) But if you're a fan of rich details, great dialogue, exciting action, and a story that pulls you in, you'll be disappointed with the book. It's more like hearing someone describe the life of Frodo Baggins or Harry Potter in 15 minutes, than reading Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter and experiencing the journey for yourself."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"As strange as this may seem, I sought out a book by Ursula K. LeGuin because of one of those crazy online quizzes--this one in particular was supposed to determine which fantasy author's works I most \\"identified with.\\" My result was Ursula K. LeGuin and I'm embarrassed to admit that I had never even heard of her until that moment. I stumbled across this audiobook on iTunes and figured it was the perfect opportunity to give LeGuin a try.In the end I'm glad I did, and now I intend to try to get my hands on more of her books. LeGuin's start to the Earthsea series definitely has the feel of classic fantasy. This was the first time I had ever listened to a fantasy novel instead of reading it, and while I found it was a little more difficult to keep up with things at times, it was definitely enjoyable to listen to. This particular audio rendition must be fairly old--it sounded as if it was copied from an old recording and the reader sounded like a storyteller, as opposed to the perfect readings that you find on audiobooks today. It's hard to explain the difference, but it really did not sound as if the reader was reading straight from the book, and I found that to be a plus when listening.As for the story, it is a bit of a different take on wizards and their quests. Ged's quest is not so much to save a world, as it seems is the case with so many fantasy books, but rather to clean up a \\"mess\\" that he made as a boy in training to become a wizard. Of course, along the way there are other side adventures and we watch Ged grow and mature through the years. The story is a bit dry, but the writing seemed fairly colorful and flowed nicely. All-in-all I thought it was a great example of fantasy literature and certainly a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Rented this movie and it was lame, read a review and it spoke of the trilogy in book form...I am in the middle of book 2 and it's so much better then the movie, what a shock...I'm not sure why movie directors can't stick to the main story line, it's a pity."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read this trilogy when I was in eighth grade. The books were by far some of my favorites during my junior high years. I am now almost 30 and have enjoyed re-reading them. The stories are enthralling.

They are well worth your time."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I love fantasy and science fiction, and this is one of my favorite fantasy books ever. The story follows a young man named Ged, from the moment he said his first spell, not knowing what the words meant, to the days when he is a powerful wizard. Ged is probably one of my all time favorite charactors, because all though he is very powerful he has his flaws, and it was his reckless pride that changed the world forever. If you like Harry Potter, I recomend you read this, although it is a bit darker and more serious. Ursula keeps you always wondering how it will end."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I thought that this book was pretty much the best book that I have read this year. The readon that I gave it four satrs instead of five is that it was very complex, and around the middle of boo, it started to waver a little bit. But it got better after about a chapter and continued its exciting adventures with Ged as he pursues his evil shadow. I reccommend this book to almost everyone!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book is often unfairly called a children's book. It is a brilliant piece of fantasy and can easily be compared to Tolkien in my mind except for being better written. The best bit though is that each book in this series is a story in its own right and Urusula LeGuin unlike most fantasy writers can get to the point instead of churning out long tedious 5 book epics. As for the assertion that older fantasy books are sexist anyone who says so hasn't read the last book Tehanu. The book does suffer from an intelligent and well thought out plot which may lose it popularity. So any stupid people out there should avoid it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I found this book riveting and exciting through it's use of description.

It has many ups and downs . It teaches morals too . (Pride) but hey , its good for ages 10-INFINITY . The language is easy to understand . PERFECT FOR A LITERATURE COURSE !"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"All I can say is that I wish my English teachers had &quot;forced&quot; me to read books of this sort when I was in school; it used to be that one had to read fantasy with a defensive attitude. I first read this book when I was nine, not because of any requirement, but because I wanted to. This book is thoughtful and full of a quiet beauty, reflecting not only the author's knowledge of anthropology but quite a lot of wisdom about humanity as well. If you like flashy sword-and-sorcery fantasies in the pulp tradition, this won't be for you; on the other hand, if you are in the mood for something that reaches beyond the normal smothering cliches, give it a whirl. No, it isn't Tolkien, but for heaven's sake, it's not even the same sort of story--can't compare Dickens to Dinesen, can you? And check out Ms. LeGuin's other works. Her short stories (Wind's Twelve Quarters, The Compass Rose, et.al) are intriguing. And remember, any book your English teacher &quot;forces&quot; you to read, unless it's a Harlequin romance, might just be worth a second glance..."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Absolutely wonderful.

This is definately not a book for people with very little brains.It's scope is compelling and majestic. A must read!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"LeGuin's book is every bit as magical as any other wonderful story about a flawed character who must go up against all odds and ends up getting in touch with himself. This book may be a fantasy novel on the surface, but don't be fooled. The magic in this book is about human creativity, self-potential, and understanding as well as gaining control over the side of yourself that might be a little... dark."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Read LeGuin's Earthsea Trilogy over 25 yrs. ago in college, and re-read them recently. Just as thought-provoking as ever and picked up on small details which I'd missed on first reading yrs. ago.Never fails to amaze me how LeGuin's depth of character portrayal (Ged in Wizard of Earthsea) and her depiction of life/death and beyond issues in simple profound terms, are endless delight to read and re-read for fresh insights. All of the Earthsea books can stand alone - a great writer is one whose books endings' always come too quickly! Recommend these books to adults who seek the &quot;true Names of all things&quot;."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I'm a big fan of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, which I consider LeGuin's best writing, certainly as far as style is concerned. Simplicity in writing style is something she shares with some of the genre's great writers like Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham.I read her more popular &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; simply because they'd won awards, but found them a little dissapointing, probably because they are both Nebula AND Hugo winners for their year and I was expecting more.This book, however, delivers exactly what I was expecting, intelligent fantasy done just right. I appreciate the author's ability to zoom in and out of the story without losing focus. She at some times brings us down to a day by day, person to person level, but can quickly zoom out and weeks or even years pass in a page or two. I found that she picked just the right days in the life of the wizard to hold the reader's interest and still gave the grand scheme of his life.The next two books were very good as well, but didn't capture the wonder of the first. I love the way that LeGuin introduces the reader to the magic of Earthsea, how the magic works and doesn't work etc...This book is well worth any Fantasy lovers time and energy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book, along with &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, and &quot;Dragondrums&quot; was one of my favorites as a child. As an adult, I still deeply enjoy sitting down with it for a re-read. Fundamentally a simple story, we look into the life of a young orphan &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot;, who discovers that he is a wizard with the true-name of Ged. Through his arrogance and pride, he accidentally releases a supremely dangerous and powerful force, that even the greatest of wizards cannot destroy. He must find a way to make right what he has done.I've always loved this story because of its characters, and its world. I have found with fantasy books that most authors tend towards the stereotypical &quot;man wearing a black cape releases ball of fire&quot; motif. This world has a clear philosophy on the use of its magic, and a whimsical, &quot;fairy-tale&quot; feel throughout. The characters are strong, and empathatic. Overall, one of the best books of its kind. I give it a four only because I reserve my five's for books of such depth and complexity as Dune. Out of 100, I would give it an 85."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"It is surprising to note that Harry Potter 1 gets 5 stars from more than 4900 people on Amazon, while this book gets only 4 stars from only a little over 290 reviewers. However, comparison is not my intent (as I believe there's really no way to actually compare the two).This is by far the best book of coming of age in a fantasy/wizardry context. It's deep, thought provoking, amazingly imaginative and written exceptionally well. It resonates with me today as much as it did when I first read it in the late eighties.The plot is superb and what works so well is the humanity of the characters, especially the protagonist, Ged, and fellow students in the school of wizardry on the island of Roke. Ged's motivations are easy to relate to, while the context is magical and yet so real at the same time. Ursula Le Guin has a way with words that's admirable. On the one hand, it's really a short book, she does not tend to overkill the reader with lengthy scenic and character descriptions (unlike what's so common in the genre). In fact, I'd even say that part of the power of this book is how much you crave for more words and yet end up filling in using your imagination. But that's not a drawback, it's a huge advantage. Because what Ursula does tell us, she does with a resonant voice, clear, beautiful prose that fits together very well and at the end you feel you really know a lot about the geography of earthsea (in some sense that's a big driving mechanism) and about the boy who would be archmage, Ged.Dragons and wizards are vividly depicted (this is possibly the most awe inspiring source for depicting dragons as truly magical beings), yet the book is really about human emotions and human weaknesses. These are explored as part of the overall theme and message of the book - anger, jealousy, strong-headedness, pride, just to name a few.The book emphasizes the power of words. I find that the book itself is the strongest advocate of this power. It's a keeper on many accounts and will be the kind of book that's still there, deep in your memory several years after you read it. You're likely to reread it later on only to discover its strength and maturity, the stronger and more mature you get.I cannot recommend this book more strongly. If you haven't done so yet, pick up a copy. You can thank me later by coming back here and writing your own 5 star review !!!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"If you are an avid fan of rubbish yet action packed pulp sci-fi such as those books by Terry Brooks, David Gemmel or Anne McCaffrey then don't pick up this book. You will not find an 'exciting' novel full of spacey contraptions, fights with orcs and cardboard characters.What you will find however is one of the most sublime and mature works of fantasy ever written. Le Guin has created a work of genius. Yes it is slow at times, however this book is outstanding. Not a pulp novel but a masterpiece with a philosophy of its own, it more than rivals Tolkiens work. And as for criticisms that Ged, the protagonist, is a poorly drawn and obtuse character, i cannot think of a 'hero' in modern fiction today more poignant than the quiet, deep and flawed Ged.Genius."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"It seems wholly appropriate that a work so well crafted, in which the words used are so perfect, should embrace as its central theme the power of words. In the land of Earthsea, magic is inexorably tied to the true name of a thing. Potential, in and of itself, can do nothing without knowledge. It is the two together that enable magic. Wizards spend their lives learning true names, without which, they can only perform charms and tricks.This book is a magnificent piece of literary art. It works on so many levels that one can only marvel at the facility with which disparate pieces of such varying sizes and shapes are moulded into a coherent whole. The result is a masterpiece.One level is dedicated to children. It is an adventure story of inner courage and strength of character. Another level is dedicated to young adults. It is a story of a boy's journey into manhood and the conquest of self-limitation. The deepest level is also the most mature. It is a philosophical rumination on the balance of life.There is more than the one type of magic here - the author submerges her themes into the story so naturally, that one is never aware of her literary magic at work. For example, she does not stretch for the philosophical. She eases into it, without hurry or seeming care. It is only afterward that one becomes aware of having experienced something profound.Another sample; this one a taste of the writer's lyricism: &quot;But Ged went on, falcon-winged, falcon-mad, like an unfalling arrow, like an unforgotten thought, over the Osskil Sea and eastward into the wind of winter and the night.&quot; The gift for vivid similes, the cadence of the sentence, the sheer potency in the words, all combine to weave a literary spell that surpasses any magic present in the story. This is a great gift, and not even the greatest.The greatest gift that this or any writer can give to her reader is that of self-discovery. In this work, as in each of the subsequent two, Le Guin crafts such a discovery so perfectly, that her work is elevated into literature. This is one of those books that change lives. Had she written nothing else, the world would owe Ursula K. Le Guin an immeasurable debt of gratitude for writing just this one."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Intelligent and thoughtfully written are appropriate adjectives to use when describing Ursula Le Guin's work. Many of her scientific novels are as profound as they are fanciful.\\"The Wizard of Earthsea\\" is the first in a trilogy of books begun in 1968. \\"The Earthsea Trilogy\\" has often been compared to Toklien's Lord Of The Rings and many times critiques have praised it has the greatest of the two.This first book in the trilogy begins the life story of a young boy called Duny at birth who is destined to become the greatest of all wizards in a world already renowned for its magic and power. Duny is a young headstrong boy who learns the first rudiments of magic from his aunt a witch. She begins to teach him minor weather control but most importantly she begins to instruct him in the true names of things. To know the true name of anything whether it is an object, an animal or a person gives you the power to control that entity.Using the knowledge that his aunt has imparted to him Duny saves his village from attackers. This brings him to the attention of the Mage Ogion. At the time of naming when one sheds his childhood name for his true name, Ogion bestows on Duny his true name Ged. However, since to know ones true name is to have power over that person the boy became known to the outside world as Sparrowhawk.Ged is impatient with his master's methods and when Ogion offers him the choice between staying with him or going to a famous school of wizards, he chooses to go to the school. There he meets his first rival Jasper and Vitch who will become his true friend.However, although his natural magical talent leads him to become a great student and his knowledge grows by leaps and bounds, so does his pride and anger. Ged in a moment of pride accidentally lets loose a dangerous shadow on the world. It is in the battle with this shadow that he comes to learn not only the true power of words but humility and duty.This book although written for adolescents will also appeal to adults who will appreciate the lessons taught in the story. Most children and teenagers may find the story a bit slow compared to current fantasy novels. Although children exposed to Harry Potter may enjoy the school of wizards and the interaction between Ged, Vetch and their rival Jasper.I must confess that although I like Le Guin's writing style and always appreciate her stories, I often lamented her treatment of women. In this book women are never equal to men. They are there to be avoided or protected. However, I do highly recommend this book because despite its minor flaws, it is fantasy at its best."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Let me start off by saying that it's very sad people dislike this book just because they heard it's of the same caliber as Tolkien's work and it turned out it wasn't. Ursula Le-Guin is a good author but even good authors have a hard time when they're compared to Tolkien. Was Tchaikovsky a lousy composer just because he wasn't &quot;as good as Beethoven&quot;? (whatever that means) Was Lev Landau stupid just because he wasn't &quot;as smart as&quot; Einstein? Mind you, Le-Guin's world lacks the depth of Tolkien's, but whatever she lacks in completeness she makes up for in compelling plot and characters. Ok, so much for my penny philosophy.I've read the Earthsea novels when I was a kid and have re-read them later on as an adult, and can say that, while I have no special affection for the fantasy genre, these books still stand out as being special. Le-Guin's choice of plot and characters makes this book very unique - instead of grand wizards and epic battles, she chooses a &quot;real life&quot; wizard and tells his story. Instead of the usual &quot;end-of-the-world&quot; theme she chooses his personal battle against a shadow that haunts him - due to his own actions. This book will never become a Hollywood production (thank heavens!), simply because there isn't enough eye-candy in it. That's one of the things I like about it. I am also very fond of Le-Guin's writing style, but that's a more personal choice.If you feel fantasy books are all about knights in armor and robed wizards and flying dragons speaking Shakespearean English and going around saving the world (or destroying it), give this book a try, it might surprise you (for the better, I hope ... )."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is a different fantasy story than what I am used to. Fantasy often involves page after page of trolls, dwarfs, elves and wizards with strange names locked in epic wars and quests. While that formula is all fine and good, by keeping action to a minimum and philosophy to a maximum, Ursula K. le Guin departs from it somewhat in the story &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea.&quot;The story involves the early exploits of the powerful archmage Ged, when he was a young man named Sparrowhawk. At a young age he is living with an abusive guardian, when he discovers he has magical powers. He then leaves this abusive person and goes off to wizard school to be learned in the arts of magery (sound familiar Potter fans?). There he befriends a fellow prentice named Vetch, and enters into a rivalry with another wizard prentice by the name of Jasper. This rivalry results in the release of a dark, evil shadow from the realm of &quot;unlife&quot; during a &quot;wizard duel,&quot; when Ged casts a spell beyond his control. Ged then spends the length of the book first running from the shadow, which seeks to posses him, and then pursuing the shadow, seeking to destroy it, trying to undo the evil he had begun in a moment of stupid pride.I have often felt that a good fantasy formula is pitting a fallible character(s) against the deeds of his errant actions. This formula is used in the Narnia books and also in Tolkien's stories. It is repeated in this book and works very well. While the obvious lack of action (although when there is action it happens with some amount of violence) may alienate traditional fantasy readers, the philosophy of the book and the examination of the balances between good and evil should appeal to adults and older children alike. The inclusion of maps and the well developed magic system, and the unique emphasis on names, also contributes to the plausibility of the book and gives it the characteristic feel of a good fantasy story. An excellent, highly-recommended book."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Influenced by Greek and Norse mythologies in subtle but obvious ways, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" was, before the era of Harry Potter, perhaps the most famous example of a bildungsroman (coming-of-age story) in the wizard-fantasy genre. Adopting the aloof tone and narrative style of medieval saga, Le Guin tells the story of young Sparrowhawk (whose \\"secret\\" inner name is Ged) and the adventures he encounters and calamities he unleashes while he studies to become a wizard. In spite of its sparseness, this first entry in the series is rich in theme and characterization, especially in the presentation of Ged's inner struggle.The plot is simple: a precocious lad in the northern area of the archipelago of Earthsea shows promise in the art of magic. Taken under the wing of a local mage, Sparrowhawk soon bridles under his tutor's deliberate, methodical training, and he is sent on the long voyage to an island that hosts a school for wizards. The competitive nature among schoolboys, however, prods Sparrowhawk to unleash a fearful monstrosity (his own dark side, so to speak) and the young wizard spends the remainder of his young adulthood atoning for--and trying to correct--his rash mistake. Although his early mentor Ogion and fellow-student Vetch both have important roles to play in Ged's salvation, \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" focuses almost exclusively on Ged's lonely quest, and it is at heart a psychological tale featuring a single heroic character.Initially written for teens (and marketed as such), the Earthsea books have transcended the \\"young adult\\" market--and deservedly so, since the author tackles so many themes in so few pages. One aspect in particular that has received much comment is its ecological message. Throughout their schooling, the young wizards are warned against the \\"butterfly effect\\" of their powers. \\"You must not change one thing, one pebble, one grain of sand, until you know what good and evil will follow on that act. The world is in balance, in Equilibrium.\\" Evil in Earthsea is the destruction of the world's equilibrium, and a wizard's duty is, above all, to maintain that environmental balance.Le Guin's tales are sure to receive renewed attention because of the Earthsea miniseries on the Sci-Fi. So it's too bad that Le Guin herself has denounced the film version as \\"a far cry from the Earthsea I envisioned.\\" Perhaps Le Guin will someday meet the filmmaker she deserves."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This is the first volume of what would become a classic fantasy tetralogy about a world of islands (the other books in the series are &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; (1971), &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; (1972), and &quot;Tehanu: The Last Book of Earthsea&quot; (1990)). &quot;The Wizard of Earthsea&quot; is often a required text in college courses on speculative fiction as well as in courses in children's literature. It was originally written for juveniles and teenagers; yet, it achieved a much wider following. It won the 1969 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; Horn Book Award for Excellence. The story is centered about the young boy known as Sparrowhawk, later known as Ged, who goes off to be trained as a wizard. His pride and anger accidentally lets loose a shadow upon the world. Ged learns humility and duty and, after confronting a dragon threatening villagers, he goes off to restore the balance in the world by facing this shadow. The reader becomes well aware of the importance of words: words, by themselves, can become acts. We have to be very careful in what we say and how we phrase sentences. In addition, the reader sees Ged face his fears and discovers an aspect of the nature of good and evil that allows him to grow more complete."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book arrived well before the expected date and was a great buy.

I liked it, thinking it good but not great and certainly not anywhere near as good as 'The Hobbit' or any of the Narnian Chronicles. I think because of LeGuin's rather detached narrative style, compared to the personal storytelling narration used in the other books.

I would have enjoyed it more had it been written in the form of a true novel."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"LeGuin's first book in her Earthsea series is wholly satisfying but is not groundbreaking. It tells the story of simple country-folk type Ged encountering both the wide world around him as well as the darkness that dwells within himself.Earthsea is populated with straightforward individuals and a smattering of magical, otherworldly beings (including dragons). It is a standard fantasy world, and the coming-of-age tale of Ged is a standard fantasy plot. LeGuin's famous focus on the importance of names and their relation to being able to do magic is an interesting twist.Perhaps given its age (first published in the 1960s, I believe) the book was groundbreaking at the time. Read now, it is simply a solid novel that beckons one to read the next."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"The Wizard of Earthsea is an interesting story of a young boy, named Ged, in search of his own identity. Ursula Le Guin uses very vivid descriptions to expand the depth of the readers understanding of the scenery and of the characters of her story. Ged starts off as a young, curious boy, interested in all that is unknown to him, and wanting to acquire the knowledge of wizardry. His quest leads him through many trials and tribulations. His learning starts with the local witch, his Aunt, to his beloved master, Ogion, who warns him of his wanting to learn too quickly, and then to the known school of wizardry. The most obvious of these trials is the birth of the shadow, which is released through his pride, arogance and ignorance of the unknown. His first fear and then quest for the \\"shadow\\" is the true test of gained knowledge of his own identity. His misuse of pride in his skill brings him a humility that is needed for him to fullfill his destiny and to become the greatness that all but him are aware he will be.While this book is full of adventure and insight, it is, in some places, difficult to get through. The scenes are long, and in great detail, which looses the readers interest. It is the ending that is the most interesting for those interested in double imaging and the human psyche. Though the book is not very long, it makes for a long read. If you look at this story as a preface to the adventures of Ged as the \\"Archemage\\" of Earthsea, then it makes it much more interesting. I am interested in seeing how the other two stories to the trilogy are written, and wether or not this preface is worth it's attention to detail."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Before I start, I should explain what I mean by high fantasy. High fantasy is (to me) a writing style that does not concern itself with the mundane details. Good is good and evil is evil. People don't worry about where the next meal comes from, and death and disease are not immediate, except as the story needs them.That being said, in some ways, A Wizard of Earthsea is a very simple book. It's straight high fantasy, and it's a coming of age story about confronting your inner demons, and the price paid for the sin of pride.And in an age where staggering complexity seems to be the norm, with plot twists and complex hurried action, sometimes it is good to sit and read a simple story, well told.Perhaps it's a personal thing of mine. So many people feel that it is necessary to do something new and exciting, the novel seems to exist to be novel and nothing else. I find great pleasure in seeing people do the simple things well. It's a lot harder than you think. Witness how few do it well.The fact that Earthsea is a seemingly simple novel, but complete in its simplicity makes it a classic in the field. Other novels build on the base, or change it, but this is a book you must read to understand the root of how high fantasy is written."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Until now, I haven't read a fantasy or SF book by LeGuin that I didn't like. And this one, I love too. I've got the sequels next to my bed, ready to be devoured at night.I love the epical language (some people seem to have problems with that and the 'hard' words, but what are dictionaries for, and I am even Dutch, so English is my second language), the character development, the heroic view on how life should be.I love the idea of the powers of magic as depicted in this book. So much more realistic and modest than Tolkien. It makes it much more powerful to me.What strikes me in this book, as well in the books of Exile and Illusion of LeGuin, is her love for travel stories. The main character always goes on a big quest to find something, to accomplish a goal. And each time it is different, it is written so well that you feel that this next long journey is necessary for character and story development. It deepens the plot, it pictures a strange world that is still quite similar to ours. LeGuin's books are not for the 'heavy action lovers', where long battles occur.Special as well is the development of the shadow that is unleashed by Geb. It develops into a real human being, it is it's own shadow, and it is finally united with Geb. It makes me think of Yin and Yang."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I'm a fan of many fantasy series, from adult ones like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, to YA series like Harry Potter, Narnia, and Eragon, but somehow I had missed Ursula Le Guin until now. I'm so glad I finally picked up this series, and I will certainly continue reading. A Wizard of Earthsea most definitely falls in the 'adult' fantasy category, and is perhaps the most sophisticated view of magic and the psychological making of a wizard/mage than any other series has attempted. As many have already noted, it is very Jungian in its view of 'shadows' and in particular the shadow of Ged, the wizard of the title. This book concerns his youth and training, and a shadow he unleashes on the world through his pride, and how he comes to defeat it (although 'defeat' is not quite the right word.)If you are looking for epic battles between external forces of good and evil, ala many of the series I listed above, this series won't be for you. The making of this wizard is an inner process, and told in quite a detached way. There is not a lot of dialogue or depth of human connection, although certainly some does develop. But the prose is simply beautiful in places. Dare I say that the entire approach is a bit more feminine? In the sense that the prose is so lyrical, and the story so inner.So I may be late to come to Le Guin, but I am certainly a new fan, and am looking forward to more."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"With a Wizard of Earthsea, Le Guin has created a masterpiece that has every element one could possibly want in a fantasy story. (Ok, so there's no romance-- but romances are usually trite in fantasy novels, so that's something to be thankful for.) Ged's quest is the ultimate un-stereotype; throughout his journey he struggles to reconcile with an otherwordly shadow that turns out to be the dark side of his own being. The world of Earthsea is meticulously crafted; Le Guin's sparse but haunting prose brings everything into a vivid, well-imagined life. This book should be read by everyone who appreciates a good story, if they're a fantasy lover or not."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I read the Earthsea Trilogy as an adolescent. I remember loving it, although the experience was, even then, very different for me. I was a fan of C.S. Lewis, Tolkein, Lloyd Alexander. But Leguin felt really differrent. Part of this was that the novel was more intellectual in focus, more about what lies at the heart of her characters and less about overt action, heroics. I remembering being surprised that the plot moved so quickly away from the obvious. In this novel the hero, Ged, very early on makes terrible mistakes. Instead of being brave and untarnished, he's afraid and for some time runs away from the evil he's unleashed. This is not obvious fantasy fare. It doesn't fit the formula, and for that I loved it. Adolescence was, for me, a time of much uncertainty and doubt and sometimes outright fear. I really connected with Ged and appreciated being able to read about a troubled, damaged hero who wasn't always perfect. Also, I did note that LeGuin is careful to describe her character's racial diversity. This is a world of brown and black people, with a few paler ones living at the margins of society. I think people often miss this, but I didn't then.And I didn't when I reread it recently. All the things I admired in the first place are still there on the page. That cultural diversity is still a part of it, although LeGuin may have been a little too subtle - as many people don't seem to notice this at all - including the filmakers adapting her work. Another thing I noticed now, though, that I didn't when I was younger, is how solid the craft of LeGuin's writing is. Sentence by sentence, description by description, dialogue by dialogue: she's a very good writer. She lean and economical and moves her story forward like a fine craftsperson.This is a wonderful novel of a wonderful series. I've got quite a bit to do these days in my adult life, but it's quite a pleasure to know that at some point in the next few months I'll be able to pick up the next in the series and carry on a little ways. I look forward to it."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book was amazing. I enjoyed it a lot. It is not a hard read and it has a great story. But what I liked most about it was how it made you ask questions about yourself. This book struggles with inner fear that everyone faces and how to overcome it. When I read it, I had to think a lot. The book helped me to understand that everyone has a battle between good and evil within themselves. Everyone has to fight this battle at least once in his or hers life. For Ged it took him many years, thousands of miles, and dozens of fights to understand what he was fighting. But from reading this book I also learned what I was fighting.This book not only lets you ask yourself a lot of hard questions, but also let you understand fantasy better. After reading this I could remember multiple books that had major similarities taken from this book. This book influenced many authors when they wrote their books, or just has a very popular concept of magic. But either way, it was a classic fantasy that I will never forget."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I've read this book four times--once every decade or so since I was a young teen. Every time I've read it I've been blown away in a different way. When I was thirteen, I was blown away by the thrilling adventure yarn that LeGuin weaves. When I was in my twenties, I was fascinated by the spare, beautiful language and imagery she engages. At thirty, I had just watched Joseph Campbell's Power of Myth, and became fascinated by the way in which LeGuin spins out a tale that follow the structures of the Hero's Journey so perfectly. Now I am amazed by the way in which, with characteristic vision, LeGuin uses a deceptively simple story to delve into some extremely deep philosophical issues. I must be getting old!This book, the first in the Earthsea series that amazon.com has justly called one of the two most important fanstasy series of the twentieth century (the other being Tolkien's Lord of the Rings), follows the early life of a young sorcerer named Ged. Going by the common name of Sparrowhawk (for in Earthsea, true names have great power), he discovers his own magical ability when he is only a boy. He is trained, first by a local wizard named Ogion the Silent, and then at the great wizard school on the island of Roke. While truly coming into his power there, like another young wizard schoolboy in literature, he gets carried away with his own ability and unleashes something evil into the world. The rest of the novel is spent following Ged's attempts to escape and then to confront this evil--learning its name.The story is thrilling, the language is beautiful, the structure is mythic and--as with most of LeGuin's writing--the author is grappling with issues far deeper than the typical sword and sorcery novel.

At young age, Sparrowhawk discovers his talent in magic and wizardry, after one victory of protecting his village from the enemy. He was taken away by a wizard to learn the art of magic. However, due to his pride and ambition, a curse was brought to him by his pride.

LeGuin about the adventures of a young wizard to be, the curiously named Ged. The book chronicles his induction into magic and wizardry, guiding the reader through Ged's gradual growth and maturation as a wizard. However, the protagonist foolishly and pridefully delves further into magic than he is prepared for, and must correct his mistake in this magical coming of age story.The presentation of the story, fantastic as it is, is wonderfully executed. The author adheres to the rules of fantasy writing by presenting the reader with clear, believable boundaries and rules to her mythical world, which allows the reader a measure of confidence and relation to otherwise unfamiliar territory. Her diction is comparable to that of familiar fairy tales, which is appropriate, even welcome considering the subject matter. LeGuin's matter-of-fact, sententious word style demands belief, her narration adopting the clipped but descriptively informative tones of a newscaster relaying a factual occurrence. It becomes easy for the audience to lose themselves in such a story; indeed, absorption is almost impossible to resist. The reader quickly transforms from readers into observers as her characters transcend their literary limitations.The magic in this story has believable jargon, clear laws, and often visible repercussions that makes rampant use unethical for any moral practitioner. Were magic to exist, these elements of restraint would probably color and police its use, and its effect on the story is an increase in the tale's ability to suspend disbelief.A Wizard of Earthsea is a delightful read for anyone, especially lovers of fiction and fantasy."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Le Guin, the famed sci-fi writter, really did a wonder here.

A world of magic, but one like no other ever described. This is not the fanciful tale of an evil mage and a gallant knight, or a fair maiden and an old king. This book is about a young man, struggling to reach his goals and sail to his own farthest shores. It is the tale of his hardships and struggles and of his realizations and pains. For this is no prince charming, but Ged, the wizard from Gont. And through this book, you will feel and learn and live along side him.This truely is a must for all fantasy readers.

And they were disappointed since except some LeGuin's, Tolkien\`s and maybe few other authors' books fantasy is not a good literature. In the short commentary to the Polish edition of the novel S. Lem has stressed its main valor: it is self-contained and complete. You cannot find in it any unnecessary &quot;gadget&quot; just for amazement of the reader, everything has its meaning and role in the Earthsea world. On the other hand - you cannot remove magic from the novel; words-spells are its building material as well as they are building material of the world created. &quot;Words are acts.&quot; The Earthsea books are often compared to Tolkien's works but they are rather complementary than concurrent. Tolkien derived his creation from the linguistic research which is mostly hidden, while LeGuin exposed the central role of language in the creation. Certainly, if you dare build the whole world of words you should know how to use them. But this is just a writer's job - and LeGuin proves she is a very good writer. There is one more good reason why &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; is worth reading - it is a novel about human beings and human problems, showing true meaning of choice and responsibility. It is wise and well-written, rarity in sf and fantasy literature.

The whole book is quite interesting, but there are some ancient words you'll have to know"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I heard this series was one of THE standards in young adult sci-fi literature so I checked out all the books from my library.Thank goodness I didn't waste my money actually *buying* this stuff.I made it through the third book before just taking the whole pile back to the library, the last three unread. I couldn't make myself read through anymore of this mind-numbing ode to boredom.To be fair, the author starts out with a good premise in this book. A young man discovering unknown powers, craving even more power, learning caution through a harsh lesson that costs a life and then he sets out on a quest to right the wrong he's done. It's a great formula and the glimpses we see of the characters show that they were good enough to pull it off. But that's the problem; glimpses were all we ever got.The author suffered greatly from \\"telling\\" instead of \\"showing,\\" that is, telling us what happened instead of letting it unfold through circumstances and dialogue. As a consequence, all of the characters remained two dimensional and severely underdeveloped. I wanted to care about them but there wasn't anything there to care about.One of the big climactic scenes in the book, Ged raising the dead, was pretty close to anti-climactic simply because the author didn't have either the patience or the desire to develop the scene more.Many scenes in the book suffered from that failing, especially the ending, which was a huge letdown. All that build-up and we're left with what? An overly confusing layer of images (badly described scene) where Ged's facing off against himself? Sure, it's supposed to be deep and meaningful, but it comes off as trite and dull. Much like the rest of the series, actually. And no, it being geared towards young adults doesn't excuse any of its faults; there are many sci-fi/fantasy YA books out there and so many of them are better than this series."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"Published in 1968, 1971 and 1972, Ursula Le Guin's \\"Earthsea Trilogy\\" is widely regarded as a fantasy classic on a level not far from epics like Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and C.S. Lewis' \\"Narnia Chronicles\\". The story begins with a young man named Ged, commonly called Sparrowhawk, who receives training to become a wizard. His training in wizardry at the wizard school on the island of Roke begins with the power of illusion. Most magic merely involves the apparent change from one thing to another. But Ged is a brilliant student, and soon progresses to the true magic of changing. \\"Magic consists in this, the true naming of a thing\\" - when one knows the true name of an object, one can begin changing things. \\"Illusion fools the beholder's senses; it makes him see and hear and feel that the thing is changed. But it does not change the thing. To change this rock into a jewel, you must change its true name. And to do that, my son, even to so small a scrap of the world is to change the world.\\" This also applies in the world of men: \\"Who knows a man's name, holds that man's life in his keeping.\\" But true magic is perilous: it affects the broader world, and can upset the balance of the world \\"Rain on Roke may be drouth in Osskil.\\" Tempted by pride, hate and revenge over against Jasper, another student wizard, Ged tries calling forth a spirit of the dead and succeeds only in bringing a shadow of evil into the world. LeGuin does not justify Ged's actions, but clearly portays his actions as the result of pride and hate, and resulting in ruin. Like ourselves, Ged is a hero with flaws and must now live with their consequences. In a manner not unlike a dark horror novel, this evil shadow now hunts Ged, and his quest is to hunt it in order to remove it from his world.It's a gripping story, almost too dark at times, at least for young children. But unlike some other popular fantasy novels, the magic here bears a close connection to the occult. In Le Guin's world, a wizard is a respected adviser who plays a role similar to a religious leader in our world today. His spiritual role includes aspects that are being popularized under the name of Wicca and similar pagan religions. It's obvious that Le Guin's magic is pure fantasy, but the way it is worked out seems to closely resemble contemporary paganism, and this made me somewhat uncomfortable and question the suitability of this series for young children. Unlike the Harry Potter series, this fantasy is much more serious (like Robert Jordan's World of Time there are also influences of Taoism) and never trite. Like the Taoist yin-yang, Ged is driven by both evil and good desires; even the concept of the shadow has overtones of Jungian philosophy - modern readers have seen the book as model of Jungian psychology. But this aside, there's no question about how gripping Le Guin's plot is, and how vivid her world. It's no wonder this book won the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award in 1969, and Le Guin has proven herself by winning several Hugo and Nebula awards with other titles. I look forward to reading the rest of the series! -GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"I really wanted to love this book. It was given to me by a friend with the recommendation that it was an excellent book and that I would love it since I read a lot of other fantasy novels and this was right up my ally. I wouldn't necessarily say that I was disappointed, but perhaps that the book did not live up to my expectations. The story itself was interesting, though a bit cliched, at least in this day and age: (Possible Spoilers)A young boy exhibits unusually strong magical powers and it's contently obvious that he is going to grow up to become the greatest wizard in Earthsea, in part because the author tells you flat out that he does so. It really ruins any suspense because you know he's not going to die, or even lose a battle because he is obviously the greatest wizard ever. The ending is also anti-climactic, with the final battle taking fewer than three pages despite the fact that the wizard has been chasing and fighting this creature for the past hundred pages and that this being is supposedly this great evil that has no true name among other characteristics that make it so deadly and dangerous.The writing is a bit sparse. Ged, the wizard, is not always characterized well. He seems a bit flat at times and while the story has very interesting moments, battles with dragons and an excellent chase across the sea, it is also written in a fairly flat tone and occasionally seems hollow, without substance or anything to really grab onto in order to attach the reader to the story. I actually enjoyed the character of Vetch a lot more than I did that of Ged, and Vetch is simply a minor character.Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I've read quite a bit of fantasy and heard a lot of good things about this book and I hoped it would be a wonderful read. That being said, I think Le Guin is an adept writer, and will certainly be trying some of her other writing to see if this can be improved upon and if it was in fact my own bias that got in the way."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book is so good! I just love how it talks about all the magic and people in this world where demons, dragons, and wizards are almost common place. The only problem with this book is that if you read it you just HAVE to read the whole series!"},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"A Wizard of Earthses is a great book of wizardry and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the dramatic ending. This book contains excellent descriptions that give you the true feeling of what the stroy wants to get across. The stunning descriptions make the whole world of Earthsea seem real and very enchanting. The book also gives you a sense that it could be real because of all of the little restrictions that people and wizards have. You might think that a wizard could not be stopped, but this book gives lots of things that wizards must obey to keep the balance. This book also shows distinct character development of the main character. The book shows how he gradually faces his fears and overcomes it. Also, there is a late climax that keeps you interested until the very end of the book. The world of Earthsea seems real for the fact of the people in the book. The people are not all nice and willing to help the wizard. Most of them give him the cold shoulder, and yell a spiteful curse at him. At points in the book I feel sorry for the wizard because it seemed like he had no friends. As the stroy comes to a close, it makes you think about how power c an be abused. It also makes you think of the consequences of your actions. You never know when you might release an evil."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"This book was truly excellent. I enjoyed this wonderful series very,very,much.

I thought Le Guin's approach on the power of names an interesting and creative idea. The book is not very slow pace and doesn't doddle too much with lengthy conversations, jumping straight to the point in a satisfying, descriptive way. Had I not read Tolkein's &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; trilogy, this novel would have received 5 stars. I found the two worlds to be comparable in some ways, yet very different in others. Le Guin's fantasy world isn't quite as glorious as Middle Earth, rather a little more harsh, giving it some edge. I had high expectations after finishing that trilogy in which this novel fulfilled.

Others, like myself, had known Ms. LeGuin's name from literary sources (Ms. LeGuin has had her stories selected for inclusion in the prestigious, annual Best American Short Stories series). Like Tolkien, LeGuin is a writer first and foremost; and the fact that she has decided to apply her skill to both Science Fiction and Fantasy is a godsend to us the readers."},{"Title":"A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)","review":"You must read this book if you have it and if you don't buy it now!!

I've taken 8 courses on our legal system so far, most of which concentrate on the judicial system. In two chapters this book covers more than any textbook I've been assigned for my courses. Pound's discussions on the application of law are worthwhile in and of themselves. This is clearly the definitive classic text on american jurisprudence, most of which is still relevant despite its age.That said, there is a downside to the book. It takes hours to read certain pages. In a few sentences Pound manages to convey the same information other authors do in pages. This is not hyperbole. I'm currently taking Judicial Process and Business Law. The combined texts for those classes border on 750 pages. This one book discusses all of the same topics, in much more precise and clear language, in 168 pages.

The characters were one-dimensional, the villians were pure evil - I expected them to be tying a damsel onto railroad tracks at any second. I am mystified by all the good editorials this book has received.Basically, I was disappointed by this book.

Paul Auerbach takes you to a place where such an oath means absolutely nothing to a select few. Welcome to Branscomb Medical Center and School where bribery, blackmail, secrets, sex, and money are commonplace. Meet Drs. Smachtz, Ingleheart, Resnick, Waterhouse, and Mahnke, the ones with something to hide. One gave a patient the wrong blood and killed her. Another let a patient who had a heart attack lay in bed and die of a ruptured aorta. Another separated a car accident victim's neck from his spine. Another has some very interesting photos to hide, and another pops narcotics like M&Ms. These doctors obviously endanger patient care, but yet they are still on the payroll. Can two first year medical students and a dedicated doctor find out why? Or should they learn to leave well enough alone. This book is a work of absolute genius. I highly recommend this book because it is a definite must read. It has a little something for everyone; you cannot afford not to read it."},{"Title":"Bad Medicine","review":"It compares with the suspenseful medical thrillers of Robin Cook in his prime.

It's also very easy to understand and to the point. Definitely good for newbies. The book also helps you realize that consulting the I Ching is like consulting your best friend -- your inner self.Also, if unable to find copper I Ching coins, try using pennies made before 1970.

Ms Dening is truly gifted in her understanding of the ways I Ching is supposedly intepreted and she has no parallel when it comes to accuracy. Reading the wisdom made so simple and logical by the author is almost like having a celestial dialogue with the I Ching Sage himself. Like many, I have had studied this ancient wisdom for more than 10 years and read many books on this art, but truly, Ms Dening is THE authority for its accuracy and subtle messages.Her book has NEVER been wrong in the advice dispensed for the path set and I am always grateful to have this friend looking out for me. There was one time I &quot;disobeyed&quot; the advice and out of self pride, I made a serious mistake in deciding on an investment that truly turned bad (as the I Ching had predicted against all odds).I really paid the price for my own foolishness and am still paying for it now. I have had since apologised to it's essence and reverted back to respecting the accuracy and wisdom without doubt.If you really want to know what actions to take or to hold, or how to approach problems in the best ways possible, or even know whether the climate is right for investments, then start a friendship with this &quot;bible&quot;...you will be a changed person and a better one for it.

I kept hearing how this book simplified many of the aspects of the hexagrams and made the I Ching extremely readable and after breezing through the pages, I have to agree that it presents the I Ching in an extremely simple matter.But here's what I don't like: this book is for divination purposes only. Hardly any of it has to do with the wisdom of the book but instead focuses on what you need to do when you read a certain hexagram; the passages always say \\"do this\\" and \\"don't do that\\".I would hate to give it a three star rating because its purpose isn't parallel to how I read the I Ching.

It will unravel the inevitable confusion you will experience from all the other books. The I-Ching takes TIME to learn and is very deep and complex. Which most people don't have time for. I usually want an answer right away that I can understand. With the I-Ching, it's very open-ended so it's written almost like a riddle or a mystery and you're left scratching your head with no real comfort from asking your question. With this book, however, she lays it out that really defines the issues and where you are at in the whole thing like, at the beginning or middle or you are almost through and what is coming up next. It's pretty amazing. I read a classical text and then I read this text and while the two correspond, Dening, gives a more complete, comprehensible and meaningful interpretation by FAR. If you are getting only one book, and you are new to the I-Ching, make this the book you get. You won't be sorry. By reading this book, I am learning how to see what's going on in my life and how to get more out of the classic books I have on the I-Ching."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Penetrating psychological insights, masculine prose, tense, gripping adventure."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This story is in an interesting perspective in that Conrad uses a new way of writting style that is hard for some to grasp.

Nor will I comment at length on how Conrad learned English as a second language and how vasty impressed I am with his wizardry of words (although I am impressed). I wanted to say to Conrads credit, that I was impressed with Jim's character, meaning his personality. Although he did spend a fair amount of time brooding (that dosen't give anything away) he had good reson. I think that while the guilt for what he did rests in his mind he does manage to get on with it and regain his life. I worry that readers might not fully consider the complexitys of the narrator, Marlo, who is a facinating character in his own right. So to anyone who has yet to read the novel, I would recommend that you make note of Marlo as more than just a narrator as you pass through. If you read it already take a minuite while you're waiting in traffic or riding the bus, or what have you, and recall Marlo as a character. I hope you find him interesting."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"I love Conrad, so I was very disappointed when I read (or slogged through) LORD JIM. Conrad was heavily under the influence of Henry James when he wrote this book, and if you like Henry James, then you'll probably like this one. But, as Michael Crichton said about Henry James, &quot;I can't stand Henry James. His stuff reads like a first draft.&quot; Conrad writes like Henry James here in that the sentences are eternal and convoluted, and take forever to make a point. And every little thing in LORD JIM is symbolic of...you name it: man's despair, etc. As I said, I love Conrad: HEART OF DARKNESS, NOSTROMO, his short stories. But I found LORD JIM a totally unwelcome change in his writing style, and it was pure tedium for me to make it to the last page"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology, but the pronoun-laced conversational passages have left me wondering who was on first, or who was the first mate.Conrad was a pathbreaker in the subjects he treated and no doubt had interesting experiences, but I prefer his other works."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Conrad, a man who learned English as a second language, shows an immense skill and confidence with it. His style and story is very interesting throughout the first half, but as soon as Jim enters Patusan, it falls apart. Jim tries to hard to love Jewel and to be accepted by his new community. Conrad would have done better to have stopped sometime after Marlowe's original discussions with Jim. Conrad originally intended to make his idea into a short story, and that is how it should have been."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Lord Jim had all the key elements for an extremely interesting story, love/ murder/ adventure, but quickly loses the reader with the confusing writing style. It is hard to know who is talking and Jim's personality or looks are only discussed in the first two senetences of the story. I believe that if Conrad had lightened his style a little bit it could have been a much better novel."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Great Story. Also, additional material included is very helpful to help set the time and culture that the book was written. Conrad is considered a master writer for a good reason.

Conrad paints a melodramatic picture of a young man that is trying to recapture his honor. The plot wanders off on a tangent once in a while, and the narrator changes a little too often to maintain perspective on the comments. The 3rd quarter of the book is the best for action and description."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Jim is a youthful, handsome, water clerk aboard the Patna, a vessel escorting 800 Islamic individuals to Mecca. He supposedly has his entire career ahead of him. With no warning, the Patna collides with something on the Asian waters and it appears that the Patna is about to founder. Jim jumps off the vessel, along with a number of ship officers in order to save their own skins.Jim, along with his fellow mates survive. The abandoned \\"unfortunate\\" 800 others face a certain death. It does not seem to matter that the whole lot of them are eventually rescued. It is solely Jim who readily accepts the onus of \\"coward,\\" which Jim is labeled after an official naval inquest into the incident. Besides losing his seaman's license, Jim must suffer the rest of his days seaching for a way to rehabilitate his sullied reputation.Jim escapes to an obscure East Indies island, called Patusan, where the natives come to view Jim as a god.

A rehabilitated character is sure to follow the newly anointed \\"hero.\\"While the book has interesting characterizations and is holding to a certain extent, I found Conrad's emphasis on Jim's Christ-like martyrdom a little much. Jim seems to revel in his suffering which I, for one, do not find particularly heroic."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This book came as promised in a very timely fashion. It was in good condition."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Lord Jim is Joseph Conrad's most popular novel and possibly his best, which truly says much. A dark tale of human frailty with profound psychological insight, revolutionary narrative techniques, and sublime prose, it is essential for fans of Conrad and classics generally.The most immediate and lasting feature is probably the dense portrayal of the title character, one of literature's most memorable tragic heroes and most fascinating character studies. What makes him so engrossing is that he in many ways has great potential - he certainly has enough strength and determination to be a successful, even admirable leader - yet somehow embarks on a downward spiral leading to bleak death. He is the essence of Conrad's dark vision - average in many respects and extraordinary in some but burdened with a character flaw that leads to his demise. As in much of Conrad, there is a strong fatalistic streak. Jim never would have thought himself capable of the act that led to his ruin, others would have thought it equally impossible, and he is unable to understand it himself while regretting it bitterly - yet it happened. Conrad's real claim seems to be not that it was fated but that humans are inherently frail and that individual flaws will come out in even the most staunch given the right situation - which only the truly lucky avoid. It is easy to condemn Jim, but Conrad was never one to take an obvious moral route, depicting him with characteristically thought-provoking ambivalence. The narrator cannot deny his act's essential despicableness but sees that Jim still has much worth. One of Conrad's great artistic strengths is that he gives much food for proverbial thought but never sinks to the heavy-handedness so common in many other heavy writers and nearly always fatal. Jim is shown from several angles with astounding verisimilitude and piercing psychological perspicuity, but it is up to us to judge him and all he stands for - if we can. Even the harshest cannot deny his essential humanity, which is what makes him so compelling; loathsome as he conventionally is, we recognize the tempestuous darkness beneath his impressive exterior because we have seen it in ourselves. Conrad made a career out of exposing this darkness, and this is a prime example.The ground-breaking and highly influential narrative structure is nearly as notable. The novel began serializing in 1899 and came out in book form in 1900, which is very appropriate since it is in many senses a bridge between the centuries' literature. Elevated language and a historical background tie it to the nineteenth century, but its techniques are distinctly Modernist. Lord is indeed one of Modernist literature's very first examples, far closer in narrative spirit to its wildly experimental novels than to Conrad's Victorian contemporaries. It is told from various perspectives, primarily via a long story by Marlow, familiar from \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and other Conrad works. Nested dialogue abounds, and there is also narrative in letter form as well as other complex methods. This multi-faceted approach is fascinatingly wide, giving a grand view of the proceedings. It can be hard to follow, especially as it is far from linear, but I strongly encourage anyone struggling to persevere. As nearly always in such cases, it becomes easier, and the threads come together in the end - indeed spectacularly, if catastrophically, so. Conrad's deft handling of these complicated devices is truly admirable - a difficult artistic feat pulled off with rare acumen.The novel is notable for many other reasons, not least its intriguing peek into a world of sea adventures that is now near-unimaginable. The glimpse of Eastern cultures nearly unknown in the West even now is particularly noteworthy, and the ongoing contrasts between East/West, white/non-white, etc. are dramatized vividly and skillfully. Those with historical interest in the era or place will be particularly invigorated, but the sociological value is at least as high. We learn much about how Victorian society - and of course Conrad, though his style as ever makes it dangerous to draw sweeping conclusions - thought of such cultures and vice versa. This aspect of Conrad's fiction initially overshadowed more important ones, but we can now appreciate them in proportion.As always with Conrad, the prose is also of great significance. He is one of English's great prose stylists, which is truly incredible considering that it was his third language. This has some of his most lyrical and sublimely beautiful writing, whether describing exotic landscapes or the darkness at humanity's heart. The prose is indeed so great that it is one of many reasons making this often difficult read worthwhile.Neophytes would be better off starting with Conrad's more accessible short stories or relatively approachable novels like The Secret Agent, but anyone alive to his fiction - or great literature of any kind - must stop here eventually."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"I actually started listening to this as an audio book on a road trip with my family. My wife and son couldn't make it through the first hour since they felt like it took forever to describe the key incident in the story. I continued with the book and found that I eventually got used to this style of writing. From a literary point of view, it is a beautiful and impressive style. Conrad paints a very graphic picture with his metaphors that is almost never used in modern writing. Reading this book was an experience I'm glad that I had, though I'm still not sure this is my favorite style. The narrative format also took some getting used to; the jumping back and forth was effective, but took some concentration.As far as the story goes, it explored the effects of guilt in a man. Great novels help us understand key points of human thought and relationships and this book clearly falls in this category. You find yourself understanding the main failings and actions of the key character. I came away from this book with a reinforced understanding of the need of forgiveness, especially for oneself. Obviously it is easier to tell someone to forgive themselves than it is to actually forgive yourself.Overall I recommend this book for those interested in literature; the use of metaphors is incredible. This book is not for everyone, but is worth it for those wanting to experience Conrad at his finest."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This book is what books were made for. Conrad's gift to build a scene that comes alive in the mind is unsurpassed as far as I am concerned. His characters are imperfect and all too human. Their inner struggles are the same as those we have today. For the novice, this book may seem a little tedious but once you get into the flow of his imagery you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"If you haven't read this since high school or college, you might want to give it another try. I loved this book back then, but picked it up just recently, maybe wanting to connect with an old friend. Well, what a ride. I somehow wasn't tuned in back in my teens and 20s to how funny many of \\"Marlowe's\\" insights, narratives and commentaries are. Those and others more serious and poetic will have you saying \\"so true\\" to yourself about Conrad's perceptions of certainly the male half of this world....what a global village he describes, too, back then. And Marlowe's concern for Jim takes on more emotional weight now that I'm reading it some decades on, and have a son of my own. Anyway, might be time to put all the professorial interpretations aside and just enjoy this tale."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Lord Jim turned out to be one of the best novels I have read, and I admit around page 180, for the first time I can remember, I was considering not finishing a novel I had started. The first novel I read by Joseph Conrad was Heart of Darkness, which was narrated by Marlow. Lord Jim is also narrated by Marlow, which was an interesting twist. However, it also made the first 180 pages difficult to follow. Instead of reading a story, a story is being told to the reader. But the book is composed of two parts: Marlow telling us the introduction, and Marlow's letter to one who also heard the story the night Marlow told it. I felt this added something to the novel, making it more thrilling. The last 60-80 pages flew by, the conclusion was exciting, and then it was over. I have read three of Conrad's novels, and I like how he finishes them.What happens. Jim is a sailor who dreams of glory, but falters in his first trial. He spends time trying to avoid his past and eventually finds himself the guardian of a people in remote India. When trouble seeks him again, he makes a decision with horrible consequences. But instead of running from the consequences as he had earlier in his life, he faces them. An amazing novel."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"There is no doubt that Conrad is one of the master writers of the previous century, however I tend to find him rather a chore to read. Not that reading is supposed to be &quot;easy&quot; of course, but that's just by way of a warning. In this novel, he not only embarks on epic page-long sentences, but engages in a whole range of innovative (for the time) techniques for telling the tragic tale of Tuan/Lord Jim. These techniques include abrupt shifts and jumps in time, and a great deal story within a story constructions. The bulk of the story is recounted by a seaman named Marlow (who also was narrator for Heart of Darkness), who is often retelling what he heard from another source, or even third-hand. Some may find this a little confusing at first, but it shouldn't be a surprising device for the modern reader. Technique aside, this is an exceedingly dense work, rich in lengthy descriptions, and requiring the reader's utmost attention.Jim is a well-bred young Englishman who takes to the sea, envisioning a series of adventures in which he will prove his mettle and emerge as a well-regarded man. Alas, when a ship carrying a load of Malay pilgrims to Mecca strikes something and seems destined to sink, and his senior officers all abandon ship without rousing the passengers, he experiences fear and abandons ship as well. But when the ship doesn't sink, Jim is the only crewman to step forward and present himself to the maritime court of inquiry, which strips him of his sailing papers. Thereafter, Jim knocks around the South Seas, working as a water clerk in various ports, and departing whenever someone recognizes him. Finally, the narrator Marlow arranges for Jim to be installed as manager of a remote Malaysian trading post. There, he becomes the ruler and protector of the native people.The story is not really of importance though; really, we are meant to be taking a long and careful look at the character of Jim. Some may find him to be a tragic and romantic figure, however I view him as the embodiment of self-absorption and pride. Jim's vision of himself as a brave and true fellow is so key to his ego that he literally can't face his own past actions, even though they are utterly understandable and human. And far from seeking to prove or redeem himself, he seeks to remove himself from the sight of anyone who might recognize him. His self-imposed exile among the Malays allows him to fulfill his dream of being an respected leader, and allows him to avoid introspection. Indeed, had he been even slightly introspective, he might have eventually recognized that his overwhelming adherence to a code of honor has not served him particularly well. Ironically (or maybe predictably), at the end of it all, his misguided sense of honor brings death to him, and destruction to his people. It's not too hard to figure out what Conrad, who spend several decades on the high seas, thought of this ideal of honor. One character gives voice to Conrad's views, by saying that Jim died for &quot;a shred of meaningless honor&quot;."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"The end of the year brings so many lists, and Lord Jim has made its share. It's been touted by Modern Library and Le Monde for being in the \\"TOP 100\\" novels of the century. Reading Lord Jim for the first time, I was struck by how pulpy the experience was.First, the book itself, a vintage early 1970s paperback that is of the size and weight to be sold in racks at a drug store magazine aisle in Topeka, Kansas. The cover shows a fierce looking guy glowering, and next to that is a drawing of men cast adrift at sea- perched precariously acrest a wave.No doubt Lord Jim's classic status is over ascribed to the obvious psychological sophistication and under ascribed to the sheer mass market appeal of Conrad's exotic locations and multiple levels of accessibility. Conrad is like a children's tv show that puts in stuff for grown-ups on the sly.Note that Lord Jim was originally published as a magazine serial, a mode of publication that requires popular audience interest. When you are talking about the reaction of an audience to a specific cultural product, it is best to use the term \\"reception\\" to take into the account that there is a critical and popular response to every cultural product which is published.Lord Jim was published in serial the same year Heart of Darkness was published in book form: quite a one-two punch. If you look at Conrad's Bibliography, it's very much the familiar pattern of an Artist achieving critical success early and popular success late. Certainly, Conrad's catalog is not as well established as a Charles Dickens. I would actually say that Heart of Darkness is really, really the only true, lasting hit, but obviously it's a \\"novella\\" so in some sense it must not \\"count.\\"Heart of Darkness relates to Lord Jim exactly the same way an early 7\\" or EP relates to an LP relates for a musician: The first record demonstrates market potential to the audience, the second record fulfills that potential in the market place. Repeat."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Lord Jim was published at the very end of the 19th century, just after Joseph Conrad published one of his other classic books: Heart of Darkness. It's about a man who lives on the sea. As a young man he gets a job aboard the Patna and spends much of his time dreaming about one day becoming a hero. It's on this ship that he gets that opportunity. When the ship collides with the wreckage of another boat in the middle of the night, Jim is sent down to determine the extent of the damage. What he sees leads him to believe that the ship's hull is close to breaching and that the Patna will soon sink. The crew decides to abandon ship and to ensure their survival, decides not to wake the sleeping passengers, leaving them behind to go down with the ship. Jim decides that he is too insignificant a member of the crew to go against their decision, and leaves with them.Unfortunately for Jim, the Patna doesn't sink, and its passengers are rescued by another vessel and the crew of the Patna faces a judicial investigation where Jim becomes the scape goat and is the only one punished for the abandonment. Jim's decision to go along with his crew mates haunts him for the rest of his life and it becomes a defining moment for him. The rest of his life is spent running away from anything that reminds him of his experience on the Patna. Eventually he finds success in a fictional region called Patusan where he becomes a leader among the native inhabitants and ultimately finds a measure of redemption when he gives his life in their defense.Lord Jim is a great story. At times it's a little slow and tends to get confusing at times as the narrator jumps back and forth in time, recounting the history of Jim as he had become aware of it through the reports of people he met throughout his life. But the themes in this book are what I think have elevated it to the ranks of classic English Literature."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Conrad is never an easy read. but this challenging tale of failure and redemption is one of his best. Start with &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; if new to Conrad; then read &#34;Lord Jim.&#34;"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) was of Polish noble heritage though he was born in the Ukraine. He spent many years in the British navy and was a naturalized English citizen. Conrad wrote brilliant English novels and short stories; often thought in French and dreamed in Russian! Conrad is one of the greatest novelists in all of world literature.Lord Jim was published to great success in 1900. The story concerns Jim the scion of an English country parsonwho has taken to the salt water world. Jim is a romantic who dreams of doing great deeds of adventure and heroism.The main narrator of the story is Captain Charles Marlow an old sea dog who first meets Jim when the later is earning a meagre living as a water clerk. Marlow relates the tragic story of Jim to a group of listeners. Jim is serving on an old wreck of a ship \\"The Patna\\" captained by a drunk. One surreal night of placidity is destroyed when the boat hits a submerged obstacle. On board are five crew members and 800 Muslim pilgrims from Malaya. In a moment of cowardice, Jim jumps overboard leaving the passengers to their fate. The Naval Board revokes Jim's license as well as that of the other four members of the crew. The events of the trial are told by a French sea captain who converses with Marlowe. Ironically the Patna and her passengers survive the night being brought to port in safety.Marlowe seeks to help the complex Jim find a job despite his disgrace. The young man leaves one job after another as he travels from one remote and filthy seaport after another in Asis and the Dutch East Indies. Marlowe is most successful placing Jim in a job when Stein the respected owner of a trading post on the remote island of Patusan gives Jim a chance for employment. Stein is a brilliant collector of rare butterflies and an intellectual man of means.When Jim arrives on Patusan he is protected from harm by the use he makes of a ring given him by Stein. Doramin the old island chieftan is a friend of Stein; gradually Jim is accepted into Patusan society winning the love ofJewel the daughter of the evil old trader named Cornelius. Jim also becomes the best friend of Dormain's sonDain Warus. The natives admire Jim and dub him \\"Tuan\\" or \\"Lord\\" Jim. He becomes the white leader of the native community. Jim leads the natives in their conquering of a hated rajah; prosperity is returned to the island paradise Jim calls home. He has respect, a good woman's love and the admiration of his fellows. Jim has no desire to return to white society.Big trouble intrudes into paradise with the appearance of the odious pirate Gentleman Brown. Years later a moribund Brown will tell Marlowe the story of Jim's final days. Jim allows Brown to escape and Dain Warus is slain by the pirates. Old Cornelius proves to be a Judas collaborating with Brown in plotting mayhem and murder in the island community. Jim knows he has for the second time in his short life let down his friends! Jim bares his breast to old Doramin who shots and kills the young Englishman. This tragic death was Jim's form of repentance for his misdeeds. Lord Jim may be viewed as a symbol of the Lord Jesus Christ who dies so that others might live.Conrad takes the late Victorian adventure tale and turns it on its head! He uses multiple narrators to tell the story though the chief narrator is Marlowe (who stands in for Conrad). The novel is rich in metaphor (particularly using insect and bird imagery in referring to characters) and the pitiless apathy of nature to the fate of humanity. The godless Conradian cosmos reminds this reader of similar beliefs posited by Thomas Hardy in his many novels. Many of the passages deal with Conrad's thoughts on such topics as: honor; the human community linked in this story by the fellowship of seamen and their craft; death, love and man's place in the scheme of things.Conrad greatly influenced twentieth century ways of telling a story through innovative storytelling methods. Conrad is not an easy writer to read but he was a poet of the pen in exploring the depths of the heart of darkness pumping in the breasts of human beings. Conrad is best enjoyed by mature readers. If you have not read him since your high school English teacher forced you to do so pick up this excellent new edition by Penguin and explore Jim who is one of us!"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Just by coincidence- Conrad real name was J&oacute;zef Konrad Korzeniowski, Polish noble man, man who left his country not for England but for the sea.

I suppose most of us are introduced to the classic Marlow-narrated books when one is quite young. And one feels the same sort of deep ambiguity in reading the novella Youth, the longer Heart of Darkness and the even longer Lord Jim. - Also, one has perhaps begun to doubt the greatness of a writer whose THIRD language was English. - Let it be said: It is always reaffirmed. The \\"unreliable narrator\\" ambiguity herein is the subject of many a dissertation. I'm not covering it here because there is always - it has always struck me - a deeper ambiguity. With whom does the reader identify? Which character captures his/her imagination? It has become almost a truism that one comes to identify with the older Marlow as one ages rather than be captivated by the subjects of his stories: the younger Marlow in Youth, the mad Kurtz or the idealistic Jim. The catch lies, of course, in the fact that this older narrator is himself captivated by his younger doppelganger, in some form. I suppose one might dub it the transitive property of narration. That is to say, you perhaps identify with Marlow now, but Marlow is fascinated with \\"X\\", ergo, you are still fascinated with \\"X,\\" only removed, like Marlowe, by your own life experience.Right. Why is Marlowe, why does the reader become so fascinated with Jim? I think primarily because, as Marlow continually intones throughout the book: \\"I only knew that he was one of us.\\" - Meaning many things, but primarily for the reader, that his soul is a noble tabula rasa embarking on life before experience and defeat have crippled his idealism. It's not as simple as the question of \\"lost illusions\\" - for one thing Jim never loses his - It's more the question of whether they are illusions in the first place. As Stein (my personal favourite character herein) says:\\"A man that is born falls into a dream like a man that falls into the sea.\\"The novel is ultimately asking us what, if anything, is real. Marlow says of his last visit to Jim on Patusa:\\"It was a strange and melancholy illusion, evolved half-consciously like all our illusions, which I suspect only to be visions of some remote unattainable truth, seen dimly.\\"The power of Conrad's writing is nowhere more apparent than when in posing this question:\\"It is when we try to grapple with another man's intimate need that we perceive how incomprehensible, wavering, and misty are the beings that share with us the sight of the stars and the warmth of the sun. It is as if loneliness were a hard and absolute condition of existence; the envelope of flesh and blood on which our eyes are fixed melts before the outstretched hand, and there remains only the capricious, unconsolable, and elusive spirit that no eye can follow, no hand can grasp.\\"As we stretch out the tendrils of our imagination towards Jim and Marlowe throughout the book, we, like them, are continually dogged by, well, life. Conrad doesn't proffer any answers to the complex issues to which the book gives rise. As Marlow addresses the auditors of his story:\\"You may be able to tell better, since the proverb has it that the onlookers see most of the game.\\"In other words, the reader must find his or her own way on the high narrative seas. But it would be disingenuous of me not to reveal what kept coming back to this reader, as it does to Marlow - Those words of Stein:\\"Ah! He was romantic, romantic.\\""},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This is a fascinating book. Although it is difficult to understand, if one reads carefully and even discovers the basic plot, it is an incredibly rewarding experience. When I first read it I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry. I recommend this book to anyone who read Heart of Darkness and is interested in the further adventures of the philisopical and self-reflective Marlow. This is an awesome book."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"I did not expect to enjoy this book, and it took a little while to get into it, but I found myself enthralled--and by the conclusion, moved--almost against my will.Conrad's style here is a bit moody for my personal taste, but beautiful nonetheless. He makes brilliant use of the English language and is a master of the judicious metaphor. He draws you in as he slowly unravels his tale of an \\"overly romantic\\" man and his \\"exquisite egoism.\\"While Conrad doesn't quite compare with the great romanticists like Hugo and Dostoevsky, Lord Jim is one of the last great romantic novels, certainly far superior to almost any fiction being written today."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Joseph Conrad's stories are generally regarded as classic literature, but tend to be difficult to read, especially Lord Jim. It is a story of the downfall of a ship's officer after he wimps out at a crucial moment. Where a less sensitive individual may have found the ability to survive, Jim in haunted by his own inner guilt about the incident. He gradually withdraws from white society.The novel tends to digress and sidetrack while developing characters, so it is some way into the story before the reader learns exactly why Jim is before a maritime court, and even farther along before you discover what actually happened to the steamer Patna. Jim had a deep desire to do heroic deeds, but an error in judgement makes him a goat. The balance of the novel is on the life Jim made for himself, and on the people he associates with, as told by a narrator.The novel was first published circa 1900, and reflects the white European attitude towards native populations during that time period."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Lord Jim is the story of a young ship's officer who makes an inexplicable mistake.

Jim seeks redemption on a small Malay island, only to fail for what one of the characters calls, &quot;...a shred of meaningless honor...&quot;. A truly great work of fiction, Lord Jim is linguistically an easier read than other of Conrad's sea works, but is just as deep. A must read."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This book is decent enough, but I was not even taken with Heart Of Darkness. I thought maybe that book had been his Gatsby, or his Sun Also Rises... after all, those are my least favorite books and the most well-known books of other very talented authors. But Lord Jim is long, O Lord, it is so much longer and slower than I thought.It does have passages that reveal beauty, but most of it is dialogue within dialoge and recounting of stories and testimonials about boat behavior... it is not very funny, and it is very drawn out."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"After reading this tale about a young man who lost his honour, and who spends the rest of his life trying to reclaim that honour, I felt sad. This is a sad story about a man that we know only as Jim. Jim committed an act of cowardice when he was a mate on a ship. He was only nineteen years of age, and he made a decision to abandon what he thought was a sinking ship and he leaves about 800 passengers to face their fate alone. He can never forgive himself for this, and he personally exiles himself from his own family back in England. This may sound a bit melodramatic, but the book is not. It is beautifully written, rich, evocative and compelling. We see the type of man that Jim becomes as he's trying to get over this big mistake. He appears to be a strong and decisive man but we the readers get glimpses of the chinks in his armour. Until his final ignominious fall - What a waste of a man's life, and what a great story!"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Of all the great novelists and writers of English, Joseph Conrad was one of the most pessimistic. His view of human nature was not encouraging or, to use modern jargon, \\"life affirming.\\" Like Shakespeare, he always sought to look under the mask, to remove the polite smile of civilization and expose the red, toothy maw beneath. He often sent his characters into the \\"interior;\\" a jungle always described as a black-green hell, hot and dripping, where man was free to release the bloody and awful God within.\\"Lord Jim\\" follows this pattern to an extent, although in this novel, the character struggles to be honorable and kind. In a nutshell, an English officer - young, handsome and noble - is terribly disgraced and struggles to restore his honor. The storyteller in the novel, Marlowe, is the same character Conrad used to tell \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" It is the relationship between Marlowe and Jim, the young officer, which provides the most fascinating element in the work.Marlowe meets Jim during the latter's military hearing, where Jim is desperate to tell someone the story of his disgrace. Marlowe, a merchant captain coincidentally in port, reluctantly hears him out. This event establishes a deep, psychological bond between the two men that courses through the book. It is through this relationship that Conrad explores some of the fundamental assumptions of human nature: Is man, basically, good and honorable? Is there even such a thing as honor or \\"good,\\" or is every belief we cherish about ourselves a thin chimera, shredded easily by the base nature within?Certainly there are few \\"honorable\\" characters in \\"Lord Jim.\\" One of the great treats of the book is the flotsam of humanity that Conrad skillfully parades before the reader. Take, as an example, the merchant Chester, one of many who offer Jim extremely dubious work once he is in disgrace (in this case overseer of an island that produces tons of bat guano, which has great commercial value) or Chester's right hand man, Captain \\"Holly Terror\\" Robinson, described thusly:\\"The Notorious Robinson. The man who smuggled more opium and bagged more seals in his time than any loose Johnny now alive. They say he used to board the sealing -schooners up Alaska way then the fog was so thick that the Lord God, He alone, could tell one man from another. Holy-Terror Robinson. That's the man. He is with me on this guano thing.\\" He put his lips to my ear. \\"Cannibal? -Well, they used to give him the name years and years ago.\\"Yet, there remains something that makes Marlowe care about Jim, something he is at pains to understand himself. The fascinating thing is that most of the time Marlowe is nearly repulsed or irritated by Jim, made squeamish about shaking his hand, or will cross a street to avoid him. There is a quality in Jim's disgrace that dims Marlowe's own cherished memories of youth and high adventure. Yet, as Marlowe says repeatedly, Jim \\"was one of us.\\" This phrase changes, bit by bit, in the course of the novel. At first it means, primarily, white, English, and of a certain class. As the novel progresses, the phrase begins to take on a much broader meaning, touching something fundamental in all living men.As Marlowe puts it in describing Jim: \\"Woe to the stragglers! We exist only in so far as we hang together. He had straggled in a way; he had not hung on; but he was aware of it with an intensity that made him touching, just as a man's more intense life makes his death more touching than the death of a tree. I happened to be handy, and I happened to be touched. That's all there is to it.\\"Again, like Shakespeare, nothing is obvious and much is open to interpretation. Does Jim succeed in regaining his honor, there in a remote jungle? Did he fail? Or, perhaps, was he aiming his shot at a romantic tendril of air, never really there at all. If you read this great work, you will have the pleasure of deciding for yourself. ---- Mykal Banta"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"(...)Conrad knows how to tell a story and few have ever been told as well as this one. Lord Jim the character is very appealing but also appealing are the sea and island settings that Conrad describes so well. Those hard to resist settings as well as the tale itself populated by a host of memorable minor characters all conspire to make this an irresistable yarn. It appeals as an adventure but there is plenty to capture the discerning substantive mind as well. Conrad offers a tale about a young man who wishes to be a hero.(...)"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Conrad was 43 when he wrote this novel, number 4 on the official &quot;A&quot;-List of the Fireside Reading Club. A wonderful book. Very hard to read, requiring great concentration and continuous rereading of certain pages until things become clear. He writes in a very strange manner, with tales within tales, and continually giving the results of actions before we know what the actions are, so that we are forever mistakenly under the impression we've missed something. Nevertheless, a great, solemn and wonderful book with a nicely ambiguous ending. For instance, what would Jim have done if Doramin had turned down the chance to shoot him?It would appear he would have &quot;jumped&quot; once more, starting the chain of self-loathing and guilt all over again, though presumably in not as extreme a manner this time. It's a great novel about guilt, innocence and betrayal, and how betrayal and guilt become easier to handle with time, and innocence can create the breeding ground for both. This of course is a great simplification. Glad I decided to take a break and watch the film version of Lord Jim half way through reading the book, for although the film is not all that faithful to the book, the young Peter O'Toole is absolutely perfect as Jim. I gave a friend a brief synopsis of Lord Jim and she said it sounded like The Red Badge of Courage (which I haven't read, and, since it misses being twentieth century by five years, I probably never will). There appears to be a Dickens connection or two in Lord Jim - Cornelius is very much drawn after Uriah Heep in David Copperfield, and Conrad's habit of breaking up dialogue with dashes is very Dickensian, as well as being highly unnatural. There is also a lot of Buddhism in Conrad, but then again there is in most great novelists, and sometimes even the not-so-great."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"A story of glimpses and rumours, a flight from a shamed past, and the redemption of a brave present. This tale captures the spirit of an age when reputation meant evrything to a man, when the taint of cowardice or failed duty would drive men to the ends of the earth, to hide, or perhaps, to find themselves. Lord Jim follows the advantures of one such man across the far-flung Islands of the Pacific and Indian Ocean. The story conveys the grief of mistakenly following the herd, the despair of recognition of a guilty secret, and the hope of a new life. Conrad manages to convey the reader from the smokey verandahs of tropical colonies where a jaded traveller recounts a story of an almost legendary fugitive, to the sun bleached sands of heavily wooded tropical Islands, where the fugitive must at last face up to the challenge of men who feel no shame. Is the outcome a victory, a chance of redemption, or the passing of a sentence? The prose of Conrad contains classic descriptions, such as &quot;The night came down like a bendiction&quot; to describe the plight of a floundering ship in the blistering heat of the seas near Arabia. The narative crawls with characters of utter evil who are drawn to, and seem to feed from the basic goodness of a man who has lost his way in the world"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"The narrator (marlow) tells a story about &#34;jim&#34;. the levels of the stroy come from the different stages of jim's life and marlow connection to him at each stage, all the while marlow is living in his own time. Most of the story is told in memories revialed to friends at a dinner party. The life of jim is riviting because of the prevading sence of failure that defines him, he wants greatness so much that he succeeds at nothing. Even his death is unfulfilling. An excellent if somewhat disturbing tale. Read it to find out if you share an unattanible dream of greatness."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Humans are the only animals with a conscience and it is for that reason we go through life facing moral dilemmas day in and day out. Based in part on an actual event at sea, Jim's moment of truth comes when a ship on which he is a first mate begins taking on water and he believes its fate is sealed. Tragically, he abandons ship on a lifeboat along with the rest of the crew, not alerting the passengers going to Haj.This lengthy yarn is verbally told to an audience (we can assume) through the eyes of Marlow, so we never really know what's going through Jim's mind, although we can well imagine.I was captivated by the story in my youth, and reading it now as an aging adult I can appreciate the romantic notions held by Jim, and to which I once ascribed. Jim redeems himself in a remote jungle village somewhere in Indonesia, where he is called Lord Jim by the locals.Joseph Conrad, who was Polish but lived in Britain, wrote with a flourishing style that was entirely British -- long complex sentences that both captivate the imagination and require attention to detail. It is at times both frustrating and enlightening. It's a story that I could easily sit and listen to when told by the likes of Marlow."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"LORD JIM - I couldn't get into it - rather boring and difficult to follow.Perhaps I will give it another try at another time."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"You need to stand up for what you believe in - if it is nonviolent - or rot in purgatory."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Lord Jim is a masterpiece, encompassing almost all that Conrad has ever written. Jim is a young seaman with an exagerated feeling for his own romantic courage. Yet this courage abandons him in the moment he can prove himself, when he and his fellow officer abandon a passanger ship on the sly, believing that it will sink. Yet the ship is rescued and Jim put to trial. His fellow officers all slink away rather than stand trial, while he is stripped of his rank.He tries to flee his own notority, but in vain. Wherever he goes, soon somebody will arrive who knows him and that unfortunate incident. Until finally he escapes to a small Malayan kingdom, where no-one knows him. He becomes the benevolent de-facto ruler of the place. Until one day he commits an error of judgement. This time he faces the consequences of his error. Thus he dies.Conrad leaves no doubt that Jim dies in vain, yet in peace with himself. Conrad does not deliver a final judgement on whether Jims romantic ideals are misguided or not. The book all in all is a great lamento for the lost age of romanticism. Thus the narrator Marlow does not hide his liking of the young man and his romantic desires, yet he does not shy away from also showing the loss and desolation Jim inflicts on others by his decision for sacrifice his life for his honour.The reader is left with these conflicting emotions, there is no clean resolution to the book. And this is what makes it great.Unlike others, I did not find this book to long or to dense. Rather the long descriptive passages give the book this slow pace which is so essential to the unfolding of this narrative.Read this book and you will see the world with other eyes."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This is the central question explored by Conrad in Lord Jim. Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery, cowardice,guilt and the alternative destinies that an individual may be driven to by these qualities.The narrative can be a bit confusing at times as Marlowe relates the tale by recalling his encounters with Jim. The book reminded very much of Somerset Maugham's THE RAZOR&quot;S EDGE&quot; in style. However I believe that Maugham did a much better job of incorporating the narrator into the flow of the story. Overall LORD JIM is a wonderful classic novel that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Conrad, unlike most novelist, emphasizes the shortcomings of his heros. Lord Jim, a character of immense ability, comes to be defined by his failures. This is a monumental work of weakness, redemption, and ultimately, tragedy.This is not a book for high school students. Teachers and administrators who assign it do their students a disservice. Stick to Heart of Darkness, which contains many of the same themes and literary merit, without what to high school students is over the top \\"wordiness.\\" Lord Jim should be enjoyed at the individual's chosen time and pace."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Honour, like virtue, or like reputation, is more easily lost than regained. Such is the premise of Lord Jim. Conrad himself half-admits in his cover note that this is probably his best novel. For more than an absorbing tale of guilt, love, and adventure, it is also a book that asks big and incisive questions. What is honour? Is there such a thing in life as principle? Or rather can one live without principles and, if not, then what if one has to die for them?Jim is young and idealistic, a talented and unafraid sailor, but he has made an early mistake, a lapse that caused him to abandon ship at the wrong time. Relegated to the fringe of the mariners' community, he drifts into in a lost corner of the Indonesian islands. It is there that he becomes Lord Jim, a pacifier, an arbiter among the local folk, a living legend. The lost province of Patusan, besides, is where he finds romance in the person of the smart, attractive, and spirited half-caste Jewel. Yet as strife re-emerges in the shape of a pirate raid on the town, Jim is soon torn between the defence of his patiently rebuilt self-regard and his love and life's salvation.Lord Jim is told in two parts, both drawing minutely and to striking effect from Conrad's personal experience of the sea and the tropics. First comes the strange and paradoxical shipwreck of the Patna, a transport for Meccan pilgrims on which Jim acts as skipper. Then the book follows Jim in his subsequent drift and his reinvention in Patusan. The story is told by sea captain Charles Marlow, the same narrator Conrad has in Heart of Darkness, here however developed as a character at greater length and to greater effect. Finally, for those worried about political correctness, this is no tale of the white man come to rule over the brown, and Conrad's humanistic credentials only come out reinforced. Lord Jim is required reading for fans of Conrad and, capturing the values of a disappearing world like no other, one of the great novels of the turn of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"That title is a knock-off of Ishmael's description of Captain Ahab in Melville's Moby Dick. My guess is that Joseph Conrad never read Moby Dick. His writing career unfolded during the decades before the rediscovery of Melville. I have no doubt that Conrad would have burst with appreciation if he'd encountered the other \\"greatest\\" writer of sea tales in English or any language. Lord Jim begins to remind me of Moby Dick in chapter four, when the straightforward 3rd person narrative suddenly shifts to Conrad's typically indirect narration in the first person voice of Captain Marlow. Thereafter, Jim's whole adventure is embedded in Marlow's rambling discourse, to the utter despair of high school sophomores and middle-age armchair travelers who \\"just want the story, ma'm.\\"So who is Marlow? Is he just a convenient mask for Conrad? Why is so much text devoted to Marlow's musing about his own \\"peripheral\\" role in the story and his own unresolved understanding of Jim? Does \\"Jim\\" really exist, outside of Marlow's penchant for entertaining friends with bizarre anecdotes? (The last few chapters, cast as a letter from Marlow to a friend, would seem to be intended to 'document' the truth of the tale.) Dear reader, you've better notice that Jim is remarkably inarticulate in Marlow's account; when he speaks, he almost never finishes a sentence, never establishes a discourse on his own terms. The Jim we get to know is as much a projection of Marlow's ego as Jesus of Nazareth was of the Apostle Paul's. And then, of course, we still have to wonder about the invisible author behind the so-obtrusive narrator.What I'm arguing here is that the novel Lord Jim is about as much about the title character as Moby Dick is about the whale. Ahab's quest for ineffable vengeance by death is almost exactly parallel to Jim's quest for redemption by death. Both are ripping good adventure tales that COULD be told in eighty-page novellas or made into films from which the narrative voices are stripped and scattered on the floor of the editing studio. But just as the main character in Moby Dick is Ishmael, Marlow is the heart of obscurity in Lord Jim. To really relish either book, the reader has to take the narrator's epiphanies seriously.Are we on any kind of solid ground in saying that Melville's novel is about a socially orphaned Ishmael projecting his need for a father Ahab? Shall we then risk the notion that Conrad's novel is about a psychologically impotent Marlow projecting his need for a son on Tuan Jim? Hey, reader! If you steal my notion and write a grad seminar paper with it, don't forget to vote \\"helpful\\" on my review!This is an absurdly great novel, a book to read thoughtfully with mounting involvement until you can't attend to anything else before finishing it, a book to read again and again as your life changes perspective on itself. If you have doubts about Conrad's mastery of the English language, listen to this description:\\"... we watched the moon float away above the chasm between the hills like an ascending spirit out of a grave; its sheen descended, cold and pale, like the ghost of dead sunlight. There is something haunting in the light of the moon... It is to our sunshine, which -- say what you like -- is all we have to live by, what the echo is to the sound: misleading and confusing whether the note by mocking or sad.\\" That extended metaphor, to my mind, sets up perfectly the mood and the narrative thrust of Marlow's first long 'confessional' conversation with the disgraced sailor Jim, in which self-mockery and sadness afflict both parties.I'd forgotten, or never realized, how deep this novel is, since I first read it perhaps twenty years ago. I hope I can come upon it with the same freshness and astonishment when I read it again, perhaps twenty years from now."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Everything in this book accords to its content and very message. Joseph Conrad's style, his sentence structure keeps in perfect beat with the events of the narrative. Despite contrary opinions, I hold that the lengthy sentences were the only way to deliver to the reader the full impact of what kind of man Jim was like; Conrad exposes every thought of the man and the emotion haunting it with terrfic and horrifying truth. This book stirred and inspired the romantic side of me, and devestated me whenever I was forced to realize that it was all hopless dreaming in the end. Above all, however, the very sense of honour (a virtue seemingly forgotten in today's culture, or perhaps only in America) in Jim gave me a universal truth and direction; this story of a man that is the truest of them all to himself is the most thought- invoking book I've ever read.To all who are thinking of picking this book up- It is a rich and orientaled lilac egg, with a treasure of meat inside that can only be described as ambrosia to the last great men. It is a voyage on the mysterious and endless sea of black waters; and once the voyage has been finished, the truth of men will be held- if you're ready."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"&quot;Lord Jim&quot; marks the beginning of the modern era of the novel. It breaks away from the linear storytelling mode of the Victorian era and instead shifts back and forth in time, gradually pulling together pieces of the story from different points of view that ultimately form an understanding, but never a clear rendering of &quot;the truth,&quot; which remains elusive and for the reader to discern. It is a deeply psychological novel. The protagonist, who is known to us only as &quot;Jim,&quot; the first mate of a ship in the British merchant marine, struggles with his ultimate decision to abandon, with the rest of the white crew, a seemingly sinking ship, the Patna, which is full of Muslim pilgrims. The ship does not sink after all, and Jim must live with his fateful and enduring decision to &quot;jump&quot; from the Patna.The problem is that Jim does not live with it and reconcile himself to the choice to which he committed; instead, he continues to run away every time his past threatens to catch up with him. Finally, he finds the opportunity to redeem himself, seemingly, on a remote island. But even there, although he can escape gossipy tales of the Patna, he cannot escape himself, and therein he finally meets his resolution.We learn about Jim through the eyes of a fellow sailor, Marlow, who is the narrator of &quot;The Heart of Darkness&quot; published the year before. Marlow is obsessed with Jim, and it is equally intriguing to probe and to attempt to understand Marlow's fascination as it is to attempt to understand Jim himself.&quot;Lord Jim&quot; is a deeply disconcerting novel that, again departing from the Victorian narrative, doesn't tie up all the ends neatly for us at the end and present a satisfying resolution. It's a haunting story whose questions will linger long after you've finished reading it."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This novel requires undisturbed concentration, and rewards with a rich description of deeply moving moments. I read the book on a Gulf Coast barrier island, where I was escaping from personal strife. Lord Jim is a tragedy about the personal past becoming destiny, and how the past can destroy. This book woke me up; my life has changed. If only Conrad would lighten up for a few paragraphs occasionally..."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Published in 1900, this story by British contemporary of Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, is a little hard to read. It is &quot;Literature&quot; (though opinion is divided as to its value) because there is much more going on that just a series of events. Like the Stallone movie &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, the central character is traumatized by an incident when he lost his nerve and abandoned ship. An assignment many guilt-ridden years later gives Jim a chance to redeem himself.There are several factors that make this famous novel hard to read: the old-fashioned morals (white man superiority, social acceptability, duty), descriptions of &quot;the mysterious East&quot;, and the use of a narrator (Marlow, no, not the Humphrey Bogart character). At first I found it hard to take Jim's guilt-tripping seriously. The narrator, Marlow, is telling the story to a group of friends at a house one evening after dinner. Although these friends do not figure in the story, we see the glow of their cigars in the dark, and they act as foils for Marlow's narrative: he has to not only tell them the story but also explain how he felt about Jim and why he decided to try and help him. They in turn, together with other characters Marlow meets, comment on Jim. Using Marlow as a narrator also helps to delay the reader's discovery of what actually happened on board the &quot;Patna&quot;. At the end, even the physical Marlow fades away, and the final details of what actually happened to Jim are given in a letter from Marlow to a &quot;privileged reader&quot;, and are made up of what Marlow gleaned from a number of different sources, including the girl Jewel and Jim's manservant/bodyguard Tamb' Itam. The long drawn-out descriptions and the indirect narration allows the reader to ponder what is going on in Jim's mind, and in Marlow's. Although a modern reader will not agree or even understand what Jim did, the mysteries within the human heart remain as fascinating and as unfathomable as ever. How will we act in an emergency: stick to our duty, or save ourselves? And how would we deal with the feelings of guilt or inadequacy? Jim firmly believes that he would do his duty, and never comes to terms with the fact that he saved himself.All this makes for a challenging read. This story reminded me of Kipling's descriptions of &quot;the far-flung corners of Empire&quot;, of Somerset Maugham's stories of the Far East (especially &quot;Before the Party&quot;, a traumatic incident recalled), and of Flaubert's &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, that ironic description of a life ruined by the romantic ideals of the day."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Like most of my modern classic favorites, I first read Lord Jim as a child, it was in an Illustrated Comics issue, he was my first flawed hero. As the book explores and explains more to Jim's character, it's a no-brainer--I love the book!"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"lord jim's tale is a lesson to us all. if someone puts you in charge of hundreds of people's lives you can't just run away and leave them to die. so jim was puniched for his cowardly actions. also, he ran way when he was young,too, so this means that people dont ever really change their personalities. this is pretty true, too. i just wish jospeh conrad could have said this a bit quicker and used simpler words -- as he learnt english as a foreigner nobody ever told him not to memorize the dictionary. the story is also outof date, as nobody uses those kind of boats any more. maybe it could be updated -- made about a truck-driver or something who abandons his cargo, or a school-bus driver or somebody like that. then they could make a movie of it and we wouldn't be forced to study it in class."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Lord Jim is the novel of one man's fight against his own past and his attempt to prove himself to the world after he has made one terrible error. Like so many of books it is a story of the sea, although it is not a non-fiction story. The story opens with the fated voyage of a vessel, the ship of Eastern pilgrims which are Muslim with the ship called Patna, which Jim the head mate and the rest of the crew leave and abandon with its passengers still on board the Patna. Jim does not wish to act so shameful and dislike his actions but does so in the horror of the moment. Put on trial for his error the young idealistic Jim is stripped of his papers and is left to follow an existence avoiding his own identity and seeking mystery as he travels the entire world. Marlow organizes a meeting at which Jim goes to Patusan, a remote or ancient region. Jim brings order and strength to the area with his strength of character and leadership. The arrival of the two-faced Gentleman Brown shakes the peace Jim has created and his value systems are called into question before the horror of the ending. The horrors of the ending would be when the angry old man shoots Jim and falls dead.I really did not like the novel because simply Jim had abandoned a bunch of Muslim pilgrims aboard a ship which he thought was sinking. Then he soon discovers that the ship is not sinking. After going to trial he escapes and goes to a remote. Jim in this part of the story he had done wrong escaping and not paying his consequences. That is basically why I think this novel isn't great. It would have been efficient if Jim had not escaped and to see what has happened."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Just after the first few pages I was already a little confused. I think just because I don't think I have ever read a book that was told in third person. Eventually you get used to it, and the fact that his descriptions of almost everything is both extremely detailed and long, perhaps a little too long. I think Conrad just wants us, the reader, to know exactly what is going on and to be focused on the story. Most of Jim's story is told by a fellow seaman(a captain) named Marlow who Jim met at a meeting where Jim loses his hopes and dreams of becoming a &quot;hero of the sea&quot;.Jim is a young man who has big plans to become a sea captian, but after pushing through the ranks and becoming chief mate he makes a bad mistake. The ship he was currently boarded, &quot;the Patna&quot;, became damaged and without thinking Jim and the rest of the crew abandoned the ship leaving innocents stranded on the boat. This mistake costs Jim his life as a seaman. This is where he meets Marlow, who seems to take interest in Jim. Marlow assists Jim in finding a new way to live in Patusan, where people begin to look up to Jim as their leader.In my opinion I don't really think we are suppose to think of the story as what is so great but looking at Jim the character as what is. I think Jim is a little to full of himself and everytime the memory of the Patna arises he hides in fear like a coward. He thinks he is superhuman for stopping a bandit in his little town. He needs to realize that heros are only in fairy tales.I rated the book three stars because it was a good story, but the book for me was a little too confusing and way to long of a book to get the story he was telling across to everyone. Overall, if your looking for a something to do everynite before you go to sleep then I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"I was assigned this book through my 10th grade English course. Never before have I been forced to struggle through a book like this one. Conrad's style is adds superfluous information that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot or symbolic significance of the story. The sentences and paragraphs were too large to be dealt with rationally. One of the chapters, which is about 4 and a half pages, is one single paragraph! While the story itself was a good one, Joseph Conrad ruins it with his esoteric and over-descriptive style of novel-writing."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"It amazes me that an author who is considered so wonderful could be so dull. The book is dry and so hard to get through. I read this for a research paper on imperialism and hated it. Never before did I need to use Cliff Notes. I had to have them so I could understand the chapters as I went along. Only read any of Conrad's work if you really enjoy long, dull, winding, and pointless stories. There are so many descriptions of the setting, that Conrad necer can find the space to focus on the characters. Like Jim, the main character. I know less about him than I do about a stanger that I could meet on the street."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Many years ago I saw the movie 'Lord Jim' with Peter O'Toole and I thought it was a great flick with a lot of depth and very thought-provoking. It is one of my favorite films. So, I thought I would read the book since I've often found books to be even better than the movie. But, in this case I was sorely disappointed. The book, to me, was very hard to read with exceedingly long sentences and paragraphs and written almost in a 'stream-of-conciousness' mode as told by a third person. I found this to be true of Conrad's 'Nostromo' as well and have to admit that I failed to finish either book because of the cumbersome writing style. Perhaps, I am not smart enough to understand the writing style. In any case, may advice is to watch the movie which I found to be much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Ugh. This might have been a good book if it were half the size, but Conrad strains to keep the plot going amid the endless descriptions of sea, sky, and the characters' states of mind. Move along, move along! This ancient icon may be a monument to Conrad's mastery of his second language, and it may be a tragic psychological exploration of the universal heroic destiny (or something equally dense), but listening to it doesn't exactly keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"I debated whether or not I should write a review. After all, I only read the first 70 pages or so, after which I decided to stop slogging through this tedious novel. However, since I assume most people who would buy and read this book are doing it for their own enjoyment, I felt complelled to chime in, although I'm clearly in the minority. However, I must add in my defense that this book was initially criticized by his contemporaries as a short story that just kept rambling on with no apparent purpose, a criticism I find valid.The premise sounds fascinating - the journey of a young seaman who attempts to reconcile his dishonorable past. It sounded like it would be an interesting tale about the conflict between heroics and harsh reality. However, in the delivery of the story, I lost all interest shortly. The main problem I see is in the vivid descriptions and imagery. This, or course, is usually a good thing. However, Conrad seems to go into such great description of every little detail that it distracts from the main story. It seems that Conrad could have been just as effective by using half of the words. The non-sequitur narrative also makes it a bit more difficult to follow, although I think this could have been effective if the narrative would have been more concise and to the point.However, rather than merely blasting away at \\"Lord Jim,\\" I will at least give one alternative - \\"Heart of Darkness\\", also by Joseph Conrad. Read my take of this in my other reviews. This is a much more interesting and more enjoyable read than \\"Lord Jim\\", and about half its length. Plus, it offers a more poignant picture of Imperialism and its ideals (or lack thereof).Perhaps I will give it another go in the future, but until then I would recommend you give \\"Lord Jim\\" a pass and spend your money and time on another novel, perhaps \\"Heart of Darkness.\\""},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"I am a Sophomore being forced to read this difficult and virtually impossible book for class.

It is the voice of Marlowe which sustains that sense of wonder and reflection, and which makes of the character of Jim, and his actions, a mystery that moves us.The story of the young seaman who dreams dreams of glory and in a moment loses nerve, jumps from a ship, marks himself with the sign of cowardice, has a second part in which Jim becomes the leader, the custodian of a people in East India. And there he redeems himself, by his courage and responsibility- though his end too bears with it the ambiguity which seems to mark the questioning tone of the narrator throughout.This is the way Conrad has Marlow describe it.\\"It is when we try to grapple with another man's intimate need that we perceive how incomprehensible, wavering, and misty are the beings that share with us the sight of the stars and the warmth of the sun.\\"Conrad's greatness as a writer is in the evocation of atmosphere, and in the creation of character. It is in the storytelling methods in which different points- of - view make Reality appears as an intriguing set of complexities.This is arguably Conrad's best novel, and the reading of it is a voyage in heart and mind which uplift as it deepens our wonder at the varied and mysterious character of life."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Conrad is like a Zen Master, and while this book is not the shortest introduction to his beliefs, it is one of the most comprehensive. He shows the world as it must be to an idealist, as a sea of competing thoughts, with the highest being the heroic and self-negating that is also world-embracing. He shows how human beings suffer for not having this, and how they rise in their own estimation and thus are capable of great deeds when they have it. A good read for an airplane or other long ordeal, this book seems like rambling Victorian trash until you notice its multilayered symbolism."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Joseph Conrad's novels are ambitious.The main character 'Jim' in this story tries to 'save from the fire his idea of what is his moral identity', after he failed to rescue the life of muslim pilgrims in an apparent shipwreck.He is haunted by the guilt instilled by his father's (the good old parson) religion: 'who once gives way to temptation, in the very instant hazards his total depravity and everlasting ruin.'Jim stands alone and above the 'stupid brutality of crowds', in a world where 'a massacre was a lesson, a retribution - a demonstration of some obscure and awful attribute of our nature, which is not so very far under the surface as we like to think', where 'the Irrational lurks at the bottom of every thought, sentiment, sensation, emotion.'Joseph Conrad's vision of humanity is very pessimistic indeed.Jim's fate constitutes the bankruptcy of all that stays for 'a moral identity'. He is the lonely hero who considers that what he did was 'a more than criminal weakness', not 'honest faith' or the expression of 'the instinct of courage'.He (one of us) stood alone within the bunch of criminal whites (us) and above the innocent savages (them).For Joseph Conrad, his fate is the result of 'the implacable destiny of which we are the victims and the tools.'One of the villains in this book, Brown, foreshadows the main character in Conrad's magisterial novel 'Heart of Darkness'.This book is not without some melodramatic effects (an idyllic love affair) or superlatives ('eyes as immensely deep wells'); however, it is a great novel by an ambitious author."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Each one of us has a personal &quot;ideal&quot;...each different in its contours and each varying in its influence on our actions. For the most part, the ideal is hazy and evolving but there are elements which are distinct and rigid...and a compromise on these core principles strikes at the very root of a person's self concept. Most of us are fortunately flexible enough to &quot;adjust&quot; and carry on. For a few, however, the failure to adhere to one's own ideal is as good as a death sentence. Lord Jim is the extraordinary tale of one such extraordinary person.For me the most interesting character of the novel is the narrator himself. Jim is the focal point, of course, and an exceptional character, but quite predictable. The drama of Jim's life after the incident on the Patna is really orchestrated by Marlowe who recognizes the inevitable doom of his friend even as he tries everything in his power to stall it. It is doubtful whether he really wanted to succeed - It is clear at many points in the narrative, that Marlowe was unable to sign off on Jim's character certificate, even in his conversations with others. He represents, in a way, the conscience of the &quot;western world&quot; - the conscience Jim betrays and attempts to flee from. Jim recognizes that and so does Marlowe...but he also loves Jim...so the dilemma is really his - should he allow his friend to redeem his honour in the only acceptable manner or should he prolong Jim's onerous journey through an unforgiving life by creating an illusion of redemption, which he probably knew Jim's stint in Patusan would. He is, therefore, equally a party to the betrayal and Jim's fatal purging is also, to an extent, his own.A wonderful book and a subject equal to Conrad's literary class. The only thing that left a bad taste was the implied superiority of the Westerner's ethics and character. I guess it has to be judged in the context of a period when the &quot;sun never set on the British Empire&quot;.Vijay"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Reading Joseph Conrad is a true pleasure. His mastery of the language is unparalleled and his sentence structures, although at times dense, as often approach pure poetry. This is even more astounding given the fact that English is a second language for him. This is the story of an untested young English sailor, Jim, who has visualized himself as a man honor and bravery. When he fails miserably at the very first test of his courage, it alters all aspects of his life and his views of himself. Conrad takes us through an intricate retelling of his tale, from the point of his failure forward, through a third party, Marlow - an older sailor who befriends him."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"In the 'Author's Note' Joseph Conrad mentions the account of a friend about the comments made by a lady after having read 'Lord Jim'. She found the book morbid, he said, and Conrad wondered how she could 'have perceived anything morbid in the acute consciousness of lost honour'.While this is the novel's central theme from which flows everything else - remorse, feelings of guilt and inadequacy, the longing for atonement -, Conrad makes use of it to explore concepts of idealism and the fragility of the human psyche in the face of unexpected exigencies and paints a vivid picture of the torments they may cause, in this case for the novel's protagonist, Jim.So, is the tale of Jim's doomed trajectory after his watershed failure morbid, or is it romantic with its emphasis on honour and unfulfillable longings for ideals and purity? I find it interesting that Joseph Conrad thought it necessary to mention that anonymous quote in his opening notes to the book. Morbid? Romantic? Maybe the two sentiments are closer than one thinks in the face of unattainable ideals and the lifes lived out in their shadow.The events and the riveting tale are set in exotic locales and it has been said that Jim becoming the 'Lord' of island natives has a very loose association with real life 19th century English adventurer James Brooke, the \\"White Raja of Sarawak\\".Reading some of the other review, I noticed that this Conrad Classic is often cited as required reading in High Schools. To those who found the novel 'tedious, wordy, boring' or whatever other adjectives used to describe it, may I recommend reading it again a few decades later? Life experience and its accumulated toll will undoubtedly bring Jim's ordeal into much better perspective."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"\\"Lord Jim\\" is a morality tale and a story of individual redemption - Jim, as a junior officer in the merchant marine disgraces himself in a moment of crisis and spends the rest of his short life running from the resulting odium and attempting to redeem himself. Which he does, in his own eyes anyway, but his attempts to apply an individual code of honor when making decisions on behalf of others ends in tragedy.The first half of the story - the tale of Jim's disgrace and the immediate consequences - is the strongest part of the book, with the second half of the book (and some of the rich descriptive language) slightly drawn out and tedious in comparison. Unlike some reviewers, I did enjoy the technique of Marlowe narrating the long, drawn out tale of Jim to his peers - in my experience, this is the way men left to their own devices tell morality tales about their own craft. I have certainly heard enough similar stories about the failings or virtues of soldiers I have never met during long waits at an LZ or during deathly dull nights on watch (and told a few of my own as well) to appreciate why Marlowe would tell such a 'yarn' in this way, and why it would be so eagerly accepted by his peers.Readers who are only familiar with Conrad'sHeart of Darknessmay find Lord Jim a bit drawn-out by comparison, and it may have been an even better book if only the first half of the story was told. It is still a thought provoking read if you want to give some thought to the meaning and practical application of honor, responsibility and redemption."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Reading 'Lord Jim' I was struck by how similar it was in many ways to Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishment. Conrad published 'Lord Jim' as a serial that straddled the beginning of the 20th century, and seemed to be hellbent on experimenting with form and style. The fractured narrative is buried in letters, conversations, remembered stories, etc. Conrad's style made me think of modernism swallowing a romantic tale. It was likeTreasure Islandbeing eaten by a novel by 'Dostoevesky.' I loved it.It also reminded me of Pynchon's classic problem. Most people are familiar withThe Crying of Lot 49andHeart of Darknessthanks to both being popular books to include when introducing high school students and college freshmen to classic works of modern and contemporary literature. Both Conrad and Pynchon's bigger AND better stuff requires more time and work.This is a fantastic novel, and a regenerative work of art."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Looking for a ripping yarn about the sea? Don't look here. Conrad seems to go out of his way to limit suspense. He also gives us a protagonist we only know through layers of filtering. He also gives us a rather anti-heroic view of the world. NOT the formula of a bestseller. But that's not what he's trying to do.Contrary to popular opinion, I don't think Lord Jim is about struggling with guilt; it's about struggling with the thought that we don't matter one way or the other.Jim jumps ship and all the passengers live anyway. Jim stays on his island to protect his people and many of them die anyway.Jim can't save the day. Could he even ruin the day if he tried? Does one individual simply not mean much in the complex web of human events which seem ruled by fluke occurrences more than our Honor, Courage, and Duty? Are those romantic ideals like Stein's beautiful butterflies: only good after we've shot them and placed them in cages to admire in a purely clinical way? Jim can't shoot his butterflies and therefore he can't participate in this fallen world for very long.This book is also an attack on imperialism, it would seem. The natives' willing servitude to the white man rests less with the white man's superior intelligence and courage than with their misplaced idealizing of him. They worship Jim for a while because they just don't know him well enough yet. And not knowing people well enough yet is the very foundation imperialism is built upon."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Jim is a handsome young mate on the Patna, a steamship carrying pilgrims to Mecca. Thinking that the ship is going to sink, Jim and other crew members abandon it. The crew is rescued. The Patna and its passengers are also saved and the perfidy of the crew is thus exposed. Jim is shamed, both by the public board of inquiry into the incident, and because of his failure to act heroically. At the trial, Jim meets Charles Marlow, a sea captain, who narrates this story and becomes involved in Jim's life after the trial.Jim can never escape the fact of the Patna. Jim changes employment whenever knowledge of the event and his involvement in it overtakes him. Eventually, Jim endeavours to start a new life in a remote island community and ultimately fills his heroic destiny in death.Marlow's involvement in Jim's story is complex. He meets Jim at the trial, tries to piece his story together and then recounts it to acquaintances as an exchange of yarns. However, at the time of Marlow's recounting, Jim's story is not yet complete. The telling of the ending is in a manuscript to one of those who heard the story initially.It seems to me that this novel is very much about the significance, and the tragedy, of human life. Jim cannot change the fact of his involvement in the Patna, and he cannot escape from it. Nor is Jim apparently able to seek or accept any form of redemption. I am not convinced, really, that he is redeemed in death. I may change my mind.I am looking forward to reading other novels by Conrad and rereading this one.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Maybe my expectations were too high. I had purchased a Modern Library hardcover copy of Lord Jim for myself at a second hand bookstore for my birthday. I was really looking forward to reading it. However I struggled to finish the book, which in my edition was 400 pages long. I normally don't have a problem with books that long, and so I can't say that this was the turn-off. So, what was it that disappointed me? I never really felt empathy for any of the characters. In my book if you are looking for a classic tale of moral failure and attempted restoration try Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" or Graham Greene's \\"The Power and the Glory\\"."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This is a gem of a novel by Conrad.The core of all is the relationship between Jim feelings of guiltness and the reality surrounding him.Every attempt to reach redemption by Jim is constantly frustated by his own unforgiviness toward himself that in the end leads him to a noble but senseless death.It seems that Conrad suggests to us that reaching perfection is less important than learn to accept ourselves as we are.Nature and society in Conrad vision are terrible forces totally indifferent of individual feelings.What is left to man in this doomed struggle is a kind of heroicity in going on the same.The novel is also masterful in the use of a narrator voice which permits to assist to the developement of the tale from an &quot;external&quot; but personal point of view.The writing style of Conrad is very powerful and fascinating .5 stars for this terrific novel!"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"When I read Lord Jim for the first time as a teenager I found it boring. Many years later I now find it an amazing book. Conrad himself spent sixteen years at sea in the late 1800s, so this book is to some degree autobiographical. The version of this book that I have even quotes Conrad: \\"Every novel contains an element of autobiography.\\" In this book, the protagonist, Jim, travels to a remote region of the world, far from Victorian England. In this sense, the plot is similar to that in one of Conrad's other famous works, Heart of Darkness. Other than that book, I'm not familiar with Conrad's other works, nor am I an expert in Victorian literature, so I can't place this in its proper historical context. However, it seems like an amazingly well written story in and of itself. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Lord Jim has always been on my reading list since I was young. I had read \\"Heart of Darkness\\" three times, \\"Typhoon\\" and \\"The Nigger and the Narcissus.\\" I found the tales and Conrad's abstract way of relating the exploits and thinking processes of simple people (many or whom I could readily identify with) resonating and profound.For me the central tenet of this novel is about moral centre, what it is to a man, society, where action springs from, and how a person can loose such a thing and how ones gets it back. Jim's fall from grace could match any person from any walk of life who finds themselves in precarious circumstances where fate collides with free-will and choice -- in such a case how much does one control and how much does fate decide? If we believe Jim's case, it is not so clear cut at times... sometimes people are forced, despite their best intentions, by events on a course of action that leaves the person reeling, confused and depressed that they may have abandoned their moral wellspring. Even when sure they have not, mane may be haunted by society thinking or judging harshly a person who has been judged as not living up to a certain presumed moral order. (It is easy to see that there were probably some lesser minions in the Enron scandal, some accountants who should have possibly known better, but did not act. There are actions of soldiers in combat, who try to aim for the good, but circumstances may force horrible decisions upon them). Dramatic examples are not really so necessary, because part of the beauty of the book is that it forces common people such as myself to ask continually -- \\"what would I do in such circumstances?\\"Jim, haunted by his loss, retreats to the wilds of Sumatra and establishes a new legacy in a part of the world that does not know his past, but defines him in terms of his acts after he arrives. It is a world of noble savage offerred redemption, it is the comfort or loneliness and the profound strength in the personal knowledge that one has done right. There is no confusing societal filter or ambiguous circumstance. Jim does not make a mistake twice. He proves to society -- and most importantly, to himself -- that he has recovered his moral centre for action.--------------------One honest note for all readers. I would not classify myself as an intellectual, but I do have an abiding interest in just about everything dealing with the love of knowledge. I do not read much contemporary fiction -- narratives and philosophy and science are more my thing -- so there is no reason why the abstruse style of Conrad's writing should be off-putting at times -- but it is! And his switch between direct narration (things he saw or said) to indirect narration (things other people told him and that he now relates) can be a little hard to follow -- you often loose track of the narrative subject... is he talking about Jim? another story teller? Relax for a second and you can at times loose the narrative completely (and I defy any honest teacher of English Literature to edeny this). That is something that stops this \\"yarn\\" from being known to wider audiences. But it must be admitted. Some of the reason is the tenor of the time, it was written in 1900, but I have a lot of literature from the same age and none of it matches Conrad's narrative style for beauty and abstruse description. That is both the strength and the challenge of Conrad's writing.Also if you are not familiar or interested in the lore of the sea, or British Maritime Technology and history (I am a fanatic), then you may have a problem with this book. This edition can be very helpful for you because there is a glossary and you can look up terms such as \\"davit\\" and \\"belay pin\\" and know the difference between a \\"cutter\\" and a \\"barque.\\"In addition, there are significant historical documents in the back of the book relating to the actual historical events surrounding this story (yeah!), and literary reviews (not so hot).One should make an effort to master this text.

Still, the story contains a decent plot and interesting main character.

Stripped of his seaman's card, he must deal with overwhelming guilt while also seeking full or at least partial redemption. He ends up moving to the remote corners of the Malayan peninsula, where he becomes a trusted protector and helper of underdeveloped natives. Sound interesting? If you don't mind books written in a sluggish Victorian style, you'll probably enjoy LORD JIM.

While some of its characters may be rather one-dimensional, some outright caricatures, and the plot perhaps unlikely (but not at all so by today's often outlandish standards), the book's redeeming qualities make it highly interesting and a joy to read.For me, the prose is rather the point of reading classic literature. Most successful authors today seem to have acquired their strain of expression from Strunk & White's \\"Elements of Style,\\" with the result being concise, clear, coherent and completely lacking artistic merit, and while that may seem a harsh assessment, I am able to temper that somewhat with my admission that sometimes I (we?) prefer an easy read. However, I do not imply that \\"Lord Jim\\" is a particularly difficult one, either; I found it entertaining, reasonably-paced, and difficult to put down, with its prose utterly artistic and delightful in many passages.Those who have not read it should rectify the omission."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"If you have already listened to Ackland's reading of 'Heart of Darkness' you might suspect that it would be impossible for a rendition of a lesser-known work to live up to the impossibly high standards that the extrraordinary combination of writer and reader had set.Let me put your mind at rest, this is, perhaps to my own surprise, if anything, even better still.Ackland makes Conrad's character's voices entirely his own.The words spring to life and build pictures so vividly that TV, movies and even real life experience are all made to seem less memorable and compelling.The emotions and thoughts of the characters seem so convincing that to reflect upon the fact that this is fiction whilst you are listening to it, is to entertain the unimaginable.Like certain collections of music, the recording is unimpaired by endless replaying.If I could only ever have one audio book, it would be this one."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Conrad is not only one of the finest stylists writing in the English language, he is also one of the best to tackle moral issues. A good writer, as we know, does not preach morality, but rather conjures up bits of life that really make us think about who we are. Lord Jim is the story of a man poised to be at the pinnacle of human heroism and ability, who comes face to face with the horror of his weaknesses. Jim is a guy who gives us every sign of being a hero, a reason for pride in the human race, only to take flight at the last moment. Having committed a brutal act of betrayal in a moment of weakness, he sets off to escape his conscience - running away but never quite getting away. No matter how many good things a man can do, Conrad shows us, he can undo in a few seconds.Colonialism figures heavily into the thematic core of the book. We are made to think throughout about the issue of race and racial relations. Does the Western conscience always, if even subconsciously, think itself superior or of more worth to the Eastern? Do we overlook heinous evils in others in favor of tenuous racial connections and conformist attitudes? All of this is explored in the book, as Conrad takes us on an escape from the heart of darkness."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"I'm sailing towards the neverending........"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"It got a bit long and tiresome at times.

However the book binding started falling apart during the reading, and it was such a problem I took out my library's copy to finish the book. So I recommend being a bit skeptical about the described book condition when purchasing."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"There should be a Joseph Conrad revival. How this man could write! No less than H. L. Menken, the great critic, essayist, and scholar (of \\"The American Language\\"), of the first quarter of the twentieth Century, said of him: \\"He was the greatest artist who ever wrote a novel\\".Most know of Conrad's Polish origin -- upper middle-class -- Polish being his first language; and that he learned and wrote exquisitely in English.The first part of his life, he spent at sea, working up from seaman to mates, to skipper, in both steam and sail; and the latter part in writing fiction about it all. He was so good, Ford Maddox Ford wanted to collaborate with him, and did.His \\"Lord Jim\\" was emblematic of the White man's superiority -- although Conrad doesn't hammer at it.Jim, presented by Conrad as being in his mid-twenties, was white in everything, including white garb and blond of hair color. And more than once Conrad uses the expression in referring to him that, \\"He was one of us\\". The context here being that he was a white, educated, upper middle-class, Christian, heterosexual, and central European -- in this case English. That is we, who more than any other, ventured out in commercial enterprise and curiosity and hooked the world together.This high adventure tale, \\"Lord Jim\\", is woven by Conrad in a non-linear way, with many back cuts and forward cuts, and jarring story surprises that the author has masterfully teased us with. In the first half Jim gets into some quite serious life difficulty and the second half deals with his redemption.This is one of Conrad's \\"up river\\" stories, and in this case Jim becomes \\"Yuan Jim\\" or Lord Jim to the river people for his bravery, great character and great competence. It shows that this white man from Europe has what it takes to straighten things out among the native Javanese. But Conrad is not Eurocentric here as some of his admirable characters are Indonesians; and of his most despicable, one is a Portuguese. Conrad weighs fairly all races and ethnicities that he has come across and writes about. There is also an interestingly and originally developed \\"love angle\\" in this story.In his other yarns as well, such as Heart of Darkness, The Secret Sharer, Youth, Nostromo, etc., Conrad is not only superb at plot architecture and structure, but at character development as well as conveying the mood of the ambience; and in doing all this with the most striking and sublime -- not necessarily economical -- language.But the most important element in his writing is elusive, is often just beneath the situational surface, and is a profound one. It sometimes seems the action of his high adventure tales may be, in part, a vehicle for conveying in a symbolic way the conflicts of the broader human condition with fate and the resolution of those."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"The experience of reading Lord Jim makes it clear that the writing of the novel was interrupted. It was begun in the summer of 1898 and then taken up again after Joseph Conrad had written Heart of Darkness. The relationship of Lord Jim with Heart of Darkness is very close.The first part of the novel is concerned with the episode on board the Patna in which Jim?s failure to meet an emergency with courage marks him psychologicaly and provokes his desertion from the community of colonists. The second part is less coherently constructed, and is concerned with the adventures of Jim in the remote jungle of Patusan, where he is regarded as Lord Jim among the natives. The story is thus deeply concerned with the question of Jim?s problematic rehabilitation after his moral breach with the community. On the other hand, the novel is a pioneering work of Modernism and as such it traces the ideological and existential origins of the new writing techniques.Edward Said said that the vision of Joseph Conrad was \\"totally dominated by the Atlantic West\\". As such, is he writing technique also to be labelled as Western? Modernism?s concern to address different voices and include extraneous narratives would circumscribe this view.Early on in the novel we are confronted with different notions of spiritual salvation. The Arab pilgrims on board the Patna are said to have left their homes following \\"an exacting belief\\". But Jim is motivated by a sensualist, modernistic interpretation of the world?s hieroglyph. When he meets a storm, he feels that the elements are directed at him. The group of people who the narrative addresses is generally supposed to share Jim?s modernistic conceptions: \\"in our own hearts we trust for our salvation in the men that surround us, in the sights that fill our eyes, in the sounds that fill our ears, a and in the air that fills our lungs.\\" Thus the narrative presupposes a community of modern, Western readers, untroubled by a fixed, Eastern religious conscience. The modernistic mindset of the novel seems to have been in its origins a broadly Western affair.Captain Marlow meets Jim a month or so after the affair on board the ship and sympathises with his case. Marlow is moved by Jim?s apparent English steadfastness, his \\"faith invulnerable to the strength of facts, to the contagion of example, to the solicitation of ideas\\". How can such a perfect constitution have been wayled? What is it in Jim that announced a breaking up in the ideology of the superior white man? In order to discover the reason why this has happened to Jim, Marlow must learn to read the hidden logic behind the apparent delirium of facts. His efforts to narrate Jim?s problematic failure and rehabilitation will go to create a new narrative technique, which is going to be characerised by its slow motion and by the slavery to impressions.The interest of the novel, like at parts the interest of the Court Enquiry, is thus deeply psychological. What matters is \\"the expectation of some essential disclosure as to the strength, the power, the horror, of human emotions\\". The white man is troubled by the necessity to confront the intolerable representation of some unknown force - perhaps embodied in the colonial subject, perhaps alighting in the utmost recesses of his own soul - which might explain that pervading self-doubt casting a ray of darkness on his glorious self-reflection. It is the beginning of the end of the innocent stage of the imperial business. And the way from innocence leads to \\"the horror\\" that will be central to Heart of Darkness too.The enterprise of the empire can only be sustained on the strictest moral grounds, to be specially observed by the British and American colonialists. \\"We aren?t an organised body of men,\\" says Captain Brierly, \\"and the only thing that holds us together is just the name for that kind of decency\\". Without decency, confidence on the good purpose of the empire is lost.The breaking up of the white man?s ideology of empire is shown through Conrad?s ironic technique, which can be handled only from a consistently Western, unified point of view. It is for this reason that Conrad does not include different cultural visions in his writing, his technique does not need them to succeed.The confrontation of the dark recesses of the imperial experience threatens to disrupt established cognitive notions of truth and falsehood, of right and wrong. Jim?s moral rupture is like the crack that threatens to disestablish the whole. The \\"white man?s burden\\" is therefore touched by the tragic. Jim?s passivity at a time when heroic action was called for has nothing short of the malediction in it. Is the Empire... to be cursed? Is Jim really guilty, or has he simply been haunted?Jim?s search for rehabilitation requires no expiation to speak of. Can Jim fairly be judged as a moral agent when he has felt himself to be deprived of his will entirely throughout the affair? The whole episode acquires for him the character of low comedy, of a devilish farce. In Marlow?s retelling: \\"he had preserved through it all a strange illusion of passiveness, as though he had not acted but had suffered himself to be handled by the infernal powers who had selected him for the victim of their practical joke.\\"His story is ultimately one of failure, since for man?s life to become utterance, his life must be part of a community. It does not matter what degree or honour you fulfil, the important thing is to belong. Marlow?s series of confidences, to the reader and to other characters, on the nature of honour, courage, and regret, eventually disclose that Jim?s soul is ultimately haunted by the riddle of being: \\"A man that is born falls into a dream like a man who falls into the sea\\"."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This book works on so many levels, it's mind boggling...it's an adventure story, it's a philosophical novel of ideas, it's got brilliant use of language.

If you don't get it the first time, try again (I've read it many, many times). It's pure poetry and a genuinely profound book.

After Heart of Darkness and Youth, Lord Jim should have become a third long story about Conrad's alter ego's experiences. The Congo, the Indian Ocean, and then the Arab Sea were the locations, but then the Jim story grew out of proportion and became Conrad's longest book so far. One might argue that it is two books in one: the shame of having been caught in a cowardly act (augmented by the shame brought on the white race, as observed by one of the judges in Jim's trial), and the redemption through an act of mad blind courage.Marlow becomes Jim's patron after his disgrace. He wonders about the young man, 'one of us', a British gentleman, who broke the code of conduct and who will not believe that he is to blame. Jim has the guts to face the charges. Or is he too cowardly to do the right thing and disappear terminally? (As his judge does over undisclosed disgraces of his own, when he commits suicide, shockingly in view of his acknowledged superiority as a human specimen.)Marlow helps Jim to find a new footing, and finds new grounds for self-reproach: Jim must be a hero and Marlow knows this was unavoidable and he should have stayed away from interference. Till the end, Marlow will not cease to wonder: was the man a coward?My first picture of Lord Jim was Peter O'Toole. I watched the movie before I knew the name Joseph Conrad. After reading the novel now for the second time, I will try to watch the film again. I have a suspicion that Peter O'Toole, in all his brillance, damaged the spirit of Conrad's Jim. My recollection of an oversensitive sufferer does not quite match with Marlow's Jim, who is robust, impulsive and brooding, but does not have this saintly suffering face and expression.And a word to Mr. John Stape, the Conrad biographer, who wrote the notes, and who may know Conrad well, but who annoyed me in the notes regarding A.R.Wallace and J.W.Goethe.First of all, claiming that Jim's benefactor Stein is modelled on Wallace is nonsense. Stein is a trader who becomes wealthy in the archipelago and who is a hobby zoologist with an experience as an assistant to a famous zoologist in the islands long ago. That man may have been Wallace, but not Stein. Zero similarity of character. And by the way, 'coleoptera' are not a species of winged beetles. Elementary, Watson!And then, Goethe was absolutely not a romantic poet, Mr.Stape; better brush up your lit-history. And to translate the line from Goethe's Tasso: 'in gewissem Sinne mein' as 'unambiguously mine' is horribly misunderstood. Booh, Mr.Stape!"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"You have to read till the end of this book, and experience Conrad's utterly masterful craftsmanship of each part of the story, to fully appreciate what a phenomenal piece of work this is. To Conrad, English was his third language, which he didn't begin to speak until he had become a young man, but it is hard to think of someone who was capable of writing more beautiful prose in English. Sure, in this book, the meaning of some of his sentences are, here and there, hard to fathom, which, I think H.L. Mencken suggested, had something to do with English not being his first language. There are, of course, other imperfections in the book. But Conrad's ability to make the scenes he describes seem very real, to make them come alive for the reader, is extraordinary. His description in the last portion of the book,of the physical scenery as well as the danger and emotional tumult of life in the remote Indonesian or Malaysian community of which Jim becomes leader, must rank near the very top of the best writing in the history of fiction."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"By Giordano Bruno (Wherever I am, I am.) - See all my reviewsThat title is a knock-off of Ishmael's description of Captain Ahab in Melville's Moby Dick.

He draws you in as he slowly unravels his tale of an \\"overly romantic\\" man and his \\"exquisite egoism.\\"While Conrad doesn't quite compare with the great romanticists like Hugo and Dostoevsky, Lord Jim is one of the last great romantic novels, certainly far superior to almost any fiction being written today."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Of Conrad's style in Lord Jim, I will say simply that it is a shining example of a master craftsman at the height of his art-form. Besides the stylistic triumphs, what makes this novel so wonderful is the central irony which balances itself upon the peak of morality. Is this novel a song of heroic redemption, or the sad dirge of a soul which tortured itself? Conrad certainly made it both. After a life of torturing himself, for his percieved cowardice and shortcomings, Jim recieves a chance at redemption. For his lonely display of honor and bravery, he recieves a bullet in the chest. Yet, what was his other option? He could run from his toubles again and choose life. The reward for this action, another start somewhere else where he would torture himself the rest of his life or until he failed again, and everytime he starts over an even greater weight is placed upon his soul. In the end, Jim had no choice. He was compelled to act because the alternative of the life of escape which he had been living was already worse than the death his actions would invite. In this conflict, Conrad displays the true murderer of Jim. The morality which was forced upon him since birth. Unable to live with the guilt any longer, Jim chooses suicide. Where, does the guilt come from. Who could not see Jim as anything but a relatively &quot;good&quot; man who had his own failings like all of humanity. Did he deserved to be tortured his entire life for them? What does that say about our own morality?"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This book is so powerful, it had me thinking for days and weeks after reading it. The more I thought about it, the more things I came to discover. One thing you should ask yourself is whether or not Conrad approves of Jim's actions throughout the book, after the Patna incident. Is it worth giving up everything to regain your honour? And is Jim's end really a tryumph? I beg to differ. In fact, I came to the conclusion that Conrad couldn't have approved of Jim's actions (after the Patna incident). (Marlow comments at the end of the book: &quot;He goes away from a living woman to celebrate his pitiless wedding with a shadowy ideal of conduct.&quot;) What will confuse many readers is that Marlow appears both as the narrator and as a character in the book. As the narrator, Marlow does not approve of what Jim is doing to himself, and finds the whole idea of honour overrated. On the other hand Marlow-the character does nothing but -contribute- to Jim's destruction. It's quite puzzling to see him in the role of Jim's friend when he does nothing to help Jim spiritually, to bring him back on the right track. He sees Jim torment himself like that and what does he do? At some point he comments: &quot;for a second I wished heartily that the only course left open for me was to pay for his &lt;Jim's&gt; funeral&quot;. Umm, ya, that's a nice friend... By no means will anybody get me to believe that Jim's end is positive, a tryumph over death, the solution to his problem... because it isn't. It isn't 'normal' for a young man to suffer like that, it is not 'normal' for a young man to see death as his only solution. He had his whole life ahead of him and enough opportunities left to regain his honour, even after the pilgrim episode. IMHO. I'd be glad to see more reviews, 'hear' more comments on this."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"LORD JIM is the story of an ordinary man who commits what may or may not be an act of cowardice and spends the rest of his life trying to atone for his sin. What makes this story extraordinary is the difficulty the reader has assessing the nature of the original act and then judging whether Jim has been punished enough. Joseph Conrad does not make it easy to gauge accurately either the man or his act since we can see the act filtered only through the lens of a narrator who is too close to the case to be judged reliable.LORD JIM is a novel of adventure and many read it on that basis, but lurking beneath the surface of a simple act is, as in so much of Conrad's fiction, a bewildering complexity of issues that tap into the deepest recesses of why people do what they do and how others can fairly judge them. Marlow is the narrator who attends the trial of a crewman Jim accused of abandoning his ship during a storm when he thought it was sinking. When all the ship's officers leap into a lifeboat they abandon the more than eight hundred passengers below decks. Jim joins them, and all are later picked up by a French trawler only to learn that their ship did not sink and in fact was safely towed to port. All the officers, except Jim, escape punishment either by running away or pleading illness. Only Jim decides to speak out publicly in his defense, but of course there is none, so he is found guilty and stripped of his seaman's certificate as punishment. Marlow sees the trial and decides to follow Jim around the world to get the truth. These are the bald facts, but what Conrad does with them is to invest them with emotional and psychological issues that resist easy analysis.To begin with, Conrad emphasizes Jim's ordinary state of being, by repeating that Jim is \\"one of us.\\" This statement occurs so often that it becomes a mantra, inviting speculation as to what sense he is one of us. Whoever the \\"us\\" is, Conrad implies that the \\"us\\" must have had a standard of justice in which one size fits all. No one at the board of inquiry seems particularly upset that Jim was merely following the captain's orders to abandon ship nor that his record was otherwise flawless. The board judged Jim by an inflexible code of honor and found him wanting. Conrad, in his description of Jim as a maritime Everyman (no first name, a flat character who no past, present, and now no future), makes it easy to condemn the board's overhasty verdict to condemn Jim for an act that had mitigating circumstances. As Marlow gets to know Jim, he acknowledges that the more he knows, the less he understands. Conrad sets up a straw man in Jim. Because so many people, including Marlow, hold Jim under so many lenses, the images that result are often contradictory. The only constant is Jim himself. During the trial, and later during the climactic encounter with the natives who call him Lord Jim, Jim continues to attempt to see himself in the simplest manner possible. He knows that he cannot possibly be all the Jims floating on everyone's lips, so he determines to be the Jim who should have stayed on board the deck of a sinking ship. This Jim is willing to take responsibility for his actions. When he unwisely allows the dastardly Gentleman Brown to escape his richly deserved fate, he makes a colossal leap of faith: he will pay now for all sins of his past. In his death, Conrad suggests that this leap of faith may be the only trait that distinguishes reprobates like Brown from ordinary men like Jim who may not be so ordinary after all."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This is a richly-woven story of redemption as told by a third person, Marlow. The tale has exciting high points but, honestly, you do have to struggle with the text to see this book through to the end. It ain't easy.Now that my struggle is over, I am still trying to figure out why Marlow is so infatuated with Jim. And, why is the group of men smoking cigars on the verandah listening so intently and for so long to Marlow's long-winded story?Sure, the story of Jim is interesting. It explores classic themes of honor and courage. Jim is definitely a headstrong figure. To a point. But I actually found Marlow to be the more engaging character in an odd sort of way.Why?Well, it seems from his commentary that Marlow has more or less dedicated his life to following Jim's exploits around the South Seas. It's not normal. I can understand everything Jim does but I can understand very little of what Marlow does. What is his raison d'etre?Marlow also keeps referring to Jim as \\"one of us\\" as if Marlow's life is somehow comparable to Jim's.I am interested to know what the heck Marlow has done to include himself in the company of a great man like Jim! Is Marlow, too, keeping a dark and hurtful secret buried deep within his breast? Which begs the question: what secret does Conrad himself hold tight?

The ship collides with something in calm waters and is in imminent danger of sinking. Much to Jim's dismay the Captain and crew decide to abandon ship leaving the pilgrims to fend for themselves.

I remember being assigned this book as a junior or senior and bluffing my way through without really reading it. I even got a literature degree without reading it. Finally, after many years, I felt that I should give the novel its due, and picked up a copy.The novel is the story of Jim, an overly romantic seaman, who during a moment of crisis loses his courage. He is first mate on a pilgrim ship bound for Mecca and after the ship collides with an unseen object and is in danger of sinking, he abandons ship leaving the human cargo to fend for its own. He is dogged by his guilt and spends years drifting around the East trying to find the right occasion by which he might redeem himself. Eventually he ends up in the forests of Malaysia where he becomes a god-like protector of the indigenous people and is given the title of &quot;Lord.&quot; But no matter how successful Jim might appear to his followers, and to the omnipresent narrator of the novel, he still cannot forget his moment of weakness. Jim's self-centeredness prevents him from moving forward with his life and condemns him to a life of voluntary exile, all the time proclaiming that he is not good enough to live in the outside world. He is willing to risk all future happiness and fortune to be able to face his demons once again without losing his nerves. Ironically, it is his last &quot;heroic&quot; act that destroys all the good that Jim has painstakingly built up, essentially bringing chaos to his Eden like world.Published at the very beginning of the twentieth century, Lord Jim, in many ways anticipated the experimental writing techniques that would be brought to fruition in the works of Joyce, Faulkner, and others. Conrad is not only interested in telling a tale, he is interested in different points of view, nonlinear narrative techniques, and solving the complexities inherent in a &quot;tale within a tale&quot; formula. Although some readers might find Conrad's prose a little tedious, perseverence and careful reading will reveal passages of unexpected beauty that will cause the reader to pause -- then slowly re-read."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This is the fifth book I have read by Conrad, and through these readings I have come to deeply appreciate his literary power and the perfection of his stories. Conrad has the skill to border about several similar subjects, without repeating himself. \\"Lord Jim\\" is truly a Shakespearean tragedy, mainly because of the Shakespearean nature of the main character. Jim is a young naval officer with high hopes of heroism and moral superiority, but when he faces his first test of courage, he miserably fails. While 800 Muslim pilgrims are asleep aboard the ship \\"Patna\\", Jim discovers that the boat is about to sink. There are not sufficient lifeboats for everybody. Should he wake them up or not? He gets paralyzed with fear and then sudenly jumps into a boat being set up by the rest of the officers. He is taken to trial and disposessed of his working licence.Ashamed and humiliated, Jim dedicates the rest of his life to two things: escape the memory of that fateful night, and redeem himself. This agonizing quest to recover his dignity in front of his own eyes leads him to hide in a very remote point in the Malayan peninsula, where he will become the hero, the strong man, the wise protector of underdeveloped, humble and ignorant people. Jim finds not only the love of his people, but also the love of a woman who admires him and fears the day when he might leave for good. The narrator, Captain Marlow (the same of \\"Heart of Darkness\\") talks to Jim for the last time in his remote refuge, and then Jim tells him that he has redeemed himself by becoming the people's protector. Oh, but these things are never easy and Jim will face again the specter of failure.Conrad has achieved a great thing by transforming the \\"novel of adventures\\" into the setting for profound and interesting reflections on the moral stature of Man, on courage, guilt, responsibility, and redemption.Just as in \\"Heart of Darkness\\" the question is what kinds of beings we are stripped of cultural, moral and religious conventions; just as in \\"Nostromo\\" the trustworthiness of a supposedly honest man is tested by temptation, in \\"Lord Jim\\" the central subject is dignity and redemption after failure.A great book by one of the best writers."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"This is a fascinating book.

This is an awesome book."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"After reading this book (along with several other of Conrad's books) I am under the impression that Joseph Conrad may very well be my favorite author. Here is another masterpiece, a deeply incisive study of character of the motivation and the ultimate failure of all high-minded ideals. Granted my own personal world view falls directly in line with this realization and therefore prejudices me towards anything the man might write, but, when considering such a lofty title as 'favorite author' one must regard other aspects of the novelist's creation. As with the others, Conrad wins by the power of his stories.Lord Jim is my least favorite of the the four books I have read by Conrad. The story is rather scattered: a righteous young man does something wrong that he holds himself far too accountable for and the public shame the action brought him exaggerates the reality of his failure and makes him believe the rumors swirling around about his so-called cowardice. He spends the remainder of his life trying to reclaim his self-regard, mostly exaggerating his own importance in matters he hardly understands. His goal is to liberate the primitive people of the jungle paradise he inadvertantly finds himself in (due to an effort to escape every particle of the world he once inhabited) and his once high-minded ideals and regard for himself lead him to allow those people to consider him almost a God.Jim likes being a God and considers himself a just and fair one. He treats everyone equally and gives to his people the knowledge of modern science and medicine as well as the everyday archetecture and understanding of trade that those primitive folks would otherwise be years from comprehending.Of course everything ends in failure and misery and of course Jim's restored name will be returned to its demonic status, but the whole point of the novel seems to me that one can not escape their past. Jim, for all his courage in the line of fire has tried to avoid all memory of the once shameful act of his former life and by doing so becomes destined to repeat his mistakes.Lord Jim is far more expansive than the story it sets out to tell, ultimately giving a warning on the nature of history and general humanity that only a writer of Conrad's statue could hope to help us understand.If there is a flaw it is not one to be taken literally. Conrad was a master of structural experimentation and with Lord Jim he starts with a standard third person narrative to relate the background and personalities of his characters and then somehow merges this into a second person narrative of a man, years from the events he is relating, telling of the legend of Jim. It is a brilliant innovation that starts off a little awkward and might lead to confusion in spots as the story verges into its most important parts under the uncertain guidence of a narrator who, for all his insight into others, seems unwilling to relate his personal relevence to the story he is relating.Nevertheless (with a heartfelt refrain), one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"A Grand Ungodly Godlike Narrator, November 22, 2008By Giordano Bruno (Wherever I am, I am.) - See all my reviewsThat title is a knock-off of Ishmael's description of Captain Ahab in Melville's Moby Dick.

Although I was too young to understand much, it intrigued me then as it intrigues me now - this prototypical theme about one who leaves the numbing monotony of uninspired domestic life for the romanticism of going to sea and distant lands. Certainly, the romanticism of youth and then the subsequent disillusionment of experience, in this case a bitter twist of fate, was a subject of grave concern for Conrad, and that concern is sounded in the powerful language that comes out through the narrator Marlow. As Marlow relates, \\"There is a magnificent vagueness in the expectations that had driven each of us to sea, such a glorious indefiniteness, such a beautiful greed of adventures... in no other kind of life is the beginning all illusion - the disenchantment more swift - the subjugation more complete\\". Or this: \\"Yet you, too, in your time must have known the intensity of life, that light of glamour created in the shock of trifles, as amazing as the glow of sparks struck from a cold stone - and as short-lived, alas.\\" Stein, the merchant and butterfly collector had an enigmatic answer to this romanticism: \\"in the destructive element submit.\\"Of interest here is the historical context within which this book was written. It appears as if an actual historical incident, the abandonment by the crew of the British ship Jeddah carrying pilgrims bound for Mecca in 1880, serves as a basis for the story. It was during a time when Great Britain had amassed a great overseas empire and had come to dominate the trade routes to the East; and also when racist attitudes abounded, supported by the science of the day. At one point, Marlow pauses in his narrative to wonder if all this enterprise into foreign lands could have arisen solely out of greed, and cannot come up with any other motives other than to benefit loved ones back home.Jim's downfall has a great deal to do with the fringe characters that cross his path. None of the crew of the Patna seem to be anything but self-indulgent and self-serving; exactly the kind of people one would expect to run for their lives rather than face a responsibility for something larger than themselves. It was Jim's fate as a youth to suffer the inaction of being pulled along with these cowards. Marlow went out of his way to extend his sympathy to Jim, seeing in him a different sensibility, as \\"one of us\\". But then again, although it's not exactly clear - \\"obscured in mists\\" as Marlow would say, he had something in common with that crew. He seems to have had his head in the clouds, thinking about his own adventures rather than his duty to the passengers. Later, when he is banished to Patusan and becomes a revered figure to the natives there and is on his way to redeeming himself and finding love - at least in that one corner of the world - he crosses paths with two outcasts, the egomaniac pirate Gentleman Brown and the abject Cornelius.

Published in 1900, the novel feels like the start of the modern literary era in both its loose, ambling structure and its questioning of the base convictions of right and wrong still girding society today. \\"Lord Jim\\" hasn't lost much of anything in the 105 years since it was published. If anything, it's more relevant than ever.Who is Jim? Is he a hero, a coward, or a victim? Is he all three? Part of the problem pegging him is the fact the fellow doing most of the talking about him, cagey Marlow the narrator, doesn't seem too sure himself. That ambiguity is another way in which the novel is modern. At one point Marlow even seems to suggest Jim is no more than a figment of his imagination.\\"He existed for me, and after all it is only through me that he exists for you,\\" he tells his anonymous group of listeners at one point. It's interesting Marlow is only identified by his last name and Jim by his first. Are they two halves of the same person?While playing with the metaphysics of identity and of right and wrong make \\"Lord Jim\\" vital and important, Conrad's deep engagement in humanity's many odd and nasty facets makes it fun. He creates a myriad of secondary characters inhabiting the backwaters of the West Indies, of varying moral shadings, finding amusement in even the cruelest.One singular nogoodnik tells Marlow he wants the disgraced Jim to work for him on a barren island harvesting guano. It's not much of an offer, he knows, but there is one benefit: \\"Anyhow, I could guarantee the island wouldn't sink under him - and I believe he is a bit particular on that point.\\"\\"Lord Jim\\" is a great book not for its message so much as its lived-in depth, a sense we are really there on Marlow's steamy veranduh amid casuarina trees or aboard a creaking brigantine sailing placid under a crepuscular sky. Conrad really engages you as a reader, and while he plays with the narrative structure, and allows the story to drift quite a bit, often frustrating me and other readers at least the first time through, the book remains engaging and illustrative about both its theme and subject.Dark? Yes, but not oppressively so. In a way, Conrad is taking a humanistic approach to a nihilistic question, asking what good notions of honor and glory really do mankind when most of us aren't fated to join life's immortals. Do we have the right to expect more of ourselves than life itself allows?At one point, when a minor character obsessed with his sense of honor kills himself, Conrad asks a burning question worth keeping in mind: \\"Who can tell what flattering he had induced himself to take of his own suicide?\\""},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"Joseph Conrad's tale of Lord Jim is a warning against taking yourself too seriously, expecting too much of yourself, failing to forgive yourself.Jim is such a noble character but is he just another manifestation of Dostoevsky's 'The Idiot' - too honourable to be a survivor. Of course Conrad conspires greatly against Jim. With Jim's first great mistake - the one that, in his eyes, blighted him forever, it is as if God himself pardoned Jim, absolved him of any blame because there were no victims. And yet Jim cannot put the unfortunate aside push on with an effective life. But that's not quite true - eventually he does find a place for himself and the rest was up to Conrad's masterful plotting.I also enjoy immensely the method Conrad uses of telling a tale through the eyes of an observer - Marlowe. While we are all participants in life, we are also very much more observers - if we care to observe.other recommendations:'Victory', 'Chance' - Joseph Conrad'Virgin Soil' - Turgenev"},{"Title":"Lord Jim","review":"From the vantage point of the 21st century, I often wonder about the life of a sailor in the 2nd half of the 19th century, when ports of call existed on every continent, and commercial trade conventions were long established, and far-off exotic locales were familiar places to the peripatetic seaman. How different is the local culture and life of the great seaports than those land locked communities in the heartlands, far from either river or railroad. How many wandering storytellers come to such communities with stories of extreme duress and moral complexity? What do such isolated communities know and understand of the complicated, difficult, and often imperfect ethical conundrums that confront the worldly wise and often, world weary in their wanderings across the seas.Lord Jim is a fascinating, complex psychological character study of someone who bore on his back the burden of absolute, utter disgrace, yet who longed for an opportunity to demonstrate, at least to himself, if no one else, that his one great moral failure should not define the whole of his character. And thus he remained true to himself, to the bitter end. When all his colleagues ran off to avoid standing up and being held accountable, exposed to public scrutiny, public contempt, and public ridicule, Jim alone answered for his actions to the high maritime court. And when he had made that ill-fated bargain with a human devil incarnate, Gentleman Brown, that turned out SO badly, once again, he alone, stood up before the high judge and accepted his responsibility, and the final, inevitable decree. He could have fled, but instead, like Socrates, he saw nothing to flee to. He had acted thusly, he accepted his responsibility, and he held himself accountable to others whom had placed their faith and trust in him.This is NOT a novel about cowardice! It is much more complex than that. Each of us, in the screenplay's of our own lives, tends to write ourselves as the heroic protagonist who always wears the white hat, and we always justify, in one way our another, the actions we take and the decisions we make. But how many of us are truly tested--in the crucible--where the urge and impulse must be weighed against the notion of obligation and duty, and the kind of decision that judges on a high court might make, after hearing all the evidence, after taking the time for proper deliberation--is demanded in the twinkling of an eye. Which of us could always make the right decision, every time, when confronted with such desperate situations--and examining our own characters honestly--where does that leave each one of us. Conrad argues that it should lead us like Marlowe, who has seen much of the world, and is willing to see the good in others who were tried in the balance and found wanting. Marlowe believes in the possibility of redemption, of growth and of hope, and it is his faith alone that finally persuades Jim that his life may yet have some meaning--that he may yet transform his one great failure into a kind of transcendent moral victory. And--alas, it is Jim's striving for moral perfection that, in the end, is his own undoing. For not every one of us is deserving of the kind of faith that Marlowe had in Jim. Faith and trust in a true psychpath like Gentleman Brown would be a bad bet every time. It's like the folklore of the frog and the scorpion--in the end, the scorpion will sting the frog, every time, because it is his nature. But Jim had known desperation, and he knew he had no right to claim any moral high ground, having failed once, himself, and so, he was willing to trust Brown, to take him at his word, as a gentleman. All his companions knew Brown for what he was--but Jim was blind to it--he saw himself in Brown, and was moved to mercy because he himself had been the object of Marlowe's mercy. This is complex stuff! And Conrad wants you to think hard, and seriously about it, for, as Immanuel Kant has written, the only absolute is the Moral Imperative. But the certainty of Moral absolutes is always fleeting--we are ALWAYS crucified on the poles of two competing perspectives-two equally valid and totally opposing propositions--and the real challenge to courage is to chose one, and let it be on YOUR head.So, Jim's failure as a crew member of the ill fated Patna was NOT cowardice--it was simply going along with the others. It was herd behavior. We find this principle expressed in the New Testament in the form of: \\"I have not come to bring peace but a sword! For I have come to set a man against his father... And one's foes will be members of one's own household.\\" It was Jim's going along with the rest of the crew in their abdication of their obligations that was his failure--the crew knew that he did not feel as they--they talked openly of throwing him out of the lifeboat--he stayed awake all night gripping the tiller as a club lest they try it. No, Jim's failure on the Patna was in not saying NO! to the rest of the crew, and staying behind, living up to the duties, and the responsibilities he had agreed to undertake when he signed on. By blindly following the leadership of the herd, he betrayed himself, the Pilgrims, the Ship owners, indeed, all of the civilized world.This book is easily misunderstood if you do not take the time to consider what Conrad is saying, carefully. Any of us is capable of moral failure or corruption, given the right circumstances. And he shows us how even the motivation to never make another mistake of that sort can itself lead to a fatal weakness. In this, he has identified the original Catch-22 long before Joseph Heller. Conrad is one of the deepest, and most profound writers in western literature, and he requires his reader to work a little; but the investment is worth it. The candle is worth the game."},{"Title":"Victory in the East: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial German Army","review":"Save your time, save your money. This book is an amateur attempt. If you want some good history find Norman Stone's Eastern Front - a classic. Skip this. Too bad there is no zero rating - I had to score it a One."},{"Title":"Victory in the East: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial German Army","review":"In a very few pages, the author has given us a quick overview of the strategy and tactics of the Imperial German Army on the Eastern Front in World War I. There is not a lot of new ground broken, but I don't think that was the intent of the author anyway. Additionally, I was fascinated with reading about the campaigns in Rumania, the Balkans, and the Baltic republics, places where conventional histories of the First World War usually ignore what happened. Those brief chapters alone are worth the price of this book, and I highly recommend it because of them. You'll learn something new, particularly about the formation of the freikorps, which had such a devastating effect upon German history in the time period shortly after this book comes to a close."},{"Title":"Victory in the East: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial German Army","review":"I enjoyed reading &quot;Victory in the East&quot; which effectively covers the little-known fighting on the Eastern Front in WWI.This book by Michael Kihntopf fills in the blanks and even goes into the fighting that took place after the Armistice ending hostilities on the Western Front. Most other accounts if they even mention the Eastern Front focus only on the Battle of Tannenburg which took place very early on in East Prussia.Place names in Russia familier from Napoleonic or WWII battles appear in this account. We learn that the Germans advanced almost as far into Russia in WWI as they did in WWII.Unfortunately the rather crude maps make it difficult to follow the descriptions at times which is why I am docking the book one star."},{"Title":"Victory in the East: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial German Army","review":"Very Poor - that is the only way I can describe this book.

This book is packed with useful information and does not waste the reader's time with flowery descriptions and sentimental musings. Directions to fishing waters are clear and concise. Thorough maps are included. Poor fishing areas are identified as such and may save the reader from fruitless efforts. Guide includes directions and descriptions of waters which may be fished from the roadside as well as those requiring a day-hike or multi-day pack trip to reach. Highly recommended for novice and expert angler alike."},{"Title":"Fishing Yellowstone National Park","review":"Recently, I managed to get the hay baled, unload several cow-calf pairs at the sale barn, and endure a screaming diatribe from one of my neighbors who was desiring to cut a road across the corner of my property for ill-defined reasons involving an elk hunting camp. When I demurred, spittle flew out of his mouth and he became quite agitated. For a moment, I thought I might have to get the Mossberg. In the end, he promised to make things so hot for me with our County Board that I would think the devil himself was after me. Against this backdrop, I decided it was a sovereign time to go fishing in Yellowstone.I have mixed opinions about the worth and accuracy of some Falcon Guides, but not this one. Armed with this guide, I wended my way through the bunkers of industrial tourism that blight our otherwise wondrous first national park, dodging the hatch of RVs and uncurious flabbos that choke the roads in high season. I settled first on a stretch of the Lewis River, which Merriwether Lewis never actually saw. It fished about the way the author said it would, and his descriptions were accurate and clear.Of course, anyone can write a roadside fishing guide but what about the pristine streams and creeks accessible only by foot or horse? I shouldered my pack and hiked twenty miles into the backcountry in search of some of the original strain of cutthroat. Again, his descriptions of Wolverine Creek and the upper Snake were clear and easy to follow. I used various atttractor patterns recommended by the author and some that weren't. Each produced an equal and abundant share of fish. I finished my week with a couple of nights on Pebble Creek in the NE corner of the park, fishing the undercut banks and big pools in the manner the author suggests. The cutthroat were plentiful, surprisingly sizeable, and not too selective. As a bonus, I saw a wolf pack cruising across the valley as I made my way down the stream bank.The short sections on ethics are a pleasure to read. Use barbless hooks at all times and don't poach another angler's water if he's clearly fishing a stretch you covet. Get out of bed earlier next time. The author occasionally gives short shrift to some of the more difficult trails in the Park, but if you want to get away from your fellow sportsmen and enjoy Yellowstone the way Colter did, take such damnings with a grain of salt. Overall, his impressions of the park's waters and their fishability mirror my own over the last 15 years or so. Also, he is not kidding when he estimates the number of fisherman who crowd popular sections of river, such as Slough Creek and the Yellowstone near Hayden Valley. Leave these waters in high season for the Zebco crowd and plan on fishing them in the off-season."},{"Title":"Fishing Yellowstone National Park","review":"I had purchased this book and one other for my trip to Yellowstone.

His analysis, although sometimes a tough read, is well planned and descriptive, and he thoroughly explains his original thesis on what he believes is the best course for Africa to embark on both politically and economically. His discussion of current and past trends and efforts at the development and democratization of Africa is very informative, original, and well-researched. Ake's use of statistics and examples of events are very accurate and do not appear (on further research) to be misused or taken out of context to misrepresent what has occured and is occuring as fact.

I have spent a few years in Africa and I can say that there are far more important problems for us to be focusing on. Blaming the colonists will give us someone to point the finger at, but it doesn't solve the immediate issues that Africa faces.To be fair, this book was published about twelve years ago, and the author died in a plane crash before he could finish editing the book.Overall, I was impressed with the amount of research and the depth of thinking, but I do not agree with the Ake's focus."},{"Title":"A History of American Law: Third Edition","review":"It is really great book.DON'T BUY IT HOWEVER, FROM \\"ADAM TOH\\" BOOK SELLERS.

Within each part he segments chapters into readable legal topics. (i.e. Corporations, Crime and Punishment, etc). In that way, the reader gets an understanding of the period and how it effects all sorts of law, before going onto another time period and seeing how other areas of the law grew and affected other areas.Although the republic split from England, the author reviews how attached the our legal system continued to be and all the reasons why this was so. (All the legal treatises and cases were only printed about English law for quite some time). He also discusses why certain areas of the law, nonetheless, quickly grew away. (i.e. the are lots of navigable seaways in America, not so many in England). This is just a small sampling of a tremendous source of information.The study of law present a tremendous number of apparent inconsistencies, non-sequitors, and just beyond the reasonable conundrums.

The premise of the book, that progression in law coincides with progression with social as well as economic factors, is extremely well-founded and confirmed throughout the book. It was fascinating to re-visit cases I had studied this past year through the lens of both historical and social contexts. The true genius of this book, however, is that you don't need to be a lawyer or a law student to appreciate it. To be sure, those with a greater understanding of American jurisprudence will likely get more out of this book, but I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in not just how the American legal system works but more importantly WHY it works the way it does. This book is truly a treasure, and I continue to be amazed with Professor Friedman's exhaustive and comprehensive research. I look forward to re-visiting this book throughout the rest of law school and through my legal career."},{"Title":"A History of American Law: Third Edition","review":"I read the book before I entered law school in order to get a general understanding of the history of American law. Professor Friedman's comprehensive work is of little use to law students (or anyone entering law school) looking for a practical guide to the study and practice of law. Frankly, you can get through law school just fine without ever picking up this book.That said, you would be doing youself a great disservice. Friedman's work is so comprehensive (covering over 400 years of American law, from the importation of the English legal system during the colonial period to late 20th-century corporate law) that it would be impossible for anyone to read this book and not come out with a better understanding of *WHY* our legal system is the way it is today.Besides, Friedman's engaging narrative style makes for fun reading. \\"A History of American Law\\" and Chemerisnky's \\"Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies\\" should be required reading for anyone who has the least bit of interest in the American legal system."},{"Title":"A History of American Law: Third Edition","review":"I went to law school years ago and wish they had given me this information then. It puts everything in context. Friedman is an excellent author and is thorough and insightful. I highly recommend this to anyone with any interest in the law."},{"Title":"A History of American Law: Third Edition","review":"This book is a masterpiece of scholarship. It covers the law of the United from origins to contemporary times, thourgh clearly defined chapters/sections and very lucid writing. To any person interested in American law and/or history, this is a must read."},{"Title":"A History of American Law: Third Edition","review":"I'll keep this brief: The title says it all. If you are looking for an excellent, in-depth introduction to the history of law in the U.S., then look no further. Tremendously readable, wonderfully informative, and above all, engaging; this book warrants not just one reading, but several. Read this book, study it, and you'll have taken an important first step towards not only a good layperson's understanding of the legal history of the U.S., but also an important step towards becoming an expert.Yes, it's that good. If a concise, yet richly detailed legal history is what you seek, this is it. Buy it and read it; you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"A History of American Law: Third Edition","review":"Prior to reading this book, I had little understanding of the law. I saw it as a single, solid body of tradition, grounded in specific documents and interpreted through the operation of the legal system. My understanding was in some sense true, but this book opened my eyes to the vast complexity and richness of tradition woven into the system of law in the United States. I learned about the different legal systems, such as admiralty, chancery, equity, and common law, and how these systems operated historically in their respective regimes of power. I learned how common law largely came to subsume the other courts, how Napoleonic law relates to common law, and how Napoleonic systems developed in several states and changed to take on more common law characteristics. Above all Friedman impressed on me the basic premise of his book:\\"Despite a strong dash of history and idiosyncrasy, the strongest ingredient in American law, at any given time, is the present -- current emotions, real economic interests, and concrete political groups.\\"Highly recommended. My understanding of law will never be the same."},{"Title":"West African Adinkra Symbols: 31 Rubber Stamps","review":"If you've been burned by worthless (low quality) rubberstamp sets sold by book publishers you're wise to be cynical when you see another set on the shelf. I took the plunge and bought this set at a local independent bookstore and was pleased with the quality of the red rubber and the images themselves. I also enjoyed the well-designed and colorful booklet that reveals the history of the symbols and what each symbol actually means. The box the stamps are packaged in is wood and begs to be stamped and colored. What fun! My only complaint is with the wooden mounts. The mounts are thin cheap wood (with extra-thick dense foam cushion) so don't expect beautiful thick maple wood mounts! Considering the price though and the number of images (31) this didn't really detract from my overall enjoyment and satisfaction so I will give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"West African Adinkra Symbols: 31 Rubber Stamps","review":"As a person who spent over 2 years in Ghana and became pretty familiar with Adinkra symbols...I was disappointed with this stamp kit. I was excited when I saw this kit online but should have read the reviews before ordering as I see several other people felt let down too. I can hardly believe that the author left out the most well loved Adinkra symbol of all, \\"Gye Nyame\\", a symbol about the power of God. I really wish the author had put more effort into her research and included the names and accurate meanings of the symbols in the Twi language. Bummer."},{"Title":"West African Adinkra Symbols: 31 Rubber Stamps","review":"The rubber stamps are the real bargain here. As others have mentioned, the small booklet that comes with this set does not have much going for it. I also would have preferred to see the symbols identified with their African names.

Also disappointed not to see ethnic names of symbols displayed."},{"Title":"West African Adinkra Symbols: 31 Rubber Stamps","review":"I had heard rave reviews about this stamp set and waited with great excitement. The stamps themselves are sufficient, though they are small. The disappointment was in the definitions, which are not accurate to the language and the fact that the two most popular Adinkra symbols were noticeably absent. While it is a good set to have around, I would have preferred to invest the money in a more accurate, larger mount set."},{"Title":"West African Adinkra Symbols: 31 Rubber Stamps","review":"Fun & informative. I have used and enjoyed this stamp kit and booklet for my students and myself."},{"Title":"West African Adinkra Symbols: 31 Rubber Stamps","review":"If you just want a bunch of random symbols that some random person made up explanations for, then please purchase this set. As already said by other reviewers many obvious and popular symbols are missing and the definitions/explanations are insufficient and/or completely wrong. Also some symbols are not accurately drawn either. Additionally, I don't understand how one can offer definitions in English but not provide information on the original Akan/Twi words/definitions (but I think that has to do with the fact that some symbols are clearly made up). Anyone who wants real definitions and symbols should check do a search for Adinkra symbols online (I am not affiliated with any site), you can get pics for free or you can save/download from the page.

Students created prints with borders of symbols that they identified with i.e. that fit their character traits. Students then wrote a small reflection about the work and the character traits in relation to the Adrinka symbol meanings. This was a great project! Couldn't have done it without these stamps...which, by the way, were hard to find...that is why I had to turn to the Internet. They are no longer available in art or bookstores!"},{"Title":"West African Adinkra Symbols: 31 Rubber Stamps","review":"I am glad I disregarded the negative comments about this set of Adinkra stamps. I needed smaller stamps for my audience to use during a hands-on activity following my presentation on the symbols. I wanted them to emulate the process for stamping fabric, including creating a grid and filling it in with symbols in a repetitive manner. Larger, more authentic stamps would not have allowed this, given the size of the fabric swatches being used and the budget for the program. I found the booklet useful, but I had done a great deal of research on the symbols, and had sufficient information to counter any shortcomings. If you need stamps to use with a group, I recommend this set. Augment it by having some larger calabash Adinkra stamps on display as part of your program."},{"Title":"West African Adinkra Symbols: 31 Rubber Stamps","review":"The set is smaller than I thought. It also didn't include some commonly used symbols which was a disappoinment. I can't really suggest that anyone else order this product. I really does need some improvement. The booklet was okay, but had a lot of empty space that could have had more information, but it was very eye catching. I also didn't get the dark black results that were shown on some of the examples sprinkled throughout the booklet. I don't know if that was because of the ink or the material used to make the stamps."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and even though the prologue pretty much tells you the outcome, the story was quite enjoyable! I have not read one of his books in quite a while, and I will definitely seek out some of his older ones, and read the ones I have missed. I was really rooting for Evie in this one, even though at the same time you want Silvia and Matt, to get back together somehow! Evie and Matt had their amazing musical bond, that was very special, and you wanted them to go back to their duets, that made them so happy!"},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"I have only read Love Story and after reading Only Love and becoming familiar with Seagal's other books I am looking forward to purchasing more of his books. This latest novel is a must-read. Much of the emotions felt by the main character were dramatic and honest. I felt as though I was experiencing the story myself. Seagal has the skill to put into words what many feel, but are unable to express into words or are unable to recognize. Many times one sentence alone captured a human's scale of emotions hitting it right on the head of the nail...True revelations of the inner-heart and thoughts of love and relationships. I loved it! I thought it wouldn't compare to Love Story and now I don't know which is better."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"Honestly speaking this Book is the best I've read by Erich Segal and the pain illustrated in the story surpasses Love Story by all means.

I saw the TV miniseries and loved it. The book is so much better! I love that it's told from the man's point-of-view (being a man myself). It was warm, touching and sad. Music lovers will love the metaphors Segal uses to compare different classical works to points in the book. There is some sex, but that shouldn't scare you away. It's told in minimal detail. I hope Segal writes a sequel to this. The story of Matthew and Evie ended way too early. It nearly brought tears to my eyes."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"This work is the first book that I have picked up, and been constantly unable to put down. It is an outstanding tale, well written if perhaps a bit &quot;wordy&quot; at times, and a bit unsentimental at the most poignant moments. All in all, a good work worthy of reading, and one that seems to &quot;stick&quot; in the mind well after the book is finished. One cares about the characters, gets to know them and like them. However, the most touching scenes and most emotional moments seem to gloss over a bit, and a bit more detail would add to the emotional impact for the reader."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"remnids me of a sheldon book, in that once you start it, you'll find that you will want to read it quickly. . . but not to get through it; rather, because you are enjoying it . . . i did!"},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"This was the best book I have read in a long time!

Rather an unlikely story, but as fiction goes, (yawn) it was alright..."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"I am Erich Segal's #1 fan; I've read and re-read all of his other books so many times, my husband laughs at me. But this one is an absolute dud. Instead of involving us in what's happening, (much less involving the characters), Mr. Segal just reports what happened, many times covering years of time in one paragraph. It reads like a college application essay. The writing feels stilted and unemotional, even though he's describing something very emotional. I hate to say it, because I've loved all his other books, but skip this one. Re-read \\"Love Story\\" instead for a love story you will truly love!"},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"This was my first book by Mr Segal. I'd heard a lot about his other books but somehow this one isn't as popular as his other books. The book is well written (later I realised that it is a typical \\"Segal style of writing\\", nevertheless a pleasure to read) and the characters are adorable. One can argue that it is not really a love story, which is true to some extent, but the emotionality with which the charcaters and events are sketched makes it a touching story if not a \\"love story\\".This is one of the best books from Mr Segal and I would recommend it for people who enjoy reading fiction. It makes a good and light read."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"Not Erichs best book.....not on the level of Love Story....but books like love story don't come around everyday...that's what makes them special. Only Love is a great story and has deep pain in it. A quick read and a nice story I guarantee you won't forget it!"},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"The promise of Segal as a novelist from Love Story is unfufilled in this book.

Better off with Anita Shreve and The Last Time They Met."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"I've been reading Erich Segal's books for quite some time now and was so overwhelmed with Doctors. Sadly, Only Love doesn't live up to expectations. The plot isn't going to hold your attention for very long and the I got the feeling that that it would have been better off as a novellette (the story looked like it was stretched in order to qualify as a novel). Would really think twice now before buying any of his stuff from now on."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"I've read every book by Erich Segal.After Love Story I've picked every title. Each of his books have been unique and written with a great combination of a sense of humour and tragedy.I love them."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"The book was pretty good. I recomend this bool to those who love the classic story of love that should've been but could never be. I enjoyed Erich Segal's other novel entitled &quot;Love Story&quot;. I think &quot;Only Love&quot; is for adult readers and &quot;Love Story&quot; is for younger readers such as college students. I gavew this book a 7 because the ending semed a bit rushed but it is also the point where is impossible to put the book down."},{"Title":"Only Love","review":"I must say Mr. Segal has done it again.

Segal is one of my favorite authors. If I'm stranded on a deserted island and can only bring two books, one of them would probably be &quot;Doctors&quot;.

This story, focused on the oh so popular theme of a marriage of convenience, is almost unreadable. Our hero, a Duke named Lord Charnwood, marries the inspid and boring Elizabeth. He figures she won't give him trouble or be troubled by her. I hate when regency writers try to make the women spunky usually, it seems to me, to make up for them not being attractive so they suddenly appear more intersting to their mates. Of course, being a regency, they do not consumate their marriage. As we all know, then the marriage is not legal - even Elizabeth realized that. Charnwood is not likeable nor is Elizabeth. The author tries to spice things up with the addition of a first wife for Lord Charnwood, a gorgeous French woman whom he divorced. Apparently, Elizabeth nor her cronnies knew that the eligible Duke had been married once before. How would that be possible in the gossip capital of London where everything is knows about potential mates? Everything Elizabeth does she says well, Mama said this or Mama said that.

This book is his story of how he renovated the racetrack, starting in 1969, then took on the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of the Massachusetts government to haul Thoroughbred racing, kicking and screaming out of the Dark Ages--or more accurately out of the Age of Puritans.He succeeded in his battles against the government (thanks mainly to the judicial branch) but was finally done in by his own holding company, Realty Equities. The bittersweet final chapter describes the farewell party he threw for his friends who had joined him in his two-year, and ultimately bankrupted racetrack venture.It was a wild two-year ride and Veeck is a very colorful character, even when he is talking about holding companies and Boston politics. During his tenure at the track, he had the pay toilets and artificial flowers banned from the facility, staged chariot races and livestock giveaways (Brahma bulls and a Thoroughbred). There was also going to be a reenactment of Custer's last stand, which alas was rained out (Veeck didn't have much luck with the weather during his tenure). He also inaugurated what was then the richest turf race in the world, the Yankee Gold Cup, won by the French horse, Jean-Pierre (so there are a few horses mentioned in this book, just not as many as you might be led to believe by the title).My biggest disappointment was that Veeck didn't talk at all about the day-to-day management of the stables. This is a book about high finance, dirty politics, and really crazy ways of drawing crowds to a racetrack.I think the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) could learn a great deal from Bill Veeck if only they would cease their internal squabbling long enough to read &quot;Thirty Tons a Day.&quot; I only wish he were still around to whack some sense into the Thoroughbred racing business."},{"Title":"Thirty Tons a Day: The Rough-Riding Education of a Neophyte Racetrack Operator","review":"Bill Veeck became a legend in professional baseball by operating teams with the fans in mind - a novel concept then, as now - and tweaking the noses of the \\"Lords of the Realm\\" as he went along.In the late-1960s, it appeared that his trek in baseball was over, so Veeck played a longshot, becoming president of Suffolk Downs, a Thoroughbred track near Boston, Massachusetts.With comedic interludes - but oftentimes very biting commentary - Veeck and co-author Ed Linn chronicle the small victories and grand frustrations while operating a facility which carried the moniker, \\"Suffering Downs.\\"There are battles with an alleged corrupt system of politics at the local and state levels, a Boston-based media with its own personal agendas (vendettas) and racetrack owners in the region who had their eyes set on a larger slice of the pari-mutual pie, at the expense of Suffolk Downs.Through the muck, Veeck was the consummate showman, having events like a chariot race, a Brahman bull \\"giveaway,\\" a major stakes race - the Yankee Gold Cup - and an attempt to re-create Custer's Last Stand, while fighting for additional racing dates and to have children admitted into the track with adults.After two years, Veeck's race was over, as the conglomerate which owned the facility toppled under the weight of financial ruin, while yanking profits out of the racetrack and tossing them into failing enterprises.Published in 1972, there are a number of controversial issues discussed by Veeck that are still running as strong on racetracks as a Triple Crown contender. That is what makes the book as timely a read today as it was nearly 40 years ago."},{"Title":"Thirty Tons a Day: The Rough-Riding Education of a Neophyte Racetrack Operator","review":"Veeck was one of the true great showmen of the 20th century. This book shows you the ins and outs of the racing business in the 1970's. Veeck had a sense of humor and needed it to deal with corrupt Massachusetts racing officials and politicians. Unfortunately guys like Bill Veeck have been squeezed out in favor of neutral corporate marketing machines. The world seemed like a funner, crazier more wide open place in the 70's.

Another bonus!This book is so simple and easy to use, yet so rich with lots of great info. In fact, after we've done our lesson for the week, we finish by making a lapbook. In case you're unfamiliar, a lapbook is just a fancy term for \\"a homemade book with lots of flaps\\".

This is a really good one and while it doesn't solve all the problems created by the past handling of Thaumaturgy in VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE, it goes a long way toward clarifying and further developing the discipline.The book discussed the history and theory of vampiric blood magic. We learn that it predates the Tremere, for example, and hear about basic principles of magical workings. There is discussion about the difference between a Tremere vampire and a True Mage (metaphysical, mostly, and assumes familiarity with MAGE- for more practical instructions on vampires and mages, see VAMPIRE: STORYTELLERS HANDBOOK), how non-Tremere might learn Thaumaturgy and some examples of arcane tomes. Most of it is clearly explained (with few exceptions like the unnecessarily ambiguous section about the difference between spirits and demons).There are welcome sections outlining the Koldunic sorcery of the Tzimisce (finally!) and voodoo-derived traditions of Necromancy. Both the Assamites and the Setites have their own traditions of blood magic, detailed here. There are paths derived from Alchemy and Kaballah. Biothaumatugy is recycled from SECRETS OF THE BLACK HAND.Unfortunately, while the material introduced here is superb, the book doesn't pull together the various little bits of Thaumaturgy scattered between VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE and VAMPIRE: DARK AGES. It just once again gives us more and better. It would have been nice, for example, to have an appendix showing which previously introduced paths and rituals are in which books. Furthermore, some storytellers seem intimidated about Thaumaturgy and disallow it as &quot;too complicated&quot;. Step by step instructions (and a pep talk) might have been good, too. I should mention also that this book is about vampiric blood magic ONLY- no numinas or hedge magic more appropriate to allies like ghouls."},{"Title":"Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"This book, as per my title, was not exactly what I expected. It had extensive information on basic Thaumaturgy, quite a few new Rituals, and a few old ones, and all of the new Paths were quite interesting, one of them even resembling some of the Dark Age system Koldunic Sorcery Rituals from Libellus Sanguinis I... However, the parts where it failed to impress me were these: The information on Necromancy was seriously lacking, in the traditional Necromancy part anyway, there were no new paths and only 5 rituals, and it only had 2 rituals for Koldunic Sorcery... which was a bit pathetic. The Vodoun Necromancy part was satisfactory, as was the Assamite Sorcery section.

I think a player would get a lot of ideas, many of which would not be compatible with a story from this book so the best way to combat that and still allow Tremere and other magic using Kindred to develop would be for storyteller and player to look at this book together. I think it does a good job of detailing how to design paths and rituals, a sample worksheet might help in this regard, but also in talking about the limitations of the practice of bloodmagic."},{"Title":"Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"As an Elder of Clan Tremere (-or just a long term Tremere player), I was very pleased to see this new teatise for upcoming apprentices (-White Wolf publish a book dedicated to Thaumaturgy). This book isn't merely a long list of new and revamped rituals and paths (although it had its share),it is an explanation of what is unquestionably the most complicated discipline. I found the history of Blood Magic to be well thought out, as well as the discussion of &quot;how it works&quot;. All in all, a MUST READ for any Tremere (-player, as well as anyone fond of thaumaturgy) apprentice."},{"Title":"Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"I guess there are two ways to look at this book. First one would be background and resource for VTM games. I believe it sheds some light on a fact a lot of DMs hate to reveal, which is, it's okay to let other players use some thaumaturgical disciplines specialized for their clans if their background is correct. The second way is how many new things are introduced in the book. There are so many disciplines in there for mages from different clans. I really believe this is great, I love to see diversity in the game. The rituals there have been creatively put together. I think the book supplies excellent background for more stories and resources plus introduction of new disciplines and rituals. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy (Vampire: The Masquerade)","review":"This is an excellent source for new Tremere players alnog with old ones.

Although annotated study notes can be very helpful, I personally prefer the Thompson approach of linking Scripture by related topics and themes.My one serious problem, and the reason that I've had to reluctantly discard my Thompson NAS Bible, is that they have not yet published it in the NAS as updated in 1995.

I have looked through the NASB Update and actually find it harder to read than NASB 1977. Personally, I feel NASB 1977 has more of a &quot;college level&quot; feel while the NASB Update (much like the NIV) has more of a &quot;high school level&quot; feel in terms of their use of english. NASB Update and NIV are fine translations but I prefer reading something that is at least at the college reading level.The Thompson Chain-Reference Bible is one of the last publications of NASB 1977 that I could find anywhere. I purchased the burgundy genuine leather version with thumb index in April 2004.When you don't have much of a choice, you buy what is available. Here are my impressions of this publication taking into account other reviews:- no damage in shipping from Amazon using free shipping;- inconsistent quality control-- overall, the Bible was in excellent condition. pages were nicely trimmed, ink darkness was consistent throughout (unlike in other reviews) though the red was on the light side, and there was no problem with the binding.-- closer look revealed flaws in quality control. there was a big gash on the front GENUINE leather cover and it was apparent the inner leather liner was severely folded and creased before someone glued it back in place. this is supposed to be their premium Bible which would hopefully be used for a lifetime. i was surprised this particular print made it to the bookshelf.-- paper was thinner than my thomas nelson printing and thin enough to allow the letters from the underlying page to show through. i don't mean the print on the opposite side of the same page, i mean two pages before...i.e. the underlying page. whereas my thomas nelson used some special cloth-like paper, the paper in this publication appears like &quot;thin&quot; high quality tracing paper but nothing special.- i have returned this item to Amazon for a replacement.- printed in Korea, hopefully by a Christian publication company, otherwise it would be a shame for a Bible publishing company to succumb to bean counting."},{"Title":"Thompson Chain Reference Bible (Style 606black) - Regular Size NASB - Genuine Leather","review":"I use the Thompson NASB and it is great. I will just echo other sentiments that the layout of this Bible is great. This Bibles greatest strength is that it uses Scripture to teach Scripture. There are no notes on the page. If one wants to dig into a specific passage or specific book the references will take the student into the Bible as deep and as far as they want to go. This is my main Bible, along with the Dickson New Analytical KJV, to read and study God's words. There are too many specialty and study Bibles on the market. All the major publishers bring them out each year like boxed cereal. I too own and use some specialty study Bibles for specific purposes. These are great if you want to study from a specific point of view, like Dispensational or Charismatic, or understand what an interesting teacher of the Word may have to say like Tim LaHaye, John MacArthur, RC Sproul, or Henry Blackaby.

At least we're somewhat safe for now.Though this book can be a bit cumbersome, (you have to turn the book upside-down after each question to read the correct answer) the answers will ASTOUND you. Read what came from Bush's own lips as he answered questions about Vietnam, his military service, and his many failed business ventures.

The comment reads: \\"My son is eleven and has never read a real book in his life. A friend gave me the book and my son just sat down and read it over the weekend. A miracle!\\" I thought, yeah right, her son probably doesn't have video game controllers glued to his hands like my son. My son thinks that consulting his favorite web sites online constitutes a good reading experience. Anyway, I decided to get the book and see if it would capture his attention, but frankly didn't hold out much hope. He has never wanted to read independently. Well, I am here to say that there is something unique about this book because it truly is the first one that has sucked him into its world. For the first time, he is willingly doing his reading time for class and even going beyond this. He is a little more than half-way done with the book and is enthralled with it. I'm already getting worried about what we'll do when he finishes it. Can the author quickly get the next volume out? Until the next volume comes out, I'm afraid we're doomed to slide back into mediocre reading that involves a cursory look at the latest gaming magazine. Go ahead and try this book if you have a recalcitrant reader. I hope you have the same success that we have had and that it is enjoyed as much as it has been by my son."},{"Title":"Here Be Monsters","review":"I was immediately drawn into Here be Monsters when I saw it on a shelf in a local bookstore. It is captivating, seeming to meld the curious Victorian imagery of Edmund Gorey with the density and endlessness of a 100 year old Sears Roebuck catalog.But I have to be frank. My son has a very active imagination (read \\"nightmares\\") and I was not that interested in providing more grist for that mill!So let me clear the air here. The only monsters are humans, and while they are dastardly and mean, they are not terrifying. Just the same mean, self-centered, narcissistic jerks that life is full of.The so-called monsters in this book (boxtrolls, cabbageheads and the like) are charming, caring, thoughtful, and endearing. But not scary.Please buy this book. Buy five copies. Buy ten. If only that you will bless five or ten children (so far I have tested on a five and a ten year old) with a sweet, fun, clever, creative romp through Ratbridge."},{"Title":"Here Be Monsters","review":"I'll begin by confessing my ignorance regarding this book's title. When I first picked up, \\"Here Be Monsters!\\", I was unaware of where this sentence came from. With some quick research I consulted a reliable source (reliable source = my husband) and found that this was the term written on uncharted waters on old maps. Should a ship fail to return from some portion heretofore undiscovered on the map, the mapmaker would whip out that old phrase, \\"Here Be Monsters\\", to warn future adventurers. I mention all this because I think author Alan Snow is a genius. For wild, wacky, unimaginable fun paired with ridiculous horrors, \\"Here Be Monsters!\\", cannot be beat. Impossibly British and a riveting read, this is probably one of the best books to swim across the Atlantic this year. I can honestly say that neither you nor your children will ever come across a book quite like this again.How to begin? Well, there once was a boy named Arthur who lived underground with his grandfather. This kind of life has its problems, of course. To get food, for example, Arthur must climb out of the underworld and use his grandfather's leather-winged technology to fly about the town scavenging for food. One night Arthur gets wrapped up in the affairs of some particularly shady characters. Long ago the evil Cheese Guild held the town of Ratbridge in its iron fist. Since then, the guild supposedly died out after the Great Cheese Crash. On this day, however, Arthur spots some former guild members hunting slow moving wild cheese (a cruel sport) just outside of town. Before he knows what's happened to him the nasty Archibald Snatcher has stolen Arthur's wings and all holes to the underworld have been blocked up. Fortunately for our hero, he joins up with a motley crew that includes a retired lawyer, several boxtrolls (trolls that wear boxes), a cabbage head (pretty much what it sounds like), and a crew of former pirates who have turned to a life of laundry. With their help, Arthur must defeat the evil not-so-defunct Cheese Guild from committing a horrible revenge on the town of Ratbridge.But that little description doesn't even begin to cover half the amusing and interesting things spotted through out the book. I haven't told you how the fashionable ladies of Ratbridge all have buttocks of different shapes and sizes (hexagonal being the most interesting). I haven't mentioned an insidious plot that involves tiny underground dwellers and how they became so small. There was no mention in my summary of the crows who love to play music but are horrendously poor at it. And what about the tribe of underground women raised by rabbits who are simply referred to as (wait for it...) The Rabbit Women? Snow packs in these new facts, funny stories, and droll little details with a frightening efficiency. And whether or not you are familiar with your Dumas, kids and adults alike will love meeting the poor Man in the Iron Socks, imprisoned under the former Cheese Hall. To say nothing of his whalloper!Imagination is one thing. How an author goes about telling his story is another. And Snow, to his credit, has a wonderful grasp on not only this new little world but also the funny details that make it up. Honestly, how can you resist a book in which the scariest detail in it is the loathsome Fondue Pit. I hope you aren't too attached to Wild English Cheese (described in a summary at the beginning as, \\"being rather easier to catch than a dead sheep\\"), because their fate is rather ... um ... melty. I loved Snow's dialogue too, of course. Actually, sometimes it was so much fun that I had difficulty reading this book on the train for fear of cackling loudly and scaring my fellow passengers. But how on earth can you read a sentence like, \\"Coming on hoity-toity with her new hexagonal buttocks\\", (said, I imagine, in a voice akin to the ones the Monty Python actors would do when they were dressed as women) and not laugh? One liners are Snow's specialty. When you read the sentence, \\"I don't think the police are going to put up with members of the local laundry letting off cannons in the streets\\", it just makes you want to read more. Through this book your children can learn what blunderbusses and leviathans are. Plus any children's book that can name drop Tristram Shandy has my instant love.I was also impressed by how sweet Snow's creatures were. The boxtrolls are described as very shy (hence wearing boxes all the time) but particularly mechanically adept. A boxtroll named Fish takes to Arthur instantly and though it can't speak, it is a good friend to the kid. When a tiny boxtroll appears in the shop, it's given some nuts and bolts to make it happy. And when the little boxtroll is upset, it hugs the bolts tightly for comfort. The cabbageheads are also shy, so much so that they usually hide behind the boxtrolls. But there's something about benign and friendly underlings like these that give the book the extra dab of sweetness to counter the villains' nasty plans.Snow's language is half the fun. The other half is more than mightily provided by his illustrations. Every single page sports a pen and ink illustration, some taking up entire pages and some tiny portions here and there that illustrate any given point. At the beginning of each chapter is an meticulous and incredibly detailed illustration of the story to come. Then, flitting at the top of each chapter, is a series of silhouettes showing what the characters will be doing. The fact that the silhouettes change with every chapter impressed me right from the start. There's also a rather intense selection at the beginning of the book taken (apparently) from Johnson's Taxonomy of Trolls and Creatures. Should you find yourself forgetting what a trotting badger is (hint: not good) or you'd like to know the personality of your average fresh-water sea-cow, it's all here. Just don't let the wordiness of it turn you off at the start. You can always skip it and come back to it later when you've met creatures like the boxtrolls.If British children's book imports are to be believed, the hot topic amongst the kiddies right now are guilds. And guilds, should anyone ask you, are inevitably bad. There were evil guilds in Frances Hardinge's fabulous, \\"Fly By Night\\", and there is the remarkably nasty guild in \\"Here Be Monsters\\". Actually, I consider these two British books to be some of the finest imports to grace our shores this year. Should you want a good rousing story to read to your kids tonight, or even just a great book for those children who like a healthy dose of fantasy in their diet, \\"Here Be Monsters!\\", is the answer to your prayers. A wonderful, fabulously imaginative, remarkable funny (and other descriptors of varying praise) book."},{"Title":"Here Be Monsters","review":"My 9 year old son hates to read, considers it torture of the worst sort. When his teacher sent home a reading log which demanded 350 pages for an \\"A\\", I thought- \\"Well, an \\"A\\" would have been nice.\\" Then, on a trip the same day to the library where above-mentioned son usually spends his time on the computer games, I saw \\"Here Be Monsters\\", with the picture of a Boxtroll on the front. It's a monsterously sized children's book, at 508 pages, but I thought \\"What the heck, it's worth a try.\\" Well- we're doing at least 1/2 hour a day. What joy!

I enjoyed reading this as a bedtime story. It was a little tough to stop and display the illustrations to kids on a bunk bed, but the pictures are just too good and meant to be shared."},{"Title":"Here Be Monsters","review":"If you ask me, HERE BE MONSTERS! is no classic, not even a keeper. I tried reading this book to some kids, and they weren't even interested an iota. Even some English children visiting San Francisco turned their nose up at it, seeing it for what it is, a goodhumored attempt to capture some of the late Roald Dahl's popularity by marrying his \\"children come first\\" philosophy to the epic fantasy saga plot of Philip Pullman or whoever the latest upstart is. That's where the big money is, you see. I will say that three of the children (ages 4-7) enjoyed Snow's cross hatched drawings of the many inventivce creatures who populate his underground kingdom. Where I see sloppy sub-par Tenniel drawings, children see the many-shadowed intimations of adulthood drawing around them like night shades. I expect that Snow will bewitch some readers, especially those with visual acuity, while turning off some with his witless puns (\\"I'm a BIG CHEESE\\") and the incredibly longwinded storytelling--five hundred pages, and this is just volume one! Does he farm out the drawings to others? How does he get all his work done?As for little Arthur, he was okay, with gumption to spare--but I hate gumption. Long ago there was a great novel for young people called THE GAMMAGE CUP by Carol Kendall--anyone remember this book? It had everything that HERE BE MONSTERS has and more (well, it didn't have MONSTERS' exclamation point, but it didn't need one) (indeed Grandma always said, never trust a book that tries to excite you with an exclamation mark)--only THE GAMMAGE CUP was a shapely 160 pages, so wouldn't make much of a splash in today's steroid driven market where the longer the better. In the meantime, I know a few kids who will be looking forward to the next installment of RATBRIDGE, and one of them has taken up drawing all by himself, after Snow, saying, \\"Kevin, look at Snow's people, the way they start out by being tic tac toe puzzles, then next time you look they have arms and legs and faces.\\""},{"Title":"When God Becomes a Drug: Book 1; Understanding Religious addiction & religious abuse","review":"In this book, Fr. Leo outlines the problem of being addicted to religion. He outlines the steps one can go through as the addiction comes to dominate one's life, and outlines the steps necessary to break free from this addiction. Being a religious addict myself, I really enjoyed this book. He described my life to a 't' in this book, and it has helped me break the chains of religious addiction and has helped me attain a more healthy spirituality. If you even suspect you might have a problem with your religiousity, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"When God Becomes a Drug: Book 1; Understanding Religious addiction & religious abuse","review":"Booth defines religious addiction and abuse then goes over a twelve step program of recovery. This book shines a light into the dark recesses of religious abuse. The person who is the most addicted and abusive may very well be the person who is admired by outsiders for their religious conviction. The children and spouses see a very different picture. I think this book would be helpful to someone who was willing to consider the possibility that they have a problem. I think it is more likely to be read by someone affected by another's addiction than by the addict herself. Booth says he has success in his practice of working with religious addicts so perhaps they can be helped. In my experience though it seems that the people who fit his description of a religious addict are the ones who would never consider that they may be wrong or that their religion is causing a problem. For these cases Booth presents ideas for staging an intervention when the addict/abuser will not admit to the problem. Good luck.One problem I have with the book is his anti-atheist bias. He wants to bring the people to a better spirituality but considers atheism to be a negative outcome. He sees it as a backlash to abuse. He must be aware that people can arrive at atheism in many different ways. He seems pretty open minded otherwise. People who want a healthier relationship to their faith without giving it up should be comforted by the fact that he is in no way trying to talk them out of their faith. He is a man of the cloth himself.I'd recommend this book for someone who thinks his or her religious involvement may be getting out of hand. For the abused children or spouse of an addict it's a start only. I'd like to see a lot more awareness that religion can be used in such a damaging way and this book is a step in that direction. Abused children are in the worst position since society doesn't really recognize this type of abuse and is not prepared to do anything about it. (I read the hardbound version.)"},{"Title":"When God Becomes a Drug: Book 1; Understanding Religious addiction & religious abuse","review":"I only wish this book had been more helpful than it is, but that is not the fault of the author. Religious addiction is a stubborn malady, and one that can best be confronted by the addict him/herself. As one who has lost at least one sibling to this painful affliction, I wish it could have given me an easy answer. There are no easy answers to this dilemma.One of the brightest conclusions Father Leo makes is that one need not give up religion, or God, to develop a healthy spirituality. It would be an incredible challenge indeed, but he assures those who are seeking that giving up God is not the solution to confronting religious addiction. He is very clear about the difference between &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;spirituality,&quot; something that is crucial in the healing process.Father Leo also states that one can be addicted to atheism, and that atheism can be a religion in and of itself. Not necessarily that it is, but that it can become one.The saddest and most frightening thing he points to is the inevitable outcome of mental breakdown if religious addiction is not treated. He outlines very carefully the possiblity of a loving intervention by those who are concerned for the addict, but when the addiction is religion (translated as &quot;God&quot; by the addict) denial comes way too easy and finding others willing to confront this denial is a very difficult challenge.I was heartened to find that there is treatment for this addiction, there are places to turn. It is a relatively new field, but it gives me hope. I, too, wish there was acknowledgement of the harm this addiction does to the children of the addict -- but I don't know that I would put any state agency in charge of dealing with it.One other concern that I have as I continue to study this subject is the subtlety of its intrusion into politics. When it comes to addiction, there IS no separation of church and state. In fact, this separation, if it exists at all, *only* exists for the state -- not for any church, unless it benefits *them*. They don't pay taxes, but they still find it perfectly acceptable to advocate for legislation from the pulpit and to lobby our representatives and to pass out post cards for the congregation to fill out in the middle of a service. It's a despicable practice, and one that becomes even more troublesome within the context of spiritual addiction.Treatment for this malady has never been more important than it is today."},{"Title":"When God Becomes a Drug: Book 1; Understanding Religious addiction & religious abuse","review":"This book is amazing. i read the older version. It taught me how what i thought was certain powers and divine messages and things the world was showing me were really my own fears that i misplaced and transformed into a god. This book and the help i later recieved from a therapist were able to return me back to society in a more wordly way. This book was fantastic in that it helped show me how when i was suffering i was creating false illusions and ways out of it through God thinking that God would solve all my problems, when in fact i needed to confront my emotional issues in real life. I am very greatful for Father Leo for taking me out of my religous persecution i was brining on my self and showing me how i was torturing myself emotionally in the name of God. How these tortures were not based on God but on my own fears and my desires to heal myself. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who feels that they are treating themselves poorly in the name of god. For example anyone beaeting themselves up believing sex or masterbation is wrong while it is a gift the earth has granted us."},{"Title":"When God Becomes a Drug: Book 1; Understanding Religious addiction & religious abuse","review":"This book really sheds light on a subject that most people avoid, but those of us who have been through this and survived with our brains and psyches intact seek answers to why this happens. It is refreshingly direct and non-judgmental, and if you've experienced it or know people who have experienced it, there are many insights that help you understand why people believe and do things that make absolutely no sense on the face of it."},{"Title":"When God Becomes a Drug: Book 1; Understanding Religious addiction & religious abuse","review":"Leo Booth does an outstanding job in exposing religious addiction as a personal and societal force. Fundamentalist believers may find difficulty in reading this book. However Leo does an extraordinary job at communicating the structure of abuse found in religious communities and cultures. In doing so, Leo also illuminates the undiscussed abuse and shame experienced by the religious addicts. It is a must read."},{"Title":"When God Becomes a Drug: Book 1; Understanding Religious addiction & religious abuse","review":"I believe this is an important topic. Rev. Booth does a nice job explaining the disease process but comes to strange conclusions. His previous anti-protestant views have become anti-Christian views. His arrogance in rewriting church history and \\"mind reading\\" Christs intentions will, rightfully, turn off many of the folks who may have been helped by a book on this subject. This is an unfortunate use and loss of a good platform and important topic! The arrogance of \\"the Anglican Church, and maybe the Roman Catholic church, is the REAL church to \\"only polytheists and pantheists\\" have healthy spirituality is a demonstration of \\"same song, different verse.\\" The \\"narcisistic/addictive\\" component remains the same. I know of many Christians, New Agers, etc. that could use help with potential religious addictions. This book, sadly, will turn off most of them."},{"Title":"When God Becomes a Drug: Book 1; Understanding Religious addiction & religious abuse","review":"I disagree strongly with Fr. Booth's personal spiritual views, but I agree with him that religious addiction is a significant problem. My favorite part of the book is the one in which Fr. Booth describes an intervention held to try to persuade a male religious addict to go into treatment for his addiction. I do have significant differences of opinion with him in other areas, however. For example, I wish he had spent more time talking about people who were addicted to New Age forms of spirituality, or even atheism or skepticism. He pays lip service to the fact that these forms of religious/spiritual belief can be addictive, then spends the bulk of the book focusing on evangelical/fundamentalist Christian religious addicts. At least those are the examples of religious addiction he gives in the book, almost as if this is the only form of religion to which one can become addicted (while offering a token acknowledgment that other religions and spiritual practices can be addictive). I also wish he hadn't talked about the family roles in dysfunctional families (the Family Hero, the Scapegoat, and so forth). This part was too neat - too pat, as if all dysfunctional families had exactly four children, so that each one could fit into one of the four roles of dysfunctional families (one Family Hero, for example, or one Clown)."},{"Title":"It's Who You Know: How to Make the Right Business Connections -- and Make Them Pay Off","review":"Elliot gets it and knows how to make it happen, great read"},{"Title":"It's Who You Know: How to Make the Right Business Connections -- and Make Them Pay Off","review":"I bought this book back in the summer of 2001.

From 1858 to 1863, they steamed up rivers and roamed the jungles enduring blistering heat, rampant tropical diseases snakes and hostile Africans, Arabs, and rival Europeans. Through it all Kirk and Livingstone persevered, promoting commerce, christianity and civilization while working against a powerful slave trade that saw more than 100,000 slaves shipped abroad each year. Maneuvering his way against the endless intrigue of Arab slavers and European geopolitics, Kirk succeeded against incredible odds in convincing the Sultan of Zanzibar to ban the highly lucrative slave trade.

The focus of these conversations is not only on the technical aspects of writing which may prove instructional to the aspiring writing, but also the preferences and passions that can inspire readers to admit that writing is what they want to do with the rest of their lives. As Harlan Ellison says in the introduction to this book: \\"You're a writer. And that's something better than being a millionaire. Because it's something holy.\\"Within these pages you will find novelists, short story writers, playwrights, poets, and journalists. In fact, a simple list of the writers interviewed should be sufficient to have you hunt this book down and check it out: Raymond Carver, Ernest Hemingway, Marsha Norman, Red Smith, Allen Ginsberg, Ray Bradbury, Erica Jong, Jerome Lawrence & Robert E. Lee, Madeleine L'Engle, Nikki Giovanni, James Michner, Jean Auel, William Saroyan, Truman Capote, Joseph Wambaugh, Irving Stone, Ellen Goodman, Kurt Vonnegut (twice), William Faulkner, Rod Serling, May Sarton, Arthur Kopit, Jay McInerney, Norman Mailer, James Dickey, Carolyn Chute, Rod McKuen, Joseph Heller, Tom Robbins and John Steinbeck. Actually, that last one is not an interview; rather it is a letter from Steinbeck addressed \\"Dear Writer,\\" which reminds us \\"A story has to convey something from writer to reader, and the power of its offering is the measure of its excellence.\\"Within these pages you will find comments on imagery, books becoming famous, style, rewriting, discipline, reportage, caring, and other precious hints of how successful writers work through the challenges of their craft.

I liked his other novel too, Coalescent, but Manifold: Time is my favorite work of his. Well...it's a tie between that and Evolution."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"(If you're not here for a spoiler, don't read past the spoiler line!)If you're looking for jarheads in space, egyptian aliens, pod races and feel good endings about humankind's unique humanity you can step away now.The rest of you can face the bloody harsh wind of Baxter's second attempt at explaining the Fermi paradox: if life just happens, why have we only found it on our planet? The book takes a long, descriptive path through the next few thousand years, painting on a grand scale what's going on in our stellar neighborhood. Relatively convincing quasi physics are woven into a surreal picture of space/time travelers, incomprehensible aliens, resource struggles on a ridiculous scale, and ultimately a cold, cold, unfortunately teetering universe.The payoff for sticking with this very deliberately paced revelation of the universe's mechanical heart is gaining a moment of clarity where you get to pose yourself the question: If the universe is \\"just\\" the universe, sans the metaphysical we've imagined, if it really is just a big cooling explosion and we're just bizarre knots in the eddies of cooling gasses... do waffles and bacon still taste good?***** HERE BE SPOILERS *****For those who'd like a few more details before committing to the book:Malenfant is back, and ends up with a key role again. He isn't the same Malenfant, just as this isn't the same universe as the first Manifold book. The idea here seems to be that Baxter is using each book to explore another answer to the Fermi paradox. Some of the first book's characters make cameos here, but there's a new cast to make room for too.This time around, the answer to the paradox revolves around the idea that life does happen all over the place, but it gets wiped out all the time. This seems to happen on a period that allows for a sufficiently high degree of sophistication that the relics of those civilizations are incomprehensible to us. Baxter would like us to picture the idea that sufficiently advanced resource plundering is indistinguishable from geology. As with the first book, he also casually tosses star engineering out there as part of his mechanism. Given the nature of the relics, the timescales involved, and the thoroughness of the \\"reboot\\" function, he paints a convincing picture of why we aren't seeing any evidence of others in the sky.As per the first book, we follow our ragged collection of human observers out to the stars to observe all of this first hand en route to the melancholy final reveal. The pacing is slow and Baxter spends what feels like more time describing every nut and bolt compared to the first book. Given that the whole point of the book is to paint you a picture of this tragic universe though, this really is only a bad thing if you have a short attention span.The punchline, the bit about our part to play, is refreshing. No magic invoked here, no triumph of vague spirit or ill defined virtue. Baxter calls us out for being what we manifestly demonstrate ourselves to be rather than what we'd like to think we are, and finds a use for it!I very much enjoyed this book.

The descriptions of different planets and places are stunning...you WILL think you're there. And the science is good and believeable (except the part about an ice age and thaw on Earth 1000 years from now). But the story wanders in the middle of the book and certain chapters start of sounding important, but then don't mean anything towards the end of the book. So I think a lot of it is filler and doesn't add to the characters or science fiction aspect. I recommend waiting until this book comes out in paperback, or rent it from the library."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Obviously, when you are in binary star system you must cast double shadows, as Reid Malenfant realizes out there on Alpha Centauri. Stephen Baxters book (Space) cast at least two kinds of shadows. First there is the wonderful feeling of being an astronaut out there among the stars. And then, on a deeper level, there is the question of what it means to be a sentient living thing in the Galaxy. The Galaxy being such a big, big place with so much to explore and so much to learn about. I suppose 2001 is year 19 before the Gaijin, or so at least according to Space. 19 years before the cosmic &quot;let the games begin&quot;. So there is still time to prepare for that strange environment called Space. And a good place to start preparing would definitely be the book Space. Manifold 1 (Time) was great, and this one Manifold 2 (Space) is just as good. So, now I am just looking forward to Manifold 3 (SpaceTime?). -Simon"},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"This Stephen Baxter fan struggled with this book. I tried my very best to like it. While I understood that Reid Malenfant in new universes as Cosmic Time Traveler was going to be quite a different man from the flawed rebel in Manifold:Time, I was still dismayed about the changes in this character. The Pirate we all loved to hate was gone! Where was the Daredevil? The crafty &amp; resourceful Pioneer? The crazy Ambassador for the human race? What happened to the Lover? I expected more about his lost friends from long ago: Michael &amp; Cornelius Taine. Emma, his beloved dead wife, was barely mentioned at all. One or two times, not nearly enough. Only Maura Della reappeared.Reid Malenfant minus all of his anti-heroic arrogance, single-mindedness, foolhardiness, passion, hunger, determination, &amp; all-consuming curiosity, was - to this reader - no Malenfant at all. Just a rocket-man trying to make it to the next gateway.I was also unprepared for the ungratifying new characters in book 2. Nemoto, for instance. That was a &quot;forced&quot; character. Was she really relevant to Reid's story? It was hard for me to accept her because she was everywhere &amp; served no purpose, despite her &quot;Great Mission.&quot; I was never given the chance to like her, &amp; I was glad when she finally left Malenfant's story.Maybe I am narrowly-focused, &quot;-centric,&quot; &amp; am unable to picture universes, space-times, worlds, species, technologies, abilities, &amp; attitudes so advanced &amp; so unlike our own? It's possible, but I don't think so. Poorly-weaved, this sequel started out bad &amp; got worse.And the many story jumps. There were so many &quot;quantum-gateway-light-year&quot; trips - back and forth - to so many worlds! Too many ETs: the Gaijin, the Chaera, the Crackers, etc. I lost count of almost everything in the story as I jumped with Malenfant from one light-year to the next, from one weird species to the next, from one puzzling galactic skirmish to another one, &amp; I got bored. You could get pretty dizzy trying to remember it all! I fought hard to get to the end of this, &amp; I considered myself reasonably well-informed. And the most patient of readers.Because I am a lover of Stephen Baxter's work, I truthfully felt betrayed by the man as I stumbled along, trying to reach the end of this long tale. Do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"What little science is involved in this fiction book is so muddled and over-stated as to make it the most tedious and boring repletion of worthless and ill-proven ideas I have ever seen compiled into one story-line. I have stopped reading this book four times now, and I am still not even close to the termination of its worthlessness. Don't start."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Okay, so this book might have been about more than the dissolution and decay of mankind, but that?s mostly what it felt like. Although some of the technical ideas in this book are interesting, there are no strong characters, the plot jumps around too much, and his version of humanity appears to be paralyzed with apathy.The worst thing about this book is the way people are portrayed. It seems like 99.9999% of humanity don't even care if another kind of life comes to earth. It's as if the whole world has somehow lost all curiosity and volition. To me, that isn't very realistic. Even if most people don't care about space, if there was something potentially threatening, at least the governments would be involved. But no, in his book, everyone seems willing to just roll over and play dead. Oh, except for his five or so main characters.And all of those characters appear to be indistinguishable, completely flat without any real emotion. None of them have any strong ties to any of the other characters and don't seem to have any real motivation. Although there are some relationships, none of them are any stronger than somebody felt sorry for someone else. I'm sorry, not compelling.It also appears that all of the action takes place just outside our point of view. There's a war, but it's elsewhere, we only hear about it second hand. Somebody gets upset, but you don't learn about their internal struggle, instead the book's focus stays with someone who watches them walk off. And every time you start to get interested in someone, the scene changes, and you're faced with a whole new set of people, who seem equally unrealistic and one-dimensional.In addition to the uninteresting main characters, his main premise seems to be that from here, things only get worse, that humans will lose all of their technological advances, and there is no way that closed biospheres can work, so that humans will never really be able to live off of Earth. What is the point of even writing about such a depressing view of the future? It doesn't motivate one to change, because you can't even figure out why people are behaving the way they do in the first place.The one saving grace of this book is the plethora of ideas to think about. So, the characters are boring, the plot is jumpy, but at least you have the concept of a universe where resources are key, and the whole bigger picture of how that would make creatures react, and what could happen over the millennia. Some of the other technology in the book interesting as well, from a 'how does it work' point of view. It does appear to all be well thought out and researched.Despite the positive technical aspects, I did not enjoy this book, and I think the only reason I finished it was due to my hope that something, anything positive would happen before it was over."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"The whole time I read it I wish I hadn't. The only point that it drove home was the absolute pointlesness of our lives. There were no characters that one could relate to and that Damn Nemto just wouldn't die!

This one is so bad that I couldn't make it all the way through(I read 400 of 512 pages).It started off pretty well...the first 200 pages were reallyinteresting. Then there was a couple hundred page lull whereincreasingly weird/unbelievable stuff kept happening onlyoften enough to make me think that perhaps it will get better.I stopped when Malenfant starts hanging around with Neanderthalson some far out moon/planet peeing in his special spacesuit.(I bought a used copy....imagine how annoyed I'd be if I paidfull price for this hardcover?)"},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Absolutley loved this novel. The shear depth of Baxters' ideas and his firm grasp of the latest cutting edge physics, is a joy to read. I loved Mainifold: Time, but this one I couldn't put down. What I love most about this novel is that you realise your learning something while enjoying every page. Personally, I have no problems with Baxters' characterizations and writing style, I think he's one of the best in hard SF ( generally better than Egan or Bear, in my opinion). To summarize what this novel is about, while not giving too much away- imagine a thought experiment concerning the Fermi Paradox, e.g if aliens exist, why aren't they here? This paradox could have lots of solutions, e.g life is very,very rare, or perhaps life is common but it gets wiped out or wipes itself out in a relatively short time scale... This novel seems to take the latter angle, space is brimming with life, yet none of it every really gets the chance to advance beyond a certain point. What's behind all this is the crux of the story. Loved the ending as well.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Not that I'll be misunderstood: I'm one of Mr Baxters biggest fans and most loyal readers, but &quot;Manifold:Space&quot; lacks a very important quality of a book: a coherent story that keeps the reader interested. Characters and their achievements light up for a few chapters and then disappear again in the vast maw of time.&quot;The most awesome ideas in science fiction today&quot; rates &quot;The Times&quot; on the cover of my UK edition. That is not untrue - but unlike in &quot;Manifold:Time&quot;, here Mr Baxter fails to weave those ideas into a gripping story - I repeatedly had to force myself to continue reading. Of course it is way more difficult to tell a story that spans centuries and millenia than one that only stretches the protagonist's lifetime and maybe it is the problem of us &quot;mayfly humans&quot; (compared to those mechanical aliens described in the book that &quot;live&quot; for millenia) that we find it hard to follow such eternal-like periods of time - but hey: we're the only life-form yet that can read (his) books ! And in &quot;Time&quot; Mr Baxters'ideas about the future of the universe and mankind as a part of it were at least as awesome as in &quot;Space&quot; - and nonetheless it was a thrilling, page-turning story. I hope that the proposed third one in this sequence, &quot;Manifold:Origin&quot;, will take up the quality of &quot;Time&quot; and - although hardly possible, since its his best - &quot;The Time Ships&quot;."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Baxter's Space is the Gulliver's Travels of modern science fiction. I mean this not only in terms of narrative convention (hapless traveler is propelled from one tableaux to the next to showcase the author's agenda, in this case, a grab-bag of the myriad forms life might take in various environments), but of repute, as well: with Time as his launching point, Baxter takes cyclopean strides, earning the hallmark \\"classic\\" and instantly vaulting into my Top Ten Greatest Sci-Fi Novels of All Time. Baxter has come a long way from what I label the \\"pajama sci-fi\\" of his Xeelee sequence: cheeseball crews running around in their jammy-jams like something from Star Trek: the Motion Picture or Invaders from Plan 9. Baxter's ideas were always there, but his Michael Crichton School of bland prose was a great detraction. No more - he's battened down the hatches on sloppy writing, his characters have distinct voices, and the greatest improvement of all, his dialogue has gone from Vaudevillian melodrama to the downright profound. Baxter refreshingly skips hashing out the trials of his characters and gets to the nitty gritty: one sentence, Malefant is reasoning out how he can get to a deep space \\"Saddle Point,\\" the next sentence, he's there, and who cares how he swung it?All this, and the ideas are still there; each chapter bursts with an astonishing new Big Idea that forces one to pause and give a Keanu Reeves \\"whoah.\\" The final onslaught of the Cracker fleet and Nemoto's soliloquy is the most deliciously bleak scene I have read in sci-fi since the end of Orwell's 1984. Here's hoping Baxter's Darwinian vision of space colonization is totally wrong. I, for one, am still waiting for enlightened beings to descend from the heavens and help us save us from ourselves.Space is not perfect - the micronized space-ship with no plausible explanation from a race that Baxter repeatedly stresses has comparatively primitive technology is particularly irksome, and Baxter can sometimes hit you over the head to make his point (there's no need to use \\"Darwinian\\" as an adjective twice on the same page - I get it already), but these are minor annoyances. It's the power to make you cower like an insignificant mote against the howling void, to go slack-jawed with wonder and awe as you gaze out over alien vistas, to make you still ask after witnessing 10,000 years of human evolution, \\"Is that all there is?\\" Baxter dishes it up in droves and he's unlikely to pull it off again, so if you're going to read only one, this is it.Finally, my glib answer to the Fermi Paradox: we exist, but we're not there...Fudo MyoGeneva, Switzerland"},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Better than the prior Manifold Time, and a classic hard sci-fi novel.

However, the author fails to give satisfying motivations for the political institutions and characters. ETS are discovered in the asteriod belt, but no government sends a probe or a manned visit. Aliens threathen to invade the solar system, but no human or government is willing to put up a defense. Instead, humans relie on a group of ETS to defend the home system for 500 years; the same group of ETS that had to buy an x-ray weapon from the humans earlier in the novel. Other parts of the novel seemed to defy logic- The teleportation gates are not affected by an event that erases all other biological and constructed material from the galaxy; an old woman mounts a better defense of our solar system than a fleet of ETS. Readers who love &quot;hard&quot; SF will like this novel. People who like more character development or military SF will not be as pleased."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Not being a great writer myself I will let others do the plot summaries and simply state my opinion of the book.I consider Baxter one of the core group of hard science fiction writers however reading his books often feels too much like work...unlike Banks or Reynolds. Maybe its too much exposition on physics and too little character development. The balance between the two is off.All in all, a so so book."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"This is the first book I read of Baxter and it got me interested in all his other books. I am sci-fi and astronomy passionate and find some of these ideas very original. I know many people here complained about the characters in the book, but if you forget about them for a moment , since their only purpose is to take you from one era to another, you will find a book rich of interesting and original ideas. At some points the books is scary and seems very negative, no matter how hard you try to make a difference some natural or unnatural forces will always be stronger than you, but I believe the overall message is that we should look inside ourselves and find the strenght to help others even beyong time. This is the problem with humanity, we only focus on &quot;us&quot; and &quot;now&quot; and Baxter makes of this problem the topic of his book. Great reading if you like sci-fi, but you might appreciate it even if you're not that big in sci-fi stories."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Some time ago, I read Greg Bear's Fist of God and Anvil of Stars, the first of the pair being close to the same subject explored here by Stephen Baxter. The difference is that Bear keeps propping up your sense of hope at intervals, whereas Baxter keeps knocking it down. The only time you'll feel anything positive is so close to the end you might already have taken the pills. In the end, everything is futile. How incredibly black can you get?The characters don't ever seem to get on well with each other, never a lasting sense of trust between them - a side effect of the disjointed nature of their time-spanning relationships maybe. The Gaijin, Baxter's first contact &quot;eeties&quot;, never seem to do anything - they have mysterious projects that are never explained, and their only purpose seems to be to act as a cosmic Eurodollar and chauffeurs (who inexplicably won't go to some places) for our heroes. The scenery is mostly bleak, unforgiving terrain with a smell of destruction, and there's nothing pretty to imagine for the most part. Images of sickly worlds post-destruction. My sense of pity would been switched on better by seeing a &quot;before&quot; as well all the &quot;after&quot;s.Flicking through the book again, I feel whole chapters might have been reduced to paragraphs without loss. Although their every word seemed crucial at the time, in the end they contained little of vital importance to the story. In other places the intent is clearly to be mysterious about how the characters are being taught lessons, but when the explanation of these learning eercises finally appears it seems too trivial to have been worth the effort of the extraordinarily time-expensive lessons. When the Gaijin finally explain their teaching method, the Humans slap foreheads and say &quot;duuuh, now we understand what you were getting at..&quot; I can't believe this trait in the aliens, would they really be deliberately obtuse and waste eons of time and precious resources when six words and a futuristic Powerpoint presentation finally sufficed? Only to extend the novel, surely!I got to the end - but it was very hard to keep going at times because although the narrative was excellent, the futility was too much. Novels of destruction like this need at least a sprinkling of hope at intervals. Maybe I'll try Manifold:Time and see if I've misunderstood something... it isn't ever easy going into a series midway."},{"Title":"Manifold: Space","review":"Pretty good hard sci-fi book.

It is as usual a mixed bag hitting a low with the incredible Science as the creation of Darwinian \\"just-so\\" story tautologies by psychologist Nicholas Humphrey. The vacuous neo-Darwinian argument that things are as they are as they had to evolve that way is repeated yet again by Humphrey for consciousness as if he has made some profound discovery!!!If one can point to any progress over the course of these conferences in the mid-1990s it was that Tucson III ends with a final section on Phenomenology with eight chapters - the best of which is by B. Alan Wallace on Buddhist Phenomenology. Many of these chapters refer to the need to learn from Hindu/Buddhist yogic phenomenology (many New-Age types are very biased towards Tibetan Buddhism)and Husserlian phenomenology as the only way to really understand Consciousness with its transformations into different states of which mainstream Western philosophy and science are totally ignorant. But even these chapters often start well pointing out the deficiencies of Western approaches but then the authors' own models are themselves based on the same sort of culturally-limited assumptions which they had only moments earlier been criticising! It is truly hard to shake off indoctrinations! For instance, Laughlin holds to the Neuronal Man myth and views consciousness as some emergent phenomenon in central nervous systems with no ontological argument to justify his views. Harry Hunt tries to explain away the mystical Light in terms of Gibson's sensory optical array and reduce profound ontological claims to simple, trivial metaphors! The great mystics all assert that the Light is NOT a sensory phenomenon and sensory processes are stopped in deep mysticism!!! Jonathan Shear conflates Kant's Transcendental Unity of Apprehension or \\"Transcendental Ego\\" with the mystical Pure Consciousness when the yogic traditions make it clear that the Ego is not the same as the Deeper Self of the Pure Consciousness and that the subject/object duality disappears only when the Ego dissolves into the Light of Pure Consciousness!!!In the first section on the \\"Explanatory Gap\\" Galen Strawson begins to appreciate the Neutral Monist panpsychist position but then refuses to budge from conceptions of \\"physical reality\\"- a term also used by Hameroff without any self-questioning. Only physicist Malin discussing Schrodinger's concept of Objectivation of Nature by Science and Whitehead's 'occasions' as \\"throbs\\" of experience (just like the Spanda (vibrations) of Nondual Kashmiri Shaivism) and astrophysicist Piet Hut who points out that we only know the outside (\\"physical\\") world as part of our internal subjective world and that a new metaphysical basis to science is needed begin to grasp that Objectivation is the despiritualization of Nature by abstraction and mistaking the concept for Reality itself!Harry Hunt makes a good point as to what whether the conference is about a Science of Consciousness or moving toward a Spiritualization of Science. All this confusion stems from the Mind/Body dualism which, as Werner Heisenberg pointed out in Physics and Philosophy, permeates the whole of Western Thought. Its roots go well beyond Descartes to the Christian myth of Creatio ex nihilo in which Nature is created out of Absolute Nothing by an anthropomorphic God completely separate from Creation (i.e. Spirit/Nature dualism). To cut a long story short, no resolution of the problem of consciousness in the West will come till the universal Light Pure Consciousness (the No-thing-ness Plenum/Void)is understood as the Ground of All Being and the physical World as a manifestation through energetic vibrations. The Buddhist/Whiteheadian emphasis on the energetic vibrations as discontinuities ignoring the universal Ground also leads nowhere as in Christian de Quincey's strange contribution.In fact, I had already identified the physical correlate of the inner Light of Pure Consciousness with the brainwaves of the Brainstem Reticular Activating system in 1994 (see my other reviews) so all this huff-and-puff and brouhaha at Tucson was like a lot of fish unaware of the ocean in which they were all swimming! See my The Oneness/Otherness Mystery and perhaps also Philosophy of Space and Time and the Inner Constitution of Nature by mathematical physicist and mystic Michael Whiteman(Heisenberg himself checked the chapter on Quantum Mechanics in this).Sutapas Bhattacharya"},{"Title":"The Burning Hills (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book and all those that Louis L'Amour wrote are remarkable.

I have read and reread all his books."},{"Title":"The Burning Hills (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was one of the L'Amour books that I think is the reason so many people came to love his writing. It's about a strong hero who has a good purpose behind him, and there's romance in it and a LOT of action. But the chapters are so LONG! There are only five chapters in the book, and they go on forever and ever. I can't believe L'Amour would do that. It made the book drag in a few places. I had to keep comparing this book to books by Kirby Jonas, who critics call the New Louis L'AMour. The difference between them is that I could never put Jonas's books down, but I was able to put down Louis L'Amour. I'm glad L'Amour wrote this book, and I can see why they call Kirby Jonas the new Louis L'Amour. But I wish L'Amour had written more in the style of Kirby Jonas. There sure would be a lot more great books to read instead of a lot that were rushed out a little too fast!"},{"Title":"The Burning Hills (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I've always liked this particular story by L'Amour because I like Maria Cristina so much. She's a strong woman, proud and independent. Jordan teases her a little, saying that he needs to boss her around a little, but no one is going to boss Maria Cristina unless she lets them! She's different from the usual women in L'Amour's books, too, because she is Mexican, living in the area right around the Mexico/USA border. I loved the side issue of how she and her family were managing to survive in a changing and challenging world. The story is classic L'Amour: Jordan is being pursued by riders from a nearby ranch. Some of them stole the horses he and his partner had caught and were breaking, and killed the partner as well. Jordan catches up with them, finds the ranch owner and some riders and accuses them of stealing his horses and the usual western free-for-all happens. As with all of his books, though, you'll like this one if you like the others. If you don't or you don't like western actions books, you probably won't like this one."},{"Title":"The Burning Hills (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I want to preface this review by saying that Louis L'Amour is my favorite western writer.Although a great story and in keeping with typical L'Amour characteristics, I was frequently lost as to who was speaking or from what perspective at any given moment. I found myself thinking several times that the writing was that of an amateur rather than that of a master like L'Amour. It was also crazy-short. I read it in one easy afternoon, and then had nothing to do in the evening. Really, my low rating is because of my disappointment in the length of the story, and also the awkwardness of the perspective. Also, I thought the plot was a little underdeveloped for a L'Amour. Basically, skip this one and read a Sackett."},{"Title":"The Burning Hills (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Western literature has an undeniable charm and represents a unique creation in the world. Let me get rid of the radical rejection of Indians as blood craving and war monging individuals with no individuality. Native Americans are rejected into and by such clich&eacute;s. The land grabbing thieves that the Europeans were are calling wolf when the original landowners start defending their property. But western literature goes a lot farther than that. It shows an essential side of humanity : the desire to go beyond limits, to force the future, to create a new world out of nothing, or out of not much, to curb nature to human needs and projects, and Indians are only part of that nature. It also shows how human feelings are reduced to some basics that can be the foundations of a more complex construction, but that are most of the time the essential part of that construction that never gets off the ground. Humanity living within its basic needs. Love is thus reduced to the need to be needed and the need to be protected along with the need to need and the need to protect. This is simple but essential. We can maybe regret that all the romanticism and the elaborate feelings that love implies are not included in the western recipe but the basic sentiments of need-beneeded and protect-beprotected are an essential human attitude that shows how man and woman can only survive and create the future in difficult situation because that is their destiny. It is this fundamental human destiny to conquer the world and transform it which is essential in western literature. Then what do we do when these values are projected into modern life ? That's a completely different question that requires a lot of thinking and much discussing. Western literature is a central melting pot from which the iron of human endeavor can be produced and refined.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Burning Hills (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"THE BURNING HILLS was released in August, 1956, after both HONDO and GUNS OF THE TIMBERLANDS and offers excellent example of the early western writings of Louis L'Amour. Yet, for me, the book remains one of the better novels Mr. L'Amour wrote.The main protagonist, Trace Jordan, a horse trapper has been forced to kill a man. Suffering an incapacitating wound and hunted by a posse including an able tracker, Trace Jordan requires the essential help and care of the woman named Maria Cristina. She is a wonderful central female character, one as untamed as any in western literature, and one of the better ones Louis L'Amour ever brought to life.Another strong character in this book is Jacob Lantz, a \\"Dutch-Indian\\" tracker who could and did trail renegade Apaches successfully. A man who truly enjoyed his work very much, and his professionalism equaled his enjoyment. Jacob was the son of a Dutch trader, his mother a Ute squaw, and it was stated Lantz tracked with his \\"mind as well as his senses\\". Trace Jordan is both a wounded and trapped man and only the mercy of Maria Christina can help save him--for Jacob Lantz certainly means not to.A movie based on this book was later made too but as usual it fell far short of reaching the drama and tension present in Louis L'Amour's written novel. Should you enjoy Louis L'Amour books, especially early L'Amour books, consider this short book as it will offer a few hours of solid reading. And after this one you only have 110 or so books of his left to read!Though Louis L'Amour died in June, 1988, he left us many worthy books to read and re-read.

He's proud of his palatial beach home and pleased that his investments have accumulated into the multi millions. But Joe is sixty. The vicissitudes of age are taking over. He turns to a phallic implant and viagra to offset his impotence, consults a priest dispensing healing miracles for dental bone loss, but what can Joe do to achieve immortality? He does not want to die. Of all spectres, past or present, Joe Forcione fears death.Joe's quest - and a large chunk of his money - takes him around the world. He has sheep gland injections in an exclusive Swiss clinic and invests in various life enhancing or prolonging techniques. Perhaps he can escape death through cryogenics or cloning! The sky's the limit if you have the cash to buy it. Joe's mood improves along with his hope of finding eternal youth and escaping death. Soon he has a pregnant wife and mistress, an increasing [physical] appetite encouraged by a wandering eye, and a whole new set of problems to resolve.The characters in this book are not caricatures. Joe Forcione is a typical American in search of ever increasing wealth and all the trappings money can buy. And I particularly liked Father McDermott, the healing priest with feet of clay, who moonlights as an actor and enjoys quality time with his mistress every chance he gets.

He or she may seem and talk and act like an enlightened master (eg Osho), but the veil of Unreality ultimately will catch him or her.The difficulty with the Yogic path is, and most likely thing to happen, is that one could 'slip' and settle for being a guru or a miracle-worker and thus become bound deeper into a happy, all powerful sense of ego.Paul Brunton gives many many examples of such people and stays clear of them. As you read the story of his experiences, youunconsciously internalize the intellectual honesty and quest forTruth.He then meets a few Jnanis - more than one is in here. His meetings with Sage of Kanchi and the Maharshi are the satisfyingclimax of his Quest. But he also meets very many jnanis - at least two more in Madras (read the one with the outhouse meditator) and an astrologer in Kasi.A Jnani is one who has understood the Reality of how World is put together and what the Mind is and how the only truth is Pure Awareness that permeates everything all the time. This understanding of the truth, not Yogic practices, characterizethe spontaneity of a Jnani.Even though the original word Yogi means 'one who is united with God', it is currently being applied to practitioners of Yoga and in general, aspirants, which is why the distinction of yogi and Jnani is made here to point out that make sure to look for a Jnani (one who has attained the understanding of reality) and not to settle for other Gurus - who may be aspirants along the path little farther from us.Even though a saint and a yogi will eventually attain this Wisdom, it is very important to remember that they are on the path and have to be treated cautiously - for their ability to mislead us. Searching for a guru, it has been said, is like a blind person trying to judge whether his helper can see. If he could say that, he does not need a helper.Reading this book, the detailed and objective style of which is very characteristic of last century British writing, you canactually re-live a journey in 1900s India or even rural india of today and gain a sense for clarifying your own quest. THAT, is a rare thing, and the most important.First introduced to this book by a friends father, I have come back to the book once every two to three years over the last 20 years, each time I have felt the book is still relevant and itre-vitalizes my outlook - sort of a spiritual compass.Ravi Annaswamy"},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"This is an excellent book based on the experiences of the author, Paul Brunton, an Englishman, who toured India in the first half of the 20th century. The author's narrative is in the first person and he takes us with him as he journeys through India seeking the answer to the meaning of life. In the end, he seems to have found what he was searching for.The book &quot;My Father's Guru&quot;, by J. M. Masson which attempts to belittle Paul Brunton, instead reveals the egotism of Masson, who, rather than treat Brunton's ideas objectively, only aims to find fault with Brunton for nothing other than being excessively kind."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"This book describes oneof the most remarkable truelife spiritual adventuresever composed. Brunton'stravels in British India lead him to numerous remarkable gurus until, at last he experiences Enlightenment.

However, one of the minus points of this book is that Paul Brunton takes himself too seriously. I think the pride and arrogance of being a &quot;genuine&quot; spiritual seeker comes out too strongly in his narrative."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"Paul Brunton's book A Search In Secret India was first published in 1934 and has been regarded as a classic work on seeking a spiritual teacher ever since. This new edition gives new readers a chance to acquaint themselves with Brunton's work and the story of his travels in India, undertaken more than 75 years ago. While Paul Brunton tells a fascinating and in many ways exciting story, it has to be said that for the most part this book hasn't aged too well. This is primarily due to the kind of language Brunton uses and the way he tells his story. There is something old-fashioned, almost archaic, about the way he writes. It may have been the latest fashion in the early 30s, but it's not a style of writing that is likely to have a great deal of appeal to most readers today. His syntax seems unnatural and stilted, and some of the words he uses he might even have made up himself.Brunton travelled far and wide across India for months on end, and did indeed experience the whole gamut of Indian spiritual masters, monks, yogis, fakirs, and assorted miracle-men. The way he tells his story works fairly well when he restricts himself to just recounting his experiences as they happened. It's only when he starts rambling on, trying to be philosophical or analytical, that he loses the plot and becomes less than engaging.Most of the people he met on his journey will long since have disappeared down the tunnel of time, and of all the people we meet in this book it's probably only Meher Baba and Ramana Maharshi that will be familiar to most people nowadays. He dismissed Meher Baba out of hand as a well-meaning \\"madman\\" who greatly exaggerated his own powers and role in the world. He is full of praise for Ramana Maharshi though, and it is really only the sections that describe his meetings with Ramana and his teaching that are genuinely moving. While most of the book is interesting and entertaining, only the passages about Ramana Maharshi have the power and authenticity necessary to truly engage the reader and impart a flavour of genuine spirituality. It's as if Ramana Maharshi brought out the best in him as a writer, and the book ends with Brunton accepting him as his true spiritual master before returning to the West.Although A Search In Secret India has its shortcomings, it is still worth reading. It's a reminder that the spiritual search is truly an adventure that transcends time, and it should make for interesting reading even for seekers in this day and age.A very useful companion to Brunton's book is David Godman's excellent book on Ramana Maharshi's teachingBe As You Are: The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi (Arkana)Pathik Strand, author ofAll This is That"},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"A critical eye looks at the old world yoga.

The condition of enlightenment is self-evident and after the people Brunton encounters, you begin to understand how true that is. I strongly recommend this work!"},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"I love this book. Brunton's journey in search of Yogis is enchanting. His style of writing is reflective of the time in which he lived. I found his wording tremendously romantic, and his descriptions truly colorful. The experiences he had, and the wisdoms he garnered remain true and clear today. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Vedic wisdom."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"Search in Secret India, by Paul Brunton (PB) offers a dazzlingly beautiful look into both an earlier era of India's hidden sacred sites and teachers, and a profound spiritual journey in itself. The author was amongst the first of western pioneers to venture deep into the heart of eastern spiritual traditions, armed with a sufficient background in the philosophies and tenets of their foundational scriptures to be accepted into inner sanctums. He also brought a correct balance of openness, tenacity and a profound willingness and capacity to learn. He shares his gleanings in a wealth of experiences beautifully rendered for any reader, whether from East or West. While the settings were exotic at the time they were written, they are historic now, and precious for it. The spiritual experiences he relays in this book were early ones for this extraordinary philosopher and sage of the 20th century, and it is a privilege to trace his own spiritual steps through the stories he tells in this book."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"Originally published in 1936, I bought this book after reading In Search of Secret Egypt. The author is a very good writer. He's a general skeptic, but is open to spiritual possibilities. Along the way, he meets some very interesting people. And from the standpoint of a \\"spiritual seeker\\" he does a good job. I enjoyed this very much and would recommend. His time with Ramana Maharshi was very informative and interesting."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"I struggled to get through the first few chapters of this book. As someone who hasn't read many books on spirituality, I found the material a bit dry and cliched. Halfway through, the pace picked up and I could relate to his journey a bit more. Not a bad read if you can stick through until the end."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"The Author's journey in India in 40s gives him new experiences.He goes with an open mind and search of new things. Brunton has an eye of an journalist. He meets a lot of people - from street magacians to Shankaracharya. Some people impressed him and some just make him feel puzzled. This is a candid writing and one can see that some things in India are still the same after 60 years. Good for people interested in eastern Mysticism.The last part with Maharshi and realization of truth is incredible!"},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"This is one of the most astonishing true spiritual search books ever written. Brunton encounters a variety of masters and wonder-workers, and finds, in &quot;The Great Sage&quot; the answer to his quest. This book is a genuine classic."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"With Paul Brunton we have a combination of three things, a Journalist who writes exceedingly well, someone who understands western mystical thought and history and an ardent student of eastern mysticism. This combination produces powerful books and 'Search in Secret India' is just one of them. I recommend Paul Brunton's books to anyone who is interested in Mysticism. Just read one of them and you are sure to become a fan."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"It is indeed a breathtaking effort by Paul Brunton which has rediscovered the lost acme of human thoughts and the peak of spirituality."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"When I first read this book, I would have rated it three or four stars. I found it engrossing, fascinating, and uplifting.I have changed my opinion after reading &quot;My Father's Guru&quot;, by Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson (also featured on Amazon). Masson grew up in a family which adopted Brunton as its guru, and in his book recounts many of his own and his family's experiences with Brunton, telling a very personal story which ends in disillusionment and some bitterness.After reading Masson's book it became clear (at least to me) that Brunton fabricates much, including his own Phd. status. I now suspect that much of what Brunton wrote in &quot;Search in Secret India&quot; was also fabricated. Hence, as a work of fiction masquerading as a documentary I do not rate it very highly."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"Paul Brunton has such a great writing style that I could not put the book down. He approaches varioius mystics in and around India with a healthy skepticism while keeping an open mind. Some of the people he encounters range from outright frauds to the true mystic. I felt as if I were on an exploration of the region sitting side-by-side with Mr. Brunton and enjoyed every minute of it."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"This was my first exposure to the writing of Paul Brunton.

I handed it off to someone else when I was finished and it could very well still be passing around in India."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"As one who has read many spiritual books and is a follower of Paramhansa Yogananda, I was thrilled in reading PB's book on India. I was most impressed by his encounters with holy men who could perform wondrous feats. Most people from the west think that so-called miracles stopped with Jesus. I was captivated reading his accounts of meeting and interacting with the true holy men of India. His dealings with the phony conjurers was interesting and showed how relentless he had to be to find true saints. His written experiences were fully convincing and reflect just how much we have to learn about our abilities to move beyond the physical world we think is our only realm of operation. I recommend this book for anyone seeking a path to self-realization. It was a great read and very helpful to me."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"From my understanding Brunton is the one who brought attention to Ramana Maharshi to the west. The dialouges in this book are thus likely the first recorded talks between a westener and the Maharshi. They are very profound and unique. I often reread the dialouge alone, as it needs reflected upon. I don't list it below as a recommendation, because I don't think many would pay full price for a book based on a review that said \\"6 pages of it makes it worthwhile\\", but it's just my opinion that it's that unique and good.Books I typically always recommend: \\"I Am That\\", \\"Pointers From Nisargadatta\\", \\"Be As You Are\\", Talks with Ramana Maharshi, The Spiritual Teachings of Ramana Maharshi, The Bhagavad Gita, The Ashtavakra Gita, Advaita Bodha Deepika, No Mind - I Am the Self , and The Yoga Vasishta."},{"Title":"A Search in Secret India","review":"A book which seeks to understand the mystic India. The autors experiences indicate there is a deeper and richer world beyond our physical world. To the ignorant it is frightening and daunting. But it is a world full of love,peace and tranquillity.

Armed with the best intentions possible in that time, Paul Brunton reveals to us all the prejudices and deformed ideas that the Occident has of the East. And he played a role in the vulgarization of several erroneous ideas that nowadays are accepted with the largest naturalness. Of special interest is the chapter IX &quot;The Hill of the Holy Fire&quot;, where P. Brunton tells us his encounter with Shri Ramana Maharshi, a true Illuminated (obs: the ones that surrounded him at the end of his life and that proclaimed themeselves as their heirs weren't of the master's height).

Barnum of the exotic travelogue.He WAS able to write bestselling books about mysterious locales, but they were full of obvious inaccuracies and flat-out fiction. He wrote whatever he felt would sound dramatic and self-aggrandizing. In this book he relates a meeting with Meher Baba that has little to do with the actual interaction between the two. Although Brunton went on to be one of Meher Baba's most famous critics, in person he represented himself as a devout follower.I'm glad to see that his Ph.D. status is no longer attached to his name... he apparently made it up to lend more credibility to his writings.Check out Jeffrey Masson's 'My Father's Guru: A Journey through Spirituality and Disillusion' for more on Brunton's nonsense."},{"Title":"Daniel","review":"This book was copyrighted in 1958 by G. Coleman Luck. It is a short, almost \\"outline\\" study of the Book of Daniel. It is only 124 pages long (and the print is easy to read). By no means is this a detailed, historical look at the Book of Daniel. Rather, it is a brief introduction that may compel the reader to further study. Yes, it explains the passages in Daniel, but only in the briefest of terms and certainly not with exhaustive detail. But then, a detailed study is not the purpose of this book. This is a study in the \\"Everyman's Bible Commentary\\", so it is directed at a general audience and is not for Biblical scholars. It does provide the reader with an understanding of difficult passages, although in several places the author acknowledges the difficulty in interpretation of certain verses, and rather than plunge into an exhaustive study, he simply writes there are more than one way to interpret. He generally gives the most commonly understood interpretation.Daniel is a key book of prophecy in the Old Testament, and many of its prophecies are tied to similar prophecies in the book of Revelation and the Gospels. So an understanding of Daniel is important to understanding Bible prophecy in general. This is a good place to start one's study. It may be all one desires to know about Daniel, and for others, it may be a launching point for further study.kone"},{"Title":"Daniel","review":"This book is the perfect companion for one's studies of the Book of Daniel in Scripture.

It is a quiet and gentle diversion into another world and time. Beautifully and lovingly written by Gillian Tindall, the book speaks of the timelessness of the human condition, of loyalties and relationships, of loves and passions and hopes and dreams, some realized and some not. Truly, the more things change, the more they stay the same. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Celestine: Voices from a French Village","review":"I took this remarkable book by Gillian Tindall on vacation and enjoyed it very much. It is quite an impressive bit of social history scholarship. Tindall has really raked the public records to reconstruct this history. I had a bit of trouble keeping the villagers straight as time passed and new villagers arrived and departed the scene. But that does not matter; I grasped the overall picture. Even Celestine, whose letters first interested the author in the project, becomes but another character and the real subject of the book emerges as the evolution of rural France in the 19th century.It is really quite a fantastic story, and, of course, I was wholly ignorant of the backward conditions in the Berry region until well into the 19th century. I always thought of France as in the forefront of the industrial revolution, the enlightenment and the political changes in Europe. But I now know that that was pretty well limited to Paris and perhaps a few other urban centers.The book makes clear that lack of transportation was the chief culprit. People did not have horses and the paths were largely for walking and did not accommodate wagons. And the distances were vast given the conditions. The villages had no stores, no inns, no tradesmen. Goods were mainly consumed by the farmers themselves with only a small surplus available in good years for sale locally. Money was not in use and French was not used until the 3rd Republic pushed schools and roads into these rural areas. Essentially, as the author points out, notwithstanding the revolution and the Napoleonic period, the Berry in 1830 was much like it had been in 1430.The author also hints at the romantic myth that the French have bestowed on their rural areas. She does not go into detail, but hints that this view results in their inability to lessen subsidies to their farmers or modernize their agriculture. All these Frenchmen, especially those in the middle class, with summer homes in the countryside, are apparently convinced that way back their ancestors were peasant farmers with a deep love of the land. The English and we Americans certainly do not encourage this illusion: that we are the salt of the earth - or at least the descendants thereof. We have our own myths, but our agricultural subsidies are based on the fact that farm states have more representation in the Senate than their population would justify and the strength of the agribusiness lobby. In other words, no romantic notions, just good old greed and political power. This is easier to deal with."},{"Title":"Celestine: Voices from a French Village","review":"Gillian Tindall has written a warm, erudite, thoroughly enjoyable book about so much that is the very essence of France. The book is structured around the life of Celestine Chaumette, who lived in the old province of the Berry, in the very center of France. Her life spanned almost a century, 1845-1933, a period of tremendous change, evolution and development. But it is so much more than one life. It concerns transformations in the very heartland of rural France. Tindall is inspired to do painstaking research on Chaumette, her family and neighbors after finding a cache of letters that she had kept, which were now more than a hundred and fifty years old. The author is both a detective and an archeologist, and I had repeated images of her with a brush, dusting off the dirt from some artifact, carefully drawing conclusions as to its significance, as she pieces together people and events more than a century removed. She examines the records maintained by various French bureaucracies, the cemeteries, and the memories of the people who still live in the village of Chassignolles. It is also only natural that Tindall would often quote from the books of George Sand, also from the Berry, its most famous novelist, who preceded Chaumette by 40 years, so one can obtain a Doppler shift on the area's development. She also references other French writers, such as Balzac, the chronicler of 19th Century life who lived just to the north of the Berry.One of the book's themes parallels my favorite quote from Faulkner: \\"the past is not dead; it is not even the past.\\" Tindall derives the same sentiment from the French historian, Ferdinand Braudel: \\"...it is possible to look at chronology from the opposite end and therefore to interpret both past and present differently- to see, not the past as prologue and preparation for the present, but the present as evidence for the persistent survival of the past.\\" (p 152) Another famous French historian, Theodore Zeldin, started his \\"An Intimate History of Humanity\\" with the history of a maid, emphasizing that is how much of real history is made, as opposed to the \\"Big Man\\" theory of history. Tindall clearly echoes this sentiment eloquently: \\"There are lives that descend into silent tragedies that, piecemeal and partially hidden, never warrant statuettes or memorial histories, which have no place of honour in family lore, but whose inaccessible pain tugs wordlessly at the heart.\\"(p 170).In covering that almost century of French life, so much of the drama of France's history reaches into the small village that is Chassignolles, from the first extension of the railway from Paris, to World War I and Verdun. Concerning Celestine's \\"found\\" brother, who Tindall uncovered through her careful research, she says: \\"From the Auguste Chaumettes of France derived the bitter Franco-Algerian conflicts of the mid-twentieth century.\\" Tindall also makes another excellent point that I only recently learned from reading \\"The Discovery of France,\\" that in mid-19th century France almost half of the population did not speak standardized French: \\"In her stories, George Sand had to make her peasants speak more of less standard French to be understood by her readers. She explained in a preface that their real speech would have been impenetrable to an unaccustomed ear.\\" Another sadder aspect of French life, which I recently learned about from our friends in Velleron is also included: \\"A suggestion of a family pattern emerges, a fatal predisposition transcending individual circumstances in a world where all lived at the same rhythm, subject to the same hardships, but in which the occasional person was unaccountably \`not like other people.'...an apparent suicide... occurs often enough to form part of the accepted nature of the human condition.\\"Finally, concerning Celestine's life, Tindall makes the following statements which may haunt Americans confronting the greatest economic crisis of the last 70 years: \\"She had, as the implacable French saying puts its, \`mange son pain blanc en premier' - eaten the white bread of life first, so that only the bitter rye remained for her in her later years. She could not possibly have foreseen this.... The passing years had denied her the happy family of descendants she might reasonably have expected and had taken from her almost every advantage she had known in better days...\\"A wonderful work of scholarship and empathy for individuals of another culture, another time period. Gillian Tindall's book is an essential work for the Anglo world on the heart of France, and deserves a \\"plus\\" in addition to Amazon's top 5-stars."},{"Title":"Celestine: Voices from a French Village","review":"Fabulous book.

So it was with Einstien and theoretical physics, and so it is with economics and Thorstein Veblen as described in this book. Mr. Veblen descended from Norwegian immigrants to the US, and lived in the Midwest from the late 1800s to early 1900s. With a keen eye and insightful mind, he took in the huge economic growth of the US and the beginnings of mass consumerism and corporate advertising in the American population. What he saw was the formation of a middle and upper class that had both idle time and money to spare. Together, this created a leisure class that defined respect, social standing, and self-worth in terms of \\"pecuniary emulation\\", i.e. spending money on stuff and entertainment just because one could. Like a zoologist examining wild animals, Veblen picks apart the rituals, clothing, speech, and consumption habits of this newly rich. All of this is recorded and explained in extraordinary and sometimes comical detail in this book. Upon publication, this book became the first great work of economics by an American author, and made Veblen famous. Along with the Great Gatsby, this book provides one of the best description of the American upper class at the beginning of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"Excellent.

This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"I have no idea whatsoever of how true Veblen's analysis of American social reality was one - hundred years ago, or how true it is today. No doubt he did see ' social phenomenom' that were emerging and succeeded in finding the 'name ' for them. 'Leisure class' and ' conspicuous consumption' are part of the everyday vocabulary of the description and analysis of 'social life'. I know that Veblen was particularly hard upon the nouveau riche, those trying to prove by buying and having more that they were as good or better than ' old money'. However I wonder if in ' work ethic' America there is not also another kind of phenomenom, of people of great wealth feeling a special social obligation, as multibillionaires Gates and whether for good purposes or not, Ted Turner have displayed in recent years. I also have a problem with making the concept of ' leisure' an entirely pejorative one. What about those ' surpluses' at the state of the agricultural age which Lewis Mumford said were so key in creating civilization? Isn't it true that in many societies those who do not have to do productive work were freed for higher work of mind and spirit? I wonder then that is whether Veblen's condemnation of the 'leisure class ' is too ' blanket' a one in many ways. And this without denying the truths that great wealth often corrupts, leads to arrogance, and indolence, folly and waste. For years the conception of the US was of a society in which the middle class element was predominant, a society reflecting an equality of opportunity and the fact that the majority of people had been able to in time and through work raise themselves to a good level of life. The decline of the middle class in the sense of the growing gap between very rich and very poor is a fact of life in America. Perhaps this makes Veblen's analysis of a certain part of American society more pertinent. But again I think that there is a counter- tradition emerging in which many of the very wealthy assume that the way to real respect in the eyes of the public is in doing good for others."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"Conspicuous consumption describes the phenomenon of buying a product or service not for its utility or necessity but because of its prestige factor or impressive social value. Mr. Veblen's book is described as a satire, pointing out the hypocrisy and shallowness of the leisure or wealthy class. I am only partly through this book but I am finding it very thought provoking.If Mr. Veblen thought that consumption had a negative conspicuousness, indicative of a hypocritical nature among the wealthy of his day, I can only imagine what he would think of our entire culture today. It seems to me in our present society we have taken conspicuous consumption, beyond the hypocritical and the satirical and into the realm of the obnoxious, the immoral and even the criminal. This really isn't an economics book, nor would I say that it is scientific or academic in nature.It is more the thoughtful extrapolation of an intelligent, thoughtful and educated individual. Thorstein Veblen is more academic than Mark Twain and not quite as humorous. But he is very entertaining and extremely thought provoking. His style is much like Galbraith's - wordy, circular and humor so subtle that if you are not paying attention you could easily miss it. I am enjoying this book.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"I have found it quite amusing to read Veblen's book is depicted as a classic by those who like it (you know, considering that he, more than once, states that the appeal of classics is due largely to the leisure class scheme). Perhaps the unique, brilliant, at times repetitive and dull, at times invariably amusing, and always surprising tone and ideas Veblen has made their indelible mark, but I think that perhaps he would have said that those who admire his book solely as a classic cannot properly understand its message.From his anthropological analysis of the rise of the predatory and peaceable instincts to his ridicule of contemporary (ca. 1900) institutions and customs (I think his theories on clothing apparel, sports, and religion stand out) to his very serious critique of waste and exploit, Veblen wrote an incredibly interesting, unconventional theory. Undoubtedly, to my apprehension, direct and vicarious conspicuous waste (the most famous variant being direct conspicuous consumption) is the most interesting concept presented in the book, yet this is exclusively associated with the rich and what they do. No doubt, the rich's excesses must have been what prompted Veblen to write the book in the first place, but I think the more universal message is overlooked. He repeats this over and over: the leisure class scheme of life pervades society.I do not know if those who appreciate the book see that Veblen makes the case that conspicuous waste is EVERYWHERE. Those who command the scheme are those who we might identify to be the rich, sure, but how can we deny we are not all part of it? Veblen says that \\"any consumer who might, Diogenes-like, insist on the elimination of all honorific or wasteful elements from his consumption, would be unable to supply his most trivial wants in the modern market.\\" To him, I am sure, stripes on a shirt would have seemed wasteful, and a regrettable vestige of some eccentric attempt at invidious pecuniary emulation. Veblen's notion of waste is constructed to be universal, but in varying gradations (which is why he identifies waste most prominently with the leisure class).All this being said, Veblen is quite far from being perfect. The book does consider that there are motives and actions that are not guided by the leisure class' predatory instinct, but is at times vague in dealing with such things. Moreover, some of his explanations are on occasion convoluted or simplified so as to make them fit his general framework. Notwithstanding, anyone who has any interest in reading a great theory about how the rich ultimately dictate many of society's customs and institutions by inciting the lesser instincts that make consumerism possible, or in being amused by a sardonic critique of how wasteful our society can be, should turn to this book.A word of caution: To make a point, Veblen uses a language that would be today considered tedious and cumbersome, perhaps needless and excessively verbose at times, so be ready to deal with that. (I think that, unless pointed out, the fact that it is inferable that Veblen does this to make a point might go unnoticed. At the end of the book he states that usage of proper, preferably archaic language is observed precisely because it is useful and not up to date; this language is preferred because they \\"argue waste of time and exemption from the use and the need of direct and forcible speech.\\" The way in which he writes his book is the last, perhaps most subtle, sardonic bit of satire he offers us.)"},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"Some of the most influential and important studies of America and American life have been authored by visitors from other lands. One such example is this political study of economic man, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Authored by Thorstein Veblen, an immigrant from Scandinavia who settled in the Eastern US, this book examines the behavior of the rich and wanna-be rich in the US at the end of the 19th century.Defining the growing upper class of Americans who owned land, dressed nicely, showered daily and read the latest gossip as the \\"leisure class\\", Veblen proceeds to dissect their behaviors and actions and its causes and effects. The author shows how much of this behavior had no practical economic benefit, but instead served to advertise social success instead. As such, this is one of the first major works to apply Darwinian thought to social evolution and human behavior. Terms such as conspicious consumption and consumerism would spring forth from this book and those that followed in its wake.The book itself is quite easy to read for an economics treatise. Few are the numbers, fewer are the equations. Instead the reader gets wit, sarcasm, and lots of dry humor as the author recounts episodes of rich people acting dumb in the name of showing of their wealth status. The book is good reading, and recommended for those studying history, economics, sociology, or any other social science."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"This is a great classic book even if the writing style is a bit dense. This is a must read for anyone who wants to really understand why the 2008 banking meltdown happened. The book was written over 100 years ago and everything he talks about has just happened again. This book will give you the psychological and sociological understanding of why the wealthy act as they do and why the rest of the population suffers from their excesses over and over again. It will also give you good reasons for knowing why their intense desire to control all the resources must be actively managed if the middle class is to survive in any way shape or form in this country."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"Just read this after years of thinking I knew what it was, based on college professors years ago telling me what they thought Veblen was about. Turns out the guy was from Wisconsin, not Sweden, and that he was a master satirist, not an economist or sociologist, and that he died in 1929 at the ripe old age of 72. He gets a special award for using the word &quot;honorific&quot; over and over, and another commendation for making breathtakingly sweeping generalizations about human history and social development, and about contemporary (circa early 1900s) industrial relationships with ZERO (!) reference to data, and a dismissal of any need for any empirical verification of his conclusions. The conclusions themselves loop around themselves like a biplane seriously out of control, and in the end this mainly entertains. And in the propwash, we get new terms that have joined the English language: Conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, canons of respectability, and even skiing terms like &quot;traverse&quot; which could also, in our &quot;post-predatory&quot; culture, be a legal term from common law pleading. I think Veblen was mainly having fun here, and am surprised that my professors of yore saw this as a serious critique of capitalism. I thought they were smarter than that."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"I'd been to led to expect this book was an account of rather silly snobberies by the rich. And that it was exquisite in scholarship, writing style, and detail. Wrong.Thorstein Veblen - 1857-1929 - and I only checked these details after reading this book - was one of many children of Norwegian immigrants into the USA. They were, or may have been, ripped off, though his father seems to have made money afterwards - I'd guess via a gift of land from the US governement, though if so he seems to have been ungrateful. 'The Theory of the Leisure Class', published in 1899 when he was about 42, caused a stir - or at least that's the story. It precedes Ida Tarbell on Standard Oil by a couple of years.Veblen's writing style is agonisingly plodding, repetitive and dull. He includes a few Latin and other tags. This must have been a deliberate attempt to project an educated image. He took time to explain his use of some English terms (e.g. 'invidious'). Part of his effect is achieved by using words in slightly the wrong sense. He used 'evolution' rather than 'change' - it sounded more up to date. His typescript (or MS) must have been the sort publishers' readers dreaded. I can't quote a sample here for space reasons.----His model of human history is very simple indeed. There *WERE* two types of people and societies:[1] The sedentary village, low on force and fraud. He calls this 'quasi-peaceful'. There's a law of status. (pp 215 & 236). 'Savages' (undefined) have this sort of lifestyle.[2] Barbarians, who hate manual work, and prefer 'exploits'. They are ferocious, self-seeking, clannish, disingenuous. They like hunting. A predatory type. Veblen often calls them 'peace-distubing dolicho-blonds'. (He himself had very dark hair - remember Norway and Sweden separated at about this time.)---------However, *NOW* (about 1900) there is industry.[3] Veblen takes progress as given: 'as populations grow denser..', '.. stage of society..', '.. as the community advances in wealth and culture', are typical phrases. These days, the collective interests of modern industry work against the ferocious or selfish aristocrat type (p 227).4] There is a 'hierarchical gradation of reputability. Ownership on a large scale [is]... the most reputable of economic interests. [then] banking .. law.. the lawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of predatory fraud..' (p.231).-----------Veblen means by the 'Leisure Class' property and company owners, financiers, bankers, lawyers. In other words, anyone not concerned with direct manufacturing. Much of his book is concerned with the way they spend or waste money, and the way other people attempt to follow or imitate their behaviour.What is of value in Veblen?I have to say I was struck by the small number of piquant examples of oddities in spending and consumption; I'd expected more. Dogs as useless deferential mouths to feed; clean clothes uncontaimnated by evidence of work; William Morris's Kelmscott Press. Of men - walking stick, and powdered wig (from Alexander Pope?) On women, bodices, bound feet in China, and general feebleness, were signs of wealth in the husband. He has an odd passage about public parks - men keep the grass tidy, and this is an example of conspicuous consumption, because they are more expensive than cows.He doesn't seem to know about Chinese mandarins' fingernails, British sumptuary laws, rose gardens and knot gardens and huge country houses as statements of things which are attractive, but unnecessary. He doesn't know about follies, or for example the Hell Fire Club and the Parthenon, both of which in their ways offered employment. Moreover he doesn't seem to understand the economics: a US department store would not stock very cheap items - there's not enough money in them and will reduce other sales. They will cater preferentially for richer custiomers - and offer, say, sherry, wine, champagne, brandy and other glasses, just to make more money. Veblen's examples are a mostly natural outcome of normal economics. As further evidence, consider that, if Veblen was right, any conspicuous waste might happen: burning of notes, buying of things just to destroy them.As to the 'leisure class', Veblen, surprisingly, barely considers inherited wealth. New England had many sons and daughters waiting to inherit and the 'leisure class' would seem to fit them perfectly. But Veblen concentrates on other targets. Like Marx, he assumes factory owners just sit back and collect loot - he doesn't seem to realise such people *may* work extremely hard. Similarly, many younger sons of British wealthy families went off to die in various white man's grave parts of the world. For that matter, the 'wolfish earls' in 'Shakespeare' weren't exactly leisurely.Veblen comes across as a man who moved directly from a peasant society into a much more technologically advanced one. (This must be common now, with uncontrolled mass third world immigration into some modern societies.) It's not surprising such people gawp, and feel fear, and boost their egos with cautious contempt. But I don't think ultimately this book delivers very much."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"Sad to say, the Dover durables of midcentury and beyond are gone (if not forgotten); but when this value-price line was introduced in the mid-'90s, this book in particular was very welcome. Herein (though not exclusively) we find Veblen supplying an alternative to Nietzsche, specifically *Beyond Good and Evil*. This is a book about morals, or the lack of them; but coming from a man who all-but-assaulted his estranged wife with &quot;notions&quot; one ought not to expect a rousing defense of bourgeois morality. Rather an unstinting defense of some other way of life (such as is provided in his impossibly rare *Instinct of Workmanship*) what we have here is a Grand-Guignol treatment of the &quot;life-lie&quot; Veblen calls conspicuous consumption, which just might happen to exclude Symbolist &quot;vitalism&quot; (and as to the provenance of the concept &quot;dolicho-blond&quot;, consult Veblen's essay on the American small town). One of Marx's more assiduous Edwardian readers, such that people who can stand to consider social life in widest compass can stand to plunk down three dollars for this (rather fragile) volume."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"The term 'barbarian' comes up 106 times. 'Ethnic type' twenty-two times.This is thinly veiled Herbert Spencer \\"social Darwinism\\" being applied, complete with racist overtones, to economics. Don't miss his enlightening views on the types of 'Occidental Man': namely blondes, brunettes and 'Mediterraneans'. Guess which is best?I give it one star for the only half-decent chapter, on Conspicuous Consumption. Like others have noted there is no data, just loopy theories, throughout. Even his concepts aren't too original: rich folk don't want to do work, and show off their wealth through stuff and not working. This has societal impacts. There you go."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"It's true to say that Veblen's book is one of the great classics of economic theory; however, such a description suggests (at least to non-economists like myself) that the book will be either dull or remorselessly technical. On the contrary, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; is stylishly written, endlessly startling (for example, Veblen analyses religion as an outgrowth of the gambling instinct), and very, very funny. Its expose of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; (yes, Veblen was the one who invented this famous concept) is as relevant today as it was in 1899, if not more so. Whether or not you agree with all that he says, it's thought-provoking and exciting stuff."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"This opus by Veblen exposes the real meaning of the pecuniary advancement of the working and merchant classes, and the formation of elites based mostly upon money and asset valuation. The transfiguration of the traditional social and individual ethical values that this phenomenon produced, is portraited with clarity and sarcastic intelligence by the author in the book, first published in 1899.Now a classic of economic theory, as well as a text book of social science, it describes the tendencies of consumerism, leisure and the &quot;materialization&quot; of the ideals of the aspiring new princes (or noveau rich) of society. Veblen's vibrant satire of the tendency of the modern individual to believe that real accomplishment is all about aquiring a condition of ostentatious wealth and status, and his analisis of the inception of modern class structure in America, still stand, a century after, as recommended reading for historians and economists.If you are a fervent follower of advertisement, fashion, &quot;glamour&quot; and other modern expressions of consumerism , then you will find a surprisingly fresh portrait of yourself in this book. It worries me that the leisure class and its shallow views and values as described by Veblen, may still today represent elites in America and their religion, as analyzed by professor Lash in his last book &quot;The Revolt of the Elites&quot;. I highly recommend Veblen's best book, to scholars and sociologists at large."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"Known by his contemporaries as the only social theorist to apply Darwin critically, in 1899 Thorstein Veblen published The Theory of the Leisure Class: A Economic Study of Institutions, which was to become the basis from which all further American leisure history and theory stemmed. In his study, Veblen is primarily concerned with the &quot;new rich,&quot; whom he regards as social parasites that retard the growth of modern life. Thorstein Veblen wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class from a perspective that was largely isolated from his own culture, which either aided in his understanding of the Leisure Class or perhaps negatively influenced his opinions due to his exclusion from it. In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen essentially confines man and woman's existence on the planet as a struggle to change and adapt with the growth of their communities. Through this belief, Veblen develops a theme that amounts to the idea of a certain &quot;dominant&quot; type of individual. This individual develops a social structure through dominance in which social advance is sought by others. She/he will feel the discrepancy between the modern life and traditional life during the process. Though Veblen's rhetoric is sometimes anxious, sometimes negative, he actively pursues a specific account of the origins of the Leisure Class through individuals. The struggle for individual advancement eventually expands to include society, and the more individual struggle for advancement in society leads to the accumulation of surplus goods.Surplus of conspicuous consumption by the Leisure Class gives the class license to indulge shamefully in pure conspicuous consumption, where their occupations eventually become leisure itself. These &quot;professions&quot; of the Leisure Class by nature render it closed, and impenetrable by outsiders.Thorstein Veblen wrote the Leisure Class represented the new phenomena of conspicuous consumption compared to pre-Industrialized wealthy communities as well as contemporary working-class ones. But as intellectual inquiry into the topic of leisure has progressed over the past one hundred years, leisure has come to hold a number of definitions and meanings."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"The basic premise of this book is that modern humans have inherited an instinct to compete with each other for material resources. This competition takes place within the context of a small groups that share the spoils of the competition amongst themselves. (Other primates essentially do the same thing). The theory hinges on the question of what happens when a group of people have access to essentially unlimited resources, but still have the competitive urge. Veblen's answer is that they simply compete amongst themselves to see who can afford to be the most wasteful (like the scene in that Woody Allen movie in which two guys start ripping up dollar bills to impress each other). He refers to such waste as \\"conspicuous consumption\\".According to Veblen, the urge to consume conspicuously explains a lot of human behavior, including fashion, sports, and religion. In all cases the consumer wants to demonstrate to his peers that he can't possibly be involved in doing anything useful. A particularly funny consequence of the urge to consume is the notion of \\"vicarious consumption,\\" in which really rich people acquire other people (essentially servants and wives) to do their consuming for them. To emphasize the point they dress up their vicarious consumers in preposterous outfits and require them to perform pointless tasks with high precision (think of a butler in a tuxedo serving a 12-course meal or some such).In this vein, anthropomorphic religions essentially worship the richest guy of all. God is imagined to be so rich that he sits on a throne all day while people in silly clothes (clergy) do nothing but tend to his fabulous mansions (churches). It's an intentionally funny image, although Veblen is careful to say that he's not poking fun at the spiritual aspects of religion, just the form in which modern humans choose to express them.An interesting subtheme is the alliance between the \\"leisure class\\" and the poor, something we see happening today in American politics. In Veblen's theory the alliance occurs because the two classes essentially share the same mindset (obsession with status).Overall the book is fun to read, except for the writing style, which is reminiscent of essays written by high school students who are studying for the SATs."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"This may not be a book to read for recreation, unless you like 1890s verbal locutions, but there are other reasons to read it. The emergence of the economic analysis of Western society might intrigue you. You might discover the origins of such still useful terms as 'leisure class' and 'conspicuous consumption,' among others. You might be curious about author Thorstein Veblen's status-conscious, anachronistic world of working men and idle wives, which reflects upper-class society in his day. Published in 1899, this is a classic in sociology and economic literature, although it is a veritable dreadnought of density. It discusses property, ownership, status and leisure in a turn-of-the-last-century American context. Though scholars call it a 'satire,' the book is neither witty nor ironic. Instead, it is a stolid analytical daguerreotype of a world long gone. We suggest that if you tackle Veblen's old-fashioned, slow-flowing prose, you should do it for the background you may glean and the scholarly satisfaction you may feel when you are done. Instead of Alexander Pope's, 'What oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed,' this book presents what oft was said and usually better, but not as early."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have read in a long time.

The Penguin edition is also set in an elegant Caslon typeface that reads beautifully."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"Like the wealth of nations or Leviathon this book is both an economic, and social text.

Even though Veblen attempts to press the application of his thesis a bit too far, the thesis istself still has merit for the 21st century.

He spares no expenses in detailing in a very polite manner the idiossincracies of the noble and very rich when deciding what to buy, what to use and how to behave, going also to all lenghts explainning how these habits mold and form the habits of the not so rich and noble strata of the society. His theory of the leisure class reachs significance when compared to the rationality which some economists, classics and neo-classics, ascribe to the human being as an economic agent. I was quite surprised by the elegant style of Mr.Veblen and the fine irony (which he does not admit) with which he treats the rich and noble of his time. Sure, this is a book which could be also serve well times ahead and before Veblen's time."},{"Title":"The Theory of the Leisure Class","review":"I was extremely pleased with this book. It reduces the notion of society to a popularity contest in which fashion becomes the perfect expression of everyone's desire to be praised and noticed. As the American economy shifts from being a breadbasket to being the entertainment capital of a devil in blue jeans world, this book, from a much earlier historical period, shows how America always had the potential to achieve this kind of greatness. More than any other book, this one allows total enjoyment of the thoughts which it expresses. When a mind has been trained to blossom in this way, the greatest danger might be that it could be considered grandiose for daring to make such comments."},{"Title":"DEATH VALLEY In '49.

This book gives us a view of God's Holy Spirit not often taught from the pulpit. He tells us that incredible power is available to the believer to accomplish much for the cause of Christ, but we usually don't trust God to do much more than the mundane in our lives.&quot;Let's face it - many of us simly do not understand the Holy Spirit. We feel awkward relating to Him...&quot; And, he goes on to teach us how to understand Him and how to comfortably relate to Him.

I found myself more than once starting to get excited about where he was going only to have him cut himself short to redundantly warn readers about getting &quot;fanatical&quot; or joining &quot;cults&quot;. While I do agree that Christians should be duly cautious about dramatic experiences, claims, cults, and the plethora of charlatans who have paraded so called &quot;gifts of the Spirit&quot; on Television weighing everything they hear of and experience against the scriptures, I feel his cautions tended to overpower the many excellent points he made about how the Holy Spirit can empower, revitalize, and enable believers.I commend the fact that Mr. Swindoll was clearly trying to be conscientious by gearing his work to a general audience of believers at all points of the spectrum of belief. Still, the repetitive admonitions gave the impression that he felt most dramatic and/or physical &quot;manifestations&quot; were not to be believed and that most readers of this book were looking for a grand miracle to confirm their weak conviction, rather than a deeper relationship with this integral Person of the trinity.I feel the point that should have been more stringently stressed is how Christians themselves limit the Holy Spirit's influence and gifts because of feeble faith and a poor diet of God's word. When one is daily in the Bible and prays frequently and fervently seeking God's will in ALL they do, the influence and revitalizing qualities of the Holy Spirit are most poignantly experienced.This is not to imply that the book has no merit or that there is nothing to be gleaned from it. On the contrary, Mr. Swindoll infuses most of his many excellent points with a healthy smattering of pertinent scripture and tended to lean more on Biblical truths than his own understanding. This is the sort of attentive preaching and teaching we could use much more of."},{"Title":"Flying Closer to the Flame","review":"If not for the dated nature (15 years old) of \\"Flying Closer to the Flame\\" I would surely give it five stars. In 1993, Chuck Swindoll, then President of the non-Charismatic, cessationist Dallas Theological Seminary somewhat shocked the Evangelical world by his authorship of this book.As his title suggested, Swindoll was encouraging those who believe that the sign gifts have ceased to hold those theological views while remaining open to experiencing the full power and presence of the Holy Spirit today.Non-charismatic cessationists teach that the sign gifts (such as healers, miracle workers, speaking in tongues, prophesy, etc.) ceased at the completiion of the New Testament canon. This has often caused them, according to Swindoll, to minimize the ongoing role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life today.With careful exegesis presented at the lay level, with careful balance avoiding extremes, and with an irenic spirit, Swindoll invites non-charismatics and charismatics alike to consider what the Bible does say about the Spirit's non-sign-gift-work today. He rightly teaches that there is much that the Bible promises about the Spirit's ministry that is still alive and well today.Laying this foundational biblical theology, Swindoll moves into practical/pastoral theology of the spiritual life. He explores with readers the role of the Spirit in decision-making, guiding, and leading the believer. He examines the filling and fruit of the Spirit and how the Spirit produces spiritual maturity in believers today.For readers wanting an updated and more scholarly focused study of the same topic from a cessationist perspective, \\"Who's Afraid of the Holy Spirit\\" by Wallace and Sawyer is the recommended text.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Beyond the Suffering,\\" \\"Soul Physicians,\\" and \\"Spirtual Friends.\\""},{"Title":"Flying Closer to the Flame","review":"\\"Flying Closer To The Flame\\" by Charles Swindoll concerns a topic controversial to some people - the Holy Spirit. Indeed, the Holy Spirit can be ignored when discussing God the Father and God the Son (Jesus Christ).The topic of the Holy Spirit has been a source of disagreement between charismatics and non-charismatics for some time.Swindoll treats the topic evenhandedly and seems to be grounded biblically in his discussions.The book is around 270 pages and covers such topics as:1. The filling of the Holy Spirit.2. Drawing close to the Holy Spirit.3. The inner promptings of the Holy Spirit.4. The role of our emotions.5. The power of the Holy Spirit.As with other Swindoll titles, the book is readable and the narrative flows freely.Read and enjoy. Recommended."},{"Title":"Flying Closer to the Flame","review":"In this book, Chuck Swindoll speaks to those Christians who have been reticent about experiencing God on an intimate basis. He promotes a balanced, experiential, biblical view of the Holy Spirit.Pastor Swindoll contends that Christians are attracted to the Holy Spirit like moths to a flamed (hence the title of the book), and he urges us non-charismatic Christians who are shy of becoming too emotional or falling into error to draw nearer to God through the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit will do for us what we cannot do for ourselves- guide us into all truth.Pastor Swindoll does not say that we need new revelations of the Lord, but we need to \\"expand our understanding of what He has already revealed\\". He goes on to say that every one of us in God's family has experienced at one time or another some inner prompting of the Spirit, such as feelings of hope and encouragement in times of loneliness, a sense of calm determination and courage when threatened by fears, feelings of inner reassurance in times of danger or disaster, and the grace that the Spirit ministers to us times of great sorrow and pain.In the chapter entitled \\"The Spirit and our Emotions\\", Pastor Swindoll says that many of us have been taught not to trust our feelings, and that this is a mistake. God made us whole people, with intellect, will, and emotions. We respond to God from the depths of our emotions when we praise and worship Him. We experience peace as well as joy and love due to the work of the Holy Spirit.In the chapter entitled \\"When the Spirit Brings a Slow Recovery\\", Pastor Swindoll points out that when we pray for an instant recovery and we don't get one, we often wonder (as well as those around us) if we lack faith or if there is some area of sin in our lives. He says that we need to acknowledge what God is doing in our lives during the time of our long recoveries, such as drawing us nearer to Him, sustaining us with His grace, deepening our faith, teaching us patience and endurance and our need to depend on Him. I really appreciated this chapter, having gone through some long recoveries of my own. Some of the people around me seemed to be more impatient with my slow recovery than I was.Thank-you Chuck Swindoll for writing this book!"},{"Title":"Jazz masters of the thirties (The Macmillan jazz masters series)","review":"Rex Stewart offers chapters on some of his contemporary jazz musicians; most of these articles have appeared in Downbeat issues in the sixties before they were collected for this book.

With studious attention to detail, Atget seemingly photographed every intimate corner of his much-loved city. Leaving the well-known monuments and boulevards to others, Atget instead concentrated on the atmospheric fabric of everyday Paris, photographing shops and window displays, cobbled streets, doorways, stairways, vehicles, churches, amusement parks, street-peddlers and prostitutes.Unraveling the mystery of Eug&egrave;ne Atget's life and work is easier said than done. Now considered to be one of history's most important photographers, Atget was relatively unknown during his lifetime. Posthumously famous for his photographs, Atget in fact made only a humble living selling his prints to architects, artists, and institutions.Atget wrote in 1920, &quot;I may say that I have in my possession all of Old Paris.&quot; His systematic method of photographing Paris street by street is spellbinding, and the result is a detailed catalogue of 19th century Paris.

Paul Getty Museum's latest photography book installment - focusing on the work of Eugene Atget, offers the best example of curators creating much ado about an artists work, through speculation and second-guessing. This merely justifies the curator's reason for employment, while boring the reader with a treasure trove of euphemisms and art-speak banter. That we learn more about each speaker's own Rorschach test interpretation of the photographs and less on the artist is not the point. The point is, why does the final third of the book contain this colloquium, when it could easily have been filled with more samplings from the Museum's 295 Atget holdings? Atget's images of Paris are brilliant for what they represent: a visual recording of what he considered worth preserving in pictures. His subject matter ranged from buildings and statues - to interiors, street merchants, and anything worthy of pursuing photographically in and around Paris.

They have been recommended to me by several photography instructors as a way of introduction to the \`greats' and big ideas of photography. They are small enough to carry around and contemplate at leisure. The limited number of images is also conducive to study.Atget's images are impressive, varied, often thoughtful or clever, and sometimes stunningly beautiful, especially considering the limitations of the plates of the time. One can imagine the old man lugging his heavy camera and glass plates through Paris in the pre-dawn mist.The accompanying essay was also enlightening."},{"Title":"Eugene Atget","review":"Eugene Atget spent his 30 years in photography making over 10,000 large-plate negatives of the art, architecture, and lives of Paris. His photographs capture the beauty and emotion of Paris in the late 1800s. Atget does an amazing job of engulfing the viewer into the Paris city life. His pictures of storefronts and street scenes are amazingly lit and present a romantic yet true to life view of Paris.This small but powerful book is one of many in the Phaidon 55 series. The small size is great for carrying around, and even though the pictures are smaller then those in most photography books, they still hold true to the original prints. There is a short introduction and history of the photographer at the beginning. Each picture is accompanied by a brief description and insight into the photograph. Even though the size is smaller then most photography books, the images are still great quality, and for the price you can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Eugene Atget","review":"This small volume of photographs of turn of the century Paris and its surroundings is my hands-down favorite photography book, and is a revelation of the potential poetic power of photography (sorry for the unintended alliteration...). Many of the pictures were taken in the early morning light so that there are few people out and about; just the empty cobblestone streets, the silent barroom, the mute statuary. There is amazing depth to many of the pictures which becomes positively three-dimensional if you look into them with one eye shut. But it isn't just Atget's photographs that make this book so special; I have other volumes of his work that don't move me in the same way at all. It is the simple and beautiful way that the book is laid out, so that you're only looking at one photograph at a time, as well as the excellent choice and sequencing of the photographs. Even the opening essay is probably the best essay about Atget's work that I've read. It is the combination of Atget's own extraordinary artistry coupled with the artistry with which this particular volume was put together that brings me back to it again and again, more than any of the many photography books on my shelf."},{"Title":"Eugene Atget","review":"As a up and coming architecture photograph I found this invaluable and well arranged."},{"Title":"DREAM BIG - THE HENRIETTA MEARS STORY","review":"The Henrietta Mears story is very inspiring.

I've read it so many times, I've lost track. When I first read it, I couldn't believe it wasn't a nineteenth century French novel, and that author Guy Endore was a twentieth century American.Werewolf is the odyssey of born pariah Bertrand Caillet, a werewolf in spite of himself. Every life he touches suffers, whether he means it to or not. He rifles graves for sustenance during his lycanthropic episodes, and conceals his identity by becoming a French soldier during the Franco-Prussian War and the Communard uprising. He even finds the one woman whose love might save him, an equally bizarre but oddly touching Jewish outcast named Sophie with decidedly S&M; tastes.The novel is many things, not the least of which is episodic. It's a love story, a war story, a tragedy, and an absurdist comedy, by turns. It's grotesquely funny, and hilariously terrifying. Most of all, it's a mature social satire, and just an incredibly damn good read.Crime of crimes, this magnificent literary masterpiece has once again fallen out of print. Seek it out in the used book bins, until some publisher manages to rediscover it and put it back on the shelves of your local bookstore."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"I suppose that I owe a debt of gratitude to writer Marvin Kaye, who selected Guy Endore's classic novel of lycanthropy, \\"The Werewolf of Paris,\\" for inclusion in Newman & Jones' excellent overview volume \\"Horror: 100 Best Books.\\" If it hadn't been for Kaye's article on this masterful tale, who knows if I would have ever run across it, and that would have been a real shame, because this is one very impressive piece of work indeed. In this beautifully written novel from 1933, we learn the history of one Bertrand Caillet, the product of a lecherous priest with a sinister family history raping a French peasant girl in the early 1850s. Caillet is later raised by Aymar Galliez, the nephew of the woman who had hired the peasant girl as a maid, and his notes on Caillet, purportedly found many years later by the author, form the kernel of this tale. It does not take Aymar long to realize that something is decidedly wrong with his young charge; in fact, Caillet is a werewolf, who loves nothing more than leaping out of his bedroom window at night and killing livestock and assorted wayfarers around the countryside. Years later, as a young man, Caillet runs away to Paris, to continue his depredations in a more populous arena, but at a most inauspicious time: right in the midst of the Franco-Prussian War, and right before the incredible violence of the Paris Commune of 1871. But this novel is so much more than a simple tale of horror, although there ARE many grisly scenes. Endore (whose real name was Harry Relis) views his werewolf not as a monster, but rather as a sympathetic victim. Although Bertrand commits some truly horrible acts--killing his best friend, committing incest with his mother, despoiling graves, murdering countless creatures, draining his wealthy Jewish girlfriend (a neurotic, self-destructive, death-obsessed girl who today would probably be a Goth) slowly of her life's blood--the author makes it clear that the atrocities going on around him (e.g., the 20,000 Parisians killed by the Versaillists during the Commune) make his sins seem small indeed. Presciently, the author says that future wars will kill millions, a prediction sadly borne out just a decade after this book's release. Perhaps what is most remarkable about this tale, though, is its seeming veracity. Endore gives us so much information about the Commune, and peoples his novel with so many actual historical figures, that it really is difficult to tell where fact ends and fiction begins. There supposedly really was a Sgt. Bertrand in 1840s Paris who was said to be a grave-despoiling werewolf, and that fact adds an additional frisson to this tale. Thus, \\"The Werewolf of Paris\\" works as both an excellent tale of terror AND an easy-to-take lesson in French history. I knew virtually zilch about the Commune before going into this book, but feel that I've learned quite a bit about it now, and in a fun way, too. That's not to say that fans of a good horror tale will be left unsatisfied. As I mentioned, this tale contains its fair share of gore and grue, and some pretty terrible incidents are depicted. The horrible tale of that lecherous priest's ancestor being tortured in an oubliette will not soon be forgotten, the real-life facts of the Commune atrocities are equally quite disturbing, and a discussion of the dietary experiments tried by the desperate Communards (ragout of rat, anyone?) will surely turn the stomachs of most. The pitiful final fate of Bertrand Caillet will surely move most readers, too. Despite an occasional glitch here and there (Bertrand travels northeast to reach Paris from the Yonne River valley, when he should be going northwest; Bertrand is said to have been interred in August 1873 and exhumed in June 1881, after eight years and two months, but that should be seven years and 10 months), this really is a terrific piece of writing from Mr. Endore. Anyway, thanks again, Marvin! I owe you one!"},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"Guy Endore's 'The Werewolf of Paris' is rightly considered a classic of horror and being published in 1933 as one of the first literary treatments of lycanthropy. The story is told from the view of an American scholar studying in Paris who happens upon an old manuscript concerning the court martial of Sergeant Bertrand Caillet at the time of the Paris Commune. The story of Bertand is then recounted, how he was conceived when his mother was raped by a priest and how he was born on Christmas Eve, a bad omen according to local superstition. At first he seems like a normal boy but then he starts to have strange dreams and farm animals start to become mysteriously slaughtered. His adoptive uncle suspect something is amiss with young Bertrand, but keeps the suspicions of the local villagers lulled by locking Bertrand's room at night and feeding him raw meat, which keeps his lycanthropy quiescent. This works for a few years until Bertrand is old enough to travel outside the village for his school exams, where he has an unfortunate tryst with a prostitute and acquires a taste for human blood. When his uncle finds out what has happened Bertrand flees to Paris, where he gets caught up in the turmoil of the Franco-Prussian war.Bertrand is presented as a likable young man afflicted with a condition beyond his power to control. We also sympathize with his uncle who follows him to Paris, conflicted by his love for his adopted son and guilt over the deaths caused by him. Bertrand's crimes are contrasted with the horrors of the Paris Commune and the even greater horrors of the reprisals by the Versailles government. The book meanders somewhat but is still a very good story and a classic of the genre."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"The Kindle version of this book is so full of typos that it starts to become a distraction. In fact, if it weren't for all of the typographical errors, I would have given the book 5 stars.The story itself is quite good. Even though it was written in the 30's, the language is still fresh. I found it to be as well written as Dracula or Frankenstein, and definitely easier to read than the latter. The plot is a little predictable, but that is true of all of the horror genre archetypes. At it's current price of $2.99, this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"First, the edition. The Kindle Edition publishers and Amazon should be ashamed for having let out such a horrific version to the public. Almost completely unformatted, the volume of spelling errors, typos, grammatical problems, etc. is so extreme that I actually had to stop reporting them. Before I stopped, I reported over 50, many of which made whole sentences totally incoherent. I know it's only $3 for a digital copy, but one staffer's reading this could have fixed a lot of problems. Example: The word \\"wifi\\" is where \\"will\\" should be a number of times. Given that the story takes place predominantly during the 19th century, wifi is unlikely. \\"Modem\\" also comes up in place of \\"modern.\\" This problem is so rampant that I recommend the new print version to interested readers.The book ranks somewhere in the 3 to 4 star range. I enjoyed it, though many of the complaints in other reviews are fair. It draws from a lot of historical events, and is much better if you are familiar with the Paris Commune. It is also disjointed, and at times I found myself wondering when the subject changed.It is not terribly gory, though it is unsettling. While the murders might not shake you, the rape and incest will turn the stomachs of the even the most heartless reader. Despite the terrible actions of almost everyone involved, sympathies do build for many of the primary players, though figures introduced late in the book feel a bit hollow at times, and some of their actions, particularly Sophie's, are questionable given what the author offers about her."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"This is a fascinating novel. It deserves to be better-remembered than it is. It is a well-researched epic, written with a good deal of wit. It tells the story of Bertrand, who was born a werewolf. It follows his tragic life to its bitter conclusion. The story is quite subversive, involving a lot of social commentary and quite a bit of kink.Those readers looking for an out-an-out horror story might be a bit disappointed. The novel is very digressive - we lose Bertrand for great swaths of the story. We know that he turns into a wolf, but there isn't much description of his werewolf activity here - that is left to the readers imagination. We know he can turn into a wolf but he is not a slave to the full moon. He does not even fully change when he attacks people. The change can be staved off as long as he is given plenty of meat...or, if his obliging girlfriend will let him drink her blood.I read the Kindle edition of this book. It does not come with the forward by Thomas Tessier and there are many typographical errors."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"\\"She awoke to find herself in the grip of a strange tenor.\\" I found that sentence part of the way through the edition of \\"The Werewolf of Paris\\" by Guy Endore. \\"Poor mutilated book,\\" I thought. Just as the protagonist has his intentions twisted into a grotesque and horrible reality by his discovery that he is a werewolf, I found as I read this novel that my emotions were strangely twisted by these bizarre accidents that appear in this edition to have been created by a text scanner and not adequately proofed.\\"She was overcome with honor.\\"I read \\"Voltaire, Voltaire,\\" by Guy Endore when I was a teenager and my imagination was enflamed by the ambitions of Jean Jacques Rousseau. This tormented writer lived in a maze of contradictions. He wrote about the relationship between the individual and society in \\"The Social Contract,\\" and abandoned his six illegitimate children; he wanted to be like the writer Voltaire, but he was not witty enough to write a satire like Candide.I wanted to write like Guy Endore. I studied French and read about the Enlightenment and disapproved of everything that people said, but defended their right to say it. I read \\"The King of Paris\\" a biography of Alexander Dumas by Endore and I was inspired to write millions of words of fiction--or hundreds of thousands of words, anyway.I read his biography of the Marquis de Sade and found myself understanding, at least intellectually, the complicated relationship between pain and pleasure, tormentor and victim.On the basis of those biographies I wanted to read \\"The Werewolf of Paris.\\" I knew that it would be passionate and that it would hold up a mirror to a world that I had never seen, but wanted to know all about.He paused to gaze at his reflection in the minor.I couldn't find the novel in my local library when I was fourteen, but the title stuck in my mind along with the assorted werewolf references that accumulated there over the decades, from Warren Zevon's song \\"Werewolf of London,\\" to the movie \\"An American Werewolf in London.\\" So the title popped into my head while I was shopping for books online and I popped for the read.I'm not as interested in French history as I once was, but I became absorbed in the sufferings of the protagonist and thought that the descriptions of the \\"Terror\\" in the novel were as fresh and terrifying as many of the horrors depicted in the daily newspapers that I read to this very day. It seems that in some parts of the world, even some parts of the very city I live in, people distrust and mistreat each other by torturing and killing them, while next door, or on the next block or in the next office-building a civilized veneer persists and people are polite and crack jokes."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"Authors are painters -- little fellas that you invite into your mind who then proceed to paint pictures on the walls of your brain. Some pictures are pretty. Others are visions of horror so twisted and evil that we can only whisper the descriptions.

Though the filming techniques were cheesy, watching Lon Chaney transform from wolf to human in the 1941 Wolfman made me shiver when it was replayed on Saturday afternoons. I was similarly chilled by Dracula and Frankenstein in both film and print. Two years after those films were released in 1931, \\"The Werewolf of Paris\\" by Guy Endore was published. Endore's book is now back in print.The wolfman myth is especially intriguing since I may become one myself. Chaney's wolfman appears after he is bitten by another werewolf. However, according to Romanian myth, people like me who were born between in the 12 days between Christmas and Epiphany (thus conceived during Easter when sex was forbidden) are destined to become werewolves.Like Romania's lycanthropes, Endore's wolfman was born, not bitten. Bertrand Caillet is conceived when his mother is ravished by a false priest; scion of an ancient, degenerate family. Young Bertrand is a charming, puppyish boy, but when he nears puberty mangled animals begin to appear, and his guardian locks Bertrand in at night. His appetite seems to be tamed by a raw meat diet, so the young man is allowed to attend school in Paris. Then the killings begin ...\\"The Werewolf of Paris\\" holds up well after several decades, though its pace and graphic depictions are rather tame by today's standards. However, it is a fine tale of compulsion, both physical and sexual, and it questions human nature itself. Can the beast within Bertrand Caillet be controlled? And what about the rest of us - does a ravening wolf dwell within our souls, to be revealed when stress or temptation overcome our better natures? An intriguing and entertaining read.-- Jo Ann Butler"},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"Pretty good yarn. Interesting concept: that horrendous, long duration punishment can be a causal factor in bringing forth werewolfian traits that become embodied and inheritable.However, a practical impediment to enjoying this nice, scary book were the numerous typos that made parts of it all but unreadable in the Kindle version. Too often I had to stop and try to decipher exactly what word was meant, since the letters were so garbled. In some instances I just skipped the words entirely because I couldn't fathom what they were supposed to mean. All this hesitation naturally interrupted the flow of reading.Other that the lousy transcription, it was an interesting book, particularly considering it was written in the early 30s, and there was language in it clearly foreshadowing the absolute barbarity of World War II and of the Nazis and Soviets in particular. These forecasts were even better than H.G. Wells's forecasts because they were specific and dead on."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"Frankenstein, Beauty and the Beast... that whole line of thought about the beast that causes so much damage but you still feel for them because their curse is not of their doing. Bertrand (the werewolf) is in the same boat. He doesn't want to be what he is but doesn't know how to escape it. He meets the beautiful French socialite Sophie and believes that his love for her can possibly cure him but of course that doesn't work. While he tries to find answers, he is constantly being hunted or just trying to avoid the possible chance of being found.While there are some pretty gruesome bits in the story to make it creepy, there is alot of human interest to the story as well. You really feel for the characters and question who really is the antagonist in the story. The one fault I had with the plot is Endore's interjections of these long passages of description that don't seem relevant while you're reading. They just appear to be crazy tangents or afterthoughts he wanted to squeeze in. These passages do make sense later on but I found those parts tedious reading. Everything else made for a really good story! Endore packs quite a bit of history into his storytelling which I found very educating and interesting."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"(And it's really written with all the good taste left to literature by the very beginning of the twentieth century...

And he felt his tongue, the short and bulky tongue of man, begin to flatten and lengthen. \\"God help me!\\" he cried. But now the tongue was curling out of his mouth, was hanging over his teeth. Unable to resist any more,he sprang from his bed. He went to a corner of his room, muzzled under a piece of cloth and dragged forth an arm, a human arm. The last of the two arms he had taken from La belle Normade.He sank his teeth into it. His eyes glared around suspiciously. Low growls came from his throat. For a while there was silence, then there were more noises, the slap of a hard dead hand as it hit the floor, the crunching a of bone, and occasionally a sharp tick as a ring on one finger struck the wood.\\"*****************\\"Aymar soon discovered that he was talking nonsense. The Commune shot fifty-seven from the prison of La Roquette. Versailles retaliated with nineteen hundred. To that comparison add this one. The whole famous Reign of Terror in fifteen months guillotined 2,596 aristos. The Versaillists executed 20,000 commoners before their firing squads in one week. Do these figures represent the comparative efficincy of guillotine and modern rifle, or the comparitive cruelty of upper and lower class mobs?Bertrand, it now semed to Aymar, was but a mild case. What was a werewolf who had killed a couple of prostitutes, who had dug up a few corpses, compared with these bands of tigers slashing at each other with daily increasing ferocity! \\"And there'll be worse,\\" he thought and again he had that marvelous rising of the heart. Instead of thousands, future ages will kill millions. It will go on, the figures will rise and the process will accelerate!

Interlaced with the story of Paris during the turmoil during the German invasion of the 19th century, this werewolf tail is a study in human nature. It's well written and an enjoyable read, but also displays the depth of a classic and skill of a true master of literature."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"Although it is considered the original werewolf story, it's obvious why \\"The Werewolf of Paris\\" has not become a popular monster classic like \\"Frankenstein,\\" \\"Dracula,\\" and \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" A slow-paced story, it is not very well-written and certainly not very compelling. Don't get me wrong, there are interesting parts and points made in the book. But, overall, it definitely is not a compelling monster story. Added to that is the disturbing fact that my edition (Blackmask Online) was filled with numerous misspellings and typos. The tale of Bertrand Caillet, who was born on Christmas Eve to a mother who was raped by a priest, \\"The Werewolf of Paris\\" follows Bertrand from birth to his participation in the Paris Commune of 1871. Born a werewolf with hair on the palm of his hands, Bertrand kills a few people and then goes to Paris and falls in love. Although there are scenes of Bertrand killing as a wolf, don't expect to find any transformation scenes, or even much about Bertrand's life as a werewolf. Apparently, the story contains one of the first references to a \\"Wolf-man,\\" however, and this inspired the classic horror movie. As a monster novel, one is advised to read \\"Dracula\\" or \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" for a more interesting and better written story. As a werewolf novel, one is advised to read Adam Pfeffer's \\"Kolak of the Werebeasts\\" for a more stimulating and compelling horror tale. The book was written by Guy Endore to compete with \\"Dracula,\\" but, in my opinion, the story falls short of a classic monster novel. Although it is readable, there are better and more compelling stories in this genre."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"Endore's book starts out well enough, with a slice of history that leaves your stomach turning. From there, the book goes down-hill. The supporting characters might as well be cardboard cut-outs, for all of their personality. Then, towards the middle of the book, the author starts introducing historical information about the revolution taking place during the books time period. Though the revolution does effect the characters, the way that Endore completely throws the plot out the window to focus on the history is terribly excessive. The single thought-provoking idea that Endore does discuss is this: who are the real werewolves? Is it the man who changes when there is a full moon, or is it you and I when we're at our worst? I would recommend this book to a history buff, but if you're simply on the look-out for a good thriller, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Werewolf of Paris","review":"This book was so bad I didn't finish reading it.

This book is terribly ambitious as it intertwines Hebrew culture with 19th century English society while exploring characters in incredible depth. The narrative structure is also quite bold, and I found myself repeatedly applauding Eliot's uniqueness. The story of Daniel Deronda (a handsome, brilliant, incredibly moral young English gentlemen with a penchant for rescuing people) takes an unconventional approach and ends in an unconventional conclusion. Eliot skillfully avoids the cliche route taking the reader along with the characters on a surprising journey. The reason I only gave 3 stars to a book I like is that I found it slow-going until over halfway through. I have to admit (sheepishly) that I've always found Eliot's style to be so verbose and intellectual that it's a bit dry for my taste. (I'm more of a Dickens and Austen girl--I need humor!) But as the story moved along, I was turning the pages faster and faster. The final quarter of the book is the strongest, in my opinion, and I definitely think this book is worth the time it may take you to read it."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Daniel Deronda was the final novel authored by George Eliot(1819-1881) whose real name was Mary Ann Evans. In this novelEliot tells the story of two intriguing fictional characters:Gwendolyn Harleth-egocentric, spoiled and rich husband huntingyoung lady noted for her beauty, wit and charm. Her marriage tothe older aristocrat Grandcourt proves disastrous. Gwendolynemerges at the end of this 800 page three-decker as a moremature person eager to live and grow.Daniel Deronda is a young man raised as an English Protestantwho has a mysterious past. During the novel he learns of hisJewish blood; becomes a good friend of Mordecai the propheticvoice of the Jewish hope for a homeland in the Middle East.Daniel falls in love with Mordecai's singing sister Mirah.The novel is slow moving. Today it would have undergone editingto reduce its numerous pages. It is a work which is sympatheticto the beginnings of Zionism and has a postive view of the Jews.All of this in a nineteenth century society which was very Anti-Semitic.George Eliot is more interested in the human mind and its manylabyrinthal peregrinations from youth to maturity. She is a forerunner of writers like Henry James who explores what underlies the surface behavior of fictional characters.Eliot did not have the widescope of Dickens nor the practical relation of cold facts as did Trollope. She did have a massive intellect who told serious stories for thinking adults.She is one of my favorite writers who is well worth knowing."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Daniel Deronda was a great classic by George Eliot. It has a sense of wonder and life challenges. This book actually holds more than one story, but two maybe more.First is the story of Gwendolen Harleth, a woman you is all about her. She gets anything she wants but when her family is suddenly out of money, she has to choose whether to become a governess or marry a man with a lot of money. Being the spoiled girl that she is, she chooses to marry even though she loves another.This is where Daniel Deronda comes in. He is a gentleman in a society that he feels he doesn't belong to. He is blind sited by his life and is unsure of where he came from. One day Deronda comes across a woman trying to drown, named Mirah Lapidoth. He befriends her and helps her to find her long lost brother, then leading to him finding out more information of his true heritage and that he is a despised Jew. He accepts his heritage and is happy in knowing the truthGwendolen then suffers from her obscene marriage and is living an unhappy life while her husband, Mallinger Grandcourt who is happy in all of his glory and power over people including his wife. His story ends with a \\"tragic\\" death, while Gwendolen is suffering for the \\"loss\\" of her husband when Deronda comes to comfort her.Both of their stories end happily while they end up not together but apart.You get a history of life in the eighteen hundreds and the trials that are faced when you are not considered to be a gentleman because of their blood.A grand classic that is brilliantly written. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"There may seem to be a lack of painting and excess of moralizing in regards to the characters, but those are no faults: Eliot writes so well, and tells us what is inside people so well, that we care nothing for what they look like, how they dress, or whether the sky was clear that day or cloudy. We get to live under the same skin as the characters', and that's the most difficult thing to achieve in a book. And what if the improbable moral perfection of the Jewish characters contrasts against the more interesting, however vain, English ones? Well, of course it does, and that was the purpose. If we don't like it that way: if we prefer the Gentile characters, the unchristian Christians, against the Jewish Jews, we are only making a statement about ourselves.Eliot made her statement about the Jewish question in this novel. She made it beautifully. I think there's no doubt this is a great book -not as great as Middlemarch, of course, but a great novel.The author's undaunted intent on bringing the Jewish element to the foreground of the story may cause unsympathetic reactions from the readers, specially those prejudiced against the Jewish predicament and those easily charmed by the tempting naughtiness of Gwendolen: the Jewish element is there, nonetheless, and one must take in one with the other.If there is a political statement within this novel, a prophetic Zionism, which by and by proved true, one can only be amazed at how prescient this eloquent lady was. I am more than ever interested in knowing about George Eliot's life, and I have now finished reading \\"The Jewish Odyssey of George Eliot\\", which -though not a biography, I do recommend to George Eliot fans, since it throws more light on the character and the times of this courageous English woman who died in 1880."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"OHMYGOD- this book rocks! Quit work for a week and dive in- Every sentence will enrich your soul- She's THAT amazing."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"George Eliot was one of the greatest writers who have ever lived. Few come close to her---maybe George Meredith and Tolstoy, but certainly not Henry James, who was her inferior in every way.Daniel Deronda is as captivating as Middlemarch, and as satisfying except for one small difference. I'll speak around the point, so as not to include a spoiler.The final love scene, in which Daniel confesses his true feelings, was not nearly as suspenseful or as heart grabbing as the final scene in Middlemarch, which had tears flowing down the cheeks of this macho reviewer.Other than that tiny flaw, this is a great novelEnjoy!"},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Daniel Deronda centres around several characters. It relates to an intersection of Jewish and Gentile society in 19th century England. With references to Kaballah, Jewish identity and the return of the Jews to the Land of Israel. Gwendolen Harleth a spoiled but poised and spirited of a family of recently impoverished English gentry enters into a loveless marriage for money, with the cold Mr Grandcourt., but soon sickens of his emotional sadism. The novel centres around Gwendolen as much as it does around Daniel Deronda. It takes us through the lives of both major character's pasts ., before joining the two narratives into the present so to speak.Daniel Deronda is the adopted son of an English aristocrat, with who Gwendolyn falls in love. Deronda rescues the beautiful Jewish actress and singer Mirah Lapidoth from suicide by drowning, introducing us to another interesting and endearing character. He then becomes intimately involved with the society of English Jewry.Deronda later discovers his Jewish birth from his dying mother who was the daughter of a prominent Rabbi, who married her cousin. Deronda's story therefore as that of a Jew brought up as a Gentile aristocrat before discovering his identity and committing himself to the national welfare of his people is partly based on that of Moses.The book puts some focus, mainly through conversation on the yearning of the Jewish people to return to the Holy Land to rebuild the Jewish Commonwealth. Deronda and Mirah later leaveEngland to help rebuild the Jewish presence in the Land of Israel. This component of the novel has lead some prejudiced bigots, such as the loathsome Edward Said to condemn this 1976 classic as \`Zionist propaganda'-an Orwellian charge indeed.People like Said cannot abide the anything that relates to the right of the Jews to live in and return to their ancient homeland.At the time of this novel's writing progressives saw the revival of nations and national self-determination as a positive thing. It was only nearly a century later that the nihilistic New Left in a sick and bizarre twist began to label the return of the Jews to their ancient homeland as an act of \`colonialism'."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Imagine a crowd of men and women of various age, stature, and alibi assemble in a place where you the spectator are going to infer an observation as to their true sentiment. This task is difficult in a train packed with commuters, but easy in a casino where gamblers share one and only desire; to extract gain from someone's loss. This is where the two main characters of George Eliot's final novel \\"Daniel Deronda\\" first catch a glimpse of each other.Gwendolen Harleth, young and vivacious, full of beauty but low on luck in a game of roulette resorts to gambling in order to help her destitute mother. With the last whirl of the disk comes the hope of big win amongst the sybarites vying for bestowal from the mindless wheel. The sight of the ill-fated creature bewitches Daniel. For is it not true that attraction is at its superb when mixed with sympathy?In this classic, George Eliot creates an exemplar in the character of Daniel Deronda, a fine English man with chiseled look. His magnanimity is put to the test with the introduction of Mirah Lapidoth, a poor Jewish woman whose striking beauty emanates from the person who wishes to see it. Her magnificent feature is like the underwater world visible only to the diver.Oh, if only our heart came in two like most parts of our body; so that we continue to live if we lose one. While our brain chooses as many objects to fill its contentment, our heart chooses singularly when it comes to truest love. Moreover, why is it when we lose this true love our head which houses our big brain does not hurt yet our heart feels inexplicable pain, what a power this organ as small as our fist has on our being.Like Daniel, we face ultimate decision, which puts our susceptibility in check. Nevertheless, most of us are not as steadfast as he is. We continue to err because our values change with whoever we are with now akin to chameleon in search of prey and acceptance."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"This is the first I have read of Eliot's work. The story centers around a woman named Gwendolen Harleth whose family has lost their fortunes, a young jewish singer named Mirah who is on the run from her father, and Daniel Deronda, who rescues the young jewess from drowning herself. The plot draws the three together as if they are bound by fate, while Eliot continues to add side characters and subplots to spice up the book.The storyline was enough to keep my interest, but there were overlying thematic issues that caused my attention to waver. I found several passages in the book weighty and overdone, and there was many times that I found I had read pages of description without having any of it sinking in, nor caring by the time I had realized. I did, however, find the overall plot centering around the three main characters of enough depth and feeling to keep me focused on them, and I liked Eliot's story telling ability enough to make me want to read more of her. Perhaps this is not the best book to read when beginning with George Eliot. I give it 3 and a half stars."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"In her final novel George Elliot courageously tells the story of a young man , Daniel Deronda who raised in an assimilated family goes on to discover his Jewishness, and make it the center of his life. Eliot is a master portrayer and analyer of the moods of human character. As he is befriended by the hero Gwendollyn who is suffering in her unhappy marriage, he develops in exploring his Jewishness, and eventually comes to 'marry the girl ,'Mirah\\"and go on to make a life for himself."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"There is little I can add to the reviews below, all of which are right on the money. What I CAN do is provide those new to George Eliot with some helpful hints. First, especially for Daniel Deronda, DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION IN ADVANCE! This advice is actually given by the intro author, and your reading experience will be greatly diminished if you do! Second, be prepared to sit down, relax, and READ. There's no skimming Daniel Deronda: the novel is full to the brim with historical, spiritual, and psychological depth, all of which demand close attention, and at times can be daunting. (All that, and a love story, to boot!) Stick with it, and you will be richly rewarded with one of the best reads of your life."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Am I the only person who really really really wished that this book had been about Catherine Arrowpoint?Don't get me wrong, I loved Daniel Deronda, but I struggled for a long time with the fact that I did not actually like either of the two main characters. Gwendolen is insufferable, although I take the point that Eliot was making about the options open to high-spirited women. Daniel was worse-- as mealy-mouthed and moralizing as Gwendolen thought him to be in the casino at the beginning. And don't let me get started on the mincing wincing Mirah.This isn't a very forgiving novel. There is not very much room for redemption.I guess that is why I had hoped that it could be about Catherine Arrowpoint-- she seemingly the only character in the position to make healthy choices.Miss Arrowpoint invents herself, Daniel discovers himself. Gwendolen, well, it's hard to talk about Gwendolen without giving away too much of the plot.Difficult for me to imagine that some see the book as two separable halves and prefer the Gwendolen part. There's a thread of linked themes running through the novel. It all fits together, as a single whole.A phenomenal book, really. Read it if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"George Eliot's final novel is both riveting and problematic. Many critics have called it &quot;two books in one&quot; -- some have even said that the two strands of the book should have been *separated*. One plotline follows Gwendolen Harleth, a spoiled and beautiful girl fallen on hard financial times, and what happens when she marries a soulless aristocrat...the other plotline concerns the title character, Daniel, who is drawn into the revelation of his true Jewish ancestry. George Eliot is a Novelist of the Mind...she dissects the motivations and psyches of her characters, setting them against the society they inhabit and examining interaction both with that society and with the other people it encompasses. This is a stirring novel, with sharply-etched characterizations : not a melodrama or a potboiler, yet still with the drive of a thriller."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"This is a classic novel by Mary Anne (Marian) Evans. Soon after writing the excellent article, \\"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists,\\" Evans decided to write some novels herself. It seems to me that while she admired the works of great lady novelists such as Jane Austen, her style was in part a reaction not only to superb works but to awful ones. She adopted the pen name \\"George Eliot\\" for her first novel. Although her actual identity was made clear to everyone fairly quickly, she kept that pen name for her remaining novels, including this one.This fine work gives us an interesting look at English society of the 1860s (the book appeared in 1876). And it includes an intriguing look at Zionism. While Theodor Herzl said he did not read her book, one key Zionist did, and he drew a real-life inspiration from it. That real-life person was Eliezer Ben-Yehuda (born in 1858), who was the individual most responsible for the revival of Hebrew as a language of everyday speech. Evans thus made a significant contribution to Zionism with this book.Evans basically applauds a Jewish character in her book who argues for Zionism, saying that \\"there is store of wisdom among us to found a new Jewish polity, grand and simple, like the old - a republic where there is equality of protection.\\" And the character continues by saying:\\"Then our race shall have an organic centre, a heart and brain to watch and guide and execute; the outraged Jew shall have a defence in the court of nations, as the outraged Englishman or American. And the world will gain as Israel gains.\\"I think it is a clever plot element when Evans winds up having Deronda take up this challenge of trying to implement Zionism.Daniel Deronda, who is raised by a Christian baronet and becomes an Etonian and Cantabrigian, is not sure that he is Jewish until he then gets to meet his actual mother (having last seen her at the age of two). That raises a couple of questions. Given that Daniel has no problems with his Jewish wedding, I think Marian Evans intends us to assume that Daniel was indeed circumcised soon after his birth, was not baptised (either as a Christian or a Jew), and that he eventually confirmed what his Hebrew name was (probably Daniyye'l, after his grandfather).Daniel's classmates (and Daniel himself) would thus suspect that he might be Jewish. However, the issue might at least be in doubt, especially with Daniel participating in Christian activities at Eton.Given that Daniel's Jewishness is a surprise to some of his acquaintances, I think it is also safe to assume that the author wants us to picture Deronda as not having what might be thought of as obviously Jewish facial features.Henry James wrote a very amusing review of this book back when it first came out. In his review, three characters comment on the book, one of them liking it very much, another liking some parts better than others, and the last, \\"Pulcheria,\\" declaring herself to be a Judeophobe and disliking the whole thing.More recently, Ed Said, while not quite as silly as Pulcheria, still missed the opportunity to comment intelligently on the book because he was so averse to the idea of abiding human rights for Levantine Jews that he simply could not avoid substituting anti-Zionist propaganda for a serious discussion of the book. I mind the silliness of his comments even more than I do the ill will. To see what I mean, here are the first two lines of the book:\\"Men can do nothing without the make-believe of a beginning. Even Science, the strict measurer, is obliged to start with a make-believe unit, and must fix on a point in the stars' unceasing journey when his sidereal clock shall pretend that time is at Nought.\\"Try to picture a silly astronomer writing about these two lines as if they were representing a critique of Big Bang cosmology.At one point, Deronda gets some easy but excellent advice from the baronet who has raised him: \\"my dear boy - it is good to be unselfish and generous; but don't carry that too far. It will not do to give yourself to be melted down for the benefit of the tallow trade; you must know where to find yourself.\\" Later, Deronda gives very similar easy but excellent advice to Gwendolen, telling her to accept some money that is rightfully hers and show her generosity only in the way she uses the money.I think this is not merely good advice for us all, but especially good advice for Zionists: some of us are a little too inclined to refuse for ourselves what we might gladly award to anyone else.The second paragraph of the novel begins with a question about Gwendolen: \\"Was she beautiful or not beautiful? and what was the secret of form or expression which gave the dynamic quality to her glance?\\"Obviously, she was beautiful.Was this novel excellent or not excellent? Oh, it was excellent in both form and expression, with a dynamic aspect no less, and, for what it is worth, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"\\"Daniel Deronda\\" was the last novel George Eliot wrote, and it's an appropriate finale to her career -- a lushly-written, heartfelt story about a young man searching for his past (and clues to his future), as well as a vibrant strong-willed young lady who discovers that life doesn't always go your way. Even better, Eliot deftly avoided the cliches and caricatures of the Jewish people, portraying them with love and respect.Daniel Deronda is the ward (and rumored illegitimate son) of a nobleman, who is unsure of his past (particularly of his mother) catching a glimpse of pretty, reckless, arrogant Gwendolyn Harleth at a casino. Gwendolyn (who boasts that she gets everything she wants) is interested in Daniel, but when her family loses all their money, she marries a rich suitor, a relative of Daniel's -- knowing that his mistress and illegitimate children will be disinherited. But she soon finds that her new husband is a sadistic brute, and sees Daniel as her only help.Meanwhile, Daniel rescues the despairing Mirah Lapidoth from a suicide attempt in the river, and he helps the young Jewish singer find a home and friends to care for her. As he helps her find her family, he becomes passionately attached to the Jewish population and their plight, embodied by a dying young visionary and a kindly shopkeeping family. Then he receives an important message -- one that will illuminate his roots, and give him a course for the future.When Eliot published her final novel, it caused a massive stir -- not many novelists tackled the plight of the Jewish population, or how it compared to the gilded upper classes. In a way, \\"Daniel Deronda\\" is both a love triangle and an allegory -- Daniel must choose between the pretty, shallow English life (Gwendolyn) or a rich Jewish heritage (Mirah) with a background of tragedy.The biggest problem with Eliot's writing is that it becomes a little too lush and dense at times, and the narrative moves a bit slowly (in the Victorian manner). But that flaw doesn't rob her writing of its power or beauty -- she describes every feeling, gesture and emotion in detail, as well as the sumptuous balls, exquisitely gilded mansions, and every shadowy tree or rich expanse of land (\\"a grassy court enclosed on three sides by a gothic cloister\\").Yet the greatest power is in the stories that twine like ivy over the main plot -- a young Jewish girl's search for her family, a sadistic man's search for a wild lovely girl he can break, and especially of the composer Herr Klesmer and his sweet, atypical love story with Miss Arrowpoint. And the last quarter of the book is wrapped in Daniel's search for his own family, culminating in a quietly tense encounter with someone from his long-ago past.Daniel almost seems like a character too good to be true -- unselfish, kind, universally kindly and very intelligent, though possessed of a vaguely searching quality. Gwendolyn is his complete opposite: she has been raised to be selfish, disdainful and immature, but as the book goes on she learns that selfishness doesn't pay -- marriage to the despicable Grandcourt changes her from a selfish little girl into a scarred but stronger woman.The third leg of the triangle is Mirah, who is not given the loving attention that Gwendolyn is, but who is still a compelling figure -- her father tried to sell her, and now she wanders through England searching for her family. And the book is littered with many other striking characters: the sadistic Grandcourt and his creepy servant Lush, the crotchety but kindly Klesmer, the spirited artist Hans, the kindly Sir Hugo and the doomed, strong-willed Mordecai.\\"Daniel Deronda\\" is a beautiful portrait of a young man's search for his past, and a young woman's struggle with the fruits of her own selfishness. What's more, George Eliot's last novel is a loving, powerful portrait of the Jewish people, in a time when they were caricatured at best."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"This novel is well-written and explores many issues of 19th century Victorian England.Both hero and heroine are magnificent. Each individual and each unique in its own way. Gwendolen with her vanity and selfishness is both endearing as a spoilt child and comic, when you think how seriously she takes her own worth until the end of the novel when all her realizations begin.Daniel Deronda is beautiful as the sensitive, kind, compassionate young man who gives so much of himself to others, and in the end has to make final decission for his own life.The only dissappointment is the ending in which he choses to marry Mirah. Mirah is both dull and uninteresting.

Years ago, F. R. Leavis made the comment that the parts of this novel concerning Gwendolen Harleth are much better than the parts concerning Daniel and his search for his identity--Leavis has been much taken to task for this comment, but the truth is, he's right--Eliot was so intent on ennobling her Jewish characters that Daniel, Mordecai, and Mirah are a pretty spotless and thus forgettable bunch."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"George Eliot's last novel is nothing less than extraordinary. The most obvious thing is that most of it is a thumpingly good read, especially the first third - witty,lively and devoid of Eliot's sometimes irritating commentaries (Eliot has an amazing mind, and her comments can both fascinate and slow the speed of the narrative). We seem to be in a decaying world of Jane Austen, with a descendant of her Emma Wodehouse - silly, headstrong, egotistical yet alluring Gwendolen Harleth.The tension heightens when Gwendolen finally marries Grandcourt, and both she and the reader realise she has made the most ghastly mistake. Brilliantly, Eliot portrays in disturbing detail the psychological twists and turns of the relationship, as the 'powerful' Gwendolen finds herself trapped by a silent sado-masochist. Grandcourt is actually shown to do very little out of place - which is the achievement - and we are left to imagine what Gwendolen must be going through in the bedroom. We become enmeshed in her consciousness - not always a pleasant experience. It is a brave novel for its time.The rest of the novel concerns the eponymous Daniel, his discovery of his identity as a Jew, and his final mission to devote himself to his race. It is thought-provoking, and interesting, and much has been said about how the way the novel is really two stories. The problem really is that the Gwendolen part is so well done that a reader feels disappointed to leave her and join the less enthralling Daniel.The ending doesn't quite thrill as other moments of the book do, and there is an over-long section relating the conversation of a philosophy society, but, thanks to Gwendolen and Grandcourt, it stands out as one of the most memorable pieces of literature in English. Take away the 'Daniel' part and it is Eliot's masterpiece - and great material for the cinema. Maybe it's because she played the aforementioned Emma, but Gwyneth Paltrow could do a fantastic job as Gwendolen - just imagine her playing the great scene where the melodramatic diamonds arrive on her wedding night, and she goes beserk and throws them around!"},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Her last work, it is fascinating, puzzling, and the most personal of all her novels. It traces the journeys of 4 young almost parent-less young characters on the verge of adulthood in a society that has ill prepared them for life: Gwendolyn Harleth(one of the most complicated, spirited and entrancing characters in literature); Daniel D(not sure of most anything); Mirah, (resilient and deep); and Susan Arrowpoint(kind, perceptive and oh so privileged). At times funny but always critical of Victorian parenting, values, and insularity, the novel traces each as they find their way (as the authoress did) through a painful, unforgettable, and original array of situations and characters. This one will stick with you long after you have finished it. A novel of how we are born(e) into adulthood. Read the first paragrph and see if you are not intrigued, despite the sometimes leaden prose. The story and the dialogue carry this to its exultant but wounded end. Do not skip by it. It is what story-telling and fiction are meant to be."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"I'm only halfway through Daniel Deronda, but so far it's been a very compelling read. Shares a great deal with Silas Marner (a far more provocative tale than most people realize) in examining the often ludicrous extent of human folly, exhibited no less in the eponymous hero and the ostensible heroine as much as any other character.UPDATE: Having now finished the novel, I can maintain that it is, from start to finish, compelling. I do, however, find myself in the position of not being quite satisfied with its resolution. Narratively there's no fault with it, but the main characters seemed to be shoved a bit too purposefully into the positions in which we leave them. Deronda especially becomes less of a character in his own right and more of an authorial statement, casting his lot with other characters that don't quite have the full breath of life that she granted to her tragic heroine Gwendolen Harleth."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"This is the first of Eliot's novels that I read. For being a Victorian women, I must say that it's also one of her most thematically adventurous novels as well. She addresses so much within the pages of this novel that it's amazing that one can still be interested in the plot. For a 500-page novel, it's thick with symbolism and social themes such as womens' rights (or lack thereof in society), Judaism, the difference in social classes, etc... Although the two contrasting stories of Daniel and Gwendolen seem somewhat strangely juxtaposed, they are actually complimentary and intertwining at points in this coming-of-age novel.Eliot's writing is typical Victorian: winded and the usage of the appendix in the back becomes tiresome, but it also shows intellect behind the pseudonym that one is forced to appreciate. It's hard to find a lovable character in this story because of the purposeful idealism and poorly sketched minor characters, but the portrait she draws of Gwendolen and Daniel's mother (who seemingly parallels Mrs. Havisham in Great Expectations, I think) are memorable."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Great book, of course, but for this edition Oxford used a computer to justify the type.

Like its predecessor &quot;Middlemarch,&quot; it is a long novel of perfectly structured complexity and impressive intellectual exposition, built upon a cast of characters so sharply and meticulously defined that the plot is propelled solely by the power of their presence. This is the novel that Henry James wanted to write, and even he could never match Eliot's passion and linguistic effortlessness.The forward story in &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; is that of Gwendolen Harleth, a coquettish, conceited, superficial girl -- in company she often affects a sophistication that is never quite convincing -- who could be called the heroine even though she lacks most heroic attributes. She is from an upper class family, but when misfortune strikes and she is faced with poverty, she consents to marry a man named Mallinger Grandcourt, heir to a large estate, rather than reduce herself to taking a job as a governess, and despite having received a warning from a mysterious lady about Grandcourt's having fathered illegitimate children.The secondary story is that of Daniel Deronda, the title character, a young man who first sees Gwendolen in a casino in Leubronn at the beginning of the novel. Daniel, who happens to be the ward of Mallinger Grandcourt's uncle, Sir Hugo Mallinger, is inquisitive about his obscure parentage and unsure of his place in the world. One portentous day, he rescues a girl from drowning herself -- this is Mirah Lapidoth, a Jewish girl who has run away from her father in Prague and come to London to look for her long-lost mother and brother. Daniel decides to help her by playing detective, which eventually leads him to befriend a family of Jewish shopkeepers named Cohen, whom he supposes to be related to Mirah, and a deeply religious man named Mordecai.Eliot intertwines this Judaic element with that of Gwendolen's unhappy marriage, as Daniel maintains a steady companionship with her while he spends time immersing himself in Jewish culture, learning about a past he never knew he had. The event by which Gwendolen's situation resolves itself is foreshadowed by a particularly eerie symbol: In her family's house, there is a painting she dreads, apparently conceived by a morbid ancestor, depicting a figure running away in fright from an upturned dead face. As a plot device it may seem unrealistically gothic, but Eliot's treatment of her material is too somber and mature ever to succumb to the absurd.This novel, while not as consistently great as &quot;Middlemarch,&quot; confirms my opinion that Eliot is the most accomplished, intelligent, and original of the Victorian novelists, boldly ahead of her time. She is undeniably one of the greatest psychological portraitists in literature; better than most other authors, she understands the way people think and why they do what they do, which is probably why her sense of tragedy feels authentic rather than merely sentimental. Whether &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot; is read to get a unique insight on Jewish life in London in the nineteenth century or just to bask in the opulence of Eliot's prose, the effort will be richly rewarded."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Daniel Deronda is a brave piece of literature. It attempts to chronicle the budding Zionist movement and anti-semitic attitudes of Victorian society, and combine it with a more traditional George Eliot soul-searching story of a young woman (a gentile who has a complex relationship with Daniel Deronda, the young Englishman who discovers he is a Jew). While many people have quibbled about various details of the story, with some justification, the overall impact is one of awe. It's amazing how an accomplished writer defies popular criticism and explores a subject matter which was, at the time, politically incorrect.Strictly speaking, Daniel Deronda isn't quite the same level of immaculate fiction as Middlemarch. So I think George Eliot fans will be somewhat disappointed. But on the positive side, the book is much more accessible (ie, easier to read). And the subject matter makes it required reading for everyone interested in modern Judaism/Zionism. It's fascinating to compare how Jews were perceived during the mid-1800s relative to today (..in western Europe).Finally, the Penguin Classic edition of Daniel Deronda has both great Notes and Introductory sections (which, oddly, is supposed to be read AFTER reading the book)."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"This novel, originally published in 1876, was Eliot's last. It has remained controversial ever since, and some critics delete it from her first-rank work. It is an ideological novel, and its plot is forced at times (too many coincidences, for one thing). The central character appears to be Gwendolen Harleth at the start (note the echo of her last name with &quot;harlot&quot;), who pawns a necklace at a gaming table only to have it returned by a disapproving observer--the eponymous Deronda. While offended, Gwendolen is also fascinated by Daniel and finally takes him on as her conscience as the novel continues, at great length, weaving a multitude of characters and issues into a fabric with an echo-chamber effect (in the sense that various elements of the book echo each other in odd and unpredictable ways throughout the novel, such as the continuing ways that people gamble with their own fates and the lives of others). This is a novel of sensibility, a link between Austen's method and Woolf's. But it is also a romantic treatment of Zionism (well before it was a popular issue, especially in Victorian England), with all the Jewish leads ennobled and idealized. In this sense it reads differently than MIDDLEMARCH, which was strictly realistic except at the very end. It's closer to SILAS MARNER, a morality tale with symbolic characters. Gwendolen is one of the saddest and most beautiful figures in any novel. She wants so deeply to be the center of attention, and finally can't even be the title character of the novel she's in. There are so many marvellous moments in this book, it repays the time it takes to read it many times over. I do not think Eliot arrived at a satisfying structure for the book, though; her need to promote Zionism prevented it. The Oxford paperback edition is the one I read, and I can recommend it highly -- its notes are superb. But the print is very small, so if that bothers you use another edition."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"I read this book as part of a graduate class on the \\"study of the novel\\" and was absolutely blown away by it. This was my first attempt at George Eliot and though I had been wanting to read her for some time, the sheer girth of most of her works prevented me from adding them to my \\"leisure reading\\" list.The character of Gwendolen Harleth is strong and commanding, Henleigh Grandcourt is perhaps one of the best villains ever written into literature, and Daniel Deronda is unequivocally the most inherently flawless character ever created who does not bore the reader with his goodness.This is a big book to be sure, but it reads fast and there is much said about the appearances and prejudices of Victorian society. There are many recurring themes and parallels to be on the lookout for. This is an intensely \\"smart\\" read, and for that reason it is one of my favorite Victorian novels ever---next to Dickens' \\"Dombey and Son\\" and \\"David Copperfield,\\" that is.I look forward to reading more of Eliot's work in the future. She was a brilliant writer and observer."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"I read Middlemarch years ago and absolutely loved it. The discipline of quieting & focusing my mind in order to follow Eliot's elaborate writing was more than repaid by the brilliance, beauty and insight of her writing.But I found Daniel Deronda terribly disappointing. The writing seemed self-indulgent (it seemed that she included every thought that came into her head!), the structure unbalanced, and the pacing tedious. Is it really a great book, or simply a book by a great author - who could have used a more insistent editor?"},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Daniel Deronda is about the way English society in the 1860's viewed the Jewish world as something venal, distorting of Christian truths, and superstitious, and therfore not worthy of mature consideration. Eliot's novel is about the richness of the Judaic heritage that could have reformed so much of what was and is wanting in the Christian dispensation, wanting before, and even more so after, the Reformation. The Holocaust is a case in point.Through the characters of the gentile Gwendolyn Harleth and the Jew, Daniel Deronda, Eliot etches a strong contrast between a woman merely surviving in a culture that is morally and spiritually dead, and a man who has been brought up rich, English, and gentile without purpose or inner peace, but who eventually finds his Jewish roots and a reason for being in the world through the teachers of Jewish Wisdom literature and Jewish mysticism, who have not forgotten the need for discourse about human nature and the God who created it. The sad, empty world of Gwendolyn is expertly detailed by Eliot at every turn, and the aftermath of Gwendolyn's final meeting with Deronda is one of the great tragic conclusions in all of English fiction, as she must return to a cruel world with duty as her guide and a memory of Deronda as her hope; and he, to Isreal, with Mirah, without love, but with the ideal of fellow-feeling for the whole enterprise of Zionism. The Jews, like the Greeks, understand that the nature of life at its core is suffering and denial. The Christain English world wants the shallowness of romance and the discourse of power through colonialism and genocide. Eliot sharply critiques Christian/English preoccupations about power, and Christian preconceptions about Judaism, most especially here in this novel, and gives us many questions to ponder. A great book, and one Henry James copied forever in so many subtle and not so subtle ways. He never seemed to have grasped the essence of Daniel Deronda."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"\\"Daniel Deronda\\" is George Eliot's last and, perhaps, most ambitious novel. It has great literary merit, but I do not think it is her best work. The novel contrasts the lax moral attitudes of the British aristocracy with the focused dedication of the Jewish Zionists. Given the typical anti-Semitic sentiments in Victorian England, and the little known world of the Jews and the Zionist Movement, Ms. Eliot's made a brave and idealistic effort by writing this book.Ms. Elliot describes the lives of British Jews, a society-within-a-society, of which most of her contemporaries were oblivious, through her hero Daniel Deronda. Through her heroine, Gwendolyn Harleth, who marries for money and power rather than love, Eliot explores a side of human relations that leads only to despair.Daniel sees Gwendolyn, for the first time, at a roulette table. He is fascinated by her classical, blonde English beauty, and vivacious, self-assured manner. When Ms. Harleth is forced to sell her necklace to pay gambling debts, Deronda, a disapproving observer, buys back the jewelry, anonymously, and returns it to her. This is not the last time the deeply spiritual and altruistic Deronda will feel a need to rescue Gwendolyn.Daniel was adopted by an English gentleman at an early age. He has received affection, a good education, and to some extent, position, from his guardian. However, Deronda has never been told the story of his true parentage, and sorely feels this lack of roots and his own identity. Not content to play the gentleman, he always appears to be searching for a purpose in life.Daniel's and Gwendolyn's lives intersect throughout the novel. They feel a strong mutual attraction initially, but Gwendolyn, with incredible passivity, decides to marry someone she knows is a scoundrel, for his wealth. The decision will haunt her as her life becomes a nightmare with the sadistic Mr. Harcourt, her husband.At about the same time, Daniel inadvertently saves a young woman from suicide. He finds young Mirah Lapidoth, near drowning, by the river and takes her to a friend's home to recover. There she is made welcome and asked to stay. She is a Jewess, abducted from her mother years before, by her father, who wanted to use the child's talent as a singer to earn money. When young Mirah forced her voice beyond its limits, and lost her ability to sing, her father abandoned her. She has never been able to reunite with her mother and brother, and was alone and destitute, until Daniel found her. Daniel, in his search for Mirah's family, meets the Cohens, a Jewish shop owner and his kin. Deronda feels an immediate affinity with them and visits often. He also comes to know a Jewish philosopher and Zionist, Mordecai, and they forge a strong bond of friendship.Daniel finally does discover his identity, and has a very poignant and strange meeting with his mother. He had been actively taking steps to make a meaningful existence for himself, and with the new information about his parents and heritage, he leaves England with a wife, for a new homeland and future.One of the novel's most moving scenes is when Daniel and Gwendolyn meet for the last time. Gwendolyn has grown from a self-centered young woman to a mature, thoughtful adult, who has suffered and grown strong.The author is one of my favorites and her writing is exceptional. This particular novel, however, became occasionally tedious with Ms. Eliot's monologues, and the book's length. Her characters are fascinating, original as always, and well drawn. The contrast between the lives of the British aristocracy, the emerging middle class, and the Jewish community gives the reader an extraordinary glimpse into three totally different worlds in Victorian England. A fine book and a wonderful reading experience."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"George Eliot is my favorite author and this is my favorite of her books. It was her most controversial since to the arrogant 19th century English mind the jews were not a &quot;worthy&quot; subject for literature. A debate has raged since its publication as to whether the Gwendolyn or the Daniel parts of the story are the better. As the introduction to the Penguin edition points out, to the English, the Gwendolyn parts of the story were the important literature and that Daniel sections were forgettable. While to the Jewish readers, the Daniel thread was realistic and meaningful; the Gwendolyn thread was superfluous. In fact, at the turn of the century an edition was published in Hebrew without the Gwendolyn sections, which were seen as irrelevant to the story. To me the two intertwining threads are both strong, poignant and critical to the story. As always Eliot's characterizations are complex and three dimensional; her insights into life, psychology, and philosophy profound. There is no better writer in the English language."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"Daniel Deronda is a moving account of the parallel yet different personal sagas experienced by two extraordinary characters: Daniel Deronda (the perfect &quot;sensitive&quot; man, way before his time) and the superb and brilliantly realized Gwendolyn Harleth. They are both insiders - one a well-bred but recently impoverished beautiful girl, the other a dazzlingly handsome and intelligent man whose birth is shrouded in mystery. As with numerous George Eliot novels, the hero and heroine would seem destined to marry, but don't. Yet they both achieve something greater: a realization of the inner state of unconditional love that Eliot considered the highest ideal of humanity."},{"Title":"Daniel Deronda (Novels of George Eliot)","review":"While Middlemarch is a thoroughly Victorian novel, Daniel Deronda looks forward to the modern period in its focus on the individual. The text primarily focuses on two individuals--Daniel Deronda and Gwendolyn Harleth. Their lives are entertwined from the first chapter in which Daniel observes, with a certain amount of disdain, a serpentine Gwendolyn gambling. By the end of the text, both characters have been transformed from the characters you meet at the beginning through self-discovery. Daniel discovers the secret of his birth while Gwendolyn is tragically disillusioned by her unfortunate marriage. The novel foreshadows the modern period's treatment of the individual searching for his identity and his place in an intolerant society."},{"Title":"Lucy Maud Montgomery: A Writer&#8217;s Life (Snapshots: Images of People and Places in History)","review":"This is the perfect book for any true fan of Anne of Green Gables, Emily of New Moon or Pat of Silverbush. It is a 32 page book in the picture book format that is loaded with photos, articles, news clippings, history and little known facts about the life of the Canadian author, L.M. Montgomery, who created all of these wonderful characters and many more in her books and stories about life in Prince Edward Island. Unlike several of the longer biographies that have been written about Montgomery, this one can be read in an afternoon and combines plenty of visual fare along with the written details of this amazing woman's life. This is a book that adults who have loved Anne will find satisfyingly interesting as well as one that is suitably concise and brief. Older children will enjoy the breezy conversational style in which it is written. Photographs abound, including ones of Montgomery's various homes, her children and her husband, as well as youthful friends and \\"beaus\\" and even her favorite cat, Lucky. It traces her life from her earliest days, through growing up, her time as a teacher, a newspaper woman, a professional writer, as the author of Anne of Green Gables and the myriad other titles that followed, and as a wife and mother. Excerpts from her journals provide special insight into her heart and mind and I found these to be the most thrilling parts of all. A chronology of all her books is included as well as several websites that concern L.M. Montgomery and her books. Wonderful little tidbits are numerous and include the personal details about writing Anne of Green Gables, the starts and stops, the interruptions, the rejection slips and tears. We learn that Montgomery's secondhand typewriter didn't type capital letters very well and didn't type \\"w\\" at all! I really enjoyed this book and I believe any fan of this gifted author's work will delight in it, too. It is especially encouraging and cheering to young writers."},{"Title":"Lucy Maud Montgomery: A Writer&#8217;s Life (Snapshots: Images of People and Places in History)","review":"After watching Road to Avonlea and Anne of Green Gables, we wanted to read about the author and found this book to be very interesting. It is a great introduction, but at the same time covers all the aspects of her life, with many photos, copies of her signatures and writing, little antidotes, and snippets of very interesting information. One can draw from these some of the people that are included in her writing. There is so much on each page and even though it is not a large book, it gives so much information of all kinds, that it is truly a lovely book, one that a Avonlea fan would not want to be without. I am so glad that I came across this little but powerful gem!!"},{"Title":"Lucy Maud Montgomery: A Writer&#8217;s Life (Snapshots: Images of People and Places in History)","review":"After visiting Prince Edward Island and FINALLY (at my ripe old age) getting around to reading the series of books about Anne of Green Gables, I was very interested in Ms. Montgomery. This item however was disappointing - seemed to be written for elementary students."},{"Title":"Lucy Maud Montgomery: A Writer&#8217;s Life (Snapshots: Images of People and Places in History)","review":"My six-year-old daughter knows Anne Shirley very well. Having watched the made for television Anne of Green Gables series several times, and meeting Anne within the pages of the original Anne of Green Gables, my eldest has developed quite a love for the red-headed orphan girl who has captured the hearts of so many readers worldwide.Anne's creatrix Lucy Maud Montgomery is a figure who my daughter is much less familiar with. Settling in to read Lucy Maud Montgomery -- a Kids Can Read Level 3 reader (designed for children just starting to read alone) from the Inspiring Lives series -- I kept Maud's identity a secret. Drawn in by the beautiful illustrations, and simple but flowing narrative, my daughter beamed with delight when she discovered that Montgomery wrote the Anne series.Following Lucy Maud Montgomery's life from birth to adulthood, Elizabeth MacLeod's introduction to the author focuses tightly upon her journey to successful publication and the emotional forces in her life that led her to writing.While written as part of a leveled reading series, this charming title should in no way be relegated to a space between the often-inane readers for young children. Instead it offers an excellent read-aloud for sharing with early elementary students before or after an introduction to Montgomery's work, inspiration for young girls with a literary bent, and a lovely visual experience.For independent reading, children will need to be able to tackle some advanced vocabulary and longer sentences while not having repetitive words and visual clues to guide their way.Without becoming bogged down in facts and detail, Macleod's simple juvenile biography of one of Canada's most beloved authors has enchanted our family. Macleod's strong emphasis on Montgomery's emotions concerning her solitude and desire to be published provide a very personal glimpse into the author's life.Arranged in typical reader style - text and illustration clearly separated - artist John Mantha's oil paintings clearly place Montgomery in mood and time. Softly pastoral nature scenes, period appropriate attire and hairstyles, and a lightly muted palette combine to evoke a distinctly historic air. It's truly a delight to find a reader filled with such lovely artistic compositionsIf Lucy Maud Montgomery is a representative example of the quality to be found in the Inspiring Lives sub-series of Kids Can Read titles, I strongly recommend parents, educators, and librarians to consider adding these titles to their libraries. This series installment has certainly found a permanent home in our collection. The historic significance, wonderful art, personal narrative biography, and of course the opportunity to practice newly formed reading skills mark the series as one to watch for."},{"Title":"Unseen Danger: A Tragedy of People, Government, and the Centralia Mine Fire","review":"I first found out about the underground coal mine fire at Centralia PA and the devastation of the town above it while surfing the Web, looking for information about urban ruins. The photos I saw on various websites were eerie: where a small town once stood there was now only streets and sidewalks. A sliver of a dwelling that had once been part of a string of row houses stood alone, propped up on either side by brick chimney-like buttresses that provided the support that other dwellings, now torn down, once gave. Steam rose from cracks in a twisted and abandoned highway or from patches of scorched earth surrounded by dead vegetation. While these photos were very creepy and intriguing, I didn't stop to read much about the story of Centralia; I was on a quest to find out more about abandoned sites closer to my home in New York State's Hudson Valley region that I have seen for myself and visited: the Lente house, Bannerman's Island Arsenal, and the Cornish Estate.Years later but a few weeks ago I happened across the last five minutes of a segment on C-SPAN's Book TV that caught my attention. Joan Quigley, author of \\"The Day the Earth Caved In\\" was talking about the Centralia mine fire. From the little bit I saw of the show it was clear that there was much more to the Centralia story than what I gathered from the photos on the Web. I eagerly wrote down the name of the book and its author so that the next time I visited Amazon I could order it. After adding the book to my shopping cart, Amazon suggested that I also might want to check out David DeKok's \\"Unseen Danger\\", an earlier volume on the same subject. I ordered both.As chance would have it, \\"Unseen Danger\\" arrived about a week before \\"The Day the Earth Caved In\\" and now, having read both books, I'm glad it did. I have a busy life and don't have a lot of time to read but I found Mr. DeKok's telling of the story so compelling that I neglected a lot of my duties around the house to make time for it. I took it to work and read it on my lunch and dinner breaks. I stayed up into the early morning hours, far longer than I should have, to finish it in a couple of days instead of the weeks it usually takes me to read a book.As the blurb quoted on the cover from the New York Times Book Review states, there are \\"enough bureaucratic villains [in this story] to fill a Dickens novel.\\" I would add that there were some Centralian citizens (especially one infuriatingly obnoxious homeowner in particular who I kept hoping would disappear into a subsidence) and the local Catholic church (who should have also suffered the same fate) who deserved to be included in that category as well. This is a story of missed opportunities, inter-governmental squabbles, denial of the present realities and local feuds all working together to turn the lives of the residents of this beleaguered town into a living hell. Mr. DeKok does a fine job of telling the story and it is obvious that he put a tremendous amount of effort into researching it and a lot of detective work into trying to separate fact from fiction, especially when it comes to the matter of how the mine fire got started in the first place. He paints a clear and terrifying picture of what the residents who were most effected by the danger had to go through before they got some relief, and the unconscionable indifference that government officials showed to the plight of their constituents in order to protect their own political behinds. The cast of characters in \\"Unseen Danger\\" is large and varied and includes the above mentioned villains and a few heroes too. The attention to detail is astounding and makes for extremely compelling reading.However, in my opinion, the book is not without its flaws. While the above mentioned attention to detail is most welcome, at times it can be confusing, especially when trying to picture the relative locations of the events. Three small maps are included in the paperback edition that I read; one showing where Centralia is located in relation to large East Coast cities, a local map indicating local landmarks and some street names along with the locations of the fire's origin and the site of one especially scary event, and a third map that indicates where the fire hot spots were located in 1983. These graphics are only helpful in a minimal way and don't go far enough toward clarification.Photographs appear at the start of each chapter and there are a few in the bodies of the chapters. In terms of graphic clarity (not subject matter) all leave much to be desired and in many cases they are of such poor quality as to be useless. They have the appearance of being photocopies of photocopies of photocopies and are of such high contrast that the very features that they were intended to illustrate have become invisible. I do not blame Mr. DeKok for this - his publisher should have done a better job. As for the type of photos included, there are many of Centralians effected by the fire, some of the government workers who had to deal with the situation on almost a daily basis, one of the fire itself, and many of the government figures involved. However there is one glaring omission: aside from the cover photo which is obscured by the bold lettering of the book's title there are no pictures of the town, either as it was at the beginning of the story, during, or after. For those, one must go to the various websites dedicated to the subject.Ms. Quigley's book generally does not suffer from these kind of setbacks. Even before her Prologue we are provided with a nearly full page map which clearly indicates street names, locations of local landmarks, locations of the principal character's homes, indications of the sites and scope of efforts to stop the fires, and a distance scale to help us better grasp the relative proximities of the places and events described. I wish I had this map while I was reading \\"Unseen Danger\\", it would have increased my appreciation of that book all the more. \\"The Day the Earth Caved In\\" contains eight pages of black and white photographs, all well reproduced, including one of the authors' grandparents row home from 1984, and one taken in 2000 of a tourist observing a cloud of vapor emanating from a non-descript area in the woods, as well as photos of mine workings from the 1880's and pictures of some of the people central to her telling of the story. As with \\"Unseen Danger\\" wide angle photos of the town before and after are absent and their inclusion would have helped drive home the immense scope of this catastrophe. Again, one has to search the Internet to find those kind of pictures.While David DeKok relates the Centralia story by presenting an almost day by day account of the events that occurred he does not get inside the heads of the principals too deeply. He doesn't have to - anyone who has an atom of imagination can empathize or sympathize with the horrors that these people must have been through. But what left me scratching my head in bewilderment after I finished his book was why the Centralians were so reluctant to leave their homes and flee the danger. I suppose this is because I was born and raised in New York City and have moved to new homes five times since I left my parents house - once because the dangers of living in a loft on NY's Lower East Side became too much to bear. It wasn't until a few days ago while discussing the matter with a co-worker who grew up in a small town in upstate New York (population about 2000) that I really began to understand what made Centralians want to cling to their homesteads so tenaciously. Joan Quigley, by telling her version of the story through the eyes, histories and emotions of a few of the key players attempts to explain that sense of attachment, but is only partially successful. Ironically enough, it is DeKok's sparse explanation that comes closest to what my co-worker told me and what I've observed since moving from NYC to a small town: that many people living in small towns are fearful of the outside world and are much more likely to cling to surroundings that are much more familiar and therefore comforting.Quigley's device of presenting the story by delving into the personal histories and feelings of her selected subjects is a welcome supplement to the mine fire disaster story as told by DeKok but ultimately it falls short in conveying just how desperately dangerous their situation was. At times I got the impression that she feels that the personal relationships between husbands and wives, parents and children or neighbors and neighbors is the interesting part of the story and the mine fire and its dangers were just a backdrop to that soap opera. Major events, like one man's close encounter with death by carbon monoxide poisoning while asleep in his bedroom and the circumstances leading up to it are described in great detail in \\"Unseen Danger\\" while Ms. Quigley mentions it almost in passing, preferring to more often dwell on what clothes a person was wearing. (What bearing does who wore what color pants suit on a particular day have on the story at hand? Inexplicably, these kind of observations appear far too frequently.) This is generally indicative of both authors approach to their subjects.Similarly, Mr. DeKok tends to speak with authority and presumably understanding on technical matters while Ms. Quigley shows some lack of comprehension. For example, at one point she states that oxygen was the fuel that kept the mine fires burning. Just for the record: coal is the fuel that is consumed by the fire while oxygen needs to be present for oxidation - burning - to occur; oxygen in and of itself does not burn. This is elementary Junior High school science. While I realize that the point Ms. Quigley was trying to make was that some scientists proposed that if the mine fire were to be deprived of oxygen then it might go out, it is this misunderstanding of basic physics that influences me to trust Mr. DeKok's opinions over hers.One rare instance where Ms. Quigley's narrative excels over Mr. DeKok's is in her scathing indictment of the Reagan administration and of the local Catholic church, an institution highly revered and trusted in Centralia, who let their parishioners down as shamefully and grievously as the government had. Mr. DeKok also criticizes these institutions, but instead mostly relies on the method he employs when dealing with other facets of the story, that of letting the facts speak for themselves. Ms. Quigley does this as well, however, she goes one step further on this one point by including examples of government official's blunders not cited in \\"Unseen Danger\\", in particular those of the lunatic James Watt (who was Secretary of the Interior near the end of the story) whose public statements were so insane that President Reagan gladly accepted his resignation, and none too soon: after Watt left office he was indicted on charges of influence peddling. None of this information about Watt was in \\"Unseen Danger\\" and I strongly feel it should have been.Both books tell pretty much the same story (though from different perspectives and not equally as well), but one disagreement between the two is about how the fire started in the first place. In my opinion Mr. DeKok presents a far more plausible explanation, citing specific evidence in chapter 3 of his book while Ms. Quigley covers the subject in an author's note at the end of hers. While she states that her research provides strong evidence for her version of the events, she reveals very few specifics of it and appears to rely heavily on the testimony of residents living near the ignition site, claiming that they had no reason to lie. I view this claim with a lot of skepticism. Her own depiction of the character of the Centralia residents (especially some who lived near the dump) leads me to conclude otherwise. Also, Ms. Quigley seems to overlook one gigantic 500 pound gorilla in the room: Why would the town dump be set on fire if it was already burning? It seems painfully obvious to me that they wouldn't. In any case, the cause of the fire is only one part of the story and either scenario would have led to the same result.If one is interested in reading about this subject my advice is to get both of these books. Read \\"Unseen Fire\\" first (it is by far the better of the two because in part it tells the horrific story in much more frightening detail) but keep \\"The Day The Earth Caved In\\" handy so you can refer to its superior map. Then read Ms. Quigley's book as a supplement, to flesh out some of the characters involved and to learn a handful of interesting but not necessarily essential facts that were left out of Mr. DeKok's. Some may find her more personally intimate and emotional method of storytelling preferable to DeKok's somewhat dry, fact based delivery but I for one did not. For as much as I enjoyed \\"The Day The Earth Caved In\\" on a certain level I think I did so because I already knew the facts ahead of time. Much to her credit, Ms. Quigley invoked in me even more sympathy for the people she chose to focus on than I had before, (at least those who were deserving of it,) especially one young couple's story of being pulled apart because of wanting different things out of life, which paralleled my own personal experience. However, I feel that this concentration on the private lives of a select few takes too much attention away from exploring and understanding the broader picture of governmental incompetence that any one of us could fall victim to under similar unfortunate circumstances.Hope that nothing like this ever happens in your town."},{"Title":"Unseen Danger: A Tragedy of People, Government, and the Centralia Mine Fire","review":"As a native of industrialized Pennsylvania I'm perplexed by how little is known of the tragedy of Centralia. I was unfamiliar myself until some years ago when I innocently passed through the area on route 61. I found a ghost town with an orderly street grid, with city blocks completely devoid of all but one or two lonely buildings, and vast abandoned fields covering what could have been orderly neighborhoods. I thought, what in the world is this? I also witnessed what I thought was a natural hot spring emitting steam from a hillside. Only over time did I learn that the hot spring was really smoke from the underground mine fire that wiped out what was once a normal small town.DeKok's book is probably the most extensive investigation of the Centralia tragedy, especially with his coverage of the political ineptitude over decades that made a minor problem into a major disaster. Dekok reveals that the town started the fire itself in 1962 by burning trash in a landfill that had an unknown connection to an old mine shaft, which ignited the slow-burning coal in the mines beneath the town. For 19 years the slow fire affected more and more people with toxic fumes, until by 1981 tragedy struck when a gentleman had to be hospitalized and a boy fell through a flaming cave-in behind his house. DeKok covers the years and years of political and bureaucratic ineptitude that merely led to \\"studies\\" of the fire rather than action, as the people of Centralia were pawns in a game between apathetic agencies with overlapping jurisdictions, plus buck-passing between the state and the Feds. Even the citizens were torn apart by divisiveness caused by stress and anger. Eventually most of the residents chose to be relocated to other towns by the government, and DeKok's most moving coverage concerns the social agony caused by this final abandonment of the town.As an update since this book, the fire is still slowly burning beneath much of the area.

Like him I am no computer Luddite and, as a university teacher, make extensive use of computers. However, he is right, there is no substitute for a certain amount of hard slog when it comes to learning. A lot of multimedia software attempts to make learning fun and there is nothing wrong with that as long as it doesn't trivialise the learning process.There is much of value in this book but for me the most important part was Stoll's thoughts on the differences between hypertext and &quot;real&quot; text and just how detrimental an effect those differences can have on the reading habits and abilities of young people. I also enjoyed Stoll's expos&eacute; of the eagerness, at many levels of government throughout the United States, to install technology at any cost. This demonstrates a lack of understanding among officials who should know better. Often, it seems, the funding of technology in schools becomes a political gambit.Stoll points out that there is little need to emphasise the learning of technology within the curriculum, especially at the expense of other subjects, because young people pick it up so easily anyway. I think it wouldn't be too strong to say that he views a large part of the US policy on computers in schools as crazy. He puts a lot of strong arguments to support this view.This book is easy to read and it will certainly give you a lot to think about. It is worth reading (if you aren't too busy surfing the web)."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"Stoll shares his skeptical and sometimes cynical view on the use of computer technology in education and society in general.I found the part on education a bit repetitous and thought that Stoll could have shortened it after the first couple of chapters he tried to make his point (or condense into less chapters). The part on computer technology and society is more general and covers several loose topics (PowerPoint and the grey mass of presentations with non-essential gadgetery!)His insight is refreshing and somewhat daring in a time you seemingly should not speak 'against' computer technology: It sometimes feels you are either on or off in the current trends regarding the Web and computers in general. Stoll simply asks questions on the blind use of computer technology and makes us think about it (I happen to agree with him a lot), but he isn't against it: he also thinks there are a lot of good uses but computer technology should not become the goal, only a means to get where we want to go.Unfortunately, I found commentaries like &quot;Uh, right.&quot; below the level of competence of Stoll as a writer. He explains and tells other stuff so well, so he should not have to fall back on short (cheap) comments like that.I give 3 points for the book (it is not great nor badly written; well above average) and 1 point for the refreshing and daring view on computer technology."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"Non-conformist Cliff Stoll, previously having taken on computer hackers and silicon valley, points his street-wise chatter sites on the educational use of computers. Stoll is concerned that the computer has drained resources instead of providing quality education. While admittedly a big user of computers (even to the point of keeping his old Mac for a fishtank, which is admittedly also being a recycler instead of a waste generator) Stoll finds numerous examples of the use of computers which does not enhance the learning environment. He intersperses his own anecdotes with quotes from seasoned educators. In the end, you have a humorous rendition of a serious matter, namely, how much better learning by our youth is being accomplished by the reliance on the computer and its web-based technologies, as opposed to instilling in our youth an earnest desire to comprehend the world within which they live. Not to mention the ability to think for one's self."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"Maybe this is not the right forum to discuss a book that debunks the internet, but I presume that you have enough sense to read between the lines here as with Stoll's book.More than his writing style, I enjoyed his perspicacious understanding of how computers and everything related to high tech has radically changed our society and individual lives. For some odd reason, we never challenge new gadgetry, we just assimilate it. But for everything we gain, we lose something.I particularly enjoyed the first half of his book, in which he challenges using computers in our public schools. It is a high cost, low benefit formula. (Read Jane Healy's books, Failure To Connect and Endangered Minds, if you want to follow-up on this topic.)In the second half of his book, he rattles technology in general, and although his tone sounds at times like the whiny Andy Rooney, his message needs to be heard, particularly his chapter on Library management.If the title appeals to you, you will like the book; he's a radical from the inside. This book should be a companion to Bill McKibbon's The Age of Misinformation and Jerry Mander's In The Absence Of The Sacred.This is a quick, scatalogical read, friends, and worth it."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"As a high school counselor, I talk to kids every day who are obsessed with computers yet are unable to relate to their peers in normal conversation. Dr. Stoll has hit the nail on the head with his ideas. This book is a godsend! I hope it comes out in paperback soon so I can afford to give copies of it to my colleagues who seem to think computers are the &quot;end-all and be-all.&quot; The book is easy to read yet has very profound points to make by someone who is on the inside of the computer world. An important book that should be read by anyone involved in education, including and especially parents!"},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"As a public school teacher I can attest to the fact that Cliff really knows what he is talking about. I think that he'd make a fantastic High School teacher and he knows more about education than half of the ED school professors that I had in college.Cliff's basic thesis in this book is that we are spending way too much money on computers in schools in an effort to appear up to date. He brilliantly argues that learning is a difficult process requiring hard work from both the students and the teacher. Too often, he argues, we are seduced by the idea that computers will somehow make this process simple and painless.He presents his material with humor and persuasive arguements. I find that his points were well thought out and argued well.For example, he rails against the idea of teaching kids how to make multi-media presentations. He points out that these exercises take a tremendous amount of time to create, and the amount of material learned is neglible.I once sat through a workshop where a student produced power point presentation was displayed. This was supposed to be a stellar example integrating technology to history. What the kid did was make a power point movie to the tune of Billy Joel's \\"We didn't start the fire.\\" It had all the images that Joel mentions in his song, but I thought. Did the kid really know who Chairman Mao was, who Ho Chi Mihn was, and all the other people and places mentioned? Or did he just go out to the web, download the images, and paste them into the song? Stoll's book argues against just this sort of junk, and is should be required reading for all school superintendentsSadly, this book will probobly go unnoticed in the educational policy marketplace. Peopl who will wonder why more and more of are children's test scores are declining and why kids are having to take remedial courses in college should buy Stoll's book. The answer is staring at them in the face."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"I've never been a big fan of installing technology in schools for the sake of installing them, but I couldn't articulate my argument against the kind of wholesale &quot;spend money on computers and the Internet&quot; campaigns now going on. My thought was that unless you provide training, resources, and real software, computers are no better than word processors or video games. There's no learning involved except if you're learning to do tech support.Stoll's anecdotes and statistics lend credence to the notion that a lot of good education (and teachers and programs) are cut to support an idea that's a sop to the real ideas of education. He carefully explores and refutes most of the claims of the pro-technology crowd, while giving good voice to the reasonable and correct uses of computers in the classroom.The point is not that kids shouldn't use computers, but that computers should always be tools to assist in learning. That learning can be hard, challenging and rewarding - and that most computer software is sold as simply &quot;a fun way to learn,&quot; as if other ways are somehow bad.No matter what your take on the issue, read this book. It should form the authoritative basis for the ongoing discussion."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"Stoll's book is a mixed bag; unfortunately, most of it is bad. While many of his points about the affect of computers in the classroom are valid and confirmed by my time in education, the good points are mired in a nearly unreadable stream-of-consciousness writing style that reeks more of \\"bitter old coot\\" rather than \\"scientist and educator\\". Without the harsh tone, there's some good stuff in here. Most of that stuff, however, is pretty obvious and not worth wading through this book to find."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"This book starts a discussion that really should have occurred well before computers came to be considered a required piece of educational equipment. In an enjoyable to read, humorous style, Stoll gives many good reasons to question the value of computers in the classroom. Earlier reviewers have critiqued Stoll for not having data to support his arguments. The real problem, however, is that the burden should really have been on those who have had us spend millions on the unproven idea that education would be better with computers in the schools. Where was the proof for that proposition?Stoll argues (convincingly, I think, and certainly cogently) that computers in schools were a solution in search of a problem. Why is it that the promoters of putting computers in every classroom, and wiring every school for the internet are not asked to demonstrate the value of these things for learning? Instead, it seems to be taken as beyond question that having more technology means the school is better - this is certainly the case in the school district where I teach. What Stoll does most effectively is make the case for raising these questions. Do computers help make students read, write, or think any better? These questions can be addressed by looking at what computers actually do, how they work, etc. Reading this book led me to badger lots of other teachers to discuss the issues it raises, and especially the question of why we have never really had this discussion, but rather have worked with the assumption that computers must be good for teaching. Every teacher, principal, librarian, school board member, as well as others interested in education should read this book so we can start a real discussion of the issues it raises."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"It was good to read about the negative aspects of computer culture in plain language. Today's &quot;upgraded&quot; machines are not fun due to unwieldy software and rapidly depreciating hardware. Unlike most commercial technologies, software programmers have abandoned the pursuit of miniaturization and streamlining. The result is hellish complexity. Mr. Stoll's book is an eye-opening account of fad-following schools ruining true learning by adopting today's mediocre computer systems. His line about software products having the same lifespan as grocery store lettuce was a hilarious breath of fresh air after so many disastrous years of unfulfilled hype."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"I agree that we should spend more resources on teachers, but since resource is a finite scarcity, how much can we really put into the educational system without taking it from some other system (ie, social security or health system).His views are extremely shallow. Have you ever had to do a paper in class and found out a half dozen other students are doing what you want to do? Then tried hitting the library and finding out one of them has borrowed it and it's long overdue? Then tried the public library and the same story? With computers, when texts are finially digitized, we wouldn't have to worry about such things like that. Not to mention if more schoolwork is done on the computer, it is easier to update the information. Whereas a school would have to dump the old text and buy new ones. I'm a University student now, so I'm experiencing these text going legacy or out of date first hand.Second, more teachers isn't going to make the education system better if all your hiring is numbers. An incompetent teacher teaching a class of 20, is worst than a good teacher lecturing a class of 100 (good as in humorous, passionate for what they teach, etc). Right now I've got a course with only about 25 in the class, but the prof is so incompetent that half the class doesn't even show up for class. However, I've got classes that are 200+ sizes, and most of the class attends simply because the class is enjoyable. And really, how are you going to clean up the innercity schools? by double the teachers position? Ha! Lets see how that's going to clean up the innercity education system. Now how about equipping the schools with state of the art computers? I would place my money that new computers would clean up the system better than an army of teachers.One last thing... learning by computers doesn't necessarily mean the information comes in one end and leaves the other with no time for reflection. Stoll is assuming that education by computers is like learning from multiple choice questions. It's not. Multiple choice is for testing. For learning it involves reading and mental processing. Maybe the author should look at some of the educating software out there before coming to conclusions. His logic is correct, but a correct answer depends on a correct premise.And at least with computers you can more or less work at your own pace. How many times have people dazed off in class, mind wander, etc, or doodleling during a lecture, that you miss what the teacher said? Or simply didn't understand a concept and didn't raise your hand for some clarification? with a computer, you can work at your own pace. If you don't understand a concept, you stick with that question a bit longer, until you finally do overcome it. This is also beneficial to those who are ahead of the class. Instead of wasting their potential while everybody else catches up, they can move forward. And group work via network computers is a lot more productive than groupwork brainstorming... as any psychologist will tell you, Groupthink dampens creativity and criticism. However, a message forum or chat system allows a sort of anonymity that allows people to express themselves easier. Another personal experience has been in a class that has required groupwork... we had problems with people expressing ideas or criticizing the bad ideas.. everybody just nodded their head to everything. Then the prof had a message forum to discuss something else, but the next thing we knew we were using it for your projects, and were more productive in a weekend than had we been in the last two weeks.I can go on and on, but I hope my point is made. The author is one that is well versed in the industry, which makes his view the more surprising (one of the surprises is how WRONG his views just are).If I had a choice to choose between a school that uses technology to it's full advantage (including such things as recorded lectures so I can watch the ones that I missed) or an education system like Stoll, I would definite choose the high-tech one. Your telling me you wouldn't send your kid to the high-tech one? The future is already set. And it is a digital future."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"After thoroughly combing over this book, I was disappointed by the lack of facts and figures to back up the 90% of his rantings and ravings with sentences like: \\"So... yeah!\\"I am a computer technician in two low-income elementary schools, so I am on the front lines of what he was attempting to explain. I am not here to \\"defend my job\\" because if I really felt this was a waste of taxpayer's dollars, I would leave and work elsewhere, which was the reason I picked the book up in the first place.But because we are in a low-income area, the teaching staff that we hire is sub-par to the 4-star \\"upper class\\" schools that may be wasting resources. Because of this, we have found that many of the websites and programs we approve are able to \\"fill in the cracks\\" of the shortcomings we face. And because of the budget situation, 100% of my school's computers are donations from companies that have generously given their \\"old junk\\" to be used by us. We are eternally grateful for all of the companies that saw our immediate need for projectors and PCs.While I DO agree that there is a fine line between TRUE learning and \\"doing it because it is cool\\", the fact of the matter is that 90% of the children of tomorrow will need computer experience, whether it is writing a resume, or a doctorate paper in college. Or, it could be the necessity of staying in touch via email with family on the other side of the globe because they can't afford talking on the phone.But the point that he has missed was that we do not force the teachers to use the technology. They come to us with their own vision and ideas to allow the children to learn in THEIR language. Think about it - when a child goes home after school, what will they most likely be doing? They play video games, facebook, myspace, and youtube. The common trait in all of these activities is that the child interacts with the media. When a child learns from their textbook (as sad as it may be) they aren't listening. I do not wish this was they way it is, but this is a sad fact of the matter.Currently, we have interactive Smartboards (a projector projecting on a touch screen) in the classrooms, where students can view and manipulate objects in a 3-D environment. My schools simply do not have the resources to purchase \\"oscilloscopes\\" to show sound waves, but we can afford to go to a free website and interact with the objects or other resources from another school district that is teaching the same thing. Everything the teachers use is by their own choice, and to say that it is a waste is simply not true.Because of computers, the teachers have resources for their SOL guides, even interactive games that are exactly what the teacher is trying to explain, instead of via an overhead projector. I would LOVE to have Clifford visit my schools to show him how many free resources have been utilized that would have otherwise cost the school thousands of dollars in materials."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"\\"High Tech Heretic,\\" written by Clifford Stoll and published by Doubleday (1999), catalogs the rants of a former computer programmer turned astronomy teacher. While acknowledging the importance of computers, he seeks to challenge the myths about the amazing things they are purported to do. I really enjoyed reading this book, and as a former classroom Computer Science teacher, I agree with about 90% of his sentiments. Stoll's rants are aimed at anyone who uses a computer, either at school or at home. He certainly gets his point across that computers, while useful, aren't the panacea to all social ills as they are sometimes revered. The book is a bit dated as it was published a decade ago, but many of his points still ring true.Some of Stoll's primary rants are as follows. \\"Learning to use a computer...is essentially a mechanical task, one that doesn't...encourage creativity\\" (p. 4). The \\"emphasis on professional reports sends students the message that appearance and fonts mean more than content\\" (p. 7). (How many times have teachers required clip art in projects?) He says, \\"It's easy to mistake familiarity with computers for intelligence, but computer literate certainly doesn't equal smart. And computer illiterate sure doesn't mean stupid\\" (p. 9). He argues that \\"equating learning with fun says that if you don't enjoy yourself, you're not learning\\" (p. 12). Stoll points out that a computer can only give one answer to \\"What is seven?\\" but a qualified teacher could give hundreds of responses to that inquiry (p. 21). Similarly, creative people tend to get the most frustrated with computers because a program usually only has one right answer (p. 151). Online chemistry experiments, biology dissections and physics simulations are nice, but they don't provide the hands-on, discovery factor that physical experiments do (p. 29). He says technology \\"train[s] the youngest children to explore through a computer rather than with their hands, feet and imagination\\" (p. 68). Supporters promote student laptops as being portable, but Stoll points out that unlike a book, children can't accidentally leave laptops on a park bench, or use them on the bus; also, books don't need batteries or cables (p. 38). He argues that since computers depreciate so fast, it makes much better financial sense to use a ten-year-old book than a ten-year-old laptop. Some people say that books are antiquated, but Stoll notes that many websites are outdated or have non-working links (p. 39).Proponents argue that computers, unlike televisions, are interactive. Stoll argues that most PC programs ask the user to \\"sit, watch and be entertained.\\" He also contends that problem-solving on a computer implies the process is as simple as clicking a mouse and choosing the right answer (p. 45). He maintains that computers discourage reading because screen real estate is monopolized by pictures, and users do not want to read lengthy blocks of text because it hurts their eyes (p. 57). Stoll points out that with distance learning, students may learn the required knowledge, but they won't even recognize the faces of those with whom they have \\"collaborated\\" (p. 93). He also blames Americans' shrinking view of the world on technology; he says that we view people of other cultures online and on TV instead of getting out there and interacting with them (p. 119). He notes that people rarely get fired for a lack of computing skills but get dismissed often for \\"being unable to get along with others,\\" which the isolationist nature of computing exacerbates (p. 122). Another rant was about the overuse of PowerPoint. Imagine if Abraham Lincoln had delivered the Gettysburg Address, with an \\"animation of Washington crossing the Delaware...and the phrases \`A new nation,' \`Conceived in liberty,' and \`All men are created equal'\\" on his bullet chart (p. 182). He argues the internet is full of (unverified) data but short on useful, pedigreed information (p. 186).\\"High Tech Heretic,\\" although intentionally one-sided, was very entertaining and a fast, fun read. Stoll reminds us that even an obsessed computer-lover can still critically examine the promises of any technology."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"The more I read this book, the more that I began to understand what it was about and the more I began to agree with Stoll.Stoll gives many good reasons to question the significance of computers in the classroom.

Stoll also talks about technology in general.Stoll talks about what is wrong with computer learning in our society, by questioning every aspect of computing, especially the computer use in public schools.Stoll, however does not hate computers, he just hates how they are misused in schools.

I and many of my colleagues with children are already converted to the heretical points of view of Clifford Stoll. My less technically oriented friends are unwaveringly certain of the importance of classroom computers. As such it was great fun to read the whimsical rantings of a convert. However, as a fellow convert, I was looking for something else, like facts and figures. These are few and far between. For every paragraph of anecdote, there are pages of personal opinion. For every quote about other technologies which had once been professed as revolutionary to education (e.g. the invention of the motion picture), there are volumes of musings. In short, there are good ideas here, but little research to back them up. In the end I grew irritated with the book. Worse yet, I am in no better position to face my children's teachers and principal with these ideas than before I read the book. The bottom line is that the book is entertaining to the convert, but stands little chance of stopping the lemmings."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"High Tech Heretic continues Mr. Stoll's writing trajectory from Cuckoo's Egg and Silicon Snake Oil.

And if you have commputers you will need to buy new ones of those as well as they die and become obsolete.Second, more teachers isn't going to make the education system better if all your hiring is numbers.I think Cliff would speak out just as strongly against blindly hiring more teachers as well. The point seems to be that some policy makers see understanding technology as a goal in itself, when the real goal of education should be to understand how to think(no what to think how to think). Once you understand that, then you can take that understanding and apply it to any subject you want, math, english, biology, theology, whatever.f I had a choice to choose between a school that uses technology to it's full advantage (including such things as recorded lectures so I can watch the ones that I missed) or an education system like Stoll, I would definite choose the high-tech one.

He is a computer user of many years citing his technical experience in the past. He is also an MSNBC commentator.&quot;High-Tech Heretic&quot; is not written as scholarly research. It is a personal essay on what is wrong with computer learning in our society today. Stoll does cite sources in his text, but uses very few footnotes and his sources are not completely identified in detail. His work is definately thought-provoking, as he questions nearly every aspect of computing, especially computer use in education.Clifford Stoll is careful to point out that he does not hate computers, however they are often misused in the classroom. He does not buy into all the hype surrounding the latest technologies and is particularly critical of the way schools spend millions of dollars on technology. I partially agree with Stoll on this point, however this does not mean that computers do not belong in our schools. I feel that they are very worthwhile in the educational setting, they just need to be used properly. They are a tool, and like all tools, may be used inappropriately. Schools should constantly examine their methods of incorporating technology into the curriculum in efficient and beneficial ways.A computer will never replace human interaction and hands-on teaching.

That the enjoyment of scholarship has nothing to do with making learning fun...That students...recognize computer assignments primarily as entertainment, rather than education&quot; (p. xiv). He is concerned about the &quot;empty promises of the cult of computing&quot; (p. xi) and that &quot;techies have a responsibility to challenge hyberbole, false promises, and gross exaggerations&quot; (p. xii).Written in an informal &quot;conversational&quot; style, Stole attempts to rebut many exaggerated claims of high technology's ability to enhance learning. While the book contains some quotations from &quot;experts&quot; and a few anecdotal &quot;horror stories&quot; missing are the hard facts, documentation, research, or footnotes backing his conclusions. What he appears to have done is select some of the worst examples of computer and Internet &quot;abuse&quot; in schools while ignoring many more positive benefits of technology in society.He often resorts to the &quot;either/or&quot; fallacy to prove his points (EITHER computers OR teachers, EITHER the Internet OR books, etc). For example, &quot;Encourage kids to surf the Web rather than read books...&quot; (p. 164) -- why can't it be both? There are many such examples.The book is an entertaining read, but we get mainly the author's private opinions and speculations why we should be skeptical like him. Having said that, I agree with his points about the negative impact that computers and the Internet could have if they are seen as replacements for hard work in the learning process, or substitutes for real personal interaction among teachers, students, and people in general.This was the book I selected as a report and oral presentation assignment for a Computer Ethics class at the University of South Florida."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"High Tech Heretic really kept my attention.

After all, not *all* teens are totally enthralled with the techno-world and I'm sure many will say to themselves: &quot;This is what I've always thought&quot; after reading this book. In fact, if the truth be known, most teens are only marginally influenced by computers. To them, computers are basically a substitute for TV or other forms of entertainment. They no more influence their lives than does football and other sports. They simply don't, despite the popular views that they do. From the technical standpoint, I had few problems with the book, considering I wasn't after a &quot;literary&quot; experience in purchasing it. There were a couple of chapters which seemed to be &quot;fillers&quot;, in particular the last one entitled &quot;All Truth&quot;. I couldn't quite figure out what the point was in including it or what it was really saying. Otherwise, a very good read. If I had teenagers in my home, I'd definitely suggest they read this book."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"This is a fantastic book. Clifford Stoll explains with great eloquence the problems of todays computer age, as well as providing a great Bannana Bread recipie!"},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"While computers and the Internet are very useful tools, they have been oversold outside of the technical and database vocations. Education is no exception. The dysfunctional result from public schools appears more a consequence of politicized bureaucracy and an either indifferent or confused citizenry than from lack of resources. (suggested reading: _In_Pursuit_ by Charles Murray or _Inside_American_Education by Thomas Sowell.)As tools, computers remain cranky if useful devices -- an observation made from running Fortran code in highschool and college since the mid-1970s on Univac, CDC, PDP, SGI, HP on a plethora of operating systems. The code gets fancier, and memory faster to access, but it's no panacea. The medium is too narrow for anything but task-specific operations, and very frustrating as a learning portal, irrespective of baud rate.Dr Stoll's conversational style perhaps fills the pages more than necessary, but his critics are unable to refute his arguments against the superficial and unverified content of the Internet debases research or the distracting nature of visual graphics advertised to facilitate learning or the wretched quality of current software development and computer ergonomics or the expensive maintenance of equipment that's obsolete when manufactured, never mind installed.The hype from electronics promoters neglects to mention the advantages of durable media -- primarily books (with text). This failing is evident even in scholarly studies, such as _Integrating_Information_Technology_in_Education_ that exhorts yet more electrons knocked from their p-orbital shells to placate the god &quot;nolij&quot; but no understanding or mastery that comes from self-discipline and investigative study. _High_Tech_Heretic_ serves as an appropriate counterweight to this latest and expensive fad."},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"I liked this book, but I think that the author could have done a much better job expressing his ideas.

It is a shame!"},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"Type your review in the space below"},{"Title":"High Tech Heretic: Why Computers Don't Belong in the Classroom and Other Reflections by a Computer Contrarian","review":"This is the message I wait for from Clifford Stoll. He started brilliantly with &quot;The Cuckoo's Egg,&quot; then slid into &quot;Silicon Snake Oil,&quot; and now blasts the industry that succored him for so long in &quot;High Tech Heretic.&quot; Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. And besides, Heretic is not how I would describe Dr. Stoll. Copernicus and Galileo were Heretics. They were against the thinking of their times, but instead of whining, they offered constructive alternatives. What does Dr. Stoll offer? More whining. I think Obstructionist or Luddite would be more appropriate.Is there anything good about the book? Yes. He states quite correctly that a scientist needs to know that pi is a transcendental number, not just 3.1416. A scientist needs a well-trained, vigorous mind muscled by long periods of hard learning. Learning shouldn't be fun. It takes work and discipline and commitment and responsibility. If you want marathon runners, you shouldn't have too many cars around. Likewise, if you want learned people, you shouldn't have too many computers around.I understand his next book will be titled &quot;Mid Tech Heretic&quot; where he blasts printing presses for ruining the writing skills of monks hand transcribing manuscripts. After some publisher pushes that onto someone's best seller list, Dr. Stoll will bring out his Magnum Opus - &quot;Low Tech Heretic&quot; - where he reveals that quills and papyri ruined the camaraderie of the campfire by putting tellers of tribal histories out of work.But, there is still time. If Dr. Stoll will send that &quot;Please stop me&quot; message, someone might help him find a productive path to fame. Einstein, dissatisfied with Newton's rigid space and time, proposed Relativity in papers early in the 1900's. As a result, he was named Man-Of-The-20th Century by Time magazine. A problem crying out for solution is how all of us can keep from getting trampled by the Electronic Herd, an entity described by Thomas Friedman in &quot;The Lexus and The Olive Tree.&quot; It may take a revolution similar to the PC vs. the Mainframe, but Dr. Stoll has the intellectual firepower to carry it off. So, which shall it be - &quot;Mid Tech Heretic&quot; or Man-Of-The-21st Century?"},{"Title":"Henry the Eighth and his court: An historical romance","review":"My preference is historical novels and this is a very good one. With all the footnotes I assume the background is historically acurate."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"To start, let me say that I'm an admirer of this series, and have found other books in the series extremely useful (Turn of the Screw, House of Mirth). Having taught the Frankenstein edition this quarter, though, I find myself disappointed in the selection of essays, most of which seem to date from an unfortunate moment in the history of critical theory, a time when critics tended to ape the style of their masters (Lacan and Derrida in particular), letting short bursts of dense ideas substitute for sustained explication. I say \\"unfortunate\\" because while such density has its place (more, to my mind, in Lacan or Derrida themselves, who have a linguistic and theoretical purpose for their density), it is off-putting in a volume that purports to be an introduction to critical theory implicitly for undergraduates. Ironically or not, Smith's own contribution is by far the clearest of the bunch, with the psychoanalytic contribution appearing nearly unreadable to most undergraduates and many graduate students (thanks to an intense, and to my eyes rare, focus on Lacan's Imaginary Order). I will not teach this volume again."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"After seeing at least five versions of this tale in film - one of my great childhood monster loves - I was happy to finally read the novel. As so often occurs with classics, I was as surprised as I was fascinated.For starters, the characters are far more subtle than any of the film versions: Victor F appears as a brooding and obsessed genius, but also as a great lover of life and nature. The monster, who is an articulate and literate creature who read Goethe, is even more interesting, from his hopeful beginning to his bitter reaction at rejection and his thirst for vengence. His eloquence was vivid and his pain horribly realistic.But the work is also fascinating as a window into the mind of the Romantics, who at once strove to reject the rationalism of the Enlightenment yet reflected it. The creature starts off empty and what it becomes is due entirely to his experience. Knowledge is not always good, etc.Finally, the themes are timeless and full of conflict: creativity giving birth to unimaginable destruction, tampering with nature as its necessities overwhelm even genius, and the like. THe book is a kaleidescope of philosophical reflection. The pain of the creator and the monster alike are inescapably linked like father and son.I did find the style of the book a bit difficult. It is full of florid rhetoric and lengthy circumlocutions, as the doctor and then the monster tell their stories in almost identical prose.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"You don't know Frankenstein until you've read the novel. Forget everything you remember about the classic horror movie of Frankenstein, sure it's great cinema, but the movie just doesn't do it justice like the novel does. The novel has every quality of a perfect story, and Mary Shelley paints a picture with her writing that's far more disturbing and exciting than the movie ever was. What's really great about the book is that the creature speaks and is literate. Throughout the novel, the creature does speaks about the cruelty of man and I actually had sympathy for him as he told his accounts of misfortune. One thing I particularly liked is the way the creature was almost invincible, it really added to the horror that his creator feels as he's chasing him through the bitter cold. The novel is not difficult reading at all and has a decent steady pace to it. There is more than meets the eye to the novel as well. One could look at Shelly's work through a psychoanalytical standpoint and see the novel on an entirely different level than just what's on the surface. Psychoanalyzing the novel brings with it some interesting discussions; for instance, is the creature really just a duplicate of its creator? Read the book and form your own analysis, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I enjoyed reading Frankenstein, but it wasn't at all what I expected. I had all these horrific images in my head about some terrible, ugly monster. Mary Shelley does not provide her readers with a descriptive image of what the monster truly looks like. As I read this novel, my imagination ran free. As different stories were told, and different emotions were expressed, the images and thoughts in my head of the monster changed. The general theme conveyed is that Victor Frankenstein has to deal with the consequences of his creation. He was so eager to creat life and a god-like figure, but once it was complete, he was disgusted. He did not want to deal with his creation, nor have any relation to it. Ultimately, Victor became his creature's slave. Victor Frankenstein had to deal with many losses and hardships, but he stayed strong till the end. At the end, the monster narrates his side of the story and after completing his &quot;job&quot; he disappears and goes back to being on his own. Although the book started off a bit slow, it picked up and kept my interest until the end. I would recommend reading this book, especially to those who have seen the movie because the book leaves more to the imagination and can be interpreted in many different ways."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I believe that people think of Frankenstein as being a horrible monster that tormented towns and people with bolts coming out of his neck. Even I had fallen under these mis-conceptions from watching the old b&amp;w movies on TV as a small child. The movies we watched set us up for that, but after reading the book by Mary Shelley, I was surprised to learn and see things differently. Mary wrote a classic horror story that even though moves at a slow pace for our time (story originally written in the 1800's) still can scare the reader. Were told what we need to know about key characters in the book, but other descriptions such as the what the monster truly looks like are left out. We are allowed to imagine that and because of this, allowed to use what scares us the most in this world to scare ourselves. Even the theme and plot that runs through the book could be looked at, as political or social issues that still plague the world today. When all is said and done, the book Frankenstein is a great book that should be read be everyone that enjoys not only horror books, but also romantic classics."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"This edition contains several critical essays about Frankenstein (they follow the actual story). Each essay uses a particular literary theory and applies it to the text 9in front of the essay is a description/analysis of the theory being used). For example, one essay applies Freud's Oedipus Complex and Lacan's Mirror Stage to the development of Victor and the monster. Some of the other theories are Feminism, Marxism and New Historicism. It is interesting to see the novel from all these different perspectives. Expect to see contradictions in interruptions from theory to theory. My only complaint is the selection of essays. Half of them are poorly chosen (ex. Psychoanalysis and Feminism). I could have selected a better selection. The essays can be very confusing; jumping all over the place and trying to cover to many ideas at once. It takes awhile simply to figure out exactly what the author's main point is. You would have better luck simply researching the theory and then applying what you know yourself to the text. Either way, it is a fun exercise and makes one appreciate even more just how amazing a book it truly is."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"When the name Frankenstein is heard the majority of the people, myself included, do not look at or see the political or social issues that affected the world in the 1800s as well as today. The story is about a scientist who becomes obssessed with the idea of playing god, creating another human life. Victor rejects his creation causing the monster to not receive the love and affection that he needs.

However, when I read the book, especially after I searched the author Mary Shelley's background, I realize that this is such a profound story which illustrates race discrimination issues, life tragedy, and so many other topics that we are still struggling with today. I consider Frankenstein combines the elements of Mary Shelley's life, for Victor Frankenstein, a talented scientist who obsessed with creating a new life from dead body, has the same tragedy life as Mary Shelley. In the book, Victor Frankenstein lost his mother, father and lover incessantly. In reality, Mary Shelley lost her father, child, and husband and died alone. In the end, Victor Frankenstein chases behind the monster in the North Pole and tries to kill him, just like Mary Shelley wanted to capture and kill her fate and get out of its control.

Up until I read the novel by Mary Shelley, I thought that Frankenstein was the actual monster. Without seeing any of the movies, I had my own mental images of what \\"Frankenstein\\" looked like. I always saw pictures or costumes of \\"Frankenstein\\" which made him to be this huge, gross monster. Upon reading this novel, I learned that Victor Frankenstein was a creator interested in science and that the monster was his creation. Even after I concluded my reading I did not have a detailed description of the monster. So, I let my imagination run wild based on Victor's response to his creation, the monster's feelings of himslef, and on my previous images. Mary Shelley lets her audience create the monster mentally and pictorally. I also really like the manner in which the story is told. It is told via letters and via conversations that share emotions and the history of the creation and its consequences. The book kept me at the edge of my bed a few times. I could not believe all the hardships and losses encountered by Victor. I also could not believe his disgust with his own creation which he wanted so badly to create. Throughout many points I felt bad for the monster. My pitty for him and his alienation made me think that I was right in thinking that Frankenstien was the monster. He created something he wanted but when he got the job done he did not end up liking the fruits of his labor. I also really enjoyed the novel because of its contradictions. For example, creating life using \\"dead\\" parts. There are many different ways to interpret Victor's story and his relationships as well as his thoughts, feelings, and causes of his actions.

At times, I wondered if this hideous creature was really so bad. Mary Shelley painted this picture of thoughtfulness and actually gave the creature a heart. He was seen as a monster by society, when in fact he had the heart of a human to the reader. This book puts all the movies that I have ever seen about Frankenstein to shame.

The book is about Annie Sullivan ( Helen Keller's teacher) as a young girl. This biography discusses and observes how Annie from ayoung age goes blind from a disease she contracted when she rubbed her eyes and scrathed her cornias. She goes on to school and learns to read braille because she couldn't see. She has a very tough and hard life. She had surgery on her eyes and it was successful. She could see. She then, finished school and went to teach Helen. She could deal with the same tantrums Helen displayed because she herself acted that way out of frustration. This book taught me that it is a lot of hard work to teach a kid. You have to have a lot of patience. I recommend this book because it explains how people have to work for their accomplishments. This book had a lot of information on Annie Sullivan. This book was sad because Annie Sullivan didn't have a good childhood. There was lots of disappointments and sadness in her life. She overcame so many obstacles and ended up being an inspirational leader for Helen. I hope you will read this book and learn about Annie's childhood."},{"Title":"Helen Keller's Teacher","review":"the name Helen Keller.I remember ordering this book through the Scholastic Book Club when I was ten. I couldn't wait to read the book. Anne Sullivan came from a background of poverty, neglect and disease; Helen a comfortable home in Alabama. Yet if not for Anne Sullivan, Helen might have wound up in a home for those whom society can't help.The only postive characteristic Anne Sullivan got from her childhood was tenacity and perserverance, and those qualities served her well when she set out to teach Helen Keller.From the time I was 10, Anne Sullivan has always been my hero. She never gave up, she was creative, stubborn, and believed a human being could accomplish anything he/she set their mind to.She was right."},{"Title":"Helen Keller's Teacher","review":"True story of Annie Sullivan's life. She was a miracle and a godsend to Helen Keller - a deaf, blind and mute girl who had never been able to communicate with others before the arrival of Annie Sullivan. Annie was not only Helen Keller's teacher but also Helen's best friend. You will see Annie's struggling endeavor to teach Helen to speak and she was eventually successful. I highly recommend this book to you and your young children."},{"Title":"Helen Keller's Teacher","review":"FINALLY!!!! A book on one of society's greatest hereos, Anne Sullivan! Oh, boy, was her childhood a NIGHTMARE!!!! Oh, she was so strong to endure so much; she endured more pain in twelve years than most human beings endure in her lifetime. Poor Anne! It's her dignity & courage that keeps her going throughout poverty, her dad's alcoholism & abuse, her mom's tragic death, her own lifelong battle with trachoma & being blind, her brother's horrible death in the poorhouse, the terrible conditions in the poorhouse...wow, and to think she survived that all & grew up to reach out to Helen Keller & other handicapped people! Wow, were her cousins, John & Statia so stupid to dump her & Jimmie in the poorhouse; I wish I could just blast those two idiots for not understanding that they needed love & support, not to criticize Anne & put her down. Well, it was their loss since Anne battle her problems & grew up to be a loving, wonderful person to be proud of. The books goes through her arrival at Perkins, her difficulty dealing with her wounded feelings when other students make fun of her & when a teacher humiliates her, then her working hard & graduating valedictorian of her class. The part with Helen also changed her life & I'm glad they found each other since their relationship blossomed into a beautiful lifelong friendship. The part after the Breakfast Table Battle where Anne struggles & wins at getting Helen to eat with a fork is touching as it describes how Anne went up to her room afterward & cried. Poor Anne didn't realize how out of control Helen was! I found Arthur, James, & Kate a little shallow & short-sighted; after Anne opens the world of language for Helen, at first they fell all over her with praise since she'd \\"tamed\\" Helen so she'd be easier to handle, but I get the feeling that they, esp. Mr. Keller felt threatened by Anne & the fact that Helen had a closer bond with her than with them. I like how it went into how their relationship deepened over the years & became almost like a mother-daughter bond. Anne had her heart broken so many times throughout her life, yet I think Helen was one consistant light in her life. One thing the book left out was Anne's disastrous short marriage to John Macy (who, from what I've read in other books, was a real jerk who broke her heart, cheated on her & was jealous of her & I think even hit her). I would have liked to have read that there, but I guess since this was more of a teen-or-kid book, they didn't want to get into the sordid details of that. Anne stayed true to herself to the end & encouraged Helen to do so too, much to the chagrin of the rest of the Kellers. The best gift she gave Helen was her freedom & independence. I thought it was really wonderful that Anne wanted Helen to be even independent of her, since once Anne got old & became permanently blind, she wanted Helen to continue her happy, productive, independent life long after she was gone. It is such a good lesson of pushing yourself to be free, since once Anne died, Helen did just that...lived a free, independent life even without Anne & continued working on behalf of handicapped people everywhere. As the last sentence in the book says, \\"Annie hadn't failed.\\" She sure didn't'; she really was a success story. WAY TO GO, ANNE SULLIVAN! CONGRATULATIONS, ANNE!"},{"Title":"Helen Keller's Teacher","review":"Hellen Kellers Teacher was a great book. I liked it because it had a lot of dialouge and lots of interesting facts I had never known That were about Annie her teacher. Annie was blind when she was little so she knew what Helen felt like. Most people concentrate on Helen but this is all about her teacher. I would recomend this to any 3rd 4th or 5th grader."},{"Title":"Helen Keller's Teacher","review":"This is a very good book. I read it for a project i was doing on social studies about one of my hero's. I was doing extra credit and did two heros, Helen Keller and Anne Sulivan. This book helped me imensly. I would recomend it for anyone who is doing a project on either Helen Keller or Anne Sullivan."},{"Title":"Helen Keller's Teacher","review":"Anne Sullivan Macy's work with Helen Keller is certainly ground breaking. A survivor of paternal abuse, abandonment in a poorhouse with her terminally ill brother and a nearly-lifelong battle with trachoma all hardened Ms. Macy's armor. She was so bright and determined that she made a good academic showing at the Perkins Institute for the Blind and it was through this noted institution that she was assigned to work with Helen Keller, who suffered the dual challenges of being blind and deaf.One admires her gritty determination; she survives the poor house, which was a genuine Chamber of Horrors; she survives being relegated there with her terminally ill brother as no other relatives were willing to take her in; she survives the painful loss of her brother and the subsequent losses of others she came to know in the poor house.This is a good starter book and provides interesting information about Anne Sullivan Macy's life. The one drawback is that it does get stuck at the water pump where Helen learned, from Ms. Macy's constant spelling into her hand that all things have a name. This &quot;watershed&quot; landmark in Helen Keller's life is, in her words, &quot;her soul's birthday.&quot; Helen, then nearly 7, learned at the now famous water pump that all things can be identified by name. For her, that singular lesson served as her lifelong key to communication.I admit, I do get rather tired of that water pump scene because many otherwise good works seem to get stuck there. Many books that cover Helen Keller, this one included, languish at the water pump and with what little speed the book has left gives scant attention to the many accomplishments these women made and their indelible stamp on history."},{"Title":"Helen Keller's Teacher","review":"This book is highly recommended for all readers.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Helen Keller's Teacher","review":"I am in my 50's now, and I look back on the moment when I got this book, in fourth grade, as a life-changer. As a child from a troubled household, biographies were my lifeline. I really took to heart this story of a nearly blind girl, orphaned with her tubercular brother, living in a state institution for the insane. Her spunk inspired me, and I found myself in awe of the moment when she managed to get the attention of Frank Sanborn, a visitor from the Perkins School for the Blind, to say \\"I want to go to school!\\"I read the book over and over, and I still count Anne Sullivan Macy as one of my heroines.

I found Annie's story very emotional (with both highs and lows) and interesting, and I really felt like I could empathize with her.

It isn't a simple one page or two page list of facts but it won't go over ever-single detail in Annie Sullivan's life. After all, it's only 153 pages, hardly a novel. It's well written but not a difficult read. It really tells about Annie Sullivan's life, not just the time she spent with Helen Keller. For example, it talks a lot about her childhood and the time she spent in the Perkins Institution. In fact only half of the book is spent talking about her time with Helen. The first half is spent telling about Annie's struggles with her disabilities. I recommend this if you are looking for a quick, yet engaging read about Annie Sullivan."},{"Title":"Helen Keller's Teacher","review":"To maintain their effectiveness, educators must constantly troll for new and interesting ways to present their material. I recently attended a meeting where a candidate for a position in the education department was doing a learning presentation. One of the topics covered was the difficulty of finding alternative ways to present the same topic and we discussed the different ways in which students process information and reach a state of understanding.Sometimes, casting your gaze only in the forward direction can cause you to miss solutions already tried and proven successful. This book is a biography of the life of Annie Sullivan, the woman who educated Helen Keller. Helen was a woman who was rendered blind and deaf by an illness while she was very young. Annie was a woman who was nearly blind in her youth and was raised in a home for the indigent. Annie's problems in trying to educate Helen were more difficult than most educators face. She had to somehow relate to Helen and impart concepts that most of us obtain through either visual or auditory means.Annie was fortunate that her student was very intelligent, but that fact should not diminish the significance of her accomplishments. Her methods of adapting to the situation and developing new ways to present material remain an object lesson in quality education over a century after her student became the first deafblind person to graduate from college.This story is a demonstration of the power of the human desire to learn and understand. I strongly recommend it as required reading in late elementary school."},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"Concise history with many black and white illustrations.

If only history had been so interesting when I was in school!

If you own a Greyhound you owe it to your dog to learn more about his contribution to history."},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"I was not really interested in the history of greyhounds, but have been contemplating adopting one. I received this book as a gift, and enjoyed it much more than I expected. She makes it interesting with some amazing stories, with some astronomical numbers in some cases. The most interesting part is her own experiences with these dogs. A good read."},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"Being both a sighthound owner and a history buff, I was so delighted to have found this book. I can't recommend it enough.I can guarantee that if you haven't had experience with sighthounds, you will want to after reading this! For those of us who know the breed, it is a long overdue salute to one of the most overlooked and unappreciated dog breeds in the world.I especially liked the photos that accompanied the text. It was wonderful to see so many representations of greyhounds through the ages.I thought that chapter 1, on the Greyhound family, was very informative, and the author managed to put a lot of information that is rarely found all in one place into a very readable and enjoyable format.Read this book- You'll love it, even if you don't own a Greyhound! I hope that Cynthia Branigan's book helps many many more retired racing Greyhounds find homes with people who learn about them from her book as well."},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"This is an excellent book for those who want an in depth look at the history of the greyhound. It doesn't have info. on how to care, treat, or train, but it provides more background than I've found in any other book. The author uses personal references which make it more meaningful. Really, an enjoyable read from a greyhound foster parent, active rescuer, and a 4 time adopter."},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"Like another reviewer said,I thought I knew a lot about greyhounds, but after reading this, I can see I was missing huge chunks of history. If you think of Greyhounds being associated only with Egypt, well, that was only the beginning. In some ways it is hard to believe these dogs have been around so long. From the book, it seems that if it wasn't for their aristocratic beauty and elegance, they might have faded out long ago, but since they were often seen as dogs for the wealthy or powerful, they managed to keep their niche even though times did get tough on them (Crusades, Roman collapse, etc.). There is a lot of history in here, and I was most surprised by the stories of the greyhounds (and mastiffs) that accompanied Columbus and other New World explorers on their trips. Unfortunately they didn't use the greyhounds as tools of peace. Anyways, the book is very in depth and should make you look at your greyhound with new eyes. I've had my brindle girl, Starry for only 5 months now and she is truly a sweetie."},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"This book offers a simple well illustrated history of the greyhound, and has helped to understand and appreciate the nobility of my 2 rescued greyhounds"},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"The more involved I became with greyhounds, the more I found them intriguing and felt driven to learn more about them, which was why I was happy when I came across this book.

I certainly gained knowledge with every page and definetely would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"Greyhounds have been around for thousands of years and Ms. Branigan covers their history very well. More conversational than scholarly, this is easily read and can used as a ready reference to pick and choose any particular portion of the greyhounds long and varied story, The author clearly has an affection for the breed that shows throughout. If you have greyhounds or want to know more about these wonderful companions, this volume is one you should have."},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"This book has lots of interesting anecdotes regarding greyhounds and greyhound-like dogs throughout history. To enjoy it the most, the reader should be a greyhound enthusiast, a history enthusiast, or both. When we lived in Baltimore, the book inspired me to look in the Walters Museum for ancient vases and other artworks to find greyhounds, which was a lot of fun.This book is where I got the factoid that greyhounds' feet are shaped similarly to rabbits' feet. I have often used that information at meet-and-greets as part of the answer when people ask what makes greyhounds run so fast.The author has a few places where she gets a little heavy-handed, like in her chapter about greyhounds in the New World, where she tells a story to illustrate her stance against using animals in experimental testing. Also, just so you know, there are people who would disagree with some of the history she presents, claiming that the original middle eastern sighthounds were different from the dogs we call greyhounds.Overall, however, the book is informative and fun. Chapters cover the characteristics of the greyhound, greyhounds in history in various regions and time periods, greyhounds in the show ring, coursing, racing, and greyhounds as companions. Included are lots of pictures (some color), a number of which are unusual, such as the one of a monkey riding on a greyhound's back. She obviously did some research to find all of the historical references. I love all the photos of dogs and artwork.It's just under 200 pages, so at around $20 it's not a cheap book, but for the right person it would be a good choice."},{"Title":"The Reign of the Greyhound","review":"This outstanding book gives a thorough history of the Greyhound.

They are dearly missed."},{"Title":"Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (Volume IV, Historical Sketches, Letters R through S)","review":"I was researching the heroic story of the loss of the USS Aaron Ward (sunk off the Solomon Islands towards the end of WW2) when I came across this item advertised on one of the Amazon websites. Unaware I was looking at an eight-volume set of books, I baulked at the price and decided to search on. Nevertheless, I kept coming back to this item and decided to take a closer look. I am so glad I did.Set out in alphabetical order and written without fear or favour, the United States Department of Defence have provided one of the most important research tools of modern years and I congratulate them for an excellent job of work. The entry for each ship commences with a note about the origin of the name. For example, the USS Missouri is named after an American state - enough said. The Aaron Ward, however, was named after Admiral Aaron Ward and that particular section commences with a most reasonable biography of the man.Each ship to bear a particular name is covered in varying degrees of detail - largely dependant on what historical information was available to the compilers. Famous ships and, naturally, more recent vessels, get excellent coverage although it must be said that if the information was available on those much older vessels, then their full story is told here.Watch out for single volumes being sold separately - when you are either looking for a complete set or perhaps a different volume.Altogether, one of the best additions to my library for a very long time.NM"},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears and the Prize Pumpkin","review":"It's Thanksgiving again, and time for the Pumpkin Contest!!!

The whole reason behind Thanksgiving (taking one day out of the year to give thanks to God for all the blessing we have in our lives), just like Christmas, Halloween, and most other holidays is often lost in the superficialities of the day, e.g. parades and football games.Those petty events are summed up in THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE PRIZE PUMPKIN as Papa Bear gets caught up in growing the biggest pumpkin in Bear Country for a pumpkin contest the weekend before Thanksgiving. In the process, Papa totally forgets the true meaning of the holiday, but is reminded at the end by Mama and Sister Bear.The book is a nice little story. However, for a book about Thanksgiving, it doesn't talk about giving thanks enough."},{"Title":"The Triumph of Eve & Other Subversive Bible Tales","review":"Mr. Biers - Ariel is my favorite English teacher I've had.

An author of Kosinski's stature, a book of this import, deserves better."},{"Title":"Steps","review":"A review by Dr. Joseph SugliaJerzy Kosinski did not write his books alone. His authorship has long since been discredited as fraudulent; all of the writings to which he gave his signature have been dismissed as the trickery of a con artist. Indeed, this very signature preempts any of \\"Kosinski's books\\" from being taken seriously. What Kosinski once fobbed off as his own creation is now surrounded by an embarrassed silence. One smirks bemusedly at these works as the artifacts of an interesting life.What is one to make of the fact, then, that Steps, a novel that bears Kosinski's name and yet was not composed in his own language, is one of the most intensely powerful novels of the twentieth century?The subject of Steps undergoes a continual metamorphosis throughout its pages. At the beginning of each of the forty-six episodes into which the book is divided, an \\"older\\" self is negated (not cancelled out entirely, but preserved in the memory of the work) and a \\"new\\" one forms and takes its place. Each self belongs to a \\"present\\" instant that is disconnected from the series of instants that precede it, each of which is itself displaced from history. If a unified authorial consciousness embraces each transformation, holding together the death and reformation of the subject in each instance, this can only be discerned in the articulation of the individual episodes. And if a link binds the episodes together (the \\"steps\\" of the title), it is the guiding thread of submission and domination, the only two forms of relationship of which the subject is capable. The author, Jerzy Kosinski was surely mistaken (or was otherwise disingenuous and willfully misleading) when he claimed in an interview that the book progresses from \\"the formed mind of the protagonist (in the beginning of the novel) when he sees himself as a unique manipulator of others, to the stage (at the novel's end) when he realizes that he is nothing but a composite of various steps of culture.\\" To speak of a \\"progression\\" in any strict sense would be inaccurate. It is the case that the narrator manipulates a young girl who is dazzled by the narrator's credit cards at the very beginning, but there are no traces of a gradual progression from the mind of a sovereign subject who deploys a dominant culture for his own purposes to one who recognizes his subjection to that culture. On many occasions throughout the work long before its denouement, he is a plaything given over to powers that infinitely surpass his own, exposed to the whims of the uncontrollable, without a barrier to shield him from the forces that invade him.The seductiveness of Steps resides in its power to lead the reader astray, away from the world to which s/he has grown accustomed and into a fictional space from which there is no easy escape. However oppressive its horror becomes, it is difficult to tear one's eyes from this book. Literary analysis may engage with the book's meaning, but will necessarily fail to adequate the spell that it casts over the reader. Each \\"step\\" is macabre and unsettling in its violence. In one episode, the subject is a farm hand at the mercy of peasants who spit on him for their amusement [II, 2]. He seeks revenge by inserting discarded fishhooks into morsels of bread, which he feeds to the children of those who torture him. The only way to invert the existing hierarchy, he seems to feel, is to become an oppressor oneself: oppression generates oppression in the way that fire generates fire. A group of peasants, in another \\"step,\\" gapes at a performance in which a young girl is violated by an animal [I, 4]. It is uncertain, the narrator tells us dryly, whether her screams indicate that she is actually suffering or whether she is merely playing to the audience. The extent to which the girl is a victim or a manipulator remains undetermined. In another episode, a nurse passively endures the amorous advances of the narrator, now a photographer, who longs for sexual contact with her in order to distinguish himself as much as possible from the seemingly non-human inmates of a senior citizen's home whom he has been photographing [III, 1]. When the narrator enters uninvited into the nurse's apartment, he finds her coupling with a simian creature who, ambiguously, is later described as \\"human.\\" The narrator, in another episode, is an office worker whose lover is unaware that she is his lover [V, 5]. The narrator plots with a friend to take possession of her. The woman submits entirely to the friend's will and agrees to allow herself to be possessed by a stranger while blindfolded. Now the narrator can dispose of her sightless body as he wishes: a relationship that is emblematic of all of the relationships portrayed in Steps. Despite her complete availability, his desire remains frustrated. Nothing about her is concealed, but her nudity is itself a form of concealment. At another moment, narrator is on a jury [V 3]. The defendant explains his deed in the most ordinary terms without ever attempting to justify his behavior. A fictive identification is afforded between the members of the jury and the \\"executioner\\": they visualize themselves in the act of killing, but cannot project themselves into the mind of the victim who is in the act of being killed. The agony of the victim is lost to vision altogether. The narrator, in another episode, becomes the powerless spectator of his girlfriend's rape [III, 3]. Afterward, their relationship changes. He can now only represent her to himself as one who has been violated and who is worthy of violation: her rape comes to define her. He visualizes her as a kind of crustacean or mollusk emerging from her shell. The conclusion of the episode follows an implacable logic: under false pretenses, the narrator offers his girlfriend to the rowdy guests at a party, who proceed to have their way with her. Her pearl necklace, a gift from the narrator, scatters to the floor like so many iridescent seeds (a somberly beautiful passage that gives the lie to Kosinski's own self-interpretive remark that Steps eschews figurative language). The architect of an orchestrated violation, the narrator departs without witnessing the inescapable result of his designs. Such a summary can only imperfectly approximate the grotesque horror of this book.One may wonder whether there is a point to such an uninterrupted current of phantasmagoric images. The reader may be invited to take delight in the extremity of its descriptions: such would nurture one's suspicion that Steps is a purely nihilistic work. What we find in each instance is a relationship between one who terrorizes and oppresses or who sympathizes with terror and oppression (this is often, but not always, the narrator) and one who surrenders, voluntarily or otherwise, to the will of the oppressor. By describing such scenes of exploitation and persecution in a neutral manner, the book seems to offer no moral transcendence. Such an interpretation, however, would ignore the book's moral center.The book's ethical dimension first becomes apparent in an italicized transitional episode in which the protagonist tells his lover of an architect who designed plans for a concentration camp, the main purpose of which, the narrator explains, was \\"hygiene\\" [IV, 1]. Genocide was for those responsible indistinguishable from the extermination of vermin: \\"Rats have to be removed. We exterminate them, but this has nothing to do with our attitudes toward cats, dogs, or any other animal. Rats aren't murdered-we get rid of them; or, to use a better word, they are eliminated; this act of elimination is empty of all meaning.\\" This passage in particular casts light on the \\"theme\\" of dehumanization that runs pervasively throughout the book. In Steps, the other person is reduced to the status of a thing. To make of the other human being a thing: such is sadism. Only by representing those to be murdered as vermin (as things to be exterminated) is mass murder possible. It is no accident, from this perspective, that the narrator imagines himself felling trees when he obeys an order to slit his victim's throat toward the end of the book: it is the only way that he can suppress the nausea that wells up within him [VIII, 3]. Each human being is irreplaceable, and the death of a person is, therefore, an irrecoverable loss. By forgetting this, by turning the other human being into a mere object, one is able to dutifully \\"obey orders\\" to kill without the intrusion of moral consciousness. Steps aims at disgusting the reader by showing him/her the obscene consequences of objectification. From this perspective, Steps is a profoundly moral book.The center of Steps may serve as a counter-balance to the parade of scenes of horror and degradation that constitute it. However, this center does not govern the totality of its operations. A tonality of evil informs these poisonous pages; in terms of its sheer cruelty, the work could only be compared to the writings of Lautr&eacute;amont and Sade. Although one can point to its moral character from the passages cited above, the book could also be determined as a willfully perverse affirmation of simulation, falsehood, and metamorphosis that suspends the dimension of the ethical altogether. The subject ceaselessly yearns to exteriorize himself, to become part of an exterior space in which he would become entirely other-than-himself. It is a space in which he would be unencumbered by all forms of ethical responsibility: \\"If I could become one of them, if I could only part with my language, my manner, my belongings\\" [VII, 1].Dr. Joseph Suglia"},{"Title":"Steps","review":"Although \\"Steps\\" defiantly lacks a narrative thread, it is a rich little book that provokes and amuses. Highly readable, it has a force and sharpness of focus to it that is undeniable. The terse, detached vignettes build what you might call a unifying vibe, if not an altogether cohesive story. This book is not for everyone, but it's an interesting study of the loose novel form and of writing in general."},{"Title":"Steps","review":"This unstructured novel filled with graphic violence and sex, for all its salacious material, does little to either titillate or instruct the reader with any moral or aesthetic lesson. Quite the opposite, Steps is wholly amoral. This would be fine, if the writing had some scintillating quality; if the characters were richly drawn; if the flow of the narrative was swift, effective, tense. But this novel has none of these things. It seems difficult to believe, based on Steps, the Kosinski was once the flavor of the month, and a National Book Award winner."},{"Title":"Steps","review":"A magnificent achievement! Oddly touching psychology and searing brutality work together to create a portrait of a man who for all mankind represents how multifaceted we can become in the face of wide ranging experience. Made me hungry to experience new and exotic emotions and experiences. An eternal masterpiece which demands re-reading."},{"Title":"Steps","review":"My agent, Ned Hamson, knowing I was writing an unconventional novel of my experience in South Africa as a young American executive (GREEN ISLAND IN A BLACK SEA) during apartheid, suggested I read STEPS.Kosinski and I were born in the same year at opposite ends of the bloody Second World War. He never had time for innocence while I was an American boy held safely in her bosom in Middle America. All that was shattered for me when I went to South Africa as a young executive to form a new chemical company in 1968, the year before Kosinski won the National Book Award for STEPS.I not only read this novel and his other works of fiction, but also James Park Sloan's biography, JERZY KOSINSKI.STEPS and other Kosinski fiction demonstrate a mind that has been shattered by people he admires and people he finds out to be both brutal and brutish. THE PAINTED BIRD is an unexpurgated version of reality as a bookend to Alan Paton's TOO LATE THE PHALAROPE. Both authors deal with the inhumanity of man to man, but Kosinski chooses to walk the tightrope of despair and psychosexual fantasy.Kosinski and I are both trained social scientists and published authors in that discipline. He went to one of the most prestigious universities in the country (Columbia) and had difficulty with his faculty advisers and never acquired his Ph.D. I had similar problems only I found my way from land grant institutions (Iowa, and University of South Florida) to safe haven in the university system of the future, writing my dissertation and defense for Walden University, a fully accredited university but not yet prestigious in the same sense as the Ivy League.STEPS is a triumph of mind over matter and soul over eternity, a book that will stay with you the way Sherwood Anderson's WINESBURG, OHIO does which was written for an earlier generation. Kosinski saw life naked, undisguised, and as Joseph Campbell might add, a time that never rose above its sexual organs or its lust for power and pleasure.STEPS is concise, anecdotal and experimental the way James Joyce's ULYSSES was. The anecdotes are connected by style, mood, and tone that bite the psyche as if it had teeth. You know the work is art because the fragments hold together like an illuminating collage.STEPS shows an intensely grim world characterized by brutality, exploitation, and calloused indifference. The impact is like a nightmare where violence breeds only more violence, and the protagonist is lost in the maze of emotion with no way out.Many of the incidents in STEPS depict sexual exploitation. It is the predator-prey dance where the narrator exploits a woman, but he himself becomes the victim. In one instance, the narrator, an archeological student stranded without money on an island, collapses from hunger. Two fat old women feed him and then assault him sexually.Among the scenes of perversion, many include accounts of sexual pleasure being derived from inflicting or witnessing pain. Sociological studies of Theodore Adorno (Authoritarian Personality) and Erich Fromm (The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness) come to mind to confirm Kosinski's thesis.STEPS captures the whirling dervish of postmodern society with no leavening with virtue. Most of the episodes present actions of lust, greed, brutality, and corruption without mitigating circumstances, a little like watching the nightly news on television.STEPS could be viewed as a series of 'dirty' anecdotes. The reality it portrays is the vicious and perverted side of life debased from human nature.STEPS suggest narcissistic disassociation of a single person, or perhaps a series of people. That is the subtle strength of its fragmentation and a narrator who is never identified, leaving open the possibility that different narrators are functioning in the various episodes. In any case, regardless of the reader's reaction, the concrete style and raw intensity of the actions are not likely to be quickly dismissed from the mind of the reader.To give you a sense of the fickle nature of publishing, 21-pages of STEPS was sent to its original publisher and several others six years after it had won the National Book Award. All turned it down. In 1981, the entire text of STEPS was sent to several literary agents and was turned down again by everyone. Kosinski committed suicide in 1991 at the age of 57, hounded by detractors, none of whom recognized his genius. If you are a writer, take note and persist."},{"Title":"Steps","review":"In 1969, the well-known writer Jerzy Kosinski published a novel, Steps, which won the NationalBook Award. In 1975, a freelance writer named Chuck Ross was convinced that unknown writersjust didn't have a chance to have a novel accepted. To test his theory, Ross typed out the firsttwenty-one pages of Steps and sent them out to four publishers, using the pseudonym &quot;ErikDemos.&quot; All four rejected the sample. In 1977, Ross typed out the entire book and, again using thename &quot;Erik Demos,&quot; sent it to ten publishers and thirteen literary agents. One of the publishers wasRandom House, which had originally published Steps in 1969. The manuscript was neitherrecognized nor accepted by any publishers or literary agents, including Random House, which useda form rejection letter. That made twenty-seven rejections for a book that had won an importantliterary prize!-Gloria T. Delamar, Getting Rejected? Feeling Dejected? (Philadelphia Writers&iacute; Conference, Inc.)Upon reading the novel, the 70's editors appear to have made the better decision : not to publish. The book is little more than a catalogue of one man's often violent sexual fantasies. I know, I know, it's supposed to be some kind of fable about how the brutality of modern life is manifested in this one victim's sex life. However, loathe as I am to defend modernity, I don't think you can blame totalitarian government, criminal violence and the other social pathologies of the 20th Century for your need to objectify your menagerie of lovers. Here is a chilling statement from the book, one that nicely sums up much of the sexual revolution :[B]eyond you and me together, I see myself in our love-making. It is this vision of myself as yourlover I wish to retain and make more real.Okay, so you can argue that this is the essential point Kosinski's trying to make, and I do nearly find it compelling. But, as I mentioned in my review of Painted Bird, he is just too fascinated by scenes of rape and other forms of degradation (here he adds bestiality) for the reader to accept that they are integral to the plot. Instead, the reader gets the unsettling feeling that the author is offering a too revealing glimpse of his own warped obsessions.I don't know about anyone else, but I can think of nothing less interesting than reading about another person's disturbed, and therefore disturbing, sexual predilections. I have enough difficulty handling my own, admittedly odd, passion for Margaret Thatcher, that Iron Lady of my fevered dreams...GRADE : D"},{"Title":"Steps","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I had to give up in the end.

Remember the admonishment, &quot;You are what you eat?&quot; It could also be said that we are what we read.

This is a violent, darkly sexual, experimental novel split into a series of extremely short vignettes connected by story but more importantly by theme.I loved this book."},{"Title":"Steps","review":"This book is a masterpiece in the weighted sense of the word. Notice the two reviews on the main page which were negative:\\"just a bit too much for me\\"\\"Some imaginations are almost too much, even for me\\"Maybe for you two it is too much. But I think that if this book is too much, then the world is too much, and reading serious books is not for the weary, for those for whom the world is too much. I'm including great but much more timid books--I don't think that you can grasp the greatness, the concept of, let's say, George Eliot, and then justly avoid fiction like this because 'it is too much.' Kosinski's understanding of the world reveals a side many people, especially those whose idea of \\"what the world is like\\" is as cushioned as it is for most of us in America, wish did not exist. The book is really about power. It is present literally everywhere, it cannot be ignored, and in each power equation there is someone on both sides. But no, I'm wrong to say that it cannot be ignored, and a great many modern lives are focused on doing just that. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean we should not understand it and see it in action.These things happen everyday in the world. They happened to happen to this narrator. And this narrator happened to write his experience down into a solipsistic fragmentary masterpiece which portrays his battle with being a single human, a solipsistic human, in a world of other solipsists.What I haven't mentioned so far is that this 149 page book is the most exciting and fun read I've had in a long, long time. It is pure fun. You won't be able to put it down.

If art is, in part, the dance between artist and audience, then Steps is art in its highest form. I found myself dancing & reacting in ways I wish I hadn't; found myself physically aroused by portions of the text that I found intellectually / psychologically repugnant. That's a neat trick, Kosinski.In spare prose, the author takes his breathless reader (think of how your oxygen intake changed while watching 'Panic Room') on a \\"depraved\\" journey into the mind / experiences of his protagonist. The scenes that are depicted would be described by a good buddy of mind as \\"filthy\\" -- and that they are. Bestiality, rape, exploitation, and beyond. What I found most intriguing about this text, from a historical / sociological / anthropological perspective is that it was written decades ago. Far from the busy streets of NYC where the tranny hos walk amongst us, far from the prevalent teenage-flesh-peddling of 2005. The fact that humans are humans are humans are animals, in all of our glorious base desires and yes, just plain filth, was the most satisfying revelation of all.It is an excellent piece of art, and I can't believe I let it sit untouched on my bookshelf for six years after picking it up from a used bookstore in New Haven.

Indeed, someone who wants to find accurate, thorough material on the Rom (especially in the US) with atleast a modicum of objectivity, is probably frustrated by the plentitude of such romantic Gypsy books. Sutherland's book, which has been called &quot;techno-babble,&quot; is in fact what serious researchers would call an &quot;ethnography&quot;-- an amazing modern invention (however dry), that if it existed years ago, so much romantic crap about the Rom wouldn't have been accepted in print and thus Gypsies everywhere would probably be less oppressed by other's damaging notions. There are too few real ethnographies on the Rom in the English language, and anyone interested in learning about the Rom population in the US will probably begin their research with this book. It's also important to note that (as the necessity of any ethnography that desires to be somewhat thorough) only a specific group is dealt with in the book, and generalizations about all Rom in the US would be difficult."},{"Title":"Gypsies: The Hidden Americans","review":"If you are seeking an exciting, and completely false, account of the Roma in America(such as the reviewer above apparently is), then this is not the book for you.

The author, perhaps meaning no offence, asserts the view that some Roma hold, which is that only Kalderash and Machwaya are \\"true Gypsies\\", which is a disservice to many American Gypsies who are Sinti-Manouche, Romanichal, Gitano, Kale, etc. All of who, along with the Roma, are Rromani. Like so many books about Gypsies written by gaje, the book seems to try to uphold the stereotypes about us and paints a picture of simple, uneducated people.

It is the story of the prophet Elijah, nephew of St. Peter and friend of Jesus.The child Elijah and his widowed mother work hard to make ends meet. Elijah sells the bread his mother bakes and fishes for their supper. His cousin, whose father is St. Peter, talks about the Teacher/Rabbi, the man named Jesus who talks of love and fairness. Elijah is excited and begs his mother to let him hear the Rabbi Jesus speaks. Her usual response is that if Jesus is who He claims to be, no gift is too small. Before she lets him join his cousin to hear Jesus, he has to clean their home and help her with the household chores. Once he finishes his chores, he joins his cousin, his Uncle Peter and others to hear Jesus.Saddened by the dearth of food and shelter to offer Jesus, Elijah asks his mother what they can give this gentle teacher. She tells him yet again that no gift is small to Jesus. Pondering this, Elijah offers Jesus the basket of fish he caught that morning. Jesus thanks him and says how lucky it was the boy caught them because the crowd had grown in number and the people were hungry. They just might like some fish.Reaching into the basket, Jesus manages to feed the crowd a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fish. Elijah, Peter, and the others watch with amazed delight. That night, Elijah talks about Jesus in great length to his cousin and mother. Elijah's mother smiled and imparted her message yet again that no gift is small to Jesus.This is such an outstanding book with first rate illustrations.

He watched, amazed, to see what Jesus did with his gift!Another reason for this book being a favorite of mine is that the drawings are beautiful. There is one in particular which shows a different view of Christ. The desciple Peter is standing in his boat on the shore. Jesus is sitting on the edge of his boat. Peter is obviously telling a \\"fish story\\" (a true one) and gesturing with his arms to explain the miraculous catch! And, Jesus is shown smiling, almost laughing, really enjoying Peter's telling of the story. The young boy is also in the scene, taking in all in, his eyes meeting those of Jesus. It's all in one moment, and so artistically portrayed! It's a chance to see Jesus expressing joy!"},{"Title":"Small Gifts in God's Hands","review":"The book arrived in pristine condition!

It had just the right balance of pictures and writing. Everything was wonderfully organized and written. Definitely a Corvette-lovers' book. I love it!"},{"Title":"Corvettes - The Cars that Created the Legend","review":"A wonderful book on The Corvette,There is a Hardcover from 1988 with the 1988 35th anniversary Edition Corvette and a 1953 Corvette on the cover,then there is this version which I have,a Red Solid-Axle Corvette on the cover and a Red Callaway Car on the back,this version is from 2004 and is Softcover(so careful when ordering soft and hardcover).The Softcover version does not mention it is revised but seems slightly revised with Callaway Cars and Something I have not seen in any other Corvette Books,Color photos of 90's Lister-Bodied Corvettes,not to be confused with Lister of the 50's which were Jag,Bristol and Mg and Corvette/Chevy Powered(there are small black and white photos of them in here also).Another Plus for me from this book besides the Great writing and the Color Photography,is the Famous 1959 Racing Champion MarkIII Purple People Eater Corvette #1 of Nickey Chevrolet/Jim Jeffords,The Restored #10 Grand Sport Corvette Roadster of 66'Sebring,and another Favorite is the Chapter on The Corvette Challenge Cars of 1988-1989 and the last chapter which sadly is all black and white,and is called \\"A Designer's Sketchbook which has some photos of Famous Concepts such as The Mako Shark I and MakoShark II/Manta Ray,AstroII,and sadly only one photo(rear shot) of the Astro I,as well as photos of the Controversial Stingray III of the 90's.This book will not disappoint the Corvette Fan."},{"Title":"Early Auden: 2","review":"This is the first of two books by the same author (see Later Auden)and I'd recommend buying them together as they are terrific accounts which tell Auden's story (mostly) in terms of his poetry. (John Fuller's commentary (on the poetry) augments these very well).(H. Carpenter for the best intro bio.)Why I liked these books is that they don't expose a bias regarding Auden's life (Auden tends/ed to divide critics) and the poetry (always the first casualty) isn't neglected. There's too much of value in these books to try and paraphrase them but rest assured they will not disappoint. As usual though, the whole controversy over the attitude of certain critics (Jarrell/Leavis/Eagleton) is passed over. Still, really useful. I'd say the same for the Collected Prose, the Dyer's Hand, Forewords & Afterwords. Hendon is a bit spotty but maybe useful (and affordable) for undergrads, while the Sea & The Mirror is rather specialised (Art & Christianity), maybe to be tackled later.Early and Late Auden are not so much 'academic' works as they are real portraits by someone close to the work, the writer and his times, so there isn't that distance you sometimes feel where authors set out \\"to do Auden\\". Great value. Will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Matrix Derivatives (Lecture Notes in Statistics Series, Vol 2)","review":"I have read a number of texts on matrix differentiation, and this one ranks as my favorite. Its key strength is its completeness. In fact, it has sections entitled &quot;Old Results&quot;, which contain the more standard material on Kronecker products and the like, and one entitled &quot;New Results&quot; which contain nice results about any type of tensor contraction described in a matrix format.Its drawback is that it needs to be rewritten using Latex or some other standard typesetting language. The typesetting is a bit off-putting."},{"Title":"The Shy Child: A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood","review":"This fine reprinting (by Malor Books) rescues &quot;The Shy Child&quot; for the many readers who contacted me about its availabity after it was put out of print by a previous publisher (in a cost-cutting institutional move). This book follows up on my earlier popular work, &quot;Shyness: What it is, What to do about it.&quot; Whereas the research foundation, exercises, and advice I gave there was based on young adults and those upward in age, this book completes the earlier parts of the life cycle, from college age down to preschoolers. The information and ideas in &quot;The Shy Child&quot; came from several years' worth of observations that I and my co-author, Shirley Radl, made in schools at every grade level, from preschool, elementary, middle, high, up to college, supplemented with interviews, research, and workshops with teachers, parents, and students. We try to convey in accessible prose what we have learned about the meaning of shyness in the lives of our children, and what ways the negative impact of shyness can be reduced, minimized, and overcome through a variety of wise strategies and simple tactics. But we propose further that new efforts be directed at preventing shyness from taking hold of the child's life, some of which involve awareness of how parents, teachers, and institutions contribute to the problem and what they can do differently to create prosocial alternatives that make every child a winner. The response of earlier readers has been very enthusiastic, some even reporting &quot;miracle&quot; changes in their shy children, as can be witnessed in the ABC-TV prize-winning video, &quot;The Pain of Shyness.&quot; My current concern is the steadily increasing prevalence of shyness in our society over the past decade from a 40% level of those reporting themselves to be currently, dispositionally shy to over 50% now. I think the technology revolution is contributing to this epidemic of shyness by making young people more socially passive and by substituting virtual social reality for the indispensable learning and engagement that comes from real world face-to-face reality. Making people our number one priority is a first step in a new agenda for combating the insidious inroads that electronic technology is and will be having on our interpersonal relationships. I hope you enjoy what you will learn in &quot;The Shy Child, share that knowledge with friends and relatives, and put into practice some of its recommendations.

My child is on the very extreme end of being shy, with some SID to make matters worse. Even so, I thought this book had enough helpful items to make the purchase worthwhile. I'd also like to say something about another reviewer's comment that the book doesn't mention Asperger's Syndrome. This reviewer thought it was a serious ommission on the author's part not to mention AS. However, in the author's defense, I think it should be noted that this book was originally written in 1982, well before most people/professionals became aware that there even was such as thing as Aspgerger's Syndrome. That didn't happen until the 1990's, ten years after this book was written."},{"Title":"The Shy Child: A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood","review":"This is a lucid, informative guide to shyness in children written by a distinguished scholar.

Parents, teachers, and clinicians will welcome the return of this classic volume."},{"Title":"The Shy Child: A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood","review":"I read with interest the comments made by so-called \\"reviewers.\\" I merely ordered the book in hopes of helping my sister-in-law to understand why her five-year-old granddaugter hides under the table rather than face or greet us when we visit. When she is finally coaxed by her grandparents to emerge, she exhibits inappropriate behavior -at least to us. I am searching for anything that may be helpful!I am highly incensed by some of the reviewers' remarks. Perhaps they did not take the time to read the jacket cover before purchase. It appears to me that the hostile/negative comments directed at the author are highly indicative of why he/she has a shy child: when is the child allowed to speak; and what form should it take so as not to offend/inflame the parent? Perhaps these parents are searching for the wrong books, and should examine their own priorities!"},{"Title":"The Shy Child: A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood","review":"Professor Philip Zimbardo has done it again! His The Shy Child offers great ideas and insight into shyness and its origins. He analyzes the development and shyness and its effects on youth. It is a great tool for parents and anyone interested in discovering how shyness affets children. I can't imagine an easier to read book that is chock full of the details Zimbardo has placed in this one. I strongly encourage everyone to purchase this book and read it...you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Shy Child: A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood","review":"I don't get the impression that the book blames the parents for shy children.

My dad got this for me before I went to college. When I read this book I was surprised what they found out about shyness. And there are different types of shyness.

But I still thought it was very helpful."},{"Title":"The Shy Child: A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood","review":"As a former shy child and currently somewhat shy adult, I found the shyness related issues Zimbardo and Radl write about extremely familiar. Their suggestions for how to transcend shyness and modify unhealthy behaviour (one's own and that of others) are refreshingly useful and practical. The one criticism I have is that issues of shyness for gay men and lesbian women are not addressed directly - but the book is so useful and direct in every other way that it should not be overlooked, even by those who aren't shy. It describes a world that too few find ways to immigrate from, and it tells you ways to cut through the red-tape."},{"Title":"The Shy Child: A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood","review":"According to this book, shyness is caused by &quot;a combination of feelings of low self-worth, labeling, and shame.&quot;I sought the book out because I have a seven year-old child who has been shy since forever. She does not adjust well to new situations. I believed that she would eventually grow out of it, but she hasn't, and it's now affecting her schoolwork. I was looking for a book that would help and give some real answers.This book focuses on people who became shy because of poor parenting, or some in-school incident that would turn any normal kid into a raving wall-flower. I am not that kind of parent. I shouldn't have to defend myself.Someone told me (after I bought the book) that there is something akin to a high form of autism that manifests itself as shyness [aka Asperger's Syndrome]. This is an inborn thing, not learned. But it is not addressed or even briefly mentioned in this book. There are other nervous system disorders, including, but not limited to, Anxiety Disorder and Social Phobia, that looks a lot like mere shyness, but again, no mention here. Apparently it's all my fault.If your child is exhibiting signs of shyness, and you don't see any external reasons why, then by all means, save your money, don't buy the book, talk to your doctor. Great care should be taken to help a child who is suffering. Because mental, behavioral, or emotional disorders can affect the way the child grows up. If that means they need medication, coupled with talk therapy, then good grief, what are we waiting for? I really looked to this book for some help, but only found unfounded guilt."},{"Title":"The Shy Child: A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood","review":"I have already reviewed this book, and explained that there is only blame for the parents and important adults in the child's life for being shy. Many, many people have emailed me, requesting more information about what other explanations there could be, because their children are not shy due to their environment of happy loving families. So this is an update to my original review.The book does not mention any treatable organic causes for apparent shyness in children, including but not limited to anxiety disorder, social phobia, and Asperger's Syndrome. None of these issues are discussed at all. This is a serious and inexcusable omission. All of them are treatable and controllable by medication and therapy. It seriously angers me that this book does nothing to address these concerns."},{"Title":"I Thee Bed... (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Big Apples Brides wedding planner Edie Benning knows that she has a chance to make it in the Big Apple if the Darden nuptials go off as planned. Edie would have her hands full just insuring nothing goes wrong under normal conditions, but hosting the wedding of the year, perhaps the decade means the paparazzi are out in full force. She keeps thanking God that her assistant is so good that is until her helper elopes with SOMETHING BORROWED permanently, someone else's intended groom.Still there must be a God watching over the beleaguered Edie as Jimmy Delaney persuades her to hire him to assist her with the Darden gala. Jimmy also charms his way into his boss' bed. He is terrific at both, but what will happen to their relationship when Edie learns her able assistant knows so much about photography because she has been sleeping with the enemy, a paparazzi.This fine contemporary romance contains fabulous lead characters and a terrific horde of secondary players especially the wedding crowds many from hell. The story line is fun to follow as Jimmy finds he wants a permanent job with the woman he loves, but knows trust issues will surface once she finds out what he does for a living. Although the heated boudoir relationship between Edie and Jimmy seems slightly artificial, fans will enjoy the latest work from the aptly named Jule McBride.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lady Luck's Map of Vegas: A Novel","review":"Lady Luck's Map of Vegas is one of those books that will stay with me for a long time. It made an impression - a beautiful story about India, a woman who must make a huge decision in her life when, at the age of 40, she ends up pregnant. Between a schizophrenic twin sister and a mother whose secrets fill the pages between India's thoughts, we are taken on a journey through New Mexico (a magical place whether in person or on paper when Barbara Samuel is writing about it) which is a reflection of an earlier journey when India and her sister Gypsy were children. Love is my favorite thing to read about, but this is not a romance novel. It's deeper and shinier and has a sharper, meatier edge to it. And it also has a warmth that wraps around you like a soft, thick afghan as you read each word, each page, each chapter.If this sounds mysterious it's because I want you to read this book and experience it yourself. All of Barbara Samuel's books have been incredible to me, and this will not disappoint those of you who are already fans. Those of you who haven't tried her yet, please do. If you're disappointed, let me know and I'll send you an email apology. I don't expect to be sending any at all."},{"Title":"Lady Luck's Map of Vegas: A Novel","review":"I'm always so impressed with Barbara Samuel's novels, and Lady Luck's Map of Vegas is no exception. Samuel, who lives in Colorado, writes about women in the western United States who may have had family problems, but resolve them, or find a way to live with them, by the end of the books. I checked out her website at www.barbarasamuel.com, and she has also written a number of romances, some under the name Ruth Wind. But her women's novels are the ones that impress me - No Place Like Home, A Piece of Heaven, The Goddesses of Kitchen Avenue, and, now Lady Luck's Map of Vegas.Forty-year-old India is a successful web designer with a large circle of friends. She also has an Irish lover that she sees monthly, Eldora, her widowed mother who can be demanding, and a schizophrenic twin sister who disappers into the unknown periodically. And, she's pregnant.When India's mother wants to take Route 66 from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas, she reluctantly agrees to accompany her, fleeing the truth and her own doubts about her pregnancy. As they hunt for Gypsy, India's sister, along the route, Eldora reaches into her own past to reveal secrets she has covered up about her life.Once again, Barbara Samuel has written of two women coming to terms with the results of their own actions. It's a strong, beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Lady Luck's Map of Vegas: A Novel","review":"This was the first Samuel book I've read and it was terrific! India and Gypsy are twins; one is schizophrenic and missing. Their mother, Eldora, asks India to take her to Las Vegas to find her.

Don't miss out on this novel!"},{"Title":"Lady Luck's Map of Vegas: A Novel","review":"This fast-paced novel takes mother and daughter, Eldora and India, down Route 66 in search of India's schizophrenic twin sister, Gypsy. India is not pleased to leave her work and long distance lover, Jack, to take her mother on a road trip down memory lane in her mother's cherished 1957 Thunderbird. But she promised her father before his death that she would take care of her mother, and so she agrees to the trip hoping that the time on the road will help her to reconcile issues in her own life and also to help her make the most important decision of her life. Eldora, who has been living with the regrets and mistakes she made many, many years ago, wants to make peace with one daughter as she searches for the other one. Eldora is faced with revealing her true self to India and in the process risks losing her daughter forever. Both India and Eldora each tell their own story as they travel the same fateful route they took several years ago and try to reconcile their past to their present and dare to hope for a future but ultimately discover that in life and love there are no guarantees.***** I thoroughly enjoyed Barbara Samuel's heartwarming story of a mother and daughter who both dare to risk their current tolerable relationship for a chance to really understand one another. The realness of these two characters makes the reader feel deeply connected with what both India and Eldora are facing. This novel needs to be a movie because India and Eldora's stories would be wonderful played out on the big screen. I highly recommend taking this real and endearing and ultimately hopeful journey with India and Eldora along Route 66. *****Reviewed by Barbara Stabler."},{"Title":"Lady Luck's Map of Vegas: A Novel","review":"This is a very fun read.

India enjoys her long distance love life when she and her beloved New York based magazine owner Jack Shea get together.Flaky Eldora wants to go on a pilgrimage to Las Vegas where she plans to reveal the truth about herself to her adult children, but first must find her other daughter Gypsy, an artist whose last postcard came from Tucuncari, New Mexico. India does not want to go, but feels obligated having vowed to her late father Don Redding she would take care of mom. Worse India senses her sibling; a schizophrenic is off her medicine and in trouble. Finally, she is pregnant, but has doubts about bringing a child into the world containing her gene pool. This pilgrimage will awaken India to what really matters in life are loving relationships.LADY LUCK'S MAP OF VEGAS is a complex family drama that mostly focuses on India and her relationships with her boyfriend, mother and sister, but to a lesser degree with her dad and between her mom and sib. Readers feel for India who fears commitment to include her concerns about allowing a newborn into this world. Though the reason for Eldora's obsession to venture forth is revealed late, readers who appreciate a strong poignant look at people with baggage in which there is no simplistic cure all elixir. Barbara Samuel provides an affecting tale that shakes the audience to its emotional core.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Science And Mormonism: Correlations, Conflicts and Conciliations","review":"This book has wonderful insights and explanations about truth and science and Mormonism.I wood recommend it and suggest that it is a must read for Mormons."},{"Title":"Science And Mormonism: Correlations, Conflicts and Conciliations","review":"This book arrived in a timely fashion and was as good as can be expected for such an old book.

When her dad dies Finnea is left all alone and must travel to Boston to meet the mother who deserted her nineteen years earlier. She is told that a fellow American named Matthew Hawthorne will accompany her safely home while she rides the dangerous African railway.When Finnea first meets Matthew he is rude, threatening and does his best to scare her senseless but fails. Matthew only wanted to be left alone and is amazed that Finnea doesn't flinch when she glances at his facial scar. Finnea sees it as &quot;character&quot; and isn't bothered at all by his blustery attitude. When the train derails Matthew spends a harried night watching over Finnea until help arrives. When Finnea wakes Matthew is gone before she can thank him and she believes she'll never see him again.A few months later Finnea is in Boston trying hard to fit in and learn all of the ridiculously stifling rules that a proper lady must follow when she meets up with Matthew again. He saves her from embarrassment during a dinner party and she decides then and there that he will teach her how to become a proper Boston lady. She does not care that he craves solitude. She is relentless and he soon caves in.What follows is a very satisfying romance between two tortured souls. And I do mean tortured. Both Finnea and Matthew have deep emotional wounds and many trials to overcome before they find their happy ever after. This is an angst filled read but it never became overwhelmingly depressing because of the gentle humor interwoven into the story.This book would have received five stars but I did feel a bit cheated because a pivotal scene that occurred in Africa was not included in the book - only alluded to throughout the story. This was very disappointing in an otherwise perfect book. Or maybe I'm just being greedy!"},{"Title":"Dove's Way","review":"I've not read this author before, but I was intrigued by the description so I took a chance. I'm glad I did. The book is amazing. It takes place in the opulent, but strict, Boston society of the 1890s, with a thread of Africa. In the back of the book there is an interview with the author that describes the book as part My Fair Lady and part Out of Africa, and I think this is a great description. It made me laugh. It made me cry. I hate for it to end."},{"Title":"Dove's Way","review":"Finnea Winslet was born in Boston, but it's only a faint memories and the stuff of her father's stories, as she's spent most of her life with him in the Congo. When her father passes away, she realizes it's time to go back to Boston and find the mother's love that she's missed all these years. On the train she meets Matthew Hawthorne, who the Africans call The Wild White Man with the Scar. Their meeting eventful but brief. When their paths unexpectedly cross again, it's at a dinner party where Finnea is at a loss for how to act--she knows none of the rules of Boston society, like which cutlery to use, how to greet people, how to eat certain foods, how to sit, how to walk, how to dress...Matthew feels something for Finnea, tho he doesn't know what or why. When she later badgers him to help her learn the how to be a lady he finally gives in--but he wonders if it can even be done and why she would want to change from who she is. DOVE'S WAY is the story of two wounded--both physically and emotionally--people drawn to each other but unwilling to suffer again the pain of loving. As Ms. Lee says in her the short interview at the back of the book (and how I love hearing tidbits like this from an author!) this novel is &quot;part MY FAIR LADY, part OUT OF AFRICA.&quot;I did have problems with this book, especially early on. I sometimes had difficulty believing people could be *so* cruel; both Boston society's reaction to Matthew and his scar (tho he was foul-tempered and scowled frequently) and Finnea's family in not trying to help her fit in and learn the manners and mores of Boston. I also would have liked to spend more time in Africa, but I know how publishers are afraid of romances not set in either America or Great Britain. However, DOVE'S WAY is a great choice when one is in the mood for a powerful, darkly compelling read.Kimberly Borrowdale, Under the Covers Book Reviews"},{"Title":"Dove's Way","review":"From the extraordinary first page of DOVE'S WAY to the satisfying last, Linda Francis Lee pulls the reader into a lush world of scandal, Boston society and two unforgetable lovers. This book is richly written and highly sensual.

A very clever idea on the publisher's part. I've never seen this done before.DOVE'S WAY is going on my keeper shelf, and I can't wait to read SWAN'S GRACE."},{"Title":"Dove's Way","review":"DOVE'S WAY, named after Matthew Hawthorne's Boston home, is a story about the price one pays in order to try to belong, and the soothing and transforming power of love in human relationships. Matthew and Finnea are social misfits for their time, thrown together in a piece of hopeful matchmaking by an African man of power and wisdom, then abruptly torn apart in a moment of unexpected violence. Both are physically and mentally scarred, both have secrets, and both are made for each other - but only Janji, the matchmaker, and Matthew's mother can see it right away. The story begins in Africa as Finnea prepares to return to late-19th century Boston to rejoin her mother and her brother, who long ago left Finnea and her father to the seductive wildness of Africa, for more civilized surroundings. We follow both Finnea and Matthew to proper Boston, where each tries mightily, and fails, to win the acceptance of a parent. The story unfolds as they struggle with how different they are from the rest of Bostonian society, how alike they are to each other, and their unwanted need and love for each other. Finnea manages to hold on to her secrets longer than does Matthew, and only with the unwitting help of their old African matchmaker, does she let go, making room in her life and her heart for Matthew - and his daughter Mary.I liked the way this story was told alternately from the male and female point of view. Scraps of Matthew's journal introduce the major parts of the book, giving a nice glimpse into his mind, but the narrative also gives him equal treatment. His daughter Mary is brilliantly written. This is a sweet, sensual novel, reported to be the first of a trilogy about the Hawthorne brothers of Boston. We see only glimpses of the other two brothers in this story, so there's plenty of unexplored territory to look forward to. This book reads easily, and my only regret is that now I'll have to wait a while until I can revisit the Hawthorne family again.

Back in his hometown lies his deceased spouse, his frightened daughter, and a terrible scandal. Here in Africa, Matthew has only his battered soul and healing body to deal with until the train wreck. Matthew saves the life of fellow passenger Finnea Winslet, which is his first step back to humanity.Several months later, following the death of her father Finnea arrives in Boston where her mother lives. Leticia is not a very maternal woman but she is a major player and mover in the upper crust of society. Though she has spent her entire life in Africa and barely remembers anything about her mother who fled that continent years ago, Finnea desperately wants to belong to her mother's social class. She struggles to adjust to the new demands on her, finally turning to her rescuer Matthew and asks him to tutor her so she can get along in society circles. As Matthew and Finnea become well acquainted with one another, they fall in love, but he vowed never again to become involved in a relationship where his partner would expect a marriage proposal.DOVE'S WAY is an entertaining, poignant historical romance that takes readers on an insider's look at high society in Boston's &quot;Gay Nineties.&quot; The story line soars because the 1890s come to life through the well-developed cast especially the &quot;naive&quot; Finnea. The lead couple is a warm duo even as his demon-drenched past threatens to end everything before it really begins. Fans of Americana romances with a touch of late nineteenth century Africa in it and a male lead who is angst laden will fully relish Linda Francis Lee's super tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dove's Way","review":"DOVE'S WAY is a wonderful book!

The book is a non-stop page turner, that will have the reader guessing who is telling the truth and who is not. The main character Matthew, is brillantly charming but has a hard time telling the truth to himself and others. He has a secret that only leds to more which in the end could cost him his relationship with his friends and even his brother. Matthew's trials and tribulations come to a conclusion when the people closest to him deliver their shocking secrets which asks the question, \\"Does everything happen for a reason, or are events just coincidental?\\"This book is a great summer read. First time writer Shannon Yarbrough delivers a story of intrigue that you just can not stop reading. I look forward to future books by him, which I can only guess will be as good as his debut novel."},{"Title":"The Other Side of What","review":"This book is Shannon Yarbrough's first novel. I'd been eager to read it, since I loved both \\"Stealing Wishes\\" and \\"Are You Sitting Down?\\"The book is a charming tale of friendship, of self-acceptance, of learning to love and trust in the gay community, where a false sense of image and lies are often socially acceptable. Matthew moves to Memphis to find himself as a gay man, but what's interesting about the novel is that it draws back from plunging him into a full-blown love affair. The two characters who seem to be set up as love interests, drug dealer Vance, who's a bit of a social pariah, and artistic and attractive Seth, who Matthew sets his heart on, have different roles to play in Matthew's life than he originally casts them in.Matthew gets an apartment in Midtown and explores Red Square, a funky gay dive, where he comes across all the different strata of gay life. It's his chance to try to find his true self, but the characters he bumps into are equally in a state of flux--not evolved, glib, or pushing intimacy away. What Matthew has going for him is a longing for friendship rather than a need to exploit others, and a loving bond with his brother Ethan, also gay, who is away at a boarding school for the deaf and mute. It's actually Ethan who becomes a role model for Matthew, teaching him about strength.Ultimately, although I was charmed by the openness and candor of Yarbrough's writing, I sensed a weakness in the structure of the novel, and the characters did not linger with me as the characters in his other two books have done. However, not many books out there treat the problems and yearnings of gay men in their 20s this sympathetically and nonglamorously. And the backdrop of Memphis is remarkably well drawn, as the place where Matthew first starts to form relationships and begin to shape his own future. A place that holds him safe while he finds out who he is."},{"Title":"The Other Side of What","review":"This is a must read for the summer. The book is cleverly written and the reader is constantly guessing himself and the characters in the book. The main character has a secret but soon learns that everyone close to him has a secret as well. This book will you keep you up late at night until the very end. This is the first book written by Shannon Yarbrough and I for one look forward to reading many more to come."},{"Title":"The Other Side of What","review":"\\"The Other Side of What\\" opened my eyes to what I never thought I'd find--good gay fiction. So many gay authors attempt to (and usually successfully do) use sex to sell their books, disregarding the fact that many gays want to read good fiction that involves gay characters. Yarbrough magnificently achieves this with a moving story about fate, friendship, love and the hauntings of the past. Read this book if you're tired of the same sex-driven plots mired with tedious, predictable pretenses. Thanks to Yarbrough for bringing someone back to the fold."},{"Title":"The Other Side of What","review":"I really enjoyed this read that centers around the complex knot of emotions and experiences that go along with leaving home, discovering sexuality and the adventure of early adult self-discovery. I read it in one sitting and you probably will too..its compelling and suspenseful. I especially love how the book kept me guessing as to what's real and what's imagination. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of his novels."},{"Title":"The Other Side of What","review":"I've always enjoyed Shannon's writing and I saved his first book for last. For me the sign of a good book is how enthused I am to get back to it after I've had to put it down. I rapidly consumed this one (I think I read it in three days) so you know it was a good one! It was fun for me to see Shannon's first steps as an author. In this book were all of the traits I love including beautiful descriptions and the shifting landscape of human emotion. Yes, it had a few more graphic depictions of gay physicality than his later work, but I didn't find any of it over the top and I thought it was all important to the story. In fact, I found \\"The Other Side of What\\" to be a fascinating glimpse into a world I don't know with some insight into the gay club scene and some of the back stories of the characters we find there. Like the Mississippi river that plays a part in this story, it seems to be moving slowly until you read the last page and realize just how far you've come caught in its powerful current."},{"Title":"The Other Side of What","review":"this is a nice little coming out story; the characters are well drawn and the narrative moves well. there's a small twist at the end - not unpredictable - but the story is more a character study than an event-led novel. the ultimate message is that we each have to make our own decisions on the people we choose to surround ourselves with, rather than taking the opinions of others on face-value; it's a good lesson and the book is well written and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Other Side of What","review":"Shannon Yarbrough's first novel The Other Side of What, a languid coming-of-age story with vivid characters and memorable descriptions of its Memphis setting, mimics the process of growing up that it describes, becoming more confident as its story progresses. Ultimately, though, like its narrator, it clings to a naivete that doesn't quite allow it to mature.The novel begins as the gay narrator Matthew moves from a small Tennessee backwater to Memphis, the metropolis of his youth, and his search for love in his new home forms the meat of the story. Through the course of several deftly described romantic relationships of increasing seriousness, Matthew maintains a personal detachment from his new friends and lovers, keeping key elements of his past and identity hidden--partly out of embarrassment about his hicks-in-the-sticks family and partly in an effort to shape his friends' perceptions of his still-developing new persona. The Other Side of What explores the emotional impact of Matthew's secrets, both on himself and the people around him, who all have secrets of their own. In Yarbrough's story, the human heart is the ultimate secret, and the struggle to reveal the heart's secrets is the whole meaning of human relationships. Though the content of the story is not religious, its structure follows a classic Original Sin thesis: we all have secrets because we're human, and to the extent that we can unburden ourselves of those secrets and live honestly, we achieve redemption and become worthy of love.The Other Side of What gains its strength from a combination of glibness and meditative reflection. The matter-of-fact debauchery of Matthew's introduction to the Memphis gay scene, which is also his introduction to the Memphis drug scene, adds grit to Matthew's otherwise ingenuous, naive and self-deprecating narration. The colorful characters he meets as he navigates and then rejects the drug sub-culture remain friends throughout, and a spitfire art dealer named Zoe befriends Matthew and becomes his confidant. Through sharp dialogue, Matthew's relationships develop intimacy and snappy camaraderie, and the three intersecting secrets that weave together Mathew's lover Seth, his brother Ethan, and his friends Jacob and Vance illustrate common, even archetypal tendencies that we all share and that subvert our attempts to fully trust each other.However, the novel itself suffers from an inability to be completely honest with the reader, so that its story remains unredeemed and its narrator doesn't fully earn our trust. This is especially true of the story's climax, when the novel changes narrators suddenly and inexplicably, casting doubt on earlier elements in the story. This narrative waffling is unfortunate because of the charm of the narrator and story up until that point, and because of the potentially explosive conclusion that the story shies away from, involving a love triangle, buried family secrets and the kind of gothic horror found almost nowhere else but in Southern fiction.Yarbrough's descriptions of a snowy Memphis, his clever mistaken-identities plot, and his tender handling of the first blush of romance between Matthew and Seth are all admirable and recommend the novel, but these virtues are mixed with an ending that settles for the comic instead of exploring the deeper emotional complexities of its plot and that becomes confused in its execution as a result. This promising first novel points toward the development of Yarbrough's more mature later novel Stealing Wishes."},{"Title":"The Other Side of What","review":"This unfortunate effort by Shannon L. Yarbrough fails to rise above adolescent obsession with sexual identity.The protagonist, Matthew, is uninteresting and unconvincing. One hopes -- and hopes again -- that this character might come alive. He does not.The book is not helped by the piling on of southern clich&eacute;s. No matter how hard the author tries to evoke place with these trite references, there is no covering over the shallowness of the characters and their failure to engage the reader.(I decided to give the book a generous two stars, because I suspect that it is an early effort from this writer. Perhaps future efforts will yield something more substantial.)"},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"In Athens, during the fifth century B.C., the Sophists were wise men. They were not philosophers, or scientists, they were itinerant teachers. Socrates was a moralist and a religious man. Plato was forty years younger than Socrates. THE APOLOGY and the CRITO are founded on fact, shaped by Plato's artistry, (he was a poet, also).Socrates was indicted for impiety. A public action was brought against him as a menace to society. Orators and poets disliked Socrates's influence on the young. He asserted in THE APOLOGY that the true champion of justice must confine himself to private life. Socrates received the death penalty. He did not think he should stoop to servility because he was in danger.Death is either annihilation or migration of the soul. Crito visited Socrates in prison. Crito urged him to escape. He claimed that Socrates was throwing away his life when he might save it. Socrates argued with Crito that he had no problem with the laws and, thus, he had a duty to be law-biding. Aiding Socrates's escape would be a breach of faith.PHAEDO is the last conversation. Socrates believed a man should be cheerful in the face of death. A love of wisdom, not the body, makes a person cheerful. Soul resembles the divine, body resembles what is mortal. No soul which has not practiced philosophy may attain the divine nature. Pythagoreans have a theory of the soul. The soul is imperishable. Friends were admonished by Socrates to just be themselves. The philosopher faced death handily.Amazing and wonderful, the three titles are a compelling work."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"The only \\"sad case\\" is for the critic below, who while being an independant baptist minister, is so blinded by his prejudice as to ingore the universal truths in this book.

Easy read and a book well worth exploring.The Last Days of Socrates (Penguin Classics)"},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"It is presumptuous to review the dialogues: they will outlast us all. This is a fine edition, with a wise choice of material. There could perhaps have been more discussion of the revolution in Socratic studies (initiated by Gregory Vlastos) over the past 40 years. One should add the volume on the Early Dialogues to get the true flavour of the strangeness of Socrates and the radical nature of his challenge. The hardest thing to capture in reading these dialogues is the flavour of the way in which Plato (who wrote them) is puzzled throughout by what happened: who is this person, and why does he act this way? It is as if he had to write them down so as to try and make out what the hell Socrates was up to. We touch on something Greek and mysterious (in the Greek sense of mystery) here -- every real commentator has been drawn into the Socratic vortex displayed in these moments. This helps characterize the strange, haunted, almost ritualistic tone that gathers depth as one approaches the end."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"This magnificent compilation has four Plato writings: \\"Euthyphro,\\" \\"Apology,\\" \\"Crito,\\" and \\"Phaedo.\\" Though apparently early works and not as complex or philosophically influential as later ones, they are immensely important in portraying Socrates' trial and death. They are our clearest picture of the historical Socrates and would be invaluable for this alone. Indeed, I have read hundreds - perhaps thousands - of books, and this is one of my ten or so favorites, mostly because of how moving the depiction of the great man's last days is. The story of Socrates' Apology and last moments is part of world literature's very fabric, an immortal part of Western cultural heritage. Anyone who wants to learn about Socrates should start here. However, the works have great value even aside from this; a few have indeed questioned their historical veracity. This does not affect their philosophical, literary, and political worth, which is of the highest, making the book doubly essential.\\"Euthyphro\\" is the least important work philosophically and probably not meant as historical, but it is still worthwhile. It examines the important \\"What is piety?\\" question and, like many Platonic dialogues, does not have anything like a definite conclusion. Some find this aspect frustrating, and it is certainly beguiling, but those who have experience with it come to love it. Like Socrates, Plato is after all too intelligent to give hard and fast answers; in all likelihood, he knows there are not any. What he does is far more important - lead us to think for ourselves and come to our own conclusions if we can. \\"Euthyphro\\" is a good, if relatively minor, example. It also introduces what philosophers call the Euthyphro Problem; here it is \\"Are good things good because they are loved by the gods, or are they loved by the gods because they are good?,\\" but it has been restated in innumerable forms. This is in some ways an unrepresentative dialogue and thus an unfortunate one to begin the book, because it seems to prove the stereotype that philosophy obsesses over inane, probably unanswerable questions of no practical use. The Euthyphro Problem seems truly asinine as given - or, in our post-postmodern world, simply irrelevant. However, we can begin to see its importance when we replace \\"good\\" and \\"loved by the gods\\" with whatever seems most pressing. Such is after all the kind of thing Plato wanted; we are not supposed to read in narrow literal terms but use him as a starting point for our path to wisdom. This is an instructive example of how Plato has been immensely influential far beyond his apparent significance.\\"Apology\\" is Plato's least philosophical and most unrepresentative work but arguably his most important and is among many readers' favorites, including mine. The book's title is misleading in that this is prose rather than dialogue; it purports to be Socrates' self-defense at his trial. It is historically priceless if so, as it gives his last public statements and some background about his life and the lead up to the trial. Even if not, it is of immense worth as a passionate, sound defense of individualism and free speech; its timeless evocation of these all-important concepts is forever associated with Socrates and the main reason he has been immortalized. The work also piercingly examines the often vast law/conscience gap and is thus an early higher law document. Finally, it is a sort of mini-dialogue in itself touching on and in several ways tying up classic Socrates/Plato themes like the nature of piety and goodness, responsibility toward the gods and the state, interpersonal relations, and life vs. death issues. It sums up Socrates and perhaps Plato better than any other work.\\"Crito\\" is a possibly partly historical account of the title character visiting Socrates in jail to inform him that he is able to escape via bribe; Socrates famously says that he accepts his sentence and argues down contrary pleas. This gives incredible potential insight into Socrates, in many ways telling us more about his character and thought than a full biography ever could. Again, though, it transcends this philosophically and otherwise and is particularly relevant politically. It also examines the law/conscience gap and gives further background on Socrates but is notable above all as a very early example of the social contract theory of government. This is an astonishing example of how advanced Plato was, as the theory is generally considered to have been founded by Thomas Hobbes nearly a millennium later. Even more amazingly, it is put forth more clearly and persuasively here than perhaps anywhere else, making the dialogue essential for anyone interested in political theory.\\"Phaedo\\" ostensibly details Socrates' last moments, including his last look at his wife and child, his last dialogue, his last words to friends, and his actual death. A large part of Socrates' image comes from this, and its potential historical value is inconceivable, though its historicity can easily be doubted since the work itself strongly suggests that Plato was not there. Even so, it is likely accurate in regard to the things that really matter and certainly a fine account of how it very well could have been. It is extremely moving; shot through with pathos, it is one of the most affecting things I have ever read. One can surely not read it without being overcome by emotion; I can hardly even think of it without misty eyes. Anyone who respects and admires this central Western civilization figure will be profoundly touched; his famous last words seem comic out of context but are very much otherwise here, telling us much about Socrates and moving us yet further. This would be one of the greatest works of all-time if it had no other aspect, but it is also a fine dialogue appropriately dealing mostly with death. Plato examines perennial questions like the soul's immortality and metempsychosis very thoroughly and thought-provokingly, and the conclusion - unsurprisingly, given the circumstances - has uncharacteristic certainty. It may not convince our cynical, empiricist, science-loving, twentieth century-surviving age, but the argument is certainly well-made and in many ways admirable. The dialogue touches on other important subjects also and is generally seen as the culmination of Plato's early, Socrates-centered thought.It is important to realize that these four works were not originally published together, but the trial and death connection means they are often collected. There are many such editions, but unlike some, this has supplemental material and extra value in that many versions lack \\"Euthyphro.\\"The ever-important translation issue must also be kept in mind. It goes without saying that anyone who cares about intellectual issues, especially applied ones, must know Plato, as should anyone who wants to be even basically well-read. However, this is far easier said than done for most; he is so different from what now passes for literature, to say nothing of pop culture, that he is virtually inaccessible to general readers. Yet the importance of persevering cannot be overemphasized; the payoff is well worth the effort. As nearly always in such cases, reading him becomes far easier after the initial difficulty; no attentive reader will ever think Plato easy reading, but he is utterly absorbing once we get used to his style. He has a near-poetic beauty that all agree has never even been remotely approached in philosophy, and such mesmerizing prose is rare in any genre. His dialogues are an incredible form at once intellectually and aesthetically pleasing - an inspired combination that has perhaps never been bettered; many have appropriated it, but none have matched it. All this means that picking the right translation is probably more important with Plato than any other writer. For the average reader, the more recent, the better is generally true, though older translations like W. H. D. Rouse's and Benjamin Jowett's are still very accessible. The important thing is to read Plato in some form, and those who happen on a translation that does not work for them should keep trying until their mind opens in a truly new way - and once done, it will never close again."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"Received the book within three days of placing my order.

A must-read for anyone interested in studying the Socratic method. Simple syntax throughout, which makes for a quick read. Does bring new arguments on samsara to the forefront. Also very theological in nature."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"Although many accounts of Socrates' trial are known to have existed for some time after the actual events described by Plato, only Plato's and Xenophon's accounts survive. Both writers were sympathetic to Socrates, and so are somewhat suspect as to whether they adequately and accurately describe the full nature of the charges against Socrates. Plato, a 27-year-old admirer of Socrates at the time of the trial, describes the charges as being impiety (questioning the state sanctioned [poly]theology) and, thereby supposedly corrupting the minds of Athens' youth. A similar charge had, years earlier, driven Anaxagoras from Athens, but many scholars believe there were probably other factors involved in the case against Socrates. Here we find an intractable mystery (and some unwarranted speculations that are merely libelous)*.Plato's telling of Socrates' last days consists in four parts:(1.) Euthyphro: Socrates in Action. (2.) The Apology: Socrates on Trial. (3.) Crito: Socrates in Prison. (4.) Phaedo: The Last Conversation.Euthyphro, The Apology, and Crito are better paced and more interesting than Phaedo, which is a long Socratic argument that the soul must possess some extra-material existence, which continues, or is somehow renewed, beyond corporeal death. I suspect that most readers will enjoy the first three sections of this text, but find the last (and longest) more of a chore; at least that is my opinion. Throughout the text, Plato presents Socrates as a man of both relentless curiosity and an admirable ethical heroism.* As to the rather facile side bar discussion that seems to have been present in earlier reviews in this forum (while noting the forensic evidence indicating that the worst of these comments was deleted): Given the full weight of the available evidence, Socrates' supposed bisexuality can add up to nothing more than idle speculation. As to his relationships with young men, it cannot be confirmed that they involved males that were considered to be below an age at which they could accountably assent--and even more importantly, IF any such relationships were of a sexual nature at all. Given the available accounts, arguments that these were NOT sexual relationships seem clearly more defensible than (slanderous?) accusations that they were. In other words, as regards this charge, we simply enter an arena of irresolvable facts and potential slander. Why go there?! What we CAN glean from the only extant accounts of Socrates' character is that he considered himself to be one who strove to consistently abide by the highest ethical standards, and that this is consistent with Plato's account here. As cited in Phaedo, these comments of Socrates' seem particularly relevant to this [particular slander]: \\". . . true philosophers abstain from all bodily desires and withstand them and do not yield to them. . . those who care about their souls and do not subordinate them to the body dissociate themselves firmly from these others and refuse to accompany them on their haphazard journey; and, believing that it is wrong to oppose philosophy with her offer of liberation and purification, they turn and follow her wherever she leads.\\""},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"In this simply-organized compilation of Socratic Dialogues, I would offer that the way Penguin Classics presents them cannot be outdone. The playfully loquacious dialogues are pure-gold bricks of logic, and should therefore be cherished greatly. This book is easy to understand because there are endnotes on every page. Spanning the entirety of over 200 juicy pages, Harold Tarrant and Hugh Tredennick present The Last Days of Socrates to the reader in an easy to follow pattern of notes. These final works of Plato should not be thought of as poor entertainment, but rather highly intense and compelling Greek discussions. It is very well-done and should be read over and over again.Although every Socratic dialogue is absolutely riddled with complacent people for Socrates to question, this collection actually reveals the largest variety of listeners. From crazy commoners to cynical and court-goers, a critical criminal and the crowd of conflicting friends, Socrates caught every category and class of character off guard. At first, the evidence that hints at Socrates' trial is a mere conviction and nothing more. He had been free then. He had boldly questioned commoners at the very steps to the courthouse that he would defend himself in later. This penniless philosopher inquired of many people during his spare time.In this collection, the second and third dialogues are the ones that depict the powerful defense of Socrates using logic to its full extent. In brilliantly defending himself, Socrates caressed, persuaded, and rallied only just under half of the jury. Unfortunately, he had failed to win the jury over completely, but he had come so close. Sleeping in the cell that was later constructed for him, Socrates was aroused by Crito, a man who had been a believer in Socrates. The extent of the discussion is contained in the third dialogue titled Crito. Anyhow, the general public hated Socrates so much that only death would avenge their flaming lust for revenge. The second and third dialogues depict Socrates' infamous apologetics and must be read. That is not all, however.In Phaedo, Socrates calmly awaited his own death by hemlock, in a full chamber of the courthouse. He first addressed his followers and comrades alike concerning the meaning of life. He wanted to reassure them that there was indeed life after death, and that he would be going to a better place. Before he drank the poison, however, Socrates spurred a discussion of the soul and its immortality, or at least as logic had presented it to him. (Of course he had to argue it.) When two of his followers timidly provided Socrates with their opposing views, he only smiled and destroyed each argument consecutively. This he did because he wanted to share his hopes with his friends and did not want them to doubt his reincarnation. Nobody could fight back tears as he took the poison and perished. Socrates' legend now carries from there on. In Phaedo, the philosopher convinced his pals that his soul had not been dying, but had rather been transcending.I love how Penguin has organized these significant conversations. Socrates is much easier to comprehend because of this book. Socrates had been last heard saying, \\"Crito, we ought to offer a cock to Asclepius. (This is because Asclepius had been the god of pleasure.) See to it and don't forget.\\" Buy this book. See to it and do not forget. When I purchased this book, which was in a used condition, it only cost two cents and has not disappointed me. Since it is known that Socrates is always welcome to thinkers, the price feels reduced even further for those who love logic. You will deprive yourself if you miss out on this intellectual classic of the Father of Greek philosophy."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"While this book was initially entertaining and relatively engaging, I felt that it drifted further from any sort of objective examination of ethics as it went on. While I did not agree with Socrates in The Apology, I could understand and respect his preceived duty to obey the law, but as he began to philosophize about the soul and its properties it seemed that he was building his elaborate castle on shifting ground. His love of analogies eventually leads him away from reality. He seems unable to understand that analogies are not always appropriate and that sometimes they can be flawed. Yes, much of what Socrates said forms the basis for many important institutions, but for the average person with an interest in philosophy, I thought this was tedious and often rather irrelevant."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"Just like the other person who said that W.J. Knapp's review is, essentially, incredible and ridiculous, I, too, think that he knows nothing of Socrates. I have studied ancient philosophy for the last 4 years, specifically Socrates and Plato!, and this \\"Baptist Minister\\" is quite ignorant of Socrates and his ostensible love affairs with young men. There is NO evidence for any claim that says that Socrates slept with young men. He even resisted Alcibiades when Alcibiades wanted to sleep with him (read Alcibiades, by Plato)! He also died for a cause; he did not die for nothing! Besides Jesus, and possibly the apostle Paul, Socrates was the best man who had ever lived--and I am a devout Christian saying this! HE WAS A MARTYR! HE DID NOT BELIEVE WHAT THE GREEKS OF HIS TIME BELIEVED AS REGARDS GOD! In sum, do not pay heed to what W.J. Knapp says; he is obviously ignorant about the TRUTH! And you, W.J. Knapp, call yourself a Baptist! Besides bashing Knapp's comment, I would like to say that this book is great; an excellent read, and it stimulates one's mind, challenging one to consider things anew. It is also a wonderful story about the most influential philosopher who died for what he belived in: the TRUTH! I hope that each one of you finds this book as enjoyable as I do each time I read it! God Bless!The following is a reply to Eric's recent comment (January 20, 2005)It seems as if Eric does not know what he is talking about, for his logic is both fallacious and implausible. Just because many male Greeks in that era had sex with young boys, this does not necessarily prove that Socrates did. Not everyone in that era had sex with young boys; now did they, Eric?! His argument would not be right even if, say, 999,999 male Greeks out of 1,000,000 did have sex with young boys. If anyone was the exception, it would be Socrates. Moreover, as a philosophy professor (who is knowledgable specifically in the ancient philosophy period), I have studied this man quite in depth, and his character and daimon would certainly proscribe such immoral conduct. For, even if it was not deemed heinous or immoral in that era, that does not mean that Socrates deemed it moral. Lastly, perhaps you have not read many of the Platonic dialogues, but in one of them Socrates even had a chance to sleep with the finest young boy in Greece (Alcibiades); but he refused! Socrates did not have sex with young boys. There are no questions! Let us hope that this argument has eliminated any difficulties you, or anyone else for that matter, are struggling with. All in all, the book is wonderful, and I recommend it to anyone, even if he thinks Socrates did have sex with young boys!"},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"I am probably alone in thinking that Socrates was a pompous windbag and that the citizens of Athens deserve a small award for putting and end to his tedious speeches. This book is pure propaganda suggesting that Socrates was a saintly figure martyred by the evil mob. They had concocted ridiculous charges of corrupting the youth of Athens and then had him convicted in a kangaroo court.The truth is of course more complex. Athens had been a democracy. Socrates and Plato were enemies of the democracy believing in rule by the rich. After the defeat of Athens by Sparta the democratic government was replaced by an oligarchy who used repression to maintain control. It was this government that was supported by Plato and Socrates. Both were in reality traitors to their country in much the same way that Pinochet was a traitor to Chile. After the corrupt rule of Plato's friends was overthrown democracy was re-instituted and Socrates was put on trial for his role in forming the views of those who destroyed the democratic system.Plato spent his life writing crude anti-democratic propaganda such as this book. His philosophical system of government was that of a totalitarian society run by un-elected guardians. Popper the famous 20th Century Philosopher saw him as one of the forebears of the closed society along with Marx and Lennin.If this book is to be believed and there is no particular reason to see it as accurate or truthful then Socrates bought his own fate upon himself. He had the chance of exile and he also had the chance to suggest an alternative punishment.Despite his role as a traitor surely Socrates deserved death because of his life spent as a tedious bore. One cannot read any of the dialogues featuring his alleged sayings without seeing contrivance and he mis-recording of his opponents. At the conclusion of this book one can put it aside and feel a certain sense of satisfaction that the people of Athens did the right thing."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"First, let me commend this book on it's ability to maintain relevance over the course of hundreds, even thousands of years. It is a necessity to any \\"rooty\\" student of philosophy.Secondly, let me acknowledge that Socrates was a seemingly unhuman grace to the acomplishments of the human race. However, as he encouraged us to face rational facts as opposed to common beliefs, you must face the reality that in fact Socrates had sex with young boys, as was the norm for that era in Greek history. There are no questions. Most of the great minds did, though I am both a devotee to their teachings and wise to the ugliness of those actions.If Aristotle killed a stranger would that make his work of lesser importance?Let me stress that dignity in experiences (your 4 years of study) should not extend to close the mind but to expand it. We are reading passionate works of a man who shaped our world.To argue irrationally on the topic of Socrates is to hit a man who disrespects Gandhi."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"I wondered that why there isn't any church putting Jacque Louis-David's painting the Death of Socrates on the wall. If you hear the story of Socrates' sarcrifice, you would understand why this old man is worth of the worship from millions. Imagine you are in the situation of Socrates. Assume that you are a patriotic citizen of a country. For all the years of your life, you try to make your fellow citizen smart and do them goods by spending all your time making speeches on the streets, defending justice and teaching the students without any charges. Assume that you have annoyed the ruling class of this country and they prosecute you on the court for corrupting the youths of your country-they could not prove that though. Assume your fellow citizen vote and put you to death on the court for you are too poor to pay a satisfactory fine and reject to proclaiming justice in exchange for your release. Assume that your best friend asks you to escape from jail since it is unjust for you to accept this unreasonable condemnation, and he guarantees that all the financial problems would be taken care of and your friends who help you escape would not be suffered, so that you can live in the countries that you prefer and raise your children by yourselves. Is anybody there would refuse to escape? However, Socrates does. He launches three arugements. 1. We should never injury others on any circumstances. Escape from jail and breaks the laws is certainly an act that would put the Laws of Athens on the blink of destruction. 2. You should respect your country's command as if you respect your parents. Since a person's birth, his country provides the protections, regulates the supply of food and enriches him with education. Thus, a person shouls respect his country like or more than he respects his parents. 3. There is a contract between the government and the people. If a person does not like the Laws of a country, he can choose to leave it. If he chooses to stay, that means he signs the contract with government of not ! breaking the laws. If he does not break the laws, the government can't do anything on him. If he does, the government reserves the rights to punish him or even execute him.This book comprises the last part of Socrates' life: Euthyphro, the cause of his accusation, The Apology ,his cross-interrogation at the court, Crito, his refusal to escape from jail, and Phaedo, his Sarcrifice. There are the most important chapters in Plato. The weight of Socrates' sarcrifice is like the cruxifiction of Christ; if he does not die, he is not the Messiah. So, if you don't have too much time to read the Complete Works of Plato, this book undoubtedly would be the best choice for you to understand Plato."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"As Socrates abstained from recording his philosophies, we must thank Plato for having the insight to preserve Socratic thoughts for posterity. As a student of Socrates, it seems that Plato, through his own writings, attempts to preserve the memory of his well respected teacher.In The Last Days of Socrates, Plato begins with Euthyphro and we see the Socratic method in action. Socrates and Euthyphro discuss the nature of piety, and through a serious of thought provoking questions, Socrates argues for what he feels is the proper relationship between Man and God.Next, Plato discusses the trial of Socrates by the Athenian aristocracy. Again, we see Socrates using his rhetorical skills in illustrating the hypocrisy and prejudice pervading throughout the Athenian government. Socrates discusses what role a good citizen should play in government. He announces his being a \\"gadfly\\" on the hide of the establishment, and we also find Socrates exposing his own intelligence by claiming that he, in fact, knows very little. The Apology is by far my personal favorite section of the book.After Socrates conviction, we find him discussing the morality of obeying or breaking laws in Crito. He meets with one of his close friends and the two discuss Socrates' options in regard to his death sentence. Here we see Socrates espouse the belief that it is acceptable to break an unjust law, however, one must also accept the consequences for breaking said law in order to preserve the stability of society.The Last Days of Socrates tackles many complex issues which are as relevant today as they were when first committed to paper in the 4th century B.C. This should be standard reading for any introductory course in political theory, and a must have for anyone interested in philosophy or ethics."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"I will not presume to analyze this, and leave that to the experts deep into the facets of philosophy. I will say that this book is excellently written by Plato, using many technically interesting devices, conversations, soliloquys and conversations inside conversations each one expertly serving its purpose. In this thin tome you can find the roots of the scientific method, modern philosophy, method of inquiry, arguements of law, political thought, fundamentals of christian thought and belief, basis of thought that will guide the inquiry into the nature of the universe itself, from physical position of the planets in the heavens to the theory of relativity. It is impossible to estimate the importance of this work on the history of human thought. Plato succeeds expertly in providing Socrates scorn of the shifting state of human reasons, his Socratic method, his personal life, his public life and his rare and enduring example of bravery. A truly amazing book, that really requires studying over simply reading."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"THE DEATH OF SOCRATES is a very inspiring book to read, especially now, when many of us may be facing the same situation he faced--though with a crucial difference. Whatever distortion of the real Socrates may have been introduced by Plato or other writers, enough comes through to paint a portrait of the first true individual in history-- the first person to be guided by his own individual conscience to do what is right, regardless of the consequences. Reading the Apology, one thrills to Socrates intransigence in the face of the Athenian jury which sentenced him to death. CRITO presents the best argument for government under law ever offered, and thus the beginning of the tradition of civil disobedience later taken up by Thoreau, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. When Socrates' friend Crito urges him to flee, saying that most people will think he was really guilty if he does not, Socrates says, \\"Why should we pay so much attention to what most people think?\\" Then he engages in a symbolic dialogue with the Law of Athens, which can be thought of as comparable to the US Constitution. It is clear that he is grateful to the Laws for having given him the opportunity to be a dissenter. The crucial fact is that they have permitted him the right to attempt to persuade his fellow citizens by permitting him free speech. Even when he was arrested for his teachings, he was allowed to speak in his own defense. Although the verdict was unjust, he was a victim not of the Laws but of his fellow men. (p. 95)However, the tradition of civil disobedience which Socrates founded is only meaningful in a democracy, where people have the right to dissent and to have a fair and public trial. And it is rapidly becoming obsolete. For on October 17, 2006, President Bush signed into law the Military Commissions Act, initiating the gravest crisis in US history, not excepting the Civil War, Pearl Harbor, and 9/11 itself. Congress has had over a year to repeal or amend that act but has failed to do so. Now it is up for review by the Supreme Court. If that body, now nearly half-filled with \\"rubber stamp\\" justices, fails to strike down the law as unconstitutional we shall have to resort to a very different tradition than that of Socrates, one which has its roots in medieval England, and was transformed in the 17th century into John Locke's social contract theory. Jefferson expressed it in the immortal words of the Declaration of Independence: speaking of the American colonists, he wrote, \\"But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them to absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and provide new guards for their future security.\\" Faced with the prospect of living in a society which would have made his dissenting individualism impossible, I'm sure Socrates would have agreed."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"The life and legacy of Socrates can be interpreted in many different ways, and have been so interpreted. While that is frustrating, it could be argued that it's also inevitable. The words and deeds of great men have different effects on different people. Most scholars base their accounts of Socrates on Plato's dialogues, especially the four dialogues included in this volume: \\"Euthyphro\\", \\"Apology\\", \\"Crito\\" and \\"Phaedo\\". They deal with Socrates' trial, execution and death. And no, they don't answer the eternal questions. Rather, they raise more questions than they answer. But then, that's the point!What makes Socrates so important? The reason, of course, is his philosophy. The whole point of philosophy is to reject tradition and revelation as automatic sources of knowledge, to be taken simply on faith. Instead, human reason is paramount. True, philosophy doesn't *necessarily* reject tradition and revelation, but it does say that such sources of knowledge should be scrutinized by reason. In this sense, philosophy is subversive and radical. At least in a society gone terribly wrong... I mean, who would need philosophy if society had been perfect?Socrates wasn't the first philosopher, nor even necessarily the \\"best\\" one. The reason why his name has been associated with the philosophical endeavour is, of course, the story of his life and above all his death. Socrates became the first known martyr of philosophy, placing his conscience and convictions above politic. Socrates showed how dangerous philosophy can be, by questioning both the oligarchic regime of the Thirty Tyrants in Athens, and the later democracy. He was the perennial dissident, the man who questioned everyone and everything. Ironically, it was the democrats who had him railroaded and executed. A warning for the future?I don't think Socrates was necessarily a \\"radical\\" in the modern sense of that term. He seems to have mingled in high society, and some of his friends and disciples had connections with the oligarchic regime. Neither his disciple Plato nor Plato's pupil Aristotle were democrats, not even by Greek standards. Socrates didn't seem to believe that society could be changed, and therefore tended to avoid politics, except when he was duty bound as a citizen to perform political tasks (he also fought as a soldier). In some ways, Socrates actually resembled a guru. His teachings were oral, he had a circle of admirers and disciples, and he may have imparted somewhat different teachings to each of them. There are also hints at a fundamentally religious worldview, as when Socrates says that a little god or daemon were giving him advice, when he talks of reincarnation and Heaven in \\"Phaedo\\", or when he takes seriously the oracular statements of the priestess at Delphi.Yet, by his bold questioning of established politics, ethics and religion, Socrates nevertheless showed the radical potential of philosophy and rational discourse. On a more somber note, the trial and execution of Socrates also shows that some people, even in a democracy, simply can't stand the truth.Free soup for Socrates? Still today, many people, rulers and commoners alike, would consider that proposal to be very provocative indeed."},{"Title":"The Last Days of Socrates","review":"This is the kind of text used in those bread & butter Western civ. or survey philosophy courses.

(You can actually read the Jowett translation online if you want to; it was done in the 19th century, so it is now a public domain text.) Here are some links to the Jowett translation:The Trial and Death of Socrates: Four Dialogues (Dover Thrift Editions)andEuthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo (Great Books in Philosophy)andSelected Dialogues of Plato: The Benjamin Jowett Translation (Modern Library Classics).If I were you I would get this book for the endnotes (it is an awfully cheap book after all). And I would get the Grube or Rouse translation as well, if for no other reason than to have a second source that you can go to if a particular passage in the Tredennick and Tarrant version confuses you. I have found that this is an invaluable tool to understand translated texts. However, the Tredennick/Tarrant translation uses such simple language that it might not be needed. If you are a philosophy student, or just someone who wants to fully understand and digest the text, I would keep an alternative translation in the holster when reading.

Though hardly a work of unassailable logic it is, nonetheless, a deeply thoughtful, imaginative, and passionately argued one. As I made my way through it, I had to remind myself, from time to time, that what I had before me was a work of ancient literature. Tredennick and Tarrant are to be commended for their eminently readable translation. As I am not a classicist, I cannot speak to the quality of the translation, but if the quality of the endnotes serves as any indication, I would venture to guess that the translation is first-rate.A very complex Socrates -- as remembered, as imagined, and perhaps also as invented -- emerges from the four dialogues in TSDoS.

I like characters with a growth arc throughout the story, and Leshaya left me unsatisfied. We do not find out the repercussions of her actions to the James family, Joy Victoria, or Paul. We also never find out if she somehow realizes her dream of becoming a singer.I would not recommend this book for any reason."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"This was an appropriate book at the high school for inner city students who find they can relate with the story and the characters. I had no trouble getting my students to take turns reading, doing their homework, and writing on this book. It hit home for my low-income students who are faced with sexuality, drugs, alcohol, running away, and poor choices. It was excellent for discussing what alternate choices could have been made and what those outcomes could have been."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Leshaya (Janie) can't get things strait. Why wasn't she black? Why did her mother leave her to drown in the ocean? Why is everyone against her?As you read this you find yourself becoming mad because you can't believe the things she does to herself and others. People like Paul , Mrs. Trane, the James, and Rosalie only wanted to help her but she refuses the loving kindness and help and continues to tumble downhill.I recommend this to anyone who loves depressing bittersweet books. I've read it at least 5 times and still can't stop reading it. You'll find yourself thinking about Leshaya for weeks afterward. I would not recommend this book to kids under 13. I myself had to sort of skip over the adult matieral. So get out there and read it already!!"},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Leshaya isn't your average teenage girl; well I wouldn't be either if I had a childhood like hers. All her life, Leshaya lived in a stupid foster home where the parents didn't even care about her. The only thing she ever enjoyed was listening to the ladies with Harmon, her foster brother. When Leshaya grew up, she wanted to be just like them, a singer. She'll do anything to become one. All her life she has made really bad decisions, stealing from the James', running away, and having a baby at age 13. Will she ever make a right decision and become a singer? Will she find a nice place for her to live forever? These questions and many more are answered throughout the book.This was okay; it was a bit depressing. It did, however, keep me wanting to read, wondering what crazy thing that Leshaya was going to do next. Sometimes I would just be like, \\"Did she really just do that?\\" I would recommend this book to anyone who likes bittersweet books."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"This was an extremely dramatic book. It dealt with some pretty delicate situations.Leshaya lives with her mother for a short time. Her mother is a heroine addict. Leshaya goes to a first foster home; her new mother is a nervous control freak and her new father is quiet and gone all the time, but Leshaya likes him. Then her mother shows up: her new Father is a drug dealer and sold her mother heroine. Leshaya goes to many foster homes and goes through alot. She ends up at the same place she started, right at the side of her mother.I liked the book, don't get me wrong, but there were alot of things that got to me about the book:1) Leshaya is any thing but a hero: she lets herself go at any time: drugs, sex, any thing.2) Leshaya is stupid. She does stupid things to people who care about her and ruins all the relationships in her life.3) The end of the book was extremely disappointing.A good book, but defidentily not one of my favorites.~Atalanta"},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"...Born blue, by Han Nolan, was a outstanding story about fighting to live through life as a teenager.

But I also think that adults might enjoy this book. But mainly I think the author is writing this for a teen audience.I thought that this book was awesome, I hate to read and this is by far the best book I have ever read I couldn't put it down. It is most defiantly a page-turner. I got really into this book and I can honestly say that it felt as if Janie was talking to me. This book stirred a lot of emotion with me, I was angry and yet sadden to think that although this is a book there are people out there who can say this is my life.My overall impression of the book was a good one. I loved this book I thought that it was really well written, the author knows how to write a book. She did a great job with description and dialect, I don't think that the book would have been as good if it weren't so well written. I would most definitely recommend this book to any teen looking for a book to read, I think anyone that reads this book will get a strong meaning out of it. I think that people who read this will become aware of real life. I know that sometimes I get so caught up in my word I don't think of how other people live. Reading this book makes me aware of other people out there and that this could be real even though it's in a book."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Born Blue is a dramatic book. It tells a touching story that everyone in some sort of way can relate with. Either by being pregnant, or by feeling like the world is against you.

Along the way to getting famous she encounters pregnancy, drugs, hate, and being depressed."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"\\"See, in a instant I grown up. In a instant I took hold of my life.\\" These are the words of Leshaya. She only thinks that she has begun to take hold of her life, but at age seven she has no clue what life has in store for her.This book is about the hardships of a young girl and how she tries to overcome them. The beginning of the book is mysterious because it does not start the way you'd think it would. Although there are many things that go on, it is an exceptionally easy book to follow and understand. It is an excellent teen book and it teaches you lessons about life in general. I think that Leshaya is a lot like many people today in our world and I think that Born Blue displays the reality excellently.This book is superb. I have read Born Blue before and as a result fell in love with it the first time I read it. It is one of my favorite books of all time. I think that the uncertainty of the inside cover makes the curious reader so intrigued that they just plunge into the book and do not want to stop. I feel as though any book in which this happens is worth reading and that Born Blue is without doubt one of those extraordinary books that is just waiting for another person to experience the splendors of reading.- Nikki Jamison"},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"A legitamate combination of words. Love the story, keeps you on the edge of your seat each page that is turned! Not able to put down once you start reading it."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"If you are looking for a feel good book this is not. Born Blue is a story about love, happiness, and survival. Lashaya is anything but perfect, except for her amazing voice. All she cares about is making it in the big time even if that means hurting all those around her, including her own daughter.Ths book is not ment to have a happy ending or even an okay ending/ It's fresh, raw and to the point. If you are an experiance reader then this is a great book, if not, try reading a book about sisterhoods."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"When I first read this book, I was absolutely shocked at the bluntness of the characters, and especially, the author's graphic way of depicting things. But what makes this book awesome is the fact everything is so real, to know it could happen to anyone, even you.The story is based around Janie, who grows up a harsh and rugged life around drugs, violence, and endless crimes. We she doesn't realize, however, is that she is destined for no real future at all. It tooks the whole book for her to finally realize this, and by then, it is too late to change what has already happened. But she could provide a good and content life for her daughter, Etta - the life she never had. Janie/Leshaya makes many bad choices, but eventually learns from her mistakes.I reccommed this book to anyone, though everything is very blunt, and the character basically speaks her mind. Nothing is held back, including everything from wild parties to pregnancy and drug dealing. Read openly."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"This was one of the best books i have ever read.

But all she wants to do is to sing like the ladies."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"I absolutly loved this book. It had a lot of unexpected events happening all over the book and lots and I mean lots of drama. This book couldn't have been written more excitingly. It just has such a different point of view, it just shows what happened to a young 12 or 13 year old girl that usually don't happen to girls that age. But then again thinking about the characteristics of her personality and her looks show that she isn't really a normal girl. I was really shocked when I found out that she was pregnant. That was the big scene to me. She also had many relationships with guys but she was so afraid of getting hurt she never let them get close enough to her. I really thought her mother was a horrible women and self centered. She traded her only daughter for heroine, she didn't care what happened to her. I wish the book continued on so I'd know whether or not she became that great singer or if she ever will see her little girl again. Even though she let her daughter live with her foster brother so she could end how all the girls in her family were like. She became just what her mother had been. She did drugs and alcohol and got pregnant early. But I'm also glad that it ended because it leaves us wondering a little bit which makes us use our imagination. I'm glad at then end that she took care of her mom who she hated so much and she got to see her before she died because she had aids."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Born BlueBy: Han NolanJanie who is the child of a heroin addict her birth mother is Moma Linda.

It really caught my eye when i was going shopping. When I glanced at it, I dedicated myself to buying it because it sounded really interesting to me. The only thing that was weird about it was that the main character thought she was black and always talked like it too, but she was white.

At First it takes some time to adapt to the way Janie talks, for she does not use correct English. Although it at times is hard to understand, Nolan did this in his writing to probably show how un-educated this girl is. We first meet Janie when she starts to live in the orphan house. The book progresses chronologically as Janie gets older. The book is well balanced between narration and dialoque.Nolan explores in his book different themes that make you think. Although there is no clear moral of this story, the ending makes you think about what this book teaches us. One thing we learn about Janie's journey is how people are important and how we should always be grateful for the help that we get from friends and people throughout our lives. this book really makes you look back on how you have lived your life and how you should live it in the future. I would recommend the book to older high school students. The book talks about things that would be more understandable for older and more mature teens. the ending in the book leaves you wanting more, but overall this book was wonderful and well written."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Janie (Leshaya) has it terrible right from the get-go. A child of a heroine addict, Janie has never known her father, and can't even fathom what real love might be. She spends most of her life in foster care with her mother coming once in awhile to visit. She learns to put all of her pain into her singing, and it drives her on. Her voice is incredible and draws attention to her, and she is determined to make it as a singer. Without guidance, support and love, this only leads to drugs, alcholol and pregnancy. Janie pushes everyone away that tries to help her, and care for her until she has nothing left. She decides to take her baby back so at least she has her, but in the end makes a difficult choice and demonstrates her love for her daughter.The despair and emptiness of Janie's life is felt through Han Nolan's words. It is a harrowing journey with Janie that the reader goes on with few happy times to lighten the burden. The reader sees how Janie makes poor choices and actually uses her history as a crux, instead of rising above to be successful. Even her talent as a gifted singer cannot help her when she is self-destructing and taking all around with her."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"~*~When i started to read this novel i thought to myself \\" Oh, GREAT! Another depressing novel.\\" I'm glad I gave it a chance because in the end I loved it. I would even go to the extent and say that I would read it again. I reccomend this novel to anyone who enjoys reading about people overcoming the odds despite their difficulties in life. This novel is definately a page turner. You never want to put it down you always want to know what is going to happen next. In my class we were gave 9 weeks to finish a novel and I think I finished this one in 6 days.

This book was what sometimes happened, what people didn't want to see. Leshaya's drive was more than I could ever have. IT showed me that I didn't have to end up on that road to become a singer. It also showed me that if Leshaya could do it, I can."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"I bought this book last week, and could hardly put it down. It's really great! The book starts off kind of slow, but quickly picks up and brings you on an adventure. Janie (or lashaya) is a great character! Something new is always happening, which keeps the story exciting.

Her birth mother is a heroin addict and her foster parents neglect her. Early on her only comfort comes from listening to tapes of \\"the ladies,\\" such singers as Etta James and Billie Holiday.

She does whatever it takes to realize her dream.Unfortunately, all the years of neglect and abuse have an effect on Leshaya as she bounces around from person to person, ruining every relationship she has.This book is a definite page turner, I'll give it that. However, just like all the characters in the book that Leshaya encounters, I found her very hard to like. Even knowing of her rough life it is hard to see past her selfish and cruel ways.The book ends the best way possible, in my opinion. Leshaya faced with a very difficult situation finally makes a good, correct decision."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Born Blue is an amazing story of a girl, raised by an addict and 'passed' from foster home to foster home, wants to sing like Etta James.

I'd recommend it to teens or anyone who loves a good read."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"The book Born Blue, written by Han Nolan, is an excellent book. Although it has some flaws, it is still very interesting. It's well written in most parts and you can get a feeling of what the main character is thinking at times. This book should have a strong connection with kids tat have been in a foster parent's care, even though the experience in the book isn't positive. I do not recommend this book to anyone under the age of twelve because of the content inside it.Janie or Leshaya, as she is later called, was abandoned by her heroin-addict Mama Linda at the age of four. While Janie was swimming in the Gulf of Mexico, her Mama Linda is getting high and doesn't pay attention to Janie when she starts to drown. Janie get put into a hospital, and when she is released she get put into a foster home with Patsy and Pete in Alabama. In this house she meets another foster child named Harmon, an African-American who introduces Janie to \\"the ladies\\", whose music churns her sole. This music inspires Janie to sing, at times that's the only thing that she can think about. Harmon and Janie became good friends, being around Harmon made Janie think that she was an African-American and that she was just \\"light\\". Harmon's and Janie's social worker, Doris, is the only other that Janie talks to. When Harmon gets adopted and Doris's daughter, Leshaya, dies Janie is left all alone. In honor of Leshaya, Janie changes her name and decides to be Leshaya.One day when Leshaya is coming home from school, Mama Linda appears and she takes her away. Leshaya knows that she is being kidnapped, but she doesn't care since she is with her mother. Little does she know that her mother actually sold her for heroin. She then goes to live with her new \\"parents\\" Daddy Mitch and Mama Shell, who later on get arrested for [illegal substance]. Leshaya takes some of the profits that Daddy Mitch made selling heroin and runs away before the police can come and put her back into Patsy's and Pete's house. She finds where Harmon lives and decides to invite herself to live with them for a while. Once she ruined her friendship with Harmon and his family, she runs away again and meets up with a band. This band is Leshaya's first big break, people actually get to hear her sing and this makes Leshaya gets into bigger things. During some turning with a band, Leshaya gets pregnant and when she gives birth to the baby she gives it to Harmon, even though he isn't the father. Leshaya becomes [an] addict at the age of fourteen and start not to care about life anymore. Leshaya has a lot to deal with in her life, but can she make the right decisions?Noland uses a lot of literary elements in this book. She does a great job with the plot of this book. The story is well thought out and planed. The imagery in this book is really good, sometimes you can actually get the feeling that you are Leshaya and you're suffering as much as her. For example, you could really feel the pain Leshaya was going through when she had to give up her daughter. I think that this novel is just like the blues; it makes you feel sad and alone, but yet sympathetic for the character.I really started enjoying this book at the end, the last two chapters to be exact, because the author finally got to the resolution of the book. The part that I didn't like about this book was the way the author portrayed the character. Leshaya was, at first, an admirable person, but hen she turned into a self-centered ... addict. Another thing I didn't enjoy was that the author made Leshaya use improper English and that made it confusing at times. Despite all the negative parts to the book, overall, it was very interesting. You can really get the feeling of what some kids are feeling. I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone, young or old. It has great ideas on what young foster children are going through."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Janie is the main character in Born Blue. She is born to a drug addict mother who nearly lets her drown at age four. That is when social services steps in and puts her in a foster home. It is here that she meets a foster brother, Harmon, who introduces her to the \\"ladies\\"--Aretha Franklin, Etta James, etc. She and Harmon would go to the basement of the \\"stink house\\" and listen to his tapes of the ladies. The words and the ladies' powerful voices burned into Janie's head. When Janie is seven, her birth mother kidnapps her and trades her for heroin. Her new parents are Mitch, a drug dealer, and Mama Shell, who becomes a user of them because she is so paranoid about having Janie. While there Janie changes her name to Leshaya. One day when she was returning from school, she sees the police taking both her parents away in handcuffs. At this point she starts running her own life. She finds Harmon again but the friendship is shortlived. She finds bands to sing with and her sultry, sexy, heartbroken, yearning voice is awesome. All she ever wants to do is sing and be famous. Unfortunately, Leshaya is also drawn to drugs and alcohol which affects her judgment. She ends up pregnant at twelve years old. Will she follow the path her own mother took or will she take the higher road and devote herself to this child? Two characters lives end in this book. You'll have to read it to find out who and how their lives tragically end.Han Nolan addresses many issues in Born Blue. These are serious issues that many young adults face. By age twelve, Janie has lived with five sets of parents, experienced drugs, alcohol, sex, unwanted pregnancy, and an eating disorder. Just pick up this riveting novel and watch how Janie's own self destructive behavior and flawed decision making send her life on a downward spiral."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"\\"Born Blue\\" is a unique, touching novel about a girl with a gift fighting impossible odds and staying on top. Leshaya strongly reminds me of the character Monique in \\"Life is Funny\\" by E. R. Frank, a similarly hostile character searching for herself after having an unwanted pregnancy at sixteen. A novel drenched in the soulful sound of the \\"Ladies\\" as Leshaya calls them, the great black female blues, gospel, and soul singers like Etta James, Billie Holiday, Odetta, Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack, and Leshaya's own journey to find her voice."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"I thought no way any of Han Nolan's books could be better than her book &quot;Dancing on the Edge&quot; but I guess I was wrong. &quot;Born Blue&quot; was one of the best books I've ever read. I particularly like the way it was told in blackspeak. It made me feel as if I could hear Leshaya talking. I'm glad she made the decision in the end to leave Etta alone. Who knows, maybe she'll come back to Harmon someday."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"I absolutely love the book. I like how they left the end open so we could put our own little twist to it. I would recommend this book to anyone who is going through a rough time right now so they can see that life can always be worse. I heard a saying once, \\"A man with no shoes was always feeling sorry for himself, until he met someone with no feet.\\" It's a very true saying and I would suggest everyone take a look at their own life and realize it will get better."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"I loved it because I had a friend that her mom fell into AIDS and died in her arms.

The main characters life is so tumultuous that you have no choice but you feel sorry for the situations shes been forced into and the ones she brought upon herself. But with Nolan's no holds barred writing you keep hoping for her sake, even when she stops hoping for herself. However, its angst ridden to the very last page the moral is almost lost because of the uneasy feeling given off at the end of the book. You won't find any personality upheavals or triumphant overcoming of the odds in Born Blue. But you'll find a decent read."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"\\"Ain't no one who can hurt me. Ain't nothin' inside me that can feel that kinda pain.\\"\\"Au contraire, my dear; every note you sing is drenched in pain.\\"Janie, a girl pursues her dream of becoming a famous singer despite her lack of a stable lifestyle, endures numerous struggles throughout her childhood. She is strong, yet incapable of taking care of herself. Her self-centered mindset and irresponsible decisions make it difficult for Janie, or Leshaya, to get past her mother's drug habits and work towards achieving her goal of singing like \\"the great ladies of jazz\\".Han Nolan paints an identifiable picture in this book. I could easily relate to Janie, even though my life is not similar to hers. Every part of the book helps to describe the main character and explain why she acts the way she does. Even the language that Nolan uses reflects Janie's lifestyle and lets the reader into her perspective.Born Blue is an uplifting and well-written book that I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in singing or just wants an entertaining story to be engulfed in."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"I just read this book for my language arts class and this is a MUST read for any teenage girl! It's got funny (not really funny but some moments are from the way Janie/Leshaya describes them) &amp; serious moments and Janie/Leshaya describes things with an interesting flair. By the time you finish this book you'll want more!"},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"The title and author of the book I read, was \\"Born Blue\\" by Han Nolan.I enjoyed reading this book because; it wasn't like most endings in books. Instead of the usual happy ending, it was a sad, depressing ending, with lots of mixed emotions. For example, the last few sentences in the book \\"were to much to give up that night, though. Harmon had Etta. He got the better deal. I stuffed the watch back in my pack and set out cross the lawn\\" (page 277). In the novel, Janie has one of the hardest lives, that I have ever herd of, and on top of it all, she's only a young girl. Janie's mother is a druggie, Janie gets kidnapped, by her mother's druggie friends, Janie gets pregnant, and so many other awful things happen to her.The theme of the novel is, no matter what hard ships life gives you, keep working towards your goals. I think that's, that is a very good and respectable theme. I agree with the idea behind it. The theme sort-of relates to my life. I've had some hardships, like Janie, but not as many or as difficult to handle as her. I've had problems with my biological mother, just as Janie has. I've also been in situations, where I am not sure what I want to do, but I made a choice and I had to live with it. Like in the part where, Janie lived with Harmon. She met a band that was full of kids with bad reputations. She chose to hang with the band, because she was working towards her goal, singing. Janie figured if she hung out with the kids, then they might take her to where she wanted to go in the music business. Sadly, the plan didn't work out, and Janie was back to square one.I would recommend this book to anyone in the world with issues, or someone who is sick of that usual \\"happy\\" ending. I even recommend this book to those people who want to see the good side of bad, and the bad side of good. This book is something worth experiencing. It gives awesome details to feeling that are unimaginable.

She goes on a journey this whole book to try and become a singer. She hits some bumps & skids along the way tho and some things unexpected change her life.What I liked most about the book: I liked how the author really got you into the story and how it hooked the reader.What I didn't like and why: What I didn't like about the book is how it keeps you guessing and how you never really find out what happens in the end.My favorite character and why: My favority character would have to be Doris because she's so nice to Harmon and Janie even thought they are in the foster home.The scene, line, or passage that meant something to me and why (page #): A scene that meant something to me was when Janie went back to Harmons house and returned all the stuff she stole even after what happened. (Page: 277)What would I say about this book to someone else: I would say it is a very moving book that will want to keep you reading.One question I have after reading this book: What does Janie do with the rest of her life?My strongest reason for recommending this book: It is a really good book that will make you think about what really matters in your life."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Good lessons in the book which was sort of unexpected.

I have already promised my copy to a young woman whom I had in mind throughout this story, her own mother being a drug addict. Although painful, just a wonderful book.

Born Blue is a book that will teach all girls a lesson. Han Nolan, the author, had a great story line. This is what girls need. They need to be able to read about people who actually experience hard times.This girl named Leyshya has a gift. This is a gift that few people have. Her child hood life is not normal. She had to be put into a foster home and grow up with a family that has a totally different background than her. Not only is this book a good book, for a girl to read but it can be a good book for guys too. They can have the chance to read exactly what a girl goes through and understand thing that they might not understand. This girl has to go through so many ups and downs and there are things that happen that stop her from going on with her gift. It is something that totally changes her whole life. Will this hold her back from wanting to go on? Will she make the right choice? And how will she end up? These are all questions that run through you head while reading this book.Other than all the emotion that is in this story there are some parts where you just have to laugh. See Leyshya is a southern girl and she has that southern accent. She uses words like \\"yall\\" and every word that ends in \\"ing\\" she leave the \\"g\\" out. It really makes you get into her character. I ended up starting to talk like her after I read the entire book.I normally do not read books. I am not a big fan of reading but while I started reading this book I kept wanting to read more and more and I didn't want to put the book down. The meaning of the book is so deep. She goes through such hard things that girls can really relate to this. It's intense. It also has a lot of suspense and it makes you wonder what's going to happen next.The only thing that I would change is change the ending. It ruins it all. It just ends and doesn't go on anymore, and I just want to keep reading but I can't because there are no more pages. The book has such a great theme, but when you get to the end it kills it."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"As a little girl she was called Janie. She never really knew her last name, but it didn't really matter. Her first memories are of being in a foster home where she was occasionally beaten and usually ignored. Her only friend, Harmon, lived there, too. He was the one who introduced her to music. He had tapes of black lady jazz singers and he would play them for her and dream of dancing while Janie dreamed of singing. She knew someday she would be able to sing like the ladies. She also believed deep down in her heart that despite her blond hair and blue eyes, she must be black.Then Harmon is adopted and out of her life. Shortly after that, Janie's real mother, a heroin addict, kidnaps her from the foster home and hands her over to Shell, a white woman and Mitch, her black boyfriend. When Janie is told she will have to change her name, she chooses Leshaya, the name of her black caseworker's dead daughter. For a few years Leshaya lives with Shell and Mitch. She dreams that Mitch might be her real father. He likes to hear her sing, but Shell is jealous of the relationship between Mitch and Leshaya.Finally, Mitch and Shell are busted for selling drugs. Leshaya, just twelve years old, decides to set off on her own and become a famous singer like her idol, Etta James. But a twelve-year-old with no family who has never really known love will have a hard time making it in the world. Will she become famous? Will she figure out how to treat those who care about her?I liked the very end of the book and the decision that Leshaya made. I also liked the way that Leshaya eventually felt about her mother. However, I didn't really like the character of Leshaya herself. She wasn't easy to like; she ruined everything she came across and never really seemed to get why people didn't like her."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Born Blue by Han Nolan is a great book to read. I think that many readers can relate to this book some way or another. There are many people in the world that is just like Janie, being in a foster home or haveing a parent that's a drug addict. Janie's mom, Mama Linda, is a herion addict which is one of the reason why Janie is in foster care.Janie's life has been reuined by everything, Harmon leaving her, being kidnapped by Mitch and Shell, Patsy and Pete and her mother leaving her, but the only thing that made her life better was \\"the ladies\\" n her singing. Janie would do anything to sing, she always dreamed that she would meet Etta James, a famous singer. I liked this book because it was an inspirational story, letting readers know that no matter what if you put your mind to something that you will succeed. I liked that the author chose singing to be Janie's goal because not a lot of people have that talent and with all the problems that Janie went through.

But she did what she thought was right in her heart. When she wanted to sing she thoight about the people she was leaving behind. Even though she was very young she was determined to sing with Arethra Franklin.

It's hard to explain but you'll know what I mean once you've read it through to the end. Janie or Leshaya, as she named herself after being \\"kidnapped\\" from her foster home by her mother and traded for heroin, wants to sing. That's all she wants to do, and she does. She runs away and travels/lives with members of various bands, does drugs and gets pregnant. She leaves her baby with an old friend, fully intending to go back and get it, and love it like her mother never loved her but -- I can't tell you everything. It is written in first person and Leshaya speaks very casually, in lots of slang, like she's really just sitting in front of you talking and it makes the book more interesting but it also gets a bit annoying at times. However, I thought \\"Born Blue\\" was a good book, not the very best, but still a good book."},{"Title":"Born Blue","review":"Let's Talk about LoveAnger. Kidnapping. Explicit sex. Drugs. These words describe just a few of the many topics that a reader can find in Han Nolan's Born Blue. What the reader can expect from Nolan's novel is a heart-gripping, exciting journey of a young girl trying to find out what life and love are really all about.Born Blue is a story of a journey the main character, Janie, takes. Janie has been in the foster care program since she was very young and, although her mother is still alive, disturbing circumstances do not allow her to care for Janie. Our protagonist finds herself caught up in a whirlwind of events as she is kidnapped, moved from place to place, taken advantage of, and gets pregnant. All the while, Janie has only her two passions to keeps her going; her love for \\"the ladies,\\" Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald, Etta James, etc., and her hunger to become a famous singer herself move her along through the novel.At such a young age, Janie is scarred by the abandonment of her mother and therefore throughout the novel it appears that she eventually pushes away those that really care for her. She finds love in her friend Harmon, Harmon's family, and others she meets along the way such as Cliff and Paul, yet each time it's as if Janie is going to push them away before they have a chance to leave her as her mother did. Instead she finds her refuge in famous singers she does not even know rather than in actual relationships with other people. Her vision of what love is and what life is about are severely obscured and it is not until one major event in her life that finally seems to open her eyes to reality.What is striking about this novel is the way that Nolan is able to make the reader both love and hate the main character so much. One gets a feeling that he or she is growing up with Janie and, as a result, the reader longs for Janie to make decisions that will better her life. When she makes the wrong ones, Nolan has written in such a way that the reader can easily become angry and could almost yell out loud at the girl running in the wrong direction. The development of each character, in fact, is done so that readers can easily enter into the world of the novel.Without a doubt, adolescent readers will be drawn into this book. With the risky topics and high point of action, Nolan will have young readers hooked on the plot and characters in Born Blue. I believe that there is someone or some event that each and every young person can relate to and find him or herself in. Even if the reader's life does not hold so many dramatic, life-changing events in it, he or she can relate to the feelings of being alone and sometimes seemingly unloved or the feelings of worrying about a friend in trouble. Also, with the attachment to the characters as mentioned before, the adolescent reader can almost develop a sense of what it is like to be a parent or authority figure, who is just hoping for the best outcome.Basically what it comes down to is that Han Nolan's Born Blue is an enjoyable, fun, stay on the edge of your seat, type of novel that any reader will enjoy and be eager to keep reading till the end."},{"Title":"Building Your Own Home For Dummies (For Dummies (Home & Garden))","review":"This book was very informative about construction loans.

Before buying german picture dict, i went to my local library to look at different kids picture dictionaries.

I used to learn german many years ago, for me pronunciation was not a problem. but without practice i forgot most of words and grammar.

He was vocations director at St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts and is a well known writer, so he was an obvious choice to write the book on behalf of the order. However, there is too much factual information woodenly presented and without photographic or other illustration to be engaging. In fact I would think this would discourage vocations. Some basic early documents of the Cistercians are included but can be found elsewhere, including on line at the Scourmont Abbey web site. The volume is also considerably overpriced for the purpose. A better choice to learn a bit about Trappist life is the same author's book _The Monastic Way_ which is engagingly written and amply illustrated."},{"Title":"Russia and the World 1917-1991 (International Relations & the Great Power)","review":"A very comprehensive and insightful book on Soviet Union as well as Russia's foreign policy.

He says his writing was a religious calling, one he was helpless to deny. Recently, though, . . . \\"the strength of that call has begun to wane.\\"He was surprised years ago when his editor suggested that he write for children. He learned that finding the initial subject 'opens the gate'. He seemed to have little understanding of the significance when his first book \\"TO BE A SLAVE\\" was named a Newbery Honor book in 1969.At fourteen the family moved to Nashville TN (his father was a minister); here he was faced with \\"the white heat of hatred\\" and negroes in whom \\"hope unborn had died.\\"( Jas. W. Johnson) He made friends with books & discovered the courage to dream. About that time he learned that his great grandfather was a Jew from Germany. Read Lester's thoughts about the personal \\"I\\" relating to the story of his ancestors. He went on to share with his students (U Mass/Amherst) what he had learned about himself, and the conviction that it is not enough to be opposed to racism; each person's story must be lived with integrity. Take \\"the risk to live your inner truth, regardless of the consequences,\\" he said.Cemeteries have been important to the author, and trying to imagine the stories of the dead. \\"In the storytelling experience we bind ourselves to others,\\" writes Lester, and become less lonely. Art & music were important from childhood - Lester types with musical accompaniment. He is interested in photography & shared mostly 'people pictures' in this book.Some of this book is slow-going. Will 'young adults' check it out? Julius Lester gives many definitions of \\"story\\" . . . My preference may not be yours, so READ THIS BOOK and savor his words. Also, read the fine review by Alison Follos, above. Julius Lester's several pages (138-147) describing the collaboration between himself and Jerry Pinkney were of particular interest to me. Their books together are successes to enjoy: the Uncle Remus books; John Henry, and Sam & the Tigers.Julius Lester wrote: \\"Today my identity is molded by the inescapable fact that the sum of my past is greater than the sum of my future. THERE IS ONLY TIME REMAINING TO DO THAT WHICH IS MOST VITAL FOR MY SOUL'S ODYSSEY.\\" I hope the words are not a valedictory. They hit home with REVIEWER mcHAIKU who hopes to have many days ahead in which to \\"read in order to be moved, & even changed.\\" This is a helpful, inspiring book; Julius Lester has shared generously. Seek it out!"},{"Title":"The Wrong Child","review":"Abbie Bernard and her eleven-year-old daughter Kendall have just returned to Abbie's hometown of Houston.

Erin's reaction to the situation is particularly poignant. Logan is a hero to die for and interesting secondary characters including Abbie's mother, Katherine, and Logan's conniving sister-in-law Elizabeth all add to the already dramatic scenes.Patricia Kay, who has been a longtime favorite for her category romances written as Trisha Alexander, joins the ranks of authors of women's fiction with great finesse.

What a riveting story. I couldn't put it down. Patricia Kay can really write--she had me in tears of sorrow, then tears of joy. The characters handled a gut-wrenching situation with intelligence, care and love with the best interest of their children in mind, and we can all learn from that.

The Wrong Child is an amazing story that will haunt you long after the final page has been turned. What would you do if you learned that you did not give birth to the child you've loved and adored as your own? What if you learned that a stranger has been raising your birth daughter all these years and to confront him, to discover the fate of your long-lost child, might also mean losing the child you thought was yours? Such is the decision the heroine in The Wrong Child must make, and the emotions her journey invokes are powerful and all-too human. I'm not a sentimental person, nor a particularly emotional one, but this book moved me to tears time and again. Five stars doesn't do it justice."},{"Title":"The Wrong Child","review":"Abbie Bernard loves her daughter Kendall and so when Kendall gets sick she wants to make her better.

Kendall is thrilled when the news comes out that Abbie and Logan were married. Erin, Abbies biological daughter is less than thrilled and runs away when the news comes out that Abbie is actually her biological mother.Everything works out in the end though."},{"Title":"The Wrong Child","review":"The Wrong Child is a compelling story that touched my heart even though it was fictional. Two families were affected by an erroneous mishap.It starts off, when the supervisor nurse called Helen to come in early. She lived within walking distance of Cyrus Hurley General hospital, and they were having the worst winter storm in the Texas Panhandle. When Helen arrived at the hospital, she was dismayed by how shorthanded they were. Two pregnant women came in around the same time before mid-night to deliver their babies. Helen was on her feet for over fourteen hours. She helped deliver two babies girls and had already printed the name bracelets. Helen snapped the bracelet on the wrong baby. And, discovered she made an error, that the Bernard/girl didn't have any hair and the O'Connell baby had black hair. When she went to correct the mistake, Helen had a heart attack and fell on the floor holding onto O'Connell/girl braclet.Eleven years later Abbie decided to move back to Houston for her daugher Kendall. Abbie has been divorced from her husband Thomas Bernard, who's a brilliant scientist, shortly after Kendall was born. He made it clear--No children. Her ex-husband travels around the world and Kendall hears from him about twice a year at Christmas and on her birthday. He hasn't actually seen Kendall in years. Thomas doesn't want anything to do with her. He didn't want any children. His work is more important than family. Abbie feels so sorry for her daughter Kendall. Kendall is old enough to understand that her father doesn't want her. She desperately wants siblings and a father who will love her. Abbie would do anything for her daughter Kendall. She took the plunged and moved back to her hometown in Houston where her mother lives.Abbie notice that Kendall was acting lethargic. Abbie took Kendall to her doctor that she's known when she was growing up Houston. When the test results came back, nothing serious, Kendall is anemic. Doctor Joplin told Abbie he didn't know Kendall was adopted. The blood test showed that Kendall is AB. We know yours is O. Doctor Joplin ran the blood test the second time and it indeed showed that Kendall is an AB.Abbie went back to check the birth records and discovered two baby girls were born around the same time. Abbie struggled with the news that Kendall isn't her biological daughter. She planned to keep it a secret. She loves Kendall as if she's her natural mother in all the ways that matter. Consequently, Abbie needs to know that the baby she gave birth to is happy and in a loving home. All these unanswered questions burst through her mind.Abbie made a decision to contact the O'Connells. Logan O' Connell is a successful architect living in Houston and a widower. Abbie went to his office to tell him about the mixed-up at the hospital. Abbie told Logan that she hasn't mentioned to anyone about the mixed-up at the hospital, so as not to cause a media frenzy. At first, he thought Abbie was after money. If it's true, the mother Erin knew growing up, died three years ago. Erin is still grief-stricken. How is Erin going to take another set back; was weighing on Logan's mind. Abbie showed Logan a picture of Kendall, she looks so much like his eldest son Patrick. Logan and Erin went to see Doctor Joplin to run a paternity test. The DNA test result showed that Logan isn't the biological father. Erin is Abbie's daughter.Logan and Abbie didn't know what steps to take without hurting Kendall and Erin. They decided to be discrete. If the press found out about the mixed-up at the hospital they would camp out on their door steps. Logan invited Kendall and Abbie to his home for dinner to meet Erin and Patrick. He felt it was an open for the two families get-together. A week later Logan called Abbie he came up with a solution to their problem. He took Abbie out to dinner and asked her to marry him. When Logan and Abbie met there were instant attractions between them. Marriage seemed like the logical alternative.Aunt Elizabeth, his deceased wife's sister, has been trying to be the next Mrs. O'Connell. She's tried everything to get her cat's-claw into him. Then, there's Abbie's mother Katherine, who's been disappointed in Abbie. Katherine wanted a son. Katherine was a daughter of a Texas Supreme Court Judge and granddaughter of U.S. Senator. She wanted a son to succeed them.I highly recommend. The Wrong Child is spellbinding with a very happy ending."},{"Title":"The Wrong Child","review":"The WRONG CHILD is a fast-paced, gripping novel about one of the most heart-wrenching conflicts a family can face. But McKay skillfully writes beyond a story that is impressive in and of itself and makes an important statement about extended family values--and even our humanity. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Wrong Child","review":"Like many other Americans, I followed the headlines when it was discovered that the girl in Florida, Kimberly, was switched at birth with another baby and both were raised by the other's biological parents. The other girl had recently died so there was no similar ordeal for her to go through. This novel takes that basic premise and makes both girls alive and well. One child is being raised by a single mother and the other child is being raised by a widowed father. This opens up the whole possibility of romance between the two surviving parents and combining their families and households. The story unfolds pretty much as a romance and family story with neither parent going to the police or to court and the media not getting wind of it. Few people are probably so heroic in real life as to not file a multimillion dollar damage claim against the hospital in court which they would probably win. This probably would have been a more gripping reading experience if those real-life elements were present in the story and if the characters had to work out their problems under that glare. A subplot involving the widower's sister-in-law wanting to be his next wife is used instead to create conflict but it reads too much like a simplistic contrivance by the author to create more conflict. The sister-in-law is created in such broad strokes that I thought at one point she was going to turn into a murderess just to make her a complete &quot;stock character.&quot; This is one of those instances where the book really deserves a 3.5 star grading but Amazon does not include half a star ratings in its system. I'd like to see another author tackle this same premise and really turn up the heat in the story's conflict."},{"Title":"The Wrong Child","review":"Eleven years ago, there was a nasty storm that left the Cyrus Hurley General Hospital in the Texas Panhandle understaffed. That night two little girls were born to two families traveling through the area. The sixty plus year old nurse on duty was extra tired from a double shift and thought the identifications of the babies had been mistakenly changed when she died in the new born wing.Single mom Abbie Bernard and her eleven years old daughter Kendall move to her hometown of Houston so she can find more work as a freelance researcher. Since Kendell has been tired lately, Abbie takes her to see her former doctor. Kendell suffers from anemia, but the shocker is the child's &quot;AB&quot; blood type 100 per cent excludes Abbie's &quot;O&quot; type from her being the biological mother.Abbie traces the other girl to local architect Logan O'Connell whose wife Anne died three years ago. Abbie uses a pretense to meet her biological daughter Erin and learns that Kendell has an older brother. As the two families begin to intermingle, protecting the two girls is paramount, superseding the blossoming love between the single parents. Adding to the mess is Anne's sisters' manipulation of Erin to obtain her hearts desire: Logan.THE WRONG CHILD is the right book for any romance reader who relishes a powerful family drama. The story line works because the cast makes it plausible. As the key players learn of the hospital's error, they react within their already developed personality traits. Best-selling author Patricia Kay has written a warm contemporary romance within a dynamic family drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Wrong Child","review":"This followed a true story that happen in Florida many years ago.

I literally could not put it down and read it in one day. You will hate Aunt Elizabeth (which is good, since that means Ms Kay did her job) You will love Abbie, Kendall, Logan, and brother.

Tuttle manages to pull together an array of primary sources including newspaper articles, meeting minutes, and first-hand accounts, both written and oral, to tell the story of the Chicago Race Riot. His goal is to write history \\"from the bottom up\\", and in this, he is successful.My only complaint is that by focusing heavily on individual accounts and exceptions to the norm, Tuttle misses out on some broader historical trends. However, since his stated goal is to write a study of \\"individuals as well as groups\\", this approach is understandable, and, in places, even desirible.This is one of the only books on the subject of the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, and, as such, it should be of interest to anyone studying the history of Chicago or the history of race relations in the United States."},{"Title":"Race riot;: Chicago in the Red Summer of 1919 (Studies in American Negro life)","review":"Most people view race relations in the United States in the context of their own times. I would even be willing to bet that most non-black Americans know little about any civil rights issues that roiled the country in the days before they were born. Since I was coming of age in the late 1960s, many of my views on the subject had been shaped for better or worse by events that took place during that turbulent decade. But I always knew there had to be more to the story than the simplistic bad Southerner/good Northerner hogwash most of us were fed in school. Race Riot offers those of open minds an opportunity to learn that racism is a lot more complicated than a mere dislike of a group because of skin color.My family is from Chicago and I got my copy of this book from my maternal grandfather who was interested in all things Chicago and who according to notes in the front of the book remembered exactly where he was when the troubles began. This made it doubly exciting for me to read. In Race Riot, author Tuttle starts by recounting the incident that ignited the racial tinderbox that Chicago had become in the years leading up to the riot's eruption. He covers in great detail the issues of overcrowding, the massive infux of rural Southern blacks and their subsequent ghettoization, inter-ethnic labor competition, the cynical policies of Chicago's city leaders, and any social and economic factors that led to polarization of feelings between the races. He writes of the New Negro, recently back from the war in Europe, who had heightened expectations of social and economic progress. And he writes of corrupt politicians, black and white, whose graft and conniving had helped turn black neighborhoods into crime-ridden cesspools of vice and degeneracy. Most importantly, Tuttle gives the reader a glimpse of the history of race-related riots in the US dating from the days before the Civil War on up through the ones in the early 20th century that did so much to fuel a sense of frustration among Chicago's black residents.Race Riot is not a perfect book by any means and often is steeped in a pioneer style of mealy-mouthed political correctness, but it is still a valuable tool for students of the history of black-white relations in the United States. Tuttle doesn't bore the reader with irrelevant details but the book is heavily footnoted so those who want to learn more have a multitude of sources to which they can turn. If this is a subject that interests you, then you are sure to find this an absorbing read."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},G=["disabled"],W={key:0},x={key:1};function L(s,e,n,c,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",x,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",W,"See more"))],8,G)):b("",!0)])}const z=u(B,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-9a7aa001"]]),J=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/52.md","filePath":"guide/52.md"}'),q={name:"guide/52.md"},j=Object.assign(q,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(z)]))}});export{J as __pageData,j as default};
