Brain has to learn to survive in the harsh environment of the Canadian wilderness. Brian went to see his dad but is now stuck, alone in the woods.This is definitely one of Paulsen's better pieces, but it doesn't hold a candle to The Transall Saga. This book is written in good ole' American style. This book is exciting but doesn't have to many details like the European style. Hatchet is a good book though it lacks in detail in some places. When Brian is hunting it shows very little detail however makes up for this flaw in the action of these parts.Brian is utterly calm in some situations. Have you ever met someone like this? This kind of person is usually calm and collected in any situation, no matter how bad.I recommend this book to anyone who likes The Transall Saga. If you do not like the outdoors do not even pick this book up. This book is more for guys, because there is only one very minor female character.

I would definitely recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson, a 13-year-old boy, is going to meet his father for the first time after his parent's divorce. Brian is the only passenger on a small bush plane when the pilot dies of a heart attack and the plane crashes into a lake. Brian must survive alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a hatchet. He must face challenges that most stranded people must face. He needs to find shelter, food, water and multiple other things to help him survive. I liked how the story ended, but if I told you what happened I would spoil the book for you. I think this could actually happen and I completely recommend this book to people of all ages that like action and suspense."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Read this out loud to my younger boys, 7 and 10, and they loved it. Paulsen did a great job of connecting with the main character's emotional core, as well as directing the exciting, rollercoaster ride of having crashed in a plane and providing a litmus test for survival. Ordeal driven, the book is a wonderful lesson in perseverance and finding the will to live when seemingly every obstacle stands in your way. Fantastic book for kids."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book keeps your interest the whole way through. Fun read about survival and adventure. Will be reading more books by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is a fictional adventurous survival story of Brian Robeson.I recommend this book to people that like adventure stories."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a powerful story of will and determination at it's best. The telling of this story sheds light into a young reader's heart that they too can survive, if they have the courage and determination to want to. This book inspires all who reads and has you rooting for Brain through out the read!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I'm sorry to all of those who loved this book. But personally, I thought this book was not exactlly the best. The symbolism all boiled down to the same thing. The story didn't move. There wasn't any main theme that made the plot more bearable. This is one of the only books I ever put down and never picked up again to finish."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is just about the worst book I hve ever read in my life. The sequence of events is dull and extremly predictable. Don't read this book if you have a choice."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I just read this book that my 9-year-old read in public school. I cannot believe this book is a Newbery Honor book. I cannot believe this book is actually encouraged to be read. (My son said the teacher played an audio introduction to the book, and if they wanted to continue reading it on their own they could.) Not even halfway through the book, the boy named Brian has vomited three times and almost a fourth (is this really necessary?). Also, about halfway through, 13-year-old Brian begins to despair that he will ever be saved so he takes his hatchet and begins cutting his arm to try and end it all. Nothing like teaching our children how to despair and attempt suicide! This book is in no way a positive moral example of great literature. If you would like to read something that is, I highly suggest \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" by Scott O'Dell rather than this trash. Beautifully written and much more worth your time."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hi everybody!We (Marissa and Emma, both 14 y/o) read that book in school but the German version. We had to read it! We don't like it very much we both think that the book is boring. Because you can't write too much about \\"Being alone in a space without anyone\\". The topic is kind of interesting, but the author took the story too long. He always writes \\"I am Brian, I am 13, I rescued a plane crash\\" and so on.We wouldn't say that book is exciting.Marissa R. and Emma D."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian's story of survival seemed interesting...at first. The story dragged out at an indescribably slow pace and was rather like reading a telephone book, or dictionary. The author repeated words to give them more meaning, and to help you feel Brians pain and yearning for his old life, which was nice, the first few times. It became extremely repetitive and made the reading unenjoyable. I would certainly not recommend this read to anyone at all."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"In English class earlier this semester, the book the Hatchet was the topic of all of our novel studies, and english discussions! We were told to read the book in two weeks and prepare a good solid essay on our points of view! This book was soo boring. I actually found myself skipping chapters just so that I could get through the book faster! It is soo dumb how all of a sudden he is in the middle of a tornado and how a moose is running him over?!? Soo many times in my essay I found myself using the words boring and lame. This book is annoyingly dumb and I can't understand how any one person can enjoy such a lame book! To sum up this review I write--- World class yah right!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"What a horrible, boring, time wasting concoction of cardboard, paper, glue, and stupidity.

Spare yourself, forget this bore of a read!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian kept on using the &quot;Secret&quot;. Paulsen could've left that out. I didn't like his style of writing. Some details went a little far on plucking a bird and having the guts come out, etc."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book flat-out stinks. It reads as if it were dashed off during the commercials in an afternoon of TV watching."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This realistic fiction was an adventurous and suspenseful book. Brian was furious, because Mr. and Mrs. Robeson, his parents, had gotten a divorce. He was in a two person plane going to see his dad. Then all of a sudden, the pilot had a heart attack and croaked. Brian decided to try and land the plane in a lake. When the plane finally went down, he tore free and swam to shore. There he gathered and ate berries. He found a hollowed out place in some lime stone to make some sort of shelter. He wove willow together to form a wall and left an opening for a door. He finally figured out how to make a fire. He made a fish spear but never caught any fish. Then one morning he remembered that water bends light, so the image would actually be a little below where it appeared to be. After a few tries, Brian caught his first fish! It tasted so delicious! Soon he would be able to kill what he called a fool bird. He lived like this for a while. Then he remembered the survival pack in the back of the plane. He finally got the survival pack. Will he be able to live through the winter with the survival pack and his new knowledge, or will someone rescue him? I recommend this book to anyone who likes realistic and suspenseful fiction."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My review: Hatchet 1# Brian Robensen has just met his fate! With only his hatchet and knowledge he has just crashed a Canadian wilderness! This book is very suspenseful for example he encounters a psychotic moose that almost drowns him! But that's not all there's much more to come just read the book! I would recommend this book to 4-9 grades because it has some parts that may be inappropriate for younger kids! In my position I love this book and my favorite part was when he got the survival pack! Well that's it for now!

Brian is a 13 year old boy whose parents got a divorce, his dad moved and he was riding on a plane to get to his dads for the summer. Why this book is called hatchet is because before he left, his mother gave him a belt buckle hatchet. While he was on the plane the pilot had a terrible hard attack! Brian had to fly the plane by himself until the plane crashed.Don't worry, Brian made it out safely, but sadly the pilot did not. The pilot had died while the plane was in the air. Afterwards, Brian finds himself only with his clothing, a tattered windbreaker and a hatchet his mother had given him as a present. Brian runs into a bear, porcupine, and a moose. I like this book because it has so many good parts in it and it's a \`can't put it down' book if you know what I mean.I recommend this book to some one who loves to read and who loves adventure, also a little sadness.By, Ray Ray"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a story about a boy who survived the wild. There are a lot of ways I can define Brain Robeson, the boy how survived the wild. One way I would define Brain is that he was strong and never gave up. I think this because in one part, a tornado comes and destroys Brian's shelter. Instead of pouting and giving up, he tried again and rebuilt his shelter. In another part, a moose attacks him. He tried to get away, but the moose hurt him badly. Instead of just lying there, he tried to get away and then he kept his spirits up while he healed. I think that shows he is strong and determined.I liked this book because it teaches a person how to survive in the wild. It also shows how to be determined when something bad happens. I would recommend this book to someone who likes the wild and enjoys camping.Submitted by, StockyAge 10."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think this book is a wonderful choice for a sit-down book.

Hatchet is by far the best of Paulsen's many.

After a few hours of flying the plane Brian lands the plane on a lake. In the crash Brian breaks through the glass and swims up to the surface with some scars and bruises. The Hatchet that his mom bought him was still clipped to his belt. He slept for a while and awoke the next morning on the ground next to the lake. He new he had to get a shelter up before dark so he looked around and found a cave made of stone. He found some wood from the forest and put the wood in front of the cave so it left a doorway about three feet high. He solved other problems like finding food, making fire, and adapting to the wildlife.This book is very exiting and many people could relate to many parts of this book. I recommend this book to anybody looking for a short good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book in my opinion is a very good amazing book about a boy who survives. The book is about a boy named Brian who gets lost in the wilderness after an accident. He tries to take on the challenge of man vs. nature with only a hatchet. This book in my opinion teaches you how to survive in the wilderness by yourself without any electronics. Even if you don't like non-fiction survival books you should give this one a chance by reading it. If you don't like the beginning of this book, I suggest you keep reading until about Chapter 7 as it evolves into the quest for survival."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever been lost?Well you know that they will come and find you right away.Well Brian is lost in the worst possible place ever when he is only 13 years old.Brian goes to see his Dad in Canada because his parents are divorced but the pilot who takes Brian to canada has a heart attack and the plane gets out of control and lands in a lake.Brian finds himself in the middle of the woods lost with only a hatchet.This book is suspenseful and keeps you reading to the very end.If you are a person who loves to read fictional and suspenseful books,then this book is perfect for you!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. I gave it a five star rating for its wonderful insides.I gave Hatchet a five star rating because I thought it was a wonderful book. I love Paulsen's wonderful detail. In his book the way he writes he repeats things like he repeats mistakes, divorce, and secrets. I think this strengthens his writing and makes it more intriguing. This book is one of my favorites I feel I could read it over and over again and never get tired of it.He has explicit details in the parts where he describes the crash and how Brian rips his fingernails off when he was trying to open his seat belt and that whole scene. He was left in the wild to suffer alone. He always overcomes his obstacles and his fears. He builds his fire, avoids the bear he stumbles on to, catches fish, builds a spear then a bow and arrow and survives for the time he has to live.I hope you chose this book because it is the best. Reading isn't my favorite thing to do but this was worth my while. I would also recommend Dogsong, Woodsong, Sleeping Freshman Never Lie, and the Giver. I am a 7th grader in a Cabarrus county school."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was very good but not the best that is why I gave four stars but over all it was good.

I really like to read what the main character of the book is always getting himself into."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"If you like to read mild adventure books and read a lot of Gary Paulsen or thinks he's a pretty good writer, you should read the Hatchet series (Hatchet, Brain's Winter, Brain's Return) they were all good. I call it the Hatchet series, because it's three books that continue on to each other. Except Brain's Winter and Brain's Return aren't exactly continuations. But overall the series is pretty good. I would read all three again and again. The books are all very detailed and descriptive."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think that Hatchet is a great book for several reasons.

I like this story but a little difficult to understand for me. This book told me important things that if I fall in black despair, even I keep a hope and try it my self, I may find the road I should go. I recommand this book to children. Of corse any one that is stading English now."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian who was thirteen-year-old got on a plane with a pilot to visit his father.

This story tells us it is important to accomplish as hard as you can. And you can learn how to survive in a place which is nothing. Because this story drows all eyes.

Through this life, he learned how to survive by making mistakes. Though0 I could't find this book's message at first, as the story goes on I found the interest of book. But there are descriptions which are too real to read. I don't like the kind of these discripotion. I like this book because it is no only about adventure but also has some messages. Superficially, the central od this story is how to survive and about his life in wilderness. But I think that the book include any type of messages. For example, about divorce, overcoming something like that.

Brian going to change his character. First time, he was very weak, but he became strong person. I think is very good for teenagers or for English student.

I recommend this book to people who like adventure stories."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The story is about a boy who gets lost in the Canadian wilderness. He is the lone survivor and makes it through fifty-four days in the wilderness with his brains, common sense, and a hatchet. The hatchet is his link to the world he left behind and the key to his survival. The story tells how the boy progresses from helplessness to resourcefulness. In the end, the boy is finally rescued and brought back to civilization. It is a fairly fast-moving story for only having one character. The author's descriptions make you feel as it you were there with the boy.I would recommend this book to anyone in my age group, or older. The story is well-written and very descriptive. The story itself follows logically from point to point. You can actually imagine being with the boy going through his problems and conflicts. I think anyone in my age group, both males and females, would enjoy such a great book.My favorite part of the story was when the boy experiences his discovery of building a fire. After going through desperate measures, he uncovers a certain type of rock in the wall that explodes with sparks when hit with the metal of the hatchet. This allows the boy to get such a brilliant, blazing fire going as soon as those sparks caught onto his woodpile. As a result, the boy was able to cook his meals. The exhilerating story was full of other adventures that I also enjoyed, but this was one of the best. I absolutely think this story is one of the best I've read so far."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HACHET IS ABOUT A BOY WHO IS GOING TO MEET HIS DAD.THE PLANE CRASHES AND HE'S THE ONLY SURVIVOR.

This is a good book for preteens and those just becoming teenagers, boys perhaps more than girls."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is about a boy named Bryan Robeson who goes to visit his divorced father for the summer. As he is flying towards his destination of Canada, the plane crashes, leaving Bryan as the lone survivor. He is stranded in the wilderness with only the clothes he is wearing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a farewell gift. Bryan must learn to survive in wild with the knowledge of the divorce and The Secret that caused it, tormenting him at every moment.I really enjoyed this book, because, although it has scarcely any dialogue, Paulsen manages to keep you interested, keeps you reading, curious about Bryan's fate. You start to wonder what you would do if in Bryan's shoes."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"In the book, Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, Brian is going to visit his dad in Canada. Everything goes well until Brian's pilot has a heart attack. Brian ends up having to crash land the plane into the water. Brian somehow survives, but unfortunately the pilot doesn't. But sadly Brian was so scared that he tried killing himself by cutting himself with his hatchet. Now Brian has to survive in the Northern Canadian woods all alone for who knows how long. I definitely recommend this book because it is very detailed and well thought out.Brian plays a big part in this book. Brian is a very intelligent kid that knows a lot about being outdoors. Brian ends up having to do some weird things such as take a shower four times a day because he was sprayed by a skunk. Brian also ends up learning a lot too. Brian can teach himself things like how to spear a fish. He learned one day while he was spearing fish that in the water there is some kind of reflection, so you don't aim straight at the fish. He also taught himself how to crash land a plane into the water. The cool thing about Brian is that he is smart, but he knows how to make himself smarter.The main point of this book is survival. Brian struggles but finally successfully finds the survival pack in the plane containing food, matches, pots, medicine, and a compass. Brian has to live out in the woods all by himself with just a hatchet. Brian ends up making a spear, a bow, a raft, and a shelter, all with just the hatchet. Brian had a big log shelter and to improve it, he wove little sticks through it to make it kind of like a basket. He of course spears fish with the spear, but it took him a while to actually get the fish. Brian also learns how to shoot deer, moose, and some other animals with his bows. So in other words, Brian taught himself how to hunt.This book takes place in the northern Canadian woods. The woods are near the little lake where Brian had to crash land the plane. In these woods there are many big animals such as, moose, bear, deer, etc. But unfortunately Brian had to kill some of the animals to survive. Every now and then Brian will go for a swim in the pond near the woods.Overall this book was great, probably one of the best books I've ever read. I would recommend this book to a person who enjoys reading nonfiction books and knows what its like to be out in the woods. This book is now easy to read, but not too hard either. You also might enjoy this book a little bit more if you hunt. If you enjoy reading and learning about survival you would love this book. All in all I really enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to reading all the sequels."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Plot Summary:Brian Robeson, a 13-year-old boy, travels to see his father in Northern Alaska in a little two-seat plane. On the way, the pilot suffers a massive heart attack and crashes hundreds of miles off course. Brian must learn to survive - alone - against the hugeness of the wilderness. Masses of mosquitoes, canny foolbirds, gutcherries, a tornado, and an insane moose seem to be working together to bring around his demise. With only a hatchet and his wits, can Brian manage to survive long enough to be rescued?My Review:Even though this classic story is almost twenty years old and has reached an almost pedestal-like level of acclaim, it has managed to not be read by me up until now - through no fault if its own. I always figured a book that had garnered that much praise would never live up to the standards I had set for it, and was somewhat reluctant to read it. However, I am planning a Hatchet unit for later on this school year with my fourth graders, and had to finally read the book. I am pleased to say that it is as good a book as I have heard.The author goes to quite a length to make the facts in the story not only accurate, but makes the plot itself almost non-fiction with its realism. I read somewhere that he actually went out and tried all the things Brian does in the story - and it shows. The book is absolutely fantastic - a solid, multi-dimensional main character, a wonderfully beautiful and dangerous setting, a twisting and active plot line, and even the admirable, overall theme of humans not being above nature and \\"conquering\\" it, but that humans are just a small piece of the natural world.Sewn throughout the story is an ironic tone, making the story much more enjoyable to read that a normal survival story would have. The story could easily have focused on the emotional turmoil and the loneliness too much, but Gary Paulsen touches on the negative feelings and then moves on. This makes the story much less dark, and thus more appropriate for younger audiences, like my fourth graders.It is hard to put praise on top of the mountain of commendations that have already been heaped on this book. To repeat them seems rather monotonous; so I will wrap up this review by saying that if you have not yet read this book, do so! I know that I will be going to the library soon and picking up a copy of the sequels with the hope that they are anywhere near the literary quality of Hatchet. That is the best praise I can give to any author."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I loved this book so much it showed a lot of good actions in words.It was about a boy that was in an airplane when the pilot had a heart-attak.The boy's name was Brian.He did not know how to fly an airplane.He crashed in a place where there was a pond beside him.There was a tornado and it flipped the plane in the pond. the boy got really hungry after about 2 or 3 days he has been eating turtle eggs.He decided to go to get the survival bag that was in the plane.The end ended up that the boy heard an airplane and it dropped down and got Brian."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I gave it 5 stars, because it was adventurous, with some action, and survival book. All of my favorites. I read 6 hours straight, I did not want to put it down! It was so good I'm going to read it again!Michael G., age 12"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I would rate this book 5 stars because it is a very good book. Brian Robeson is flying north to see his father when the pilot has a major heart attack. They crash land into a pond and Brian gets stranded. This is a gripping novel that pulls you right into the book. Gary Paulsen explains it so well, that it felt like I was in the actual plane when it crashed. In the bush, Brian encounters moose, wolves, and a tornado. They all drive Brian further into hunger, aloneness, and craziness. The point of view of the book is excellent. It is told right from Brian himself, as if he was right there telling it to you. I would consider the genre of the book to be an adventurous book. The sequels to Hatchet (shown in order) are The River, Brian's Winter, Brian's Return, and Brian's Hunt. Gary said he might actually publish another book about Brian. I would recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I thought this book was one of the best books I've ever read.It's like it made me keep reading it. I loved the fact that ithad only 1 character because it was easier to focus on what wasgoing on. My favorite part is when Brian eats the foolbirdbecause it sounds so delicious and I imediately wanted some.Anyone who is unsure about reading this book shouldn't be.It is a great book for all ages. I also think the fact I couldrelate to some of it might have had something to do with itbut I still loved it.I hope others enjoy a wonderful story about a crash, beingready, and survival in the wilderness."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian is thirteen years old and is completely stranded with only a hatchet to survive. Brian Robeson's parents divorce so he has to take plane rides to visit his dad, who built a self cleaning self sharpening drill. In his trip the pilot teaches Brian how to keep the plane steady. During his flight he realized that the pilot was having a heart attack. Brian took the wheel and kept it steady until he ran out of fuel and landed in an L-shaped lake. Brian had to live of the land until someone found him. Eventually he was able to get into the plane and find a distress beacon and get back to civilization.This was a very thrilling book. You really get attached to Brian and fear for his life. I suggest this book to anyone who has free time or has to read a book for school.Brian displayed great courage many times in this book like when he grabbed the wheel of the plane and kept it steady a lot of people would have lost their cool in that situation. Also it took a lot of courage to venture back into the plane even though he knew that there was a dead body waiting for him. These are just a few of the times that he displayed great courage.In this book you could really see the main character developing. Like when he ate those bad berries and got sick but then later he was able to figure out how to eat what the animals were eating. I really enjoyed seeing the main character mature through this story.The conflict in this book was very interesting because you couldn't really tell who the antagonist was. It could have been nature because he had to survive in nature. Also it could have been his divorced parents because they were the actual cause of the problem because he was on a plain going to visit his dad.This was an all around great book I really didn't want to put it down. The main character Brian was very interesting because he wasn't just a stock character. I would definitely recommend this book to any one who is looking for a good riveting book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"If you like wilderness or hunting books, then this book is for you.

First you start with a happy family, then the divorce, but why the divorce. Its because the secret. The secret is why Brain has to go to Canada.Also why he is in thw wilderness and why he got in a plane crash on his way there. Hw will brian get out or will he get out this is all a secret but is it the big secret? what will happen? Will he get out? What will he use to survive????? Read this awesome book by Gary Paulsen to find out!!! This review is made By: Carissa"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It was slightly better than I expected, though still pretty uninteresting with large gaps filled with nothing but boredom. (Comparable to Deathly Hallow's camping scenes) However, I did like Gary Paulson's narration style quite a bit, it came off as very natural and conversational. The one thing that bothered me about the narration was the repetition. There were lots of ideas that were repeated for no apparent reason (\\"He would have to find something to eat. Before he did anything else, he would have to have something to eat.\\" (57)) This is neither realistic nor simplistic, and just ends up annoying the reader tremendously. I also thought that Brian was not a very consistent character, sometimes showing traits of a boy well beyond his age, and sometimes acting like a five year old would. Brian's repetitive TV/movie related realizations were really getting irksome as well. I suppose it's just hard to relate to this book and some of the things Brian had to do to survive simply due to the fact that I've never been placed in such a situation, so it's very hard to relate. I did not like the convenience of the emergency kit at the end, and the fact that there was no resolution about The Secret was probably the most irritating part of all--why mention it in the first place if you won't solve it?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Although I have enjoyed Peter Coyote's voiceover on many documentaries, I found this work to be on the boring side. The book has many exciting segments, begging for an excited narration. I was a bit disappointed in his oft monotone, soft voice. When used chapter by chapter in the English Language Arts classroom, this rendition suffices. I will use it again as a teaching companion to reading the novel."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian, a small town boy is on his way to his dad's house and he is traveling by airplane. The pilot of the plane has a massive heart attack that kills him. Brian is scared because he has to land the plane by his self but he does not know how to land a plane at all.Brian thinks he will be dead for sure until he finds the safety kit in side the wrecked plane. It contained a .22 survival rifle, fishing pole and freeze-dried food. Did he die of starvation or did he eat the nasty freeze-dried food. A pilot stopped on the island and saw Brian and did not know who he was, but when he found out that it was Brian, he was highly shocked because he was missing for 7 months. Read the book and you will find out if he is dead or alive when the pilot finds himThis book teaches you to respect and to not take your family for granted while your parents are still together. The reason it teaches you to do that is because his parents had a divorce and while he was gone they missed him dearly because they didn't know if he was dead or alive.The book was good because it was adventurous and showed Brian's hardships in word form. The book also shows how happy he was when he killed his first fish and ate it. However he wasn't so happy when he found out that the fish was eating on the corpse of the dead pilot.I would recommend this book to people that are an adventurous person or if you like adventurous books. The age group would be ages 12 and up. The reason I picked that age group is because younger children may not understand the book.This is a good book in my opinion you might like it to if you read it. If not, you can read more of Gary Paulson's award winning books.By josh"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"i am a 6th grader.

His parents just got a divorce because his mother was cheating, so his father moved away. He went on a plane to visit his father over summer break, and while he was on the plane the pilot had a heart attack and died so Brian had to steer it. The plane was running out of fuel so Brian had to let it come down. The plane landed in a lake and Brian got out and had to survive in the wilderness until he found out how to get out. He was a city boy so he has no clue about how to survive, like what berries to eat or how to catch a fish, simple things he didn't know how to do.This book was a good book, I enjoyed it except some parts I couldn't understand what the author was trying to describe what he was going through at some parts.

It is only him and the pilot on the way there flying over the canadian woods. Oh no, the pilot has a hard attack, Can Brian fly a plane?? Hatchet also has suspense, I did not want to put the book down. Hatchet also made me fall in love with it, because me and Brian are somewhat alike. I love to hear what he does to survive. I also love this book because it is so descriptive and easy to picture in your head. Read this book, you will like it, I gaurantee it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book when I was very young, about 6 or 7 years old, and loved it. Paulsen's tone of writing has an ebb and flow that is becoming increasingly rare. He doesn't tarry (like Lord of the Flies) on motionless landscapes, but delves the reader straight into the heart of the action.Josh's psyche is deep and ponderous, and I sensed the tincture of lunacy lurking at the back of his mind. The castaway children-novel has been used quite a few times, but no noticable cliches in this book. (or they're just marvelously disguised)Very satisfying read. I'd recommend it to anyone, young or old.Lavaix"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It all started with a divorce. Brian, a thirteen year old kid from New York,is going to visit his father in the wilderness of Canada,where he now lives after the divorce. Brian steps into the copilot seat of the small bush plane. He waves good-bye to his mom as the plane takes off. About half way to his destination, the pilot starts complaining about terrible cramps. The cramps get worse until the pilot passes out. He's had a heart attack. Now Brian must fly the plane alone. After running out of fuel, Brian crash lands in a lake in the middle of the Canadian wilderness. This is the beginning of an incredible survival story of an inner city boy.I really enjoyed this book a lot. The way Gary Paulsen writes it, every chapter pulls you deeper and deeper into this amazing story. Although anyone would enjoy this book to the very end, I think people who like the outdoors would get the most out of Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"...The pilot let him take the wheel only for a moment on Brian's side of the plane.

Also it was very action paked with adventure. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for some outdoors and also some fun. This book will keep you interested all the way threw and also keep you on the edge of your seat. As you are about to read is one of the rising actions of this book.Brian is looking out the window looking at the vast wilderness below him wondering, why did his parents split up and what was the secret. He started to cry and tried to hide it from the pilot. He was on his way to see his Dad in Canada working on a oil rig. There was one thing that Brian's mom told him before he left the airport.\\"Get in the co-pliots seat!.\\" And he did. Brian was not very fond of the pilot cause for one he did not mine passing gas all through the plane ride. He was also moaning loudly and rubbing his chest and shoulders. Brian tried to ignore him the best that he could. But the one thing that was mostly on his mind was why there was such thing as divorce. The secret of why they split up in the first place. The more he thought about it the more he started to cry. The pilot started to really moan now. HE must have been in a lot of pain. Then suddenly the pilot shot back into his seat yelling and screaming. Brian started to panic he did not know what to do. The suddenly stopped moving and foam was coming out of his mouth.Brian was shocked and looked around for something to help. He put his ear to his chest and there was no pluse. It was surtain that he was having a heart attack. So Brian saw the radio and picked it up and said \\"Hello! Hello! Is anyone out there, my pilot is having a heart attack and I do not know how to fly the plane!\\" But there was no answer, then suddenly a fuzzy\\"What is your position son.\\" answered back. Brian yelled into the radio\\"I donno somewhere in the middle of Canada. But there was no answer back. And there Brian was alone by himself without anyone. He looked out the front of the plane as the nose of it started to go down.If you would like to read the rest of the book I am not going to type the rest of it so you will just have to find it and read the book yourself."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book so that I could understand my son's homework assignments. I enjoyed the book, but wonder why it is so highly regarded. It is a wonderful coming of age story. I did enjoy the imagery and appreciated the lessons it taught, but I question the violence of the plane crash as well as the negative connotations about the reason for his parents' divorce. I wish the book had just noted that the divorce had happened and that Brian was visiting his father for the summer. I did not appreciate the entire story line about THE SECRET. I was shocked when I read the THE SECRET in a book for 5th graders. I think the story line should have been divorce neutral instead of placing blame on the mother who was portrayed in a negative light throughout the book. I worry about a 5th grader whose parents are going through a divorce or who are divorced and that child's reaction to THE SECRET. Whatever happened to Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think the book Hatchet is a good book to read. The story of Hatchet is about a boy that gets lost in the wilderness and he has to figure out how to survive there. He has to build tools and uses his brain to survive out in the wilderness.

He endures many hardships along the way from trying to survive. The boys name is Brian Robeson and he is thirteen years old.

Read this book and its sequals."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"There is something lacking in Paulsen's style. There was no distinguishable climax, and plot structure was no where to be seen. There was sometihng unrealistic about Brian's survival attempts. It was as if the book droned on for ever, and the end was no where in sight. Things that should have been summarized and made shorter took up pages; things that should have been packed with detail, description, and emphasis took a matter of sentences. I was itching in my seat for the book to be over. It's keeps you on the edge of your seat because you really want to get up and put the book down."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"In Hatchet, a boy, Brian, is on a plane on his way to visit his dad in Canada.

I was hooked from the very beginning and I don't usually like adventure/survival type books. What I liked most about the book is that it is about a boy that was my same age (when I read the book), the forest area reminded me a lot of Island Park, Idaho and so it made it easier to relate to. &quot;Hatchet&quot; reminds me of &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins,&quot; by Scott O'Dell because both of the characters had to learn how to survive by themselves.

Just recently, I came across it at a garage sale and decided to give it another go. Paulsen is incredible! Everything he does is great; he really heightens his reader's awareness, an important thing to do when you're writing for children. There are a couple scenes I found a bit disturbing (ie. seeing pilot having a heart attack, kid seeing pilots face after it had been eaten away at by fish), so I'd have to say this book is more appropriate for older children.

I read a section of the book (the first mosquito attack) to the young men nearby. EVERY one of the boys has since read this book - MORE THAN ONCE. My son not only read the book, but we made a mobile to hang in his room. We often discuss &quot;what would I do in the same situation&quot; senarios that I can see maturing my son in his reasoning ability right before my ears. The story has been told before and since, but Paulsen has a grasp of what a young man thinks in an alien environment - and through Brian offers solutions to life's wickedly dealt hand.

This makes &quot;Hatchet&quot; an exciting book, because the reader is scared right along with Brian, happy with him, and even hungry with him.Paulsen uses this same theme, of character getting lost in the wilderness and finding himself, in many of his books. In fact, there are three other books about Brian. One is a sequel to &quot;Hatchet&quot;, another is based upon a different ending to &quot;Hatchet&quot;, and a third is a sequel to that book.

He is lost and alone in the wilderness with only a hatchet, how long will Brian survive? Well if you want to find out go to your nearest library and check out this great book hatchet!The book hatchet is written by Gary Paulsen and the main character is Brian Robinson. He's thirteen and lost and alone in the wilderness with only a hatchet, how long will Brian survive? He has to find food, face animals. Brian also has to make a shelter for himself; he got poked by a porky pine while he was lying down in his shelter. He tried throwing his hatchet but he missed and hit a stone that's how he discovered how to make a fire in the wilderness. Brian is so interesting and brave he's also smart because he has to learn how to survive in the wilderness. I would be freaking out right at that moment but not Brian Robinson. This book is sad its gross it's awesome it's..... HATCHET!My favorite part of the book is when the pilot has a heart attack and dies because it was so tradjic and chaotic it's so scary like when I'm reading the book I start to panic because I'm worried about Brian. I try and read faster to see what happens next. The pilot turns pale white and freezing cold like a vampire or something. I love that part. It's almost the first part of the book. I like the way that it pulls you in and you feel like you're really there.The most important thing that I learned from reading this book is that you always have to be prepared for anything. Just so you don't get hurt and so that your always ready for something bad to happen.The other books that are similar to the book hatchet are\\"The river\\", \\"Brian's hunt\\", \\"Tracker\\", ECT.

The forests of northern Canada are looming with dangerous animals like a moose he got attacked by and skunks. The forest's only food is berries and fish from the lake. Also, this is a very dangerous place to be due to the violent storms and quickly changing weather.

On the flight there, the pilot has a heart attack and the plane crashes in the middle of nowhere. Luckily Brian survives the crash but he is way off course because the pilot changed course accidentally during his heart attack. Brian crash landed in a long lake where he had to battle the forces of nature. He had a hatchet that his mother gave him for the trip, which he uses for a variety of survival skills. Due to his lack of materials, Brian had to figure out how to find food and make shelter with whatever he could find. During his period of time that he is lost in the woods, Brian makes a small hut and a fire with his hatchet, figures out how to catch fish with a spear and learns many other ways to survive. He constantly tells himself to keep believing in himself even though he thought he should give up because his life back home was a mess and he probably wouldn't come out of the forest the same. Why do you think the author chose to end Hatchet the way he did?I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars. I think the author used very intricate details about the events that happened throughout the book. Although he used intricate details, he did not describe the characters very well. The only character the author described which was brief was Brian. The author did not describe his mother or father very much. I really enjoyed the parts of the book where the author talked about all the different ways Brian discovered how to survive and all the different tools he used to survive. The author was very detailed and descriptive about all the events that happened to Brian such as a moose attacking him. The way the author was able to describe all the different parts of the moose attack, like the way the moose hit Brian and how Brian felt when he got up where great to read. If you were looking for a book to read soon, I would strongly recommend Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"How many problems do you think can occur through out a novel? The River is an intense thrill full of problems that Brian has to overcome. Every problem that you can think that will happen happens.I like how Gary Paulson started this great series of books.

Brian is forced to live by himself until he can find support to get him back to his house.

The life lessons and morals taught in the story are well needed in todays world."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"For a project in school I had to read Hatchet. I did not want to but I did. I am glad I read it because it was wonderful. The book is about a boy in a plane going to see his dad in Canada. The plane crashes after the pilot dies. The boy, named Brian, is alone in the widerness and has no one to turn to for help. He then uses his one and only tool, the hatchet, his mother had given him. He makes a home and is able to find food long enough to last him months. While he is there he changes into what he called, \\"the new Brian\\". After a tornado and a few attacks he sees the boat and remembers the emergency pack inside of it. One morning he makes a raft and he floats out to the plane to get the pack. He gets the pack and it has food, drinks, and a gun. He sees a transmitter and flips a swith a few times. Soon, a plane comes to take him home.

I would highly recommend for young readers as it inspires young people to believe in themselves."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulsen's Hatchet is a great survival story about a thirteen year-old boy, Brian Robeson, who must survive in the Canadian wilderness. He's going to see his father for the summer (his parents are divorced) when the pilot of his small plane has a massive heart attack and dies. Brian must control the plane for nearly three hours before running out of gas and crashing into a lake.Gary Paulsen uses some great foreshadowing because at one point he describes how trees were knocked down in a path. This later comes into the story and has a great effect on Brian. Once something happened, I realized why Gary Paulsen put detail into what he described to make it a foreshadowing. Gary Paulsen uses great detail in things you might not want to have detail such as when Brian sees the pilot and his dead body. Hatchet is a Newberry Medal winner and it's a great book for 9 to13 year olds."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson is a thirteen year old boy whose parents are recently divorced. He boards a small plane and is flying over the green of the Canadian forests. When his pilot has a massive heart attack and dies Brian attempts to fly the plane only to have it crash in a small lake. Brian surprisingly survives the crash and comes to out of the water to a sandy tree lined shore. Brian only has the clothes on his back and a hatchet that his mother gave him as a present. Brian about gives up but then realizes how to make fire and a new chance has been given he uses the fire as motivation and it inspires him to catch live food. In this story Brian learns to use all of his abilities to help him survive. He must learn to hunt and find food without panicking. I liked how this story line was put together there was nothing too unbelievable about it except when he finds a aid pack with a rifle in it he decides to not use it to get food. That is the only thing that I think would never happen. This is a good book and I recommend it to everyone who knows how to read. I have never met someone that did not enjoy this book and I think you would to."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I use to hate reading and writing because in the fourth grade my teacher made me read my personal narrative out loud, and it really embarrassed me, but when I got in the sixth grade I started liking it. A lot of it was from you reading to us and teaching us not to write run on sentences.Ms. Parson, do you remember when you read the story Hatchet out loud to the class? Well, that book has really made a difference in my writing and it has made me start liking reading. Before you read that book, I use to hate reading and writing, but then after you read that book to the class it made me realize that reading can be fun if you choose topics that you like and think are interesting.What I liked most about Hatchet was the plot because it had a lot of action/ adventure in it, and I love action/adventure, and it was really funny. So after I read that book I started putting a lot of action/ adventure in my stories. You can see my great adventure in my story \\"Life in the Roman Army.\\"This book has changed the way I write, and it has made me like reading a whole lot better. Thank you for reading Hatchet out loud to the class. It has helped me a whole lot.Another thing that helped me a whole lot is that when you taught us to write complete sentences. Now that you taught me that I now try not to write incomplete sentences and I can pretty much identify if I have incomplete sentences in my writing. It makes it more fun now that I know how to write complete sentences because it makes it easier to write.Thanks again for all of your help.

The story begins when Brain is on a plane going to visit his father because his parents are divorced. During the flight the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane crashes but Brian survives the problem he is stranded to an island and no one where he is. The meaning of this book to me is not how to survive on an island is your plane crashes. It shows how you have to stay strong no matter how difficult life gets. Brian goes through a lot of the same situations most teens got through every day. I think teens like me can learn a lot from this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read almost all of Paulsen's \\"Brian\\" series and all I can tell you is that he has a knack for fiction of this sort. I don't want to resort to cliches, but nothing can describe this book but the \\"I couldn't put it down for a second\\" line. It is very intelligent fiction at its best, and Paulsen's descriptive eye gives you a look at what it's like to be stranded in the Canadian wilderness.I read this book in fifth or sixth grade and I don't usually read modern fictional works, but this was an exception. I feel that modern fiction lacks the eloquent and beautiful language that the classics have, but this book doesn't need fancy pedantics. It does just fine without them.I recommend this to any young reader, or any adult reader, for that matter, if you are interested in the wilderness, outdoors, or general Gary Paulsen.

This book shows all of his feelings and thoughts and you can almost feel the same things he is feeling. It makes you see how lucky people are just to have a frying pan. And when bad things hapen you can feel his sadness and when good things happen you can feel his excitement. I think that this book can be relatable to a lot of people. If you buy this book you will not be sorry that you spent the money. When I finished the book I wished I could forgret everything in it and read it again. This book also inspires you to be greatfull for the things you use and have in everyday life. (I'm age 11)"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My son is a Gary Paulsen fan. He loves hatchet.

While not up to par with similarly themed classics such as Stevenson's &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; or Dafoe's &quot;Robinson Crusoe,&quot; the book has a contemporary feel and the text is for modern audiences."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Last year my entire class and I were forced to read Hatchet. I can truthfully say it was the worst book I've ever laid eyes on... Not only is it slow paced and so repetitive that I once seriously wondered if Paulsen had Alzheimer's, but the teacher made us read it one chapter at a time drawing out my agony.The detail, while amazing, dragged on way too long, (If you can't sit through a thousand different descriptions of the same tree stump don't read this book) and the whole book was completely predicable. So much that I found myself constantly, desperately pleading mentally for Paulsen to either get Brian rescued or kill him off and put me out of my misery.As if the plot and place setting being flawed weren't enough the Protagonist is a complete idiot! It is very hard to feel genuinely sorry for him when the survival pack sat at the bottom of the lake for the entire book and he doesn't think to get it until the books almost over. And as for the scene where the moose attacks Brian, I can't honestly say that I wasn't rooting for the moose.Furthermore, before you even start, don't even try to say I'm just some kid that hates to read because I assure you it's not reading I have problems with (having a genuine love of reading and almost all the book in the local library under my belt) it's this book. To make someone who enjoys reading suffer through this is the worst kind of torture in a civil society I can possibly think of! And I can't image it being any better for someone who can't read well or hates to do so, it could more than likely turn them off reading for life!In conclusion the book got one star because Amazon doesn't have a lower rating."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I started reading this when, with no uncertainty, my son, age 9 years, told me, he \\"Hated!!!\\" the book. I was shocked to learn this \\"Newbury Honor\\" book has a sub-plot of Brian's struggling with his parent's recent divorce!While it is an adventure, intelligent readers will understand the main character is victim of his mother's behavior and initiation divorce. Throughout the book, Brian struggles with the hurt from his parents' separation. It is the reason why he is on the bush plane. He is being ping-ponged to his father for the summer. After he helplessly witnesses the massive heart attack of the pilot at 7,000 feet and knows he's going to die time after time, he continues to get flashbacks of his parents.Our family has been going through a series of complicated marital troubles this year, but we are desperately trying to do everything we can to make things better for the sake of our family and our children and to communicate opening with our children how much we love them and are trying to hold things together. Tragically, this is not the message the author communicates to readers.Families who have been through or approached these painful issues can imagine what having to explain how \\"separating things\\" felt to me and my son. Brian hates judges, who \\"only separate things\\". These issues are painful and are definitely too mature for elementary school readers.While I pity the author, who had an alcoholic parent and ran away from home at an early age, I don't take any pleasure in him trying to identify with my young son who is going through a complicated, confusing time. I certainly don't want the clumsy handling of the subject to make things worse for my son. I'm deeply concerned that Mr. Paulsen does not provide any comfort or recommendations on how to communicate his hurt, confusion and anger to adults in their lives. In fact, Brain keeps his mother's secret long into the author's other subsequent books.While this might be a fine adventure for certain mature middle school and high school aged students, it is definitely inappropriate for the elementary age level. From what I have seen of this book and Dog Song, Paulsen likes to include death scenes in his books. I simply recommend caution to parents, teachers, librarians, and administrators.Mother, Massachusetts"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I was forced to read this book a few years ago in school.

There is a very slim chance that the pilot would have a heart attack on a plane, and then Brian Robeson, the main character, would actually be able to fly the plane at all. Then there would be an even slimmer chance that anyone would survive a crash of such greatness where a wing broke off and the plane crashing into the lake, and then swimming out.

After reading a few negative reviews, I read the book myself (easy read, 2-to-3 hours). I've changed my mind about it being appropriate to give to my nephew, I'll save it for my son and when he's old enough I'll read it with him. I did enjoy the book, and believe that it would be a good read for a young teen with discussion of the quotes below. I'll write the page numbers that are in my copy, your copy may be different. Here are the quotes, so that you can do your own research without reading the entire book:Death of pilot, p 10, 11 Chap 1: \\"The pilot was having a heart attack...Spit came from the corners of his mouth and his legs contracted up, up into the seat, and his eyes rolled back in his head until there was only white.\\"Finding dead pilot in plane when he goes back for survival bag, pg 180, Chap 18: \\"...he saw the pilot's head only it wasn't the pilot's head any longer...all that remained was the not quite cleaned skull and when he looked up it wobbled loosely.\\"Twice the boy, Brian, starts a sentence with \\"God\\": Pg 2, Chap 1: \\"A tearing, ugly word that meant fights and yelling, lawyers-God, he thought, how he hated lawyers...\\"; p 155, Chap 16 (during the tornado): \\"God, he thought, on top of the moose not this - not this.\\"The only instance of prayer mentioned in the book was during the tornado: p 156, Chap 16, \\"He couldn't think, just held and knew that he was praying but didn't know what the prayer was-knew that he wanted to be, stay and be, and then the wind moved to the lake.\\"After the tornado, Brian thinks to himself: p 157, Chap 16, \\"...had lost everything and was back to square one. Just like that. A flip of some giant coin and he was the loser...Is that the best you can do? Is that all you can hit me with-a moose and a tornado.\\"Brian's memory of seeing his mom with another man before his parent's divorce, a secret he kept from his father, p 68, Chap 7: \\"His mother sitting in the station wagon with the man. And she had leaned across and kissed him, kissed the man with the short blond hair, and it was not a friendly peck, but a kiss...\\" Last sentence of book: \\"Brian tried several times to tell his father, came really close once to doing it, but in the end never said a word about the man or what he knew, the Secret.\\"Evolutionary view: p 88, Chap 9: \\"There had been fire for thousands, millions of years.\\" p 90, Chap 9: \\"...a Cro-Magnon man would have a fire by now...\\"In the book, Brian has something revealed to him in a dream, then twice he knows there is danger without knowing how. In my opinion, intuition and the subconscious should be discussed. Brian's dream about fire, p 85,86, Chap 8: \\"That is it, he thought. What they were trying to tell me. Fire...The hatchet was the answer. That's what his father and Terry had been trying to tell him...\\" on pg 120, Chap 13, \\"But something he did not understand had stopped him...It had happened before this way, something had come into him from outside to warn him and he had stopped...\\"Memory of a suicide attempt: On page 122, Chap 13: \\"To where he wanted to die. He had settled into the gray funk deeper and still deeper until finally, in the dark, he had gone up on the ridge and taken the hatchet and tried to end it by cutting himself...but the cutting had been hard to do, impossible to do, and he had at last fallen to his side, wishing for death, wishing for an end, and slept only didn't sleep...\\""},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"this was the WORST book i have ever read. it was so completely boring and dragged on forever. i wouldn't have finished the book had it not been for school."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The middle schoolers at the school I work at recommended this book and I will have to give them a high five on Monday. Brian has a secret, he knows the reason behind his parents' divorce. As he boards a one-engine plane in the co-pilot seat to see his father for the first time in Canada, this is the big thing on his mind. Hours later, when the pilot (who has been passing some horrible gas for a while) clutches his heart and dies, Brian has a lot more to think about. This young man's tale of survival and solitude made me think about the many things we take for granted every day. It also made me think about how modern conveniences have changed us as humans and made us perhaps more crude and uncivilized than the people who came before us.

I really enjoyed the story. It's not long, which I understand since it's for young adults, so you may read it in one sitting. As a former boy scout, I had to laugh at some of Brian's learning curves when he first found himself in the wilderness. The book is the story of his survival, what he learns, and how he changes from a kid to a mature young man. Boys are sure to enjoy the book for it's theme.

Then, the only thing on his mind was divorce. Lost in his thoughts, he watched the pilot die in a major heart attack, and he began to crash land. After he woke and got bitten by angry mobs of mosquitoes, the only thing left on his mind was food. With only a hatchet, he made a shelter, fishing spears, hunting bows and arrows, and most important of all, fire. After few weeks, when everything was fine, (well, at least on his scale of survival,) a tornado struck and all of his hard works disappeared. Next day, when he scanned the area for repairs, his heart rose at the sight of a crash-landed plane's tail. With his heart driving him, he desperately searched for a survival pack somewhere underwater in the plane and he found it. After ooh and ahh-ing at the contents of the survival pack, a plane arrived telling that the pilot caught his signal through the emergence transmitter which Brian was disappointed at seeing that it wasn't MP3.In MY opinion, the theme of this book was to give us some joy, adventure, and happiness, but most important of all, what we need to survive. Most of us may think about internet and money, but let me tell you, less than a week in a wild with only a hatchet, NO WAY!

My older boy has read it already, too, and he also enjoyed reading it. Paulson gives has vivid descriptions of the setting of a boy that is stranded alone in the forest after a plane crash.

Being trapped in the wilderness with only a hatchet and his own skills. Will Brian Survive? Will he ever make it out alive and it's also 195 pages of pure awesomeness by Gary PaulsenA part that I really enjoyed was when he was trying to get to his dad by plane the pilot must not have been feeling well because when Brian was asked to sit in the co pilots seat he was flying for about 7 hours longer but then they finally go down... And then he had to survive on his own with only his hatchet he is going to have to depend on the wilderness he will have to build his own shelter and collect his own food.The most important thing I learned is that you are alive and you are alive if you want to be and you try to be and that surviving in the wilderness is really hard by yourself.Another book that I believe will be great is brains hunt and brains winter they are both wonderful books I believe from what other people say and me to.I will give these books 5 stars because it is about the best book I have ever read and because it has so many details and I loved ever single detail.

Basically, Brian, whose parents have just recently divorced, is going to spend his summers with his dad when the single-engine plane he is in, crashes in the Canadian woods. Armed with only a hatchet and his wits, Brian learns to survive. Like any child in his situation, Brian is very upset about the break-up of his family unit. The story is really one about survival so why bring up the divorce? My feeling is that it shows that you can have two types of problems -- those that you can control/fix like the survival issue, and those that you can do nothing about like the divorce. So, why did I give it a two-star? Well, this is a children's book so I saw no reason for a detailed description of a kissing scene in the mother's extramarital affair. Even the affair was irrelevant. In fact, it is not that Brian really deals with either The SECRET or the affair by the end of the book. If Paulsen's intention with the divorce was to just show kids that you cannot always do some thing about all the bad things that happen to you but that should not mean you should drown in self-pity, then including the divorce was okay. However, he should just have left it at that and would probably have received four stars from me."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HATCHET by: Gary PualsenDo you like to read?

He builds a shelter by a small lake with many small fishing it. The area is teaming with grouse, moose and many other wild animals. During the day it is comfortable but during the night it is frigidly cold.Overall my book is very exciting. You never know what will happen next.

If there is anyone that only likes action, I wouldn't read this, but other than that, anyone who likes anything (other than romance too).This book has a good theme. Brian has positive thinking throughout the whole book and it helps him. Thinking of committing suicide, Brian is able to over come that by thinking positively. Like said before, throughout the whole book, Brian is able to overcome every obstacle he faces with thinking positive and using his brain.The book also has good fore shadowing. Such as his mother giving him the hatchet. Having the hatchet gave Brian protection, fire, and food. Also having it, it helped him get the survival pack inside.\\"Hatchet\\" is very suspenseful. When a porcupine had attacked Brian, he had been hurt realty bad. Every little prick he had to take out hurt. He took them out one after the other.

As soon as he saw a lake that was big enough to fly the plane into he crashed into the water. So the next coupple of months he had to live in the woods. He had to remember how to stay alive. He knew he had to get some food and water so he drank some water and piked some charries. And later on in the book he makes a fish pond to keep the fish alive while he is not going to eat them. He also made a place to store is other food like barries, he put them up int a tree.And all the time he was out there one plane flew by to see if they could but they coulden't find him because the plane was under water, so he tried to make a big fire so sombody would see him. And too make that big bonfire he used his hatchet that his mother gave him to help his father over the summer.Where he put up camp looked like a big cliff or ridge in the background, while he was sitting right next to the water. And if he walked about onehundred yards thats were he got the charries and barrires there.I would recomend this book to anyone that likes adventure books. It starts out kind of slow but give it a chance and don't quite reading it.

This book starts in a private plane on its way to Canada with a boy named Brian Rogeson and the pilot. Things get bad as the pilot suffers from a heart attack. Luckily, the pilot showed him a few things about flying. Things go from bad to worse as the plane runs out of fuel and crashes into a lake in the forest. Now, he is stuck without food and doesn't know how to start a fire. He faces many other hardships along his journey. With 195 pages of action this book is good for ages 9 and up. I give this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetThis book is amazing! When Brian Robeson Crashes in a bush plane he is challenged by the wilderness. Hatchet by Gary Paulson is a great book. Brian faces many challenges such as finding food and just trying to survive. This book is only about two hundred pages long. After the third page I was hooked. I couldn't put the book down. Brian is flying to Canada so he can spend the summer with his dad when the pilot has a heart attack and they crash. Brian is left in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a hatchet[a small axe]. He has to survive bear attacks, tornadoes and skunks. Brian has almost no knowledge of the wilderness and has trouble surviving.My favorite part of the book is when he finds the dead deer and says it looks like it got hit by a semi truck. I liked this part because I had fun imagining how bad it must have looked.The most important thing I learned from this book is that you must always stay on your flight plan.Other books by this author are Brian's winter and Brain's hunt. They are the sequels to hatchet.This book is amazing so next time you are in a library make sure to check out hatchet and its sequels."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I love the book Hatchet.

I was thinking ahead for once, and got it as a Christmas present."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet Book ReviewHatchet is a book great for any child to read, it's about the adventures of a thirteen year old boy lost in the Canadian Forest. This book was written by the award winning Gary \\"the MAN\\" Paulsen. Hatchet has been awarded the Newberry Honor Medal. Many students and teachers have enjoyed reading this book it embraces the heart of adventure and challenges.The main character of this book is Brian Robeson. The story begins with him dealing with his parents divorce. He goes to visit his father and this is what puts him on the plane that eventually crashes. Throughout the book we experience how a child views divorce and how it affects their opinion of their parents. Our group enjoyed reading this book because as future teachers we know students would be able to connect to this book. We think it's important to have a book for children to make text to life connections. Another main character in the book is Brian's Hatchet. The character might not be an ordinary character but it proved to be his only companion in the forest. The hatchet protected Brian and created comfort when he was alone. In our opinion Brian wouldn't have survived without his trusted hatchet.The majority of the story was set in the Canadian forest next to an L shaped lake. Brain experienced raw nature at it's finest in the forest. He had to search for food and shelter to stay alive. There are many lessons that Brian learned during his trial in the forest. As readers we grow to understand his battles and can vividly put ourselves in his situation.There are three main themes in the book Hatchet. The first theme is man vs. nature. This theme forces Brian to deal with the elements of nature if he wanted to survive. This is a captivating part of the book, which feeds the mind with adventure and suspense. The next theme is the power of positive thinking, which is a great lesson for anyone. As future teachers this encourages us to stay positive through the difficult times that we will experience. Brian's teacher instilled that into Brian and we hope to do the same in our teaching. The last theme is about maturing. Brian has to be independent and in the process grows up.Our group has loved reading Hatchet. It has captivated our imaginations and created a hunger for children's literature! We highly recommend this book to anyone that wants a good read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is my third time reading it and I recommend this book to outdoor enthusiasts and young kids who love adventure."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"in 7th grade i read this book.Hatchet is a book about a boy who was in a plane then the plane crashed.The polit died and the boy had to live in the woods for weeks.At first i thought it was going to be boring,but as i got more and more into the book i started to like it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is the first book to many of sequels.Hatchet is a very good book if you like action adventure books.Hatchet is about a boy named Brain who lives with his mom in the city. he goes to vist his dad in canada who works on oil rigs.His mom buies him a plane ticket to vistit his dad.on the way the ploit has a heart attack and the plane crashes into one of the great lakes.Brian has to survive until some one finds him and all he ha sis a hatchet his mom gave him before he left.Brain finds a place under a rock for shelter later he drops his hatchet on a rock and it makes a spark and he made fire.To find out what happends to brain you will have to read hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a good book it'sabout a boy named Brian who is on a air plain.

Gary also tells in great description on Brian's feelings. He acts as if he is mad at the world. His feeling really erupt when he describes his mother's secret in which in his opinion is very bad.The character that Brian is taking role of is a very good character if I do say so myself.

It was also very interesting how he would just think of something and then go and do it.Brian Robeson was thirteen and on his way to see his father. The pilot has a heart attack and the plane eventually crashes into an L shaped lake. Brian survives somehow but is a little bruised. He learns how to survive in the wild and how to make fire. After a while there is a tornado. The tornado was so strong it lifted the tail of the plane right out of the water. When Brian sees it he remembers the survival pack. He builds a raft and floats out to the plane. He uses his hatchet to cut a hole large enough for him to get in. he finds the pack jammed under one of the seats. When he finally gets it loose he looks up and sees the body of the pilot. There was no skin left on his face because the fish had been eating it, the fishes he had been eating.

He had to learn how to survive by himself with only his hatchet. Brian was 13 and going to visit his dad in northern Canada. While they were flying, the pilot showed Brian how to fly the plane. The pilot had a heart attack during the flight and died, so Brian had to crash land the plane by himself in a lake. This was a terrible experience for him. It reminds me of the time I was on a river raft going down the rapids, and I thought I might die if we flipped in the boat. Once it was over, I told my mom I never wanted to do anything like that again. When he woke up from the crash, Brian built a shelter to protect himself. He realized he was all alone with no food or supplies. He felt scared. Then he remembered what his teacher had told him about staying positive and staying focused. I can relate to this by trying to be positive on the tennis court. When I am playing a big match, I am alone. I know I have to depend on myself. In this situation I try to stay positive and calm. Once when Brian was sleeping, a porcupine came into his shelter. When Brian woke up, the porcupine swung his tail and hit Brian's leg. This made him cry and feel sorry for himself. Then he realized that feeling sorry for himself would not help him to survive. During my tennis matches, I try not to get down on myself if I am losing. I try to be confident instead of feeling sorry for myself if I get behind. Finally after about two months Brian was rescued. His time in the wilderness had taught him to be more cautious. Now he also noticed more things around him. He had learned how to survive on his own. He knew he could take care of himself, and he felt confident. I loved this book because it showed how a boy could grow when he had to face big problems by himself. I think every person in our class could benefit from reading this story"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Liz Gilbertson~Dobbs Grade 5 Hardy Elementary Wellesley MA May 19, 1999HatchetThis is a beautifully written story about a 13 year old city boy named Brian.

One of the things that kept me reading this book was that it was filled with suspense. The main character is a thirteen-year-old boy named Brian Robeson. You never knew what was going to happen to Brian next. Brian was attacked by a bear, skunk, porcupine, and a moose throughout the story. I always wondered if he was going to be killed or be able to survive the next ordeal. The reader is left wondering if he was going to be found by anyone or not. As I read the book, I tried to figure out how Brian would meet his next challenge. You never knew what was around the next corner for Brian.I found the book was full of action. Brian had to crash land the plane when the pilot had a heart attack. He had to swim to safety. He survived on his own by using information he learned from reading books and watching the television. Brian is all alone and has to grow up fast if he wants to survive and ever see his parents again. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book full of suspense and adventure."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My review: Hatchet 1# Brian Robensen has just met his fate! With only his hatchet and knowledge he has just crashed a Canadian wilderness! This book is very suspenseful for example he encounters a psychotic moose that almost drowns him! But that's not all there's much more to come just read the book! I would recommend this book to 4-9 grades because it has some parts that may be inappropriate for younger kids!

It is realistis fiction.It tells the story of a boy whos parents are divorced. He is forced to survive in the wilderness with only a hatchet, after the plane he was on to visit his father, crashes. The pilot is dead and leaves only Brian and his hatchet to survive on their own.This was a very exciting book to me. Anyone who likes a book filled with despair, hope and lots of adventure should read this book. I highly recomend it to anyone.The way Gary Paulsen sets up this book is terriffic! He also uses great detail and puts you right in the middle of the story.This is one of the best books I have read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this when I was somwhere around sixth or seven grade. Now, now that I'm twenty-one, I would like to go back and read it again. The best thing about this book is that not only is it a page turner but it also is re-readable. There are few books out there that you can go back over without getting bored. This classic will have you entertained every single time you read it. Also, it helps you to get a better understanding on how to survive in the wilderness. I tell ya, This book would make a great movie. Even though there is little or no dialogue; the author gets his point accross. This is a favorite book of mine. Don't rent it -- buy it. This is a classic that is terrific to own."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The summer after his parents divorce, Brian was going to visit his father in Canada. On the plane trip to Canada the plane's pilot had a heart attack and died. Brian was in the plane alone and had to crash it into a lake. All Brian had were the clothes on his back and his hatchet and he has to use those things to live by himself in the Canadian wilderness. Will Brian die, get rescued or have to spend the rest of his life in the Canadian wilderness?I liked how Gary Paulson made the book believable by making both the good and bad things that happened to Brian in it. I also liked that the book was so unpredictable. Another thing that I liked was the events that he put in it. He put very few boring events, they were all very exiting. I didn't like that the book was so short and easy to read.Anyone who likes outdoor books would love this one because almost the whole story takes place outdoors in the Canadian wilderness. Also adventure books lovers may like it because the book is about Brian's adventure. The other group of people who would enjoy Hatchet is the kind of people who like good short reads because this is a good book and it's short. The only people who wouldn't like this book are people who hate the outdoors."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Over all this was a pretty good book. I thought that Brian was going to die for almost the whole story. The book kept me on the edge of my seat/bed or where ever i was sitting at the moment. I think that the author Gary Paulsen did a great job on this book. If you like this book you should check out the book Brian's Hunt, or Brian's Winter they are pretty good books to. If you are an action adventure person then i think you should definetly check out this book and other stories from the award winning author Gary Paulsen. I gave this book 4 out of five stars simply for the fact that the book was great, but there is always room for improvement. I don't know how this book could be any better but I'm sure there is a way. Gary Paulsen might find out what is missing and write another book about Brian and his adventure's. Until then I will be looking for other books created and witten by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was an excellent book for children looking for an adventure.

I thought this book was a very good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Your plane just crashed. You're all alone in the Canadian wilderness. What do you do? Newbery award winner Hatchet by Gary Paulsen puts thirteen year old Brian Robenson in this situation. He must use a hatchet, other hand-made tools, and his wits to survive.As I said above Brian Robenson is stranded in the Canadian wilderness after his plane crashed, Brian was the only passenger and his pilot died instantly. He must prolong his life until somebody can rescue him, and try to do so before winter comes. During his journey he must face many obstacles.One exciting moment in the story was when Brian foolishly left recently cooked eggs in the open for animals to smell. Luckily for Brian it was only a skunk that found him. Unfortunately the skunk sprayed him, which quickly contaminated his stored food and made all his clothes (what was left of them) smell like skunk.The novel's strong point is definitely the description. For example, \\" Brian Robenson stared out the window of the small plane at the endless green northern wilderness below. It was a small plane, a Cessna 406- a bush plane- and the engine was so loud, so roaring and consuming and loud, that it ruined any chance for conversation.\\" If this doesn't show great description I don't know what does.I thought this was an okay book, not all that good just okay. At times it seemed like the author was running out of ideas. I recommend this to people who like the wilderness, because they might be able to connect with Brian and like this book more than I did. I'll give it a 2/5."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulson's book \\"The Hatchet\\" was nearly mesmerizing. I, personally, would recommend this book to any who can read.This story all begins on an ordinary trip to Brian Robeson's father. This trip is normal until the pilot flying the plane suddenly has a heart attack while they are in the air. Brian then tries to fly the plane but it is no use. The plane crashes into the Canadian forests. Brain, very luckily, survives the plane crash. Brian's anger will not help him on the adventure that he is about to begin. He knows he has nothing, but his strength and knowledge. He has no food or shelter.Gary Paulson just pulls you into the story with his way of words. As you are reading you feel as if you are a part of the story. The imagery seems real and then suddenly the mood of the story nearly becomes reality"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever Known a survivor are you one. Well, by reading hatchet by Gary Paulsen I've learned desperate at a whole new level. The theme of Hatchet is survival of course! He overcomes things such as a plane crash. A furious bear fight. A porcupine comes trudging into camp. Plus he survives a rough winter.The character of Hatchet is very interesting because, he lives by himself for a very long time. He was forced to fight animals. He built a sweet fort. He is also a 13 year old boy struggling to live.The setting of Hatchet is very real. It is in the frozen upper part Canada. He is surrounded by trees. He is trying to get were his dad is. There is no sight of life. After a long story you will learn how to survive in the wild and I hope you're never in this situation, but you never know! During this book you will encounter courage, bravery, and survival. I hope you likes this book as much as I did. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This story about a young boy stranded in the Canadian wilderness will never lose it's affect on me. Being a child of divorce I can totally empathize with Brian's struggles to cope. And I appreciate Gary Paulsen's comparing that struggle with actual survival. But this book is in no way a sermon on how to deal with divorce. It's about learning to co-exist, and to overcome any obstacles. The descriptions of how Brian went about ensuring his survival, only with the use of his hatchet (hence the title) were awe inspiring when a pre-teen and the book still retains a sentimental hold over my heart as an adult. the encounters with wildlife range from comical to downright horrifying. Hatchet made me appreciate the things I had and also allowed me to realize that I shouldn't seek too hard the things I desired to have but didn't. Overall this is a great book to give your 10-13 year old, a book about respect for nature, appreciation for life, and above all understanding that you can make it through the toughtest of situations as long as you have the right tools and are willing to learn how to use them."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Imagine being stranded in the wilderness alone and learning to survive. We all think about it at least once in our life, learning to hunt, getting shelter, and staying sane. In the book, Hatchet, Brian Robeson, age thirteen, is stranded in the Canadian wilderness, after his plane crashes, with only a hatchet and the clothes on his back. Brian was on that plane to his dad's house because of the Secret... This survival-fiction book tells how Brian undergoes a complete character change. When he first arrives he is relatively weak, but eventually Brian has keen, alert, senses, and he is a stronger person. In the book, Brian must deal with insane moose, and making a new friend; fire. Hunting and food gathering is a major part of the book, which makes it seem very realistic, but will Brian ever make it home alive? This book is a Newbery honor book and I believe it is very deserving of that prestigous award. Gary Paulsen's portrayal of someone in that predicament is very accurate. He puts you right in the action and in the struggle. I recommend this book to people of all different ages and backgrounds. You will feel every moment of hope and rejection in this amazing Paulsen novel."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My favorite book that I've read is the very well known novel entitled, Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen. The novel is about a regular boy named Brian Robeson, and he goes to meet his father in Canada, but as he's in the plane heading to his father, something goes terribly wrong; the pilots of the plane gets a sudden heart attack! As the plane goes down in the story, the stakes rise for Brian. That's one example of why this book is so great! Gary Paulsen explains Brian's troubles in simple words, yet he uses lots of those words to describe Brian's troubles well. One other example is, it sparks your mind into reading or makes you start reading Gary Paulsen's nooks. I assure you, give this book to a person that doesn't like reading, and after a week, they'll come to you asking for books written by Gary. In this novel, the question is,\\" How will the main character, Brian, survive?\\" So it's obvious that this book is an adventure and a \\"man against nature\\" conflict novel. As you have probably guessed, Brian suffers from hunger and searches for food and shelter. When Brian finds any kind of food, Gary describes Brian to feel like he just found money []off the street! The third reason why this book is so well thought out is because of the creativity Gary has put into Brian. Brian uses a lot of things in his environment around him in every way; a common stick can be a spear or an arrow. To sum it up, when you start this book, you won't stop reading it until Brian is rescued. I feel that Gary Paulsen gave Brian Robeson life, and that's whatmade, Hatchet a great book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen year old Brian is on his way to visit his father when the pilot of a small, two-person plane has a heart attack and dies. Brian crashes the airplane into a small lake in the middle of a Canadian wilderness. Sore and shocked from the crash, the boy finds himself on a sandy tree-lined shore with only his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the belt-attached hatchet his mother had given him as a present.At first, Brian hopes to be rescued in a couple of days, but later he realizes that his life depends only on him - the rescue is not near, since the plane drifted off course significantly soon after the pilot died. Now Brian has to learn how to survive, to toughen up, and to let go of self-pity: \\"...he learned the most important rule of survival, which was that feeling sorry for yourself didn't work.\\"Gary Paulsen effectively describes how Brian learns to watch, listen, and think before he acts, learning to co-exist, and to overcome any obstacles. The reader sees Brian's mistakes, setbacks, and small triumphs as, with the help of the hatchet, he manages to survive the 54 days alone in the wilderness - he attempts to build a fire, to fish and hunt, and to make his home under a rock overhang safe and comfortable.An epilogue of the book describes the lasting effects of Brian's stay in the wilderness -his character have changed from the \\"city boy\\" mentality to enlightened and being as one with nature. \\"None of that used to be Brian and now that was a part of him, a changed part of him, a grown part of him, and the two things, his mind, and his body, had come together as well, had made a connection with each other that he didn't quite understand.\\"\\"Hatchet\\" is a heart-stopping tale of accomplishment, sadness, anger, and happiness that brings a new appreciation for life and respect for nature. This particular 20th Anniversary edition has a bonus feature of author's notes and some truly great pencil drawings.P.S.

Thoughtout this book I could tell how the author used descriptive language which then created imagery in my mind. This novel is mainly about a young 13 year old boy, Brian Robeson, who is travelling to his father's with a timid pilot. Soon, the pilot gets sick and has a massive heart attack. Brian panics tremendously and using the knowledge that the pilot has given him Brian tries to land the plane in a lake. With great luck the plane cashed in a L shaped lake leaving Brian in the Canadian Wilderness all by himself. I would diffenitly have to rate this book with 5 stars and I would like to take this time to say congradulations to the intelligent author, Gary Paulson, who made my day every chapter of the novel. It is a magnificent novel, perhaps the best one I have ever read in my entire life. I would love to create a wonderful book like Hatchet and have the knowledge to do so.

This book is about a 13 year old boy named Brian Robeson who goes to visit his father after his parents get divorced. On the way there, the pilot suffers a major heart attack and the plane crashes, but Brian makes it out alive. He has to survive alone by making fire, cooking fish, and hunting meat until a rescue plane finds him. Will Brian be rescued? What I like about this book is how Brian never gives up and always tries his hardest. Brian works hard no matterwhat happens and I like that attitude. This book is well suited for kids who like survival novels. The best age for the reader is ages 9 or older because not all the words are easy to read. The genre for this book is Realistic Fiction because this could actually happen. You should definitely read this book!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This text is frequently assigned for 5th grade readers who are often 10 and 11 years old. Parents should be aware that there is a suicidal attempt made by the main character in the book. He slits his wrist in despair and passes out. He happens to wake up and change his mind.Furthermore, a sub-plot involves the child in the story finding out that his mother is having an affair while still married to his father. His father does not know. Therefore, the boy struggles with having to keep this secret from his father. These issues involve violations of trust in marriage and child-parent relationships. There is never any resolution to this story line or questioning of the moral dilemna this boy is thrust into.The story issues may be more appropriate for older high school students, but the issues of depression among our students and infidelity of parents should have parents and teachers consider any literary value the text might have to be limited. Parents and teachers should strongly consider their trying to meet objectives with more appropriate alternatives for students."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson is thirteen and is on a survival mission in the Canadian wilderness.

He speared fish, rabbits and foolbirds. Brian was not successful at this in the beginning. Brian learns to survive in the willderness with little or nothing at all. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes the outdoors or wo li kes a great adventure. This is a great book for anyone who wants to read and have fun.

I read through it and was surprised at the mature subject matter for a third grade school assignment. I love the idea of the story, a determined boy surviving and overcoming on many levels. At one point in the story however, he contemplates slitting his wrists to attempt suicide. My 8 year does not need to learn about suicide and methods to attempt suicide at this age and he doesn't need to read about a boy discovering his parent cheating on the other parent as a third grade school reading assignment. I think this may be a good book for a more mature audience but even the teacher was surprised at the content once I talked to her and she pulled it off the third grade book shelf. I gave it 2 stars because I believe it is targeted and marketed to the wrong age group. The school description says it is designed for boys age 10-13. I think a lot of parents of 10-13 year old boys would want the discussion of suicide to come up in another way rather than as a book assignment. Obviously advanced 8-9 year old readers in the school are being target with this book as well. Teachers and parents need to know the content so a serious topic like this can be discussed with kids rather than introduced in a book without any discussion."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"In this epic tale of adventure/survival Brian,a city boy,crashes in the Canadian wilderness and has to live off the land for fifty-four days. gary Paulsen takes us on this roller coaster of accomplishment,sadness,anger, and happiness.{The importance of the setting and the character traits makes this a delightful book to read.} Nature is a great setting for the story because it provides a lot of imagery for the reader to absorb. &quot;Some swamps,but they had trees scattered through them.&quot; &quot;No roads,trails,or clearings.&quot; Also the reader can connect with the character and imagine what is happening. &quot;As soon as he moved,the hair on her back went up and she charged him again, using her head and front hooves this time, slamming him back and down into the water and she left again.&quot; Brian has changed since the crash so long ago.

I think his goal was to establish a great young adult novel that is easy to become immersed in. He looks to create a book that is enjoyable and also has a lot of useful information about life in the wilderness.Paulsen, a writer from Minneapolis, writes young adult novels usually about nature. He has written over 200 books, short stories, magazine articles, and plays. He enjoys dog sled racing and has participated in many Iditarod races.Brian Robeson is trapped in the Canadian wilderness with nothing more than the clothes on his back and a hatchet, given to him by his divorced mother before his trip. He crashes from a bush plane after the pilot has a heart attack and the plane runs out of fuel. He is forced to eat whatever he can find, which includes fish, turtle eggs, wild berries, and a few birds. Isolated from any outside help, Brian must find out on his own by making fire by hitting flint with more flint and other survival tactics. Many dangers seem to get in Brian's way as he tries to get by until he can be rescued. Among these dangers, Brian must face a porcupine, a moose, and even a tornado. Will he survive the elements and get rescued or will the wilderness be too much for him to handle?I feel that Gary Paulsen has achieved his goal with flying colors. You could read this book over and over again and still find inspiration from it. Hatchet sparked the mind with exciting conflicts and kept me entertained from cover to cover. I felt that Hatchet has a certain special touch that no other writer could compare. If you are ever stuck in the wilderness, do not look for a survival guide, look for Hatchet. It will teach you more about the wild than most guides out there."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulsen's adventures of Brian are the only books my 15 year old son has ever ASKED me to buy for him.

You will not be able to put it down and can learn so much from this precise and moving story. Read this review by yourself or with your parent to find out more:The Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is a must read for all Middle School students coming of age and figuring out a true sense of self. Brian Robeson was a child of divorce. He was burdened with the secrets of his Mother and was living an in-between life so painful and typical of adolescent children in divorced household. The book opens as he is traveling to the Canadians backwoods for the summer to live with his father who was on site as a mechanical engineer in the oil business. When the pilot of the two-seater aircraft has a fatal heart attack, Brian quickly learns his true survival instincts. He is able to land the plane and survive for fifty-four days in isolation in the Canadian backcountry with only a hatchet, given as a gift by his mother, to help him along the way. Through Brian's life threatening struggles and incredible discoveries, such as figuring out a way to make a fish pond and making fire from flint stones, he is transformed into a young man. He becomes a survivor and brings the reader with him through all of his life changing experiences.The only potential negative I could foresee, is how well young ladies could relate to a wilderness story where essentially the only character is an adolescent boy. To this critique I would say that girls I've seen are equally gripped by this story. I've seen female students reading this book independently while walking through the halls oblivious to the rest of the school. One young lady in my class actually was in trouble for reading while the lesson was going on. It speaks to anyone who is growing into maturity, male or female, and hits at deeply human emotions that transcend the male/female divide.My personal appraisal of this book is that it is completely gripping and spun in a tight narrative that stays fresh and interesting. It is one of the few books that I actually remember specific scenes from as a child, and rereading it brought back vivid reading memories that only a select number of books have ever given me. Brian is a personal character and a thoughtful, confused boy. The simplicity of the writing makes the moments deep and fresh. The repetition and descriptive language accentuate Paulson's moving story. When Brian triumphs in creating his shelter and discovering how to make fire you will pump your fist with him. When the tornado takes everything he has worked for away in an instant you will feel his deep crushing despair. When Brian is discovered, he takes the reader with him. Just like Brain you'll be changed."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson knows the Secret. His mom is seeing another man, and his dad doesn't know.

The next book in the series is \\"The River\\" so that is why you could read this book and possible the series. But that is really your choice. I'll tell you my favorite part next.My favorite part in Hatchet is when Brian survives the crash because the pilot had a heart attack and died so Brian has to land on a \\"L\\" shaped lake or else he will die for sure. Will he land? Maybe or maybe not. To find out you have to read the book. I like this part because if Brian died the book would be boring.Brian is a interesting character because he seems like a city boy because he uses memory about stores or TV shows he's seen but he's not a city boy. He is one interesting character.I think the book Hatchet should become a movie because I think many people would like it because many people like the book.These are reasons why I recommend this book to all ages. Thank you for reading my book review."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulson is an excellent storyteller with a keen sense of adventure. the story opens with a young boy en route via a small plane to see his father in the wilderness when the plane crashes and the pilot dies. All the boy has is a tiny hatchet that was given to him before he left on his trip. He sets out on a path of survival as he awaits rescuing. This book contains mature themes (death, consequences, mistakes) that portray the realistic images that Gary paulson portrays. Having three Scouts in the house, this was an adventure book they all approved of enought that they have encouraged us to purchase more Gary Paulson books."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetThis story is about a teenager named Brian.

When he hit the water looked up and he was still in the plane. He swam out and grabs on to muck and pulls him self out. For the next 87 days he survives in the wilderness.

The only thing he has with him was a hatchet his mother gave him.As Brian struggles to survive out in wild he stumbles on some new ways to life.On journey to find food he stumbled on some weird looking berries.

There's only one question will he make it out alive?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"You would think a book called Hatchet by Gary Paulsen would be a about a hatchet but it's not. It's more about a boy than a hatchet.In the book, the boy was in a plane crash. He was out in nowhere and was almost killed. He killed his first fish with a spear he made. He made a bow and arrow and killed his first meat, a squirrel. He built a shelter that was knocked down by wind. He was alone in the meadow.The book was exciting because it made me want to see how he built his shelter. Hatchet won the Newbery award.My uncle Allen would have a good connection with this book because he eats raw eggs too. A grown up or a fifth grader would like this book very much."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet, has many exciting adventures that a boy called Brian Robeson goes through in which I greatly enjoyed.. The boy Brian goes to visit his father in Hampton in a private jet that his mother sends him in. During the flight the pilot suffers a heart attack. Brian then has to take control of the plane but he can't and the plane crashes. But he is still alive. But he has to survive through out the forest alone ,and lost with the hatchet that his mother gave him before he left. He missed two airplanes but the third one he didn't and left him back to the airport. Thank god for the third airplane that came and rescued him!!! I actually liked this book because how a boy survived in a forest and I like books that has problem just like he did. One thing that I really liked about the book was how the author used metaphors, and similes how the plane reacted to the crash. For Example: The plane, committed now to landing, to crashing, fell into the wide place like a stone. One thing that the author should have done better was put a title to each chapter, so the reader could predict what would happen next. Also so the reader would be able to understand the chapter and why is it named as the title. I recommend this strongly to those who like adventure stories because it has a lot do with that."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"\\"And his leg was instantly torn with pain, like a hundred needles going through his leg!

Third, Hatchet shows you what it takes to live in the wilderness alone. Fourth, Hatchet is a good book to show you how to get food when you don't have any food. All in all, I recommend Hatchet to everyone because it's a good book and easy to read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is an outstanding adventure novel written about a 13 year old boy, who crash lands in the Canadian wilderness all by himself. He has no food, shelter or navigation out of the wilderness. The only thing he has is the hatchet his mother had given him before he left. Now Brian must face the brutal forest and survive on his own, until his help is on the way.I believe Hatchet is one of the most inspiring books i have ever read. How could a 13 year old boy survive the harsh winters, dangerous animals and lack of food all by himself. On page 125 Brian thinks to himself as he catches his first fish, \\"He would not forget his first hit. Not ever. A round shaped fish with golden sides, sides as gold as the sun.\\" This was an important part in the novel because, this gave him the hope and desire he needed to survive. As the story progresses Brian faces many difficult challanges, and learns a valuable lesson that he would never forget. Never give up hope just because you don't have the modern tools we use today. Mother nature is the biggest tool there is. So don't pass up the chance to read this wonderful novel, and also dont forget to read Brians Winter and The River also written by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"By Aaron-Hatchet is about a boy named Brian is a boy who has to survive in the middle of the Canadian forest due to a plane crash, with nothing but a Hatchet. Through this story you will learn about the secret. Read the book to learn what if Brian gets rescued and to see what the secret is!The Author: This author of hatchet is not my favorite author, but I like how all of his writing almost rhymes.The Book: This is a good book although not my favorite. The writing in Hatchet is good and clear, but the story is kind of plain. There's action in the beginning, and action in the end, but not much in the middle. Not much happens, and it just goes on and on.My favorite part of the book is the beginning when the secret is introduced, but the author never makes you want to know what the secret is.I would probably rate this book 2 or 2.5 stars out of 5. It might be worth reading if you like survival books.By Ethan-Hatchet is a story about a boy named Brian who is stuck in the east Canadian woods after his pilot suffers a massive heart attack and dies, crashing the plane in a lake, in the middle of the woods.My favorite character was Brian because he is the only person that is really described in the story. The main character Brian runs into lots of problems during the story, but eventually he gets out.I couldn't really relate to Brian because I've never been stuck in the wilderness. But I have eaten berries that made me sick.By Justin Ch.-Hatchet is about a boy named Brian. Brian is 13 years old and his parents are divorced. Now he is on a airplane to visit his father but then the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane crashes but Brian survives the crash. Now he is trapped in the Canadian forest he has to survive, make a fire, hunt for food, and make a shelter. In this book I didn't like it because it always have flashbacks and it's not on topic.

Unfortunately that was reality for Brian, in the book; Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It all starts when a single engine plane on its way to Brians dads house crashes in the widerness of Alaska, on an island. The piolt doesn't survive and brian is all by himself. Brian lives with great hunger and many other terrible conditions by himself. This novel kept me on my toes and looking forward to what was ahead! There are plenty suprises and interesting things that happen to Brian. I think Hatchet is directed towards ages ten and up. Read this book you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Is it no surprise that Paulsen has sold millions of books? I have read several Paulsen books and would say this is his best work. Yes, the follow ups of Brian's Winter and Brian's Return were good, but this one set the bar pretty high. Reading it as an adult I was of a different mindset than say a 6th or 7th grader. I felt at times circumstances were a little unrealistic, especially for a kid in the CANADIAN WILDERNESS. It's not exactly the woods behind the house. However, giving it some latitude I decided to look deeper at the character not the setting, and there I found a young boy who epitomized survival. The great thing about fiction is the departure aspect, where we can shed the reality of our world and venture off into the woods. It's a delightful story that should resonate with young readers.As a writer I try not to be too critical of other writers because I know how hard it is to sit down and write, revise, edit, revise, edit, etc. There are avid readers who are not writers, and though they may criticize or praise, as is their prerogative, one should consider the difficulty in delivering a story that will stand the test of time. It's been 20 years now since the release of Hatchet and it still sells. I believe Paulsen delivered on this one. Well done Gary, well done.Scott A. Reighard, author:Jamestown: Journey Back in Time"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This story about a young boy stranded in the Canadian wilderness is an excellent recommendation for reluctant readers.

Another reason I found the book to be so wonderful is because It's by my favorite author, Gary Palson. Most of his books are a true story about himself.

The hatchet his mother gave him is obviouslyhis most important tool, because without it he couldn'thave made fire, his bow, spear and arrows, or the raft. The hatchet made all the difference.

The first thing I like about it is its realism. A man having a heart attack complains about himself having chest pains. Also, whenever the main character, Brian, is fishing, he tells the secret about fishing with a spear; aim higher than it looks. The next thing I like about Hatchet is the detail. It explains how Brian feels every step of the way in the forest. The last thing I like about Hatchet is the plot. A thirteen-year-old boy stranded in a Canadian forest by a lake in the shape of an L. He has to fight to survive while he looses hope in rescue each day. He has to eat, drink, make a fire, build a shelter, and more. So, these are the reasons I like Hatchet.

Desperate, he lands the plane in a remote lake of the Canadian forests. Despite being alone, Brian learns how to survive without a survival pack - looking for food, building a shelter for himself and hunting. He discovers fruits, hunts birds and learns how to create fire and cook. When he sees a bear, he learns how to stay calm and overcome his fears. This is a beautifully written story I would recommend for the young and the \\"young at heart\\". Read the story yourself to find out about the adventures of Brian Robeson and what happens at the end of the story!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was a great read! Brian's plane goes down and he's forced to survive for an unknown length of time in the Canadian wilderness. The book captures the same spirit as the movie Castaway; it's only more impressive since the book was written before the movie, and involves a child instead of a grown man. Brian encounters setback after setback, but perseveres and shows his true spirit and strength. The book is a true testimony to the power of the human spirit to survive anything. My one criticism is Brian's constant bemoaning over his parents' impending divorce and the dreaded &quot;Secret&quot; he carries. Pullease...if the author wanted to show a change in Brian's character, he certainly could have used something more substantial and less cliche. Other than this minor (and useless) subplot, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It's the perfect gift for a nine or ten year old."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a very good book, and I would recommend it. Here's the first part of the story. Bryan, a kid whose parents are suddenly divorced (by his mother), before that happens he sees something, the secret his father does not know. This is what the secret is, he was biking with his friend when he sees his mother in a station wagon with a man with blond hair. While she is driving she turns over and kisses his lips. Now he is flying to his father, the pilot suddenly has a heart attack, and rams his foot inot the right rudder pedal. A few hours later Bryan has to make a crash landing right by a lake! Then he has to find food, shelter, weapons and fire with no survival pack. I won't tell you the rest because it would spoil it. I liked this book so much I listened to it twice in the car. I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetIf you're looking for a good book that makes you want to read it over.And over and you still find out new things. This is that book ... Hatchet Gary Paulson is a survival thriller that's great for ages 8 and up.This book consists of very few character like Brian, brains mom, and the air plane driver. But sense there are very few characters it's almost like you are Brian. Another thing you will like about it.I think the theme of this book is survival because Brian has to survive in the wild. whether he has to survive or notThis setting takes place first in his mom's car, on the way to the air port to visit his father in Canada. After they are at the air port Brian goes to the plane that goes to Canada, the plane is only for to people to Canada. But before he goes his mom gives him a hatchet. Now he end up in a forest I won't tell you how but he does.So for my conclusion well basically is all you have to do now is to read the book hatchet to find out if he survives or tries to anyway.The End"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"If you want an action packed thriller, you have to read Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. Hatchet is about a boy named Brian. He goes to his dad&iexcl;s house on a private plane and some how he doesn&iexcl;t arrive. Are you anxious yet? Come read some more.I think that the theme of Hatchet is survival. Brian has an incredible journey for hunting. He shoots an enormous black bear that was incredible. He also shoots a lot more little animals such as deer, mice, and rabbits. The mosquitoes were coming, so Brian has to build a shelter to live in so they don&iexcl;t bit him. Brian also made his first fire by himself. Brian got cut, so he used his old clothing to wrap it up and he made new clothes. All of the examples were apart of the theme.The theme is very important but, the characters made the story mostly what it is. Brian is the main character in this story. He goes to being a geek in the city to being a survivor in the wilderness for an enormous amount of time. He goes through major changes such as getting food, making clothes, and adapting to the theme. If Brian wasn&iexcl;t in the story, it wouldn&iexcl;t be Hatchet any more.Although the characters are important, the setting of the story sets the stories tone. Gary Paulsen described the setting wonderfully. I could mentally draw a picture in my head and it felt like I was sitting there when I was reading, now that has to be a good descriptor. I could picture the mountains, trees, and the beautiful sunset. That is as good as I can explain the setting, I hoped you like it so far.Through all of the struggles Brian went through, he gets rescued. If you are not that good of a reader I would not recommend this book to you. I would recommend this book to you if you are a mild reader and you like action books, I would highly recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The Book Review of Hatchet By: Gary PaulsenHey come on read my book review it's awesome.

But I do not like how he has his hatchet wiyh him for a while in the begining of thr book, and Brian dosent remember that he has it"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I found Gary Paulsen's story very captivating. His narrative of a boy lost in the Canadian wilderness was an inspiring story that gives the reader the eagerness to turn the page as if Brian's destiny was our destiny. The descriptive tone left me with recollections of my own adolescence and summers spent roughing it in the mountainous regions of the Mogollon rim country in Arizona. Mr. Paulsen spells out every detail with amazing vivid colors that allows your imagination to place you right next to Brian as he battles the bear or captures the \\"fool birds\\". I feel that this book is well worth the read and is a great lead into Brian's Winter and The River."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Fantastic book for any gender. It really allows the reader to use her or his imagination and is a fast read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I've purchased this item and some of the other Gary Paulsen audio tapes for quite a few of my family members. My dad, who is now 67, enjoyed listening to them on his drive from Texas to South Dakota to hunt pheasants. He didn't even want to stop for gas or food. ha! ha! My nephew is 16 and has requested some of the additional tapes for his birthday. My husband's cousin is 13 and he got his first one for Christmas this year and loved it. For anyone who enjoys the outdoors and a good plot, these stories will keep you entertained for hours. Great purchase each time!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson is a 13-year-old boy who is on a small plane flying to visit his father in Canada. There are no other passengers on the plane so he is the only one he can rely on when the pilot suddenly suffers from a heart attack and dies. Brian is forced to try to land the plane when it runs out of fuel. He crashes into a lake and manages to swim ashore with a hatchet as his only tool.Brian is forced to remember useful tips he's heard in school and seen on television to survive. He encounters wildlife such as bears, wolves, a porcupine, and a moose. Brian learns new survival skills from experience as he undergoes successes and failures. He develops a sense of his surroundings and is able to discern sounds and shapes in the brush.The plot is suspenseful and realistic. As Brian encounters obstacle after obstacle, the reader wonders how Brian will overcome each one. The situations and solutions are true to life. For example, when Brian is attacked by a moose, he learns that if he tries to get away quickly, the moose will attack again. However, if he slowly moves away, the moose seems uninterested and allows him to go. Also, Brian learns that if he aims just under the fish he is trying to hit in the water with his bow and arrow, he can hit it because the fish isn't where it appears to be. Brian remembers that water refracts or bends light.There aren't too many characters in the book as it is mainly about Brian's survival on his own. His parents and a friend of his are mentioned briefly. The reader can interpret from what is said about his friend, Terry, that he is a good friend. Brian remembers past good times with him and wishes he were with him. Brian's parents seem like they are good parents, however, one might interpret that they divorced because Brian's mother was seeing another man. So, the reader isn't too fond of the mother.Brian, of course, is the most interesting character. He grows and changes from a typical teenager into a young man with increased survival knowledge and experience. He becomes more thoughtful and observes what is happening around him more. Brian is a teenager far more mature than others his age. He's had to maneuver a plane and survive an ordeal that most people only read about!Hatchet is a wonderful book about survival and the growth of a character. It reminds you to appreciate life and not to take it for granted. The book is easy to read, but contains many repetitions. Readers from age 11 and up will love this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The plot to this book was exciting. Brian is on a plane. He is going to visit his dad. Then the pilot had a heart attack! Brian was in panic, and he did not know what to do! He manages to crash safe but hurt. Mr. Robertson had heard wildlife and fell asleep for the entire night. Brian decided to go and take a drink from the lake but threw up. Brian managed to make a fabulous shelter. Brian found his own sweet berries, and he made a wonderful fire. It was lucky, but Brian found food. Brian almost got saved, but he did not. Brian felt very happy about everything. Brian got attacked by a crazy moose. He luckily was safe. Brian found out that there was a survival pack he was so happy, and he went in the morning to get the survival pack. He had trouble, but he got the great survival pack, and started to make a feast Will there be any life saving thing in the pack? To find out what happens read this amazing book! You really should read this fabulous book. I really love this book!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This realistic fiction book, Hatchet, is very excellent! 13 year old Brian Robeson is going to see (Mr. Robeson), his father, for the summer in Canada. Brian is in the copilot's seat. When the pilot embarks to have shoulder pains, Brian is pondering about his parent's divorce. Brian never told anyone that he knew about the divorce. The pilot teaches Brian how to steer. Then the pilot has a heart a tack. Brian will now have to steer. He makes a plan. His plan is when he finds a lake he will land in knee deep water. Brian spots a lake; he hits trees then goes out in the lake. He swims a-shore and lays down and sleeps. Brian is very swollen on his forehead. He has to find some food. Brian saw two birds that flew to some berries. He figures that if the birds can eat them he can, too. Brian thought that he was going to get rescued in a few days. A month goes by; he stills does not get rescued. One day Brian was getting fish out of the lake when a moose came and threw him into the lake. Then that night a real strong wind like a tornado came and took everything Brian had. The dead pilot is still in the head of the plane. The end of the plane stuck out of the water that had the survival pack. Brian has to get that pack. He makes a raft. Then the next morning he sets out first thing to get that pack. He starts to pound on the plane with the hatchet his mother gave him before he gets on the plane. Pretty soon he has a hole that is as big as him. He gets in there and gets the survival pack. Brian gets it back to shore late that night. He unpacks all the belongings after a long nights rest. Will Brian get rescued after he got the survival pack I recommended this book to 3rd grade and up, because it is suspenseful, thrilling, and makes you think about what if that happened to you. !"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read.I give it 1 star becase it was boring.I really liked it when the plane was going down.How come it could'nt have some action in it.He could at least have to fight a bear or something. Or he could have meet a friend in the woods. So my conclusion is this the worst and boring book, and I will not tell a friend."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulsen's Hatchet is easily one of the worst books I have ever read. Paulsen's style and diction merit a children's book. There is no depth, meaning, complexity, et cetera. The main thing which people who actually like this abomination cling to is Paulsen's ability to make it seem real; Of all the things one could claim, that is one of the most outrageous. This book does not convey any sense of reality at all, it merely explains the main character's illogical or simplistic actions, shallow thoughts, unrealistic emotions, and naive reactions - and moreover it does this sans any insight or purpose. Perhaps this book would be alright for kindergarteners or first-graders; beyond that, I would highly discourage anyone from even giving this book a second glance."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take so long to get into the action.(Other than the plane crash.)If you don't mind waiting you might like it. It might be I had to read it for a school thing which put me more to sleep. Brians was 13 year old city boy. This book tells how Brain survives with his hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I would have given this zero stars but the site woulden't let me. when i read the book my mind felt like it was going to explode . when you read this...actually dont"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"this is one of the worst books i have ever read. it was terrible. unless you are a boy who enjoys reading crap like this, it is a useless book. i will admit the ending was good but the rest of the book was horrible. we had to read this for school, which was so stupid. unless you are a boy i definatly would not reccomend this."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I was forced to read this book in school and I hated it. It's about a boy who is haunted by his parents divorce and is going to see his father and his plane crashes when the pilot died. I thought it really neede more characters and it is no way for 9 year olds[he tries to commit suicide]. Brian has to survive alone in the wilderness and overcome depression. If you like survival books, I guess you'd like it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was SOOOOOOOO boooring. It was so bad, that I had to put post it notes telling me what was going on when I fininshed a chapter. DANGER!!! IF YOU READ THEN YOUR MIND WILL BE POISENED. THIS IS THE WORST BOOK ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"People that praise this book obviously are those that would happily laze about in the field with the other sheep believing if it got an award it must mean it's good.1) Why introduce a Madonna Complex story line that is above the level of the age group you are targeting? It is not necessary to the plot or supposed ultimate lessons since only as an afterthought instead of conflict resolution we get a sentence that basically is apathy. Mom is a adulteress, Brian caught her, Brian is angry and is felt trapped in his guilt over the anger and rage at Mom cut his family apart just like the hatchet cuts the wood. Do we delve into the child becoming a man and learning that even Moms can do horrible things that shake our world? Umm no. Do we resolve and tie into the \\"lessons\\" Brian learns that he is responsible for his actions and mistakes can lead to his physical death and how that could tie in to confronting his Mother about her wrong doing and how her \\"secret\\" is something can destroy but yet she still refuses to take responsibility? Umm no. The main person in this story that needed to grow up and learn about responsibility and looking at how your actions can hurt you and others is Mommy dearest but she only get the conflict moments and not resolution. Did Paulson just get bored? Or did he see oh look got enough pages let me just say he didn't say anything okay yeah lets leave it with secrets are good yeah yeah that's a great life lesson for kids moving into middle school with all the issues they will face there. Yeah you people doing things immoral or illegal yeah suck it up move on whatever you could get trampled by a Moose..2) Does Paulsen think kids are complete morons? I mean why not pull out the Madden play by play drawing board? Foreshadowing?? No this is \\"hello stupid kid that your teachers and parents are utter mindless sheep and make me lots of money forcing you to read this brain death inducing drivel so here is the play by play you are too dumb to follow along or make presumptions and I want to get back to my boat.\\"When I looked up this book as my son's teacher is requiring it for one of the class read along books I threw up a little in my mouth at the mind numbingly simpleton vernacular. Then we have the whole Mommy is a hooch but I will not have that actually have an arch or be meaningful in any way other than to let Paulson I guess say his Mom was a bad person I don't know did he even map the thing out?Attempted suicide definitely see where this is something that to me should be talked about with the parents so that they can get off their \\"duh whatever your teacher seezzz\\" butts and be there to walk through these section and talk about it with their children and could have a purpose and be a important discussion point but as with every other learning growth or movement point in the book you speed through it and it is a poof of whatever..Basically this is garbage it has an award big woop I have a bag of trash I can plop an award on it for you. Parents REALLY start reading what is being given to your kids this kind of drivel is just making kids hate reading and sucking out their brains. I sent my kid to school with Life of Pi which he read in 3 days and told her to use that as her class \\"coming of age in a boy vs. nature\\" story. I doubt there are preprinted tests so she would actually have to read it and know what she is forcing kids to read though."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My son needed this book for school. We had already taken it out of the library over the summer and read it, but then I realized that he needed a copy to use at school. I had already done this once before and received a beautiful perfect condition old library book so I figured I do it again. Mistake. This book turned out to be a very old copy. None of the pages matched up with the newer edition. In a panic the other night I ended up buying the book on my Ipad because I needed to find vocabulary words on specific pages. Bottom line, I tried to save money and it ended up costing more than just buying a normal new book. You don't know what you're getting and that's a problem."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I didn't like Hatchet because it was so boring.

I loved the book, but it was a bit gruesome in parts. It's a great story about overcoming obstacles and surviving despite the odds. My favorite part of the book was learning to build a fire without any matches! This book teaches you a lot about what it would be like to survive a plane crash and be left all alone to fend for yourself out in the elements. All you're left with are your own thoughts and you have to process things that happened in your life because you don't have anyone else to talk to. You have to learn to be resourceful and figure out how to survive, even when you don't want to."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was a very inspiring story as Brian never allowed himself to give up.

I actually read this one when it first came out and remember not being able to put it down. When I was looking for books to share with my own children - especially my son - I rediscovered this gem. Both of my children enjoyed the story and were entranced at the idea of &#34;living off of the land&#34;. They were suitably impressed with the character's ingenuity, determination and grit. I think the book is suitable for most age groups. There are some scary parts in it to be sure but nothing that most kids cannot handle. My youngest, 5, did not get scared at all, so I judge my opinion based upon her reaction. The book is not long and it is exciting and well written. This is the first book of a series of Brian books. I had no idea of that until I bought this one again several months ago. If you or your children enjoyed this one, I recommend trying out Paulsen's Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod book. It is a bit coarse and I absolutely glossed over some of the language and events in the book for my own kids. I suggest pre reading it before giving it or reading it to children under 13.

Brian, a 14 year old boy survives the crash. Then he has to survive in the wild. Luckily he has the hatchet his mother had given him, but that's about all he has. Thru trial and error he figures out how to get food and shelter. He learns to listen and pay attention to his surroundings. He learns how to move to fit in with nature. He sees the world in an entirely different way. He is forever changed. The things he took for granted when in civilization are missed at first, but he comes to realize most of those things are not central to survival. When he can finally access the survival kit from the plane he finds a gun, but he sets it aside, he wants to consider how a gun would make his wilderness experience different. He isn't sure he wants a gun. He is completely satisfied with what he accomplished.My 8 year old loved this story. It stimulated him to think about what he would do under those conditions. I've always enjoyed survival stories. This one is particularly well done as we are in Brian's head and hear what he's thinking, how he motivates himself to solve the problems he is facing.

Later, Brian is taking a plane to visit his father when the pilot dies from a heart attack and a crash landing is being prepared. It was perfect and Brian just made it to the surface and survived. As he is stuck in the wilderness he creates tools to catch food and help him survive. As he is there many unsuspected dangers occur out of nowhere. Not all of the dangers are life threatening but have the power to harm him. Will Brian ever get out of the forest and back home?The way Gary Paulson puts the marvelous words he comes up with and the way he uses his words makes this book flow like a fish swimming in the ocean. After you have started the book you can't put it down because it is to good. He shows, not tells, you how you would feel an act if you were in Brian's position.Gary Paulson is one of my favorite authors because in all of his books he is able to drag you into the story by putting fantastic description and marvelous use of words in the story. I would recommend this book to people at the age of 9-12 years old. If you want to know what happens to Brian you should read this outstanding book followed by four other books in this series.

He used lots of description of the forest where Brian crashed near. It sounded very nice. Another time Gary Paulsen used great detail was when Brian made his first shelter and when he added to it. Brian added weeds to hold everything together and he added the other walls to his shelter. Gary Paulsen used lots of detail when describing Brian throughout the adventure.Gary Paulsen made all of the character and animals sound great. He made Brian sound awesome and brave in the clutches of death. He also made the wolf sound unbelievable. Also he made the birds seem very colorful and like a moving rainbow with wings.I truly liked this book. It had lots of description and great characters. This was a positive review about the book, Hatchet and Brian's great adventure. This was the second best book I have ever read so far in my life. I recommend this book for people of 11 years of age and up if they like great adventures and survival stories."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson is in a one-engine plane heading to Northern Canada to see his dad.

The main character, Brian, is trying to cope with his parent's recent divorce. This aspect of the story relates to the experience of today's youth, since 50% of marriages presently result in divorce. Paulsen uses his troubling childhood experiences to shape Brian's point of view in regard to the drastic changes he must undergo in his current household. Furthermore, the author adds his personal plane crash tragedy to give an accurate portrayal of Brian's near death experience, and his ability to survive overwhelming odds in the wilderness. The author does a wonderful job of demonstrating the importance of surviving, and how surviving develops character. Brain's transformation throughout the text reveals that he is stronger now than he was before. Paulsen is exemplary in bringing attention to certain words. However, some students are not aware that this unique writing style is not normally encouraged in a majority of middle school academic settings."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I rate this five-stars because the author made you feel like you were experiencing the same things that Brian did.

Hatchet is about a thirteen-year-old boy named Brian Robeson. He was on a single engine airplane on his way to visit his father in Canada. On his way, the pilot has a heart attack. The plane crashes and the rest of the book tells how he survives the Canadian Wilderness. I recommend this book for ages 11-15. Hatchet is very interesting because during his duration in the Canadian Wilderness, it shows how he deals with his parents divorce"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetPaulsen, GaryA PandeyPeriod 5An outstanding novel by Gary Paulsen! Hatchet is the best book I have read, because its so adventurous. Brian Robeson is a 13-year-old boy who is going to meet his dad for the first time after his parents divorce. He received a hatchet as a parting gift from his mom, which later helped him out. The story gets exciting from the beginning because his plane crashes and he is stuck in the wilderness. He must learn to survive because all he has is clothes on him and a hatchet. He soon starts to adapt to the environment and learns many things on his own. He learned many things to survive he ate berries, made a spear to catch fishes, ate eggs, made his own little shelter, learned how to make fire with his hatchet, and many more. This book is all about Brian adapting to the environment around him, and he does!What I liked about this book was that it was really adventurous and made me read on and on. I love this book because it shows how a teenager could survive in the wilderness on his own. I love the way he gets so happy whenever he finds a new food or a new way to get something. The really interesting part was when Brian gets the survival pack by going down in the lake the plane crashed into. It was like treasure for him it had a sleeping bag, pots and plate, rifle, fishing rod, a first aid kit, knife, compass, lighters, matches, food, and many more things. I like the quote when he just lands into the wilderness and he says, \\"So.So.So here I am.\\" Right after that he says, \\"I am hungry\\"!What I didn't like about this book was that whenever an airplane arrived it always missed him and left him lonely at the forest. Also there aren't many quotes in this book except in the beginning. I think that the book could have been more interesting if he would have not been rescued. I really admired his weapons he made to capture his food. I really loved the way Brian learns to survive, he survived for 54 days before he was rescued! This was a great book and i loved it. This quote was my favorite in the book,\\" right now I'm all I've got to survive. I have do something.\\"My favorite part of the book was in the beginning when Brian is on the co-pilot seat and the pilot starts holding on to his stomach and starts saying,\\" I don't know what I ate but it hurts\\". The pilot soon gets a heart attack. The pilot goes down and tells him to take over, Brian doesn't know much about flying the plane! The plane was now going to crash and Brian only hoped it lands in a lake and always kept on saying, \\"I am going to die\\". Luckily the plane lands in the L shaped lake and he survives. This was my favorite part because it was so funny and scary. I love this book and look forward to read another one of Gary Paulsen's novel."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Chris MulicaESL Reading3/22/04HatchetThe novel Hatchet is a very good book. Sometimes it makes you cry. It shows that every person can do stuff that is hard to imagine. It is a life story that could happen to any one. Main character Brian Robson is going to visit his father who lives in Canada. During the flight pilot has a heart attack and died. Brian landed the plane in the Canadian wilderness. He has nothing with him; nobody to talk to or to share feelings with. The worst part of it is that he has nothing to eat. He is so hungry that he would pay any price to get food. After few days of starving he eats some raspberries but they weren't the good ones so he throws up. He made his own tools and he starts to a new life there. He even made a fire, which helps him a lot. He is getting some new ideas how to get food but he has no idea how is going to get back home. He is there for 54 days and then something happens.When I was reading this book I felt sorry for Brian but I also was proud of him. When he was doing all those things it was hard to believe that he was only 13 years old. Especially when he made a fire, without matches or lighter. He also made his own weapons to get food by using only his hatchet. This book makes me happy because it shows that you just have to believe in yourself and do what you think is good.The best part of this book is that it is very easy to read because it doesn't have a lot of hard words. It is also very interesting with a lot of fast action. This story could happen to any person, which makes it more interesting.I learned from this book that you must trust yourself no matter where you are. Sometimes you can do things that you think are impossible to achieve.There is only one thing that I would change in this novel; I think that it a little too short at the end. I would make it a little more interesting and longer so it would be nicer to read it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HATCHET by Gary Paulsen is an adventure story. You have to read this book.

He then lands in the middle of no where and has to live on his own. He learns how to find food and live. This is a good book until the end because it is very descriptive. I dont like the end because it is way to short and it didnt explain enough."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"As you open the cover of this book you get enthralled to the point where you cannot stop reading. The story starts out slow. After reading a chapter you may want to stop. It may seem like the story is going nowhere and isn't very interesting. You shouldn't stop reading. By the second or third chapter you will be totally enthralled, and be glad that you didn't stop reading.This story begins as Brian is flying over the Canadian wilderness on his way to see his father. When the single engine Cessna suddenly crashes, it leaves him stranded in the forest. Brian has to adapt to his new conditions. He is forced to learn how to survive with little supplies and experience. All Brian has are the cloths on his back, a hatchet his mother gave him, and any supplies he could recover from the wrecked plane.Brian Robeson is the main, and almost only, character in this book. He is thirteen years old. Brian is dealing with his parent's break-up. He is the kind of person who keeps things inside, thinking about their divorce all the time.The author of Hatchet, Gary Paulsen, uses many descriptive words in his writing. When reading his book you can imagine yourself in the book seeing and talking to the characters. By describing every little intricate detail one feels like they are actually in the story. As you read more of the book the deeper you sink into the heart-stopping suspense. The only criticism I would give to this story would be that there wasn't always action going on. It was a little repetitive at times, when the author was talking about every day life. Overall this book was great and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet was a reaaly great book. When readding this book I became a book worm. It was really weird because I hate reading books. This book really made me appreciate reading a little bit more. This book also made me read the sequels, Brians Winter and Down River. they were just as good as Hatchet. There is a secrete, read all three books and you will be satisfied.The author, Gary Paulson, did a great job detailing what Brian (the main character) was thinking and what he did to survive the Canadian wilderness. He did a great job on all three books and having one book really lead to another.As flying over the canaidian wilderness Brian looks down and all he sees are trees. He begins to think of his father and his mother. His parents were divorced and he was flying to see his father in canada. The pilot of this little bushle plan looked over and he had a heart attack. Brian took control of the plan and flew it into a lake. He survives but the real survival is stearing him right in his face- the canadian wilderness. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure books and is not affraid of reading this book all night long."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"When I first read the book &quot;The Hatchet&quot;, I thought it was a great story, so much that I read it twice. This is not a normal occurrence; in fact, I hate to read, but the story of Brian and how he survived was such a great story. To this day it is still one of my favorite books.I first read the book in fourth grade, which was about eight or nine years ago, and it still sticks with me today as one of my favorite books. Yes, it is meant mainly for a younger audience, probably a great book for someone in junior high, but it can be a fun book to be read by all that like a good story of adventure.The reason that I think this was such a good book was probably because I'm a nature freak. I love being in the wilderness and I think every little boy in America at one time imagined being lost in the forest and surviving on nothing but their wits. I heard some other people comment on how they think this is an overdone story, and someone actually compared to the movie Cast Away. Both stories have similar plots, but what makes this story different is that Brian, the protagonist of the story, is no more than thirteen years old, and his plane crashes into the wilderness. The poor boy has to endure the punishment his body took from the plane crash, nurse himself back to health, and then survive with nothing more than a hatchet. I thought it was a great story, and most people that I know who read it all had great things to say about it.Also, Gary Paulsen has written quite a few books with the same kind of wilderness setting, so if you liked The Hatchet then you will like his other books too. He also wrote a sequel, which wasn't quite as good, but if you liked &quot;The Hatchet&quot;, then it's worth reading."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I have read this book twice. Once in middle school and again in high school. Still I believe this is my favorite book of all time. Hatchet is an epic battle between man and nature. Brian Robeson is on his way to Canada in a bush plane to see his father. The plane goes down and he's stranded. He has to rely on his instincts and his hatchet to survive. He had some run ins with a few animals while struggling with hunger and coldness. I would recomend this book to readers of any and all ages.

Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think this book is a fantastic and enjoyable story. This book not only deals with survival but also the emmotional aspects of the plane crash and Brian's parent's divorce. I like the fact that Gary Paulsen puts so much detail in this book.

Paulsen's writing is exceptional and leaves the reader feeling as though they are in the novel themselves. Though this book does have some gross parts, it is not a central focus and is overridden by the great plot and characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes other Paulsen novels- this one is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Adventurous, exciting, and suspensful would all be words I would use to describe Gary Paulson's Hatchet. It is a non-stop book of a boy's adventures and will to survive in the Canadian wilderness. It shows the true heart of a thirteen-year-old boy, who has just suffered the divorce of his parents, is now faced with learning how to survive on his own. The only things he had were the clothes on his back and a hatchet that his mother had given him. This book is a fictional yet believeable chronicle of Brian Robeson's adventure of survival and his finding of his real self. The most memorible of Brian's adventure appears in the beginning of the book. Brain's parents' divorce forces him to visit his parents at different times of the year. The summer is the time for him to fly to see his father in Canada. He takes the trip in a small Cessna sky plane with two passengers, the pilot and himself. After several hours the pilot suffers a heartattack and the plane goes down. This marked the beginning of Brain's survival time. Paulson's discription of the plane, the accident and the setting leave a true picture of the events. Because of his style of writing I was able to invision everything in clear detail. Time and again as Brain was faced with a bear attack, finding food, and other obsticles, pictures and scenes from the book appeared vividly in my mind. I am not a true reading fan but I felt like i couldn't put this book down. It is a great story with a good plot and Paulsen's words and desciptions kept me reading. This book flows and keeps a constant push to read. It is one of the best books that I have read and I will be reading it again. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves adventure and suspense. It is a good book for both kids and adults, its easily understood and fun to read. It is an all around a good book and great for anyone."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think Hachet is one of the best books i've ever read and i've read a few books.

Although fictional,this is a real story about a real boy. Gary Paulsen takeshis knowledge of the wild obtained by his camping, kyaking,backpacking and such experiences and uses it to the fullestextent. Abstract and artistic, &quot;Hatchet&quot; is just amazing.Reader Beware: Do Not put the book down when Brian getsstranded. This is not a book where the hero &quot;just happens&quot;to have matches and a gun and a clean bubbling brook runningalongside the lean-to he made out of deerskin. I hate suchstories, and was pleasantly surprised that Brian had notbeen a boyscout. I felt as if he truly was a city boy throwninto the wilderness with no idea of it's dangers. He doesn'tfind delightful wild strawberries and when he comes face-to-face with a bear, a moose, and other such animals, he doesnot know how to handle it. On the first night, he suddenlyrealizes that he has no idea how to make a fire, and that thenature specials on PBS don't tell you all there is to knowabout the Canadian wilderness. As I read this book, I thoughtto myself, this is really what he would be thinking. I wouldreact the same way if I were in his shoes. Once again, GaryPaulsen has out done himself. Do yourself a favor- read thebook but do not see the movie. Hatchet has always been myfavorite book, and will be for many years to come."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"From the talented Minnesotan pen of Gary Paulsen comes a story that many a kid living today has been given to read at some point in his or her life. Paulsen is to many people the ideal \\"boy's\\" author. In the stereotypical view of what boys like, Paulsen hits all the right buttons. I don't know how true to life this reputation really is. I don't know any young boys and, if I did, I can't really guarantee they'd enjoy this book. Of course, I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it very much. Would I have enjoyed this book if it has been crammed down my throat at an early and impressionable age? That's an open ended question, and I like to think that the answer is yes. This book is a lot of fun. In this era of \\"Survivor\\" like tv shows, we the American viewing public like to think we know a lot about survival. Bull hockey. We know jack squat and this book sums that point up beautifully. You're abandoned in the middle of nowhere with a single tool and you must somehow survive on your own in the wilderness. Now.... go. Brian does very well, but I couldn't help but think of Douglas Adams at times. After all, in Douglas Adams' final book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series the protagonist is dumped on a planet without so much as a hatchet. He realizes that his only real talent is in making sandwiches (which he proceeds to do with great pomp and flair). By comparison (and a comparison is, quite frankly, not fair) \\"Hatchet\\" is a dour novel. This is not to say it isn't enjoyable. And most of Brian's adventures seem utterly believable (with the possible exception of the, goodness me, tornado in his back yard). And Brian himself is a good guy. He seems like a quiet fellow and his actions are utterly understandable from page one. I don't really see the point of \\"the secret\\" (nor can I understand those parents that find it so offensive in today's day and age) in the text. I suppose it's the whole learning-to-be-a-man stuff. Not my particular cup of tea. For those students that suddenly have to learn about \\"Man Vs. Nature\\" (or don't they teach that in schools anymore?) here is the ultimate in such tales. I'd pair it with Sacher's \\"Holes\\" for an interested compare and contrast session of personalities and making-do. On the whole, \\"Hatchet\\" is a great book, and I was surprised, considering its popularity, that it only received the Newberry honor. There is no accounting for taste."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"A riveting, can't-put-it-down story of a boy's survival in the Canadian wilderness for two months, after crash-landing a small plane when the pilot dies of a heart attack. Very well written, this could be a modern Robinson Crusoe story with a protagonist young enough for its target age to identify with. Brian shows courage, resolve, and creativity in facing the dangers and challenges of his situation, and the ending is quite satisfying.Unfortunately, a sub-plot of the story is that Brian's mother is having an affair, which has led to his parents' divorce. Before the divorce, Brian witnesses a scene he calls \\"the Secret,\\" which troubles him repeatedly: his mother kissing another man. This betrayal is not dealt with by forgiveness but rather repression, as Brian decides that crying \\"doesn't work\\" to help him survive. He instead focuses entirely on his physical survival, deciding that \\"food is all\\" (129). At the story's close his parents remain divorced, his mother continues her affair, and Brian never discloses \\"the Secret\\" to his father. This troubling element of the story might introduce suspicion and insecurity to vulnerable readers.Another troubling element is the way in which Brian rather mystically becomes part of the wild landscape. In an encounter with a wolf (121), the author writes that he was not afraid because he \\"knew the wolf for what it was -- another part of the woods, another part of all of it... He knew the wolf now, as the wolf knew him, and he nodded to it, nodded and smiled.\\" In another scene, unpacking a survival pack which he salvaged from the wrecked plane, he experiences uneasiness at holding a gun (186), because he feels it distances him from his surroundings: \\"Without the rifle he had to fit in, to be part of it all, to understand it and use it -- the woods, all of it. With the rifle, suddenly, he didn't have to know; did not have to be afraid or understand... The rifle changed him, the moment he picked it up, and he wasn't sure he liked the change.\\"These two scenes seem to reflect an ideal of human-animal equality, which denies the Biblical command to dominion and stewardship. The assumption is that for a human to really understand the natural world he must descend to the level of the animals. The exercise of power, by this way of thinking, necessarily introduces distance between humanity and the natural world. This ideal is in direct contradiction to the Biblical mandate for humans to care for the earth as its rulers, the crown of God's creation.Although it is memorably well-written, the sub-plot of parental infidelity and the unbiblical perspective on humanity's place in the created order make this a book I don't recommend."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This story might be about a young boy stranded in the wilderness, but it could apply to any neophyte in the same circumstances. It shows the perils that exist out there for the unexperienced, and the resourcesfulness and will to live of the human species. It's simply a good adventure story."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"When I read Hatchet I thought it was quite boring. The ending wasn't really good because Bryan kept looking and drooling at food. During this book, Bryan kept on saying he knew &quot;THE SECRET.&quot; He was always scared of things, so I thought he was a wimp. The book was way too short but it was easy to read. One good thing about the book is that it told you how to survive if you were stranded in the middle of nowhere. The author was Gary Paulsen and some of his books are good, but not this one. I wouldn't read this book if I were you. You will start the book, you'll hear &quot;THE SECRET,&quot; and after that you will put the the book down. Overall this book wasn't worth reading."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"--- WARNING: SPOILERS ---My 9 year old brought this book home and put it down because he felt it was boring at the start. I suspect (because he's a sensitive kid), he found the notion of divorce and the plane crash hard to read about before bed. So, I picked it up and read it in a few days. I enjoyed the book, but a couple events that occur to the main character are implausible:1. A tornado in the Canadian forest? Not likely. Perhaps the main character mistook high winds for a tornado, but the likelihood either would raise a plane out of the water isn't plausible.2.

The book is about a boy, Brian, who crashes in a plane. The pilot is dead, so Brian is stranded in the wilderness with his only possession, a hatchet. The genre of the book is survival. A person who would like this book is someone who would like a good adventure or survival story. In the course of my author's life, he has written several fabulous novels. One is The Winter Room, another is Hatchet, or Brian's Winter. Those are only a few. When he wrote these books, he lived in New Mexico. One reason why readers would like this book is it is a book action, adventure story. A really good scene in this book is when the plane is crashing. Another reason why readers would like this book is because it has good description of things. Like when the plane crashes, or where the book describes the forest."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I thought that this story was great!

Before you even finish the first chapter, you will be hooked. At the end of every chapter, Paulsen leaves you hanging just enough that you want to keep reading to find out what happens. This book is also very descriptive. It goes into great detail about how a 13-year-old boy survives alone in the Canadian woods with nothing more than a hatchet his mother gave him before he left and the clothes he has on his back. He has to adapt himself mentally and physically to the task of staying alive. To make things worse he has all these different things running through his mind constantly about his parents' divorce, finding food, and other things. This is a great, simple book to read. It doesn't take long because you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think that this book has lots of wilderness features.and it realy tells people what a hard working set to learn mind can do.And it tells you what life in the wild is like.And it is a book enjoyable adults and children."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was great.

This is because this whole series was based on real life experiences. I have read this book numerous times and I still love reading it. Now that I have the whole series I get to read them all. The only one that I thought could be better was &quot;The River.&quot; So if you are looking for an adventure book that is very good and has good description about the story then this is the book to read. Also once you've read this book you will want to read the whole series."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulsen's &quot;Hatchet&quot; shows what survival in the northern woods really would be like to the reader. This book is great for readers of all ages, and it is just as good as reading a non-fiction book on survival because it shows what really happens when someone is lost in the Canadian woods. The only thing that I disliked about the book was the ending...

Easy to understand and be sympathetic with the boy and his effort to survive..Clear discriptions and thoughts without vulgarity. Most of our writers today would not have enough words to constitute a &#34;book&#34; without being crude. I am one of those who believe that those who have filthy mouths and/or filthy pens have not only a poor vocabulary but a filthy mind. For instance, I have just gotten into another book I purchased; &#34;Resuscitation&#34;. After turning about 10 pages the two major players, an MD and a law student, can't speak English, which tells me the author cannot.One of the good things about the Kindle is that such books can be quickly deleted!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Everything was exact!

He is able to do so by learning how to make weapons, kill and cook prey, make shelter, and cherish the memories that he has of his mother and father. When compared to other books this book usually comes out on top with me because it is an action and a thriller all in one.

It was an adventure.I like the parts when Brian gets attacked by a moose and a tornado. If I ever go on an airplane, I would make my own survival pack. I think this book is for 4th grade and up."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"To anyone who enjoys adventure, Hatchet is the book for you. Not only did it keep my attention throughout the entire story, but it made me think. While flying over the Canadian wilderness, Brian's plane crashes. Brian is equipped to survive with nothing more than the clothes on his body and a hatchet. I contemplated what I would do if I was in Brian's situation or how I would react to the same experiences he had. This well-written book by Gary Paulsen took me beyond a superficial level of reading. I delved into a second and even third level of what the author was really portraying and trying to communicate to his reader. What Brian endured, he did so as much physically as mentally. His \\"survival\\", his \\"becoming a new person\\", these are just metaphors as to what we have to face at one time or another. Taken literally, Brian lived in the wilderness and found ways to survive. But on more than one level, he found himself through experience and discovered how to really \\"live\\" and \\"survive\\". I would recommend this book to anyone who believes that something greater awaits him or her. It is an inspiring piece of literature that rests on what we have inside us- toughness, perseverance; we just have to go out and discover that."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is fast moving, easy to read, and the plot is simple to understand. All very good, but sometimes luck is just like another main character. I think that Brian was VERY LUCKY to have had a hatchet- going away present. He was VERY LUCKY that he had found a good place to 'land' the plane. He was VERY LUCKY to have 'landed' the plane. The list goes on and on. There were also some parts that could've been shortened. And this is the main flaw in survival stories: the plot doesn't develop that much: there's no story arc. I agree with some readers that Gary Paulsen could've combined all four Brian books. Then he wouldn't have to worry about the length and just cut out some of the unnecessary parts. On the other hand, the book was pretty realistic. I liked the fact that there weren't any other main characters in the survival part (not the flashbacks or the pilot dying part) besides Brian. It really gave Gary Paulsen a good chance of developing him. I liked Gary Paulsen's style and the way he decribed certain things: especially the fire. Another thing: even though the book was written about a decade or so ago, it took an awfully long time for someone to find Brian. If it were set in present time, it would've only taken a day to find him and rescue him. Overall, Hatchet's a good book. I will keep on reading Gary Paulsen's books because he has a very 'alive' imagination. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something realistic- something without supernatural stuff."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I bought this book for my 9 year old son to read on an extended road trip last summer. I was thrilled by the constent comentary from the rear of the vehicle. He read it; and read it again, with a joy that I had not seen in any of his prior reading experiences.

Go ahead and read this book so you can either prove me right, or prove me wrong"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Having the opportunity to read this book in 4th grade, I was left with a good impression of Paulsen's books. I enjoyed living through the adventures of Brian Robeson. Although I have had some exciting events in my life, I believe his struggle to survive in the wilderness would be quite an adventure.Paulsen does a good job implementing young adult issues into the adventure, and you can see this through Brian's thoughts throughout the story. After reading Hatchet, I ventured on to read many of Paulsen's books such as The Voyage of the Frog, Dogsong, Canyons, and The Foxman. Many of these stories were similar in nature but with different plots. I was also intrigued to learn of Paulsen's other books regarding slavery and other issues.I would recommend this book to any young adult, and many of Paulsen's other books.-Kevin"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book Is by far the greatest out door survival book i have read. Gary paulsen is from Minnesota making him very known to woodland conditions. Gary did a great job, I highly recomend this book for anyone who likes the woods.

I hope that Gary makes another part to this story becuase i know it would be as good as &quot; HATCHET &quot;."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"the book was real good. I like the suspense.

Hatchet was okay and had many good properties and many bad. A few things I didn't like about the book are that he kept \`starting over,' and that the first half of the book was pretty much all about him starting his life in the woods. One thing I did like was that he met (and killed) many different animals. And still, the book is interesting and it makes you wonder what will happen next, although there are MANY slow bits. In conclusion, this is a reasonable book to read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian is the only passenger on a tiny plane headed toward Canada. His parents have recently divorced and he is on his way from his mother's in New York to his father's in Canada. Before he reaches his destination, though, the pilot of his plane has a massive heart attack and dies, before he can even get a message asking for help over the radio. Brian is left all alone in an airplane close to Canada, with no idea where he is going or how to land. He is not even sure he is on the right track toward civilization.With some difficulty, Brian manages to safely crash the plane in a small lake surrounded by woods. He crawls out before the plane sinks into the water. Now he is completely alone with nothing except the clothes on his back and the hatchet his mother gave to him before he left, which he was wearing strapped to his belt. Using common sense and experimentation, Brian must learn how to survive in the wilderness. The wilderness has food and a place for him to create a shelter, but it also has wild animals and bad weather. Brian must face up to the possibility that he may not be rescued for a very long time. Will he be able to survive?I liked the detailed description of how Brian managed to do things--how he created a shelter, how he built tools, and how he got his food. It seemed plausible that he really could have survived out there using those resources and thinking like he did.I would have liked to have gotten to know Brian better. This book focused mainly on what he did, and didn't talk much about what he was thinking."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I did my book report on Hatchet. This book is realistic fiction.

It grapples with some very difficult and very adult issues in a realistic and logical manner that will appeal to young readers and adult readers as well. In a day and age of \\"reality\\" shows based on surviving difficult situations, \\"Hatchet\\" is a true test of survival and skill and the human spirit.Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson finds himself torn for the first time between his recently divorced parents. He is flying into nothern Canada to spend the summer with his father, armed with a secret he intends on telling him about his mother. Yet before Brian gets a chance to do so, his plane crashes into the wilderness, the pilot is dead, and he is forced to survive on his own with his few meager possessions - the clothes on his back and a hatchet that his mother gave him before his trip. Being a slightly pudgy, suburban raised boy, Brian doesn't know the first thing about the wilderness, but learns quickly through trial-and-error. He has many successes - learning how to make fire, fashioning a bow and arrows and spear to hunt - as well as failures that help him perservere. While there are times when adversity seems too tough, Brian keeps a cool head to find a way to keep hope alive.\\"Hatchet\\" is a modern classic that is sure to stand the test of time. Brian is a likeable character and the ordeals he overcomes are amazing. The ending, while a logcial conclusion, still seems a bit rushed after everything that Brian has been through. Paulsen doesn't offer easy resolutions or simple platitudes which forgives the somewhat hasty ending."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Few books for young adults have the potential to capture the attention of the young male reader. \\"Hatchet\\" is defenitely one of those books. Like watching a good movie, I often found myself on the edge of my seat as I waited for a scene to come to its logical end. Even when I foresaw what would happen next, I found this to be an exciting book.Paulsen perfectly captures the psyche of a 14 year old boy in this book. Passed between parents after their divorce, Brian is going to see his father for the summer. But when his plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness, Brian is made to fend for himself. Through trial-and-error and reasoning, he learns about his environment and learns to survive. More importantly, he learns about himself.As the story evolves, the author shows the development of Brian's character in evident ways. As he faces his demons, both physical and emotional, his actions are that of a 14 year old boy who is growing up fast. Though hardly subliminal, these lessons will leave an impact with young readers.Though the ending is easy to anticipate based on the sequels to this book that are now available, the way in which the ending occurred was well presented. The author chose not to make a simple happy ending. Instead, the ending was somwhat awkward but realistic.Generations of middle school students are certain to enjoy this book. As a Newberry Honor winner, it has already received recognition. Time will make it a classic."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a fantastic book. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it, read it every chance I got, and was sad when it was done. Hatchet is thought provoking and powerful. Gary Paulsen is turning into a favorite author."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a novel written en 1987 by Gary Paulsen, it is the first part of a series of four novels which I will also be reviewing.The story is about a 13 year old boy named Brian, who is going to visit his father in Canada because his parents have recently been divorced and he has to split time with them. He is traveling in a two person plane, just him and the pilot. As he is traveling and feeling grief about his situation with his parents, the pilot suffers a massive heart attack and dies, leaving Brian to fend for himself. Unable to fly the plane he manages to emergency land it in a lake in the middle of the Canadian wilderness.Now, hopeless and lost, Brian must learn to survive in the forest on his own, his only tool is something that his mother gave him before he left on the plane, a hatchet. At first he has no idea what to do, but little by little he learns to make shelter, find berries, build a fire, catch fish, build a bow and arrow and shoot big game, among other things.As time passes in the forest Brian turns from a regular pampered teenager into a young adult with a sense of survival as he loses hope that he will ever be found. He faces major problems while living in the wilderness such as swarms of mosquitos, bears, being attacked by a moose, and being in the middle of a tornado...scary stuff!As a kid I loved this book, I always loved to play in the woods or dream of running away as a child and this book talks about whats its like out there, I'll remember all this stuff in case I do actually get stranded. The book is very well written and even as an adult I still love it, it has a major nostalgic value for me.So in conclusion, I'd say this is definitely deserving of the 3 Newberry Honors that it one, and by the way it also was made into a movie, A Cry In The Wild. The sequel to this book is called \\"Brian's Winter\\" which I will also be reviewing in the future."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetBy Gary PaulsenReview by Ms Perkins' ClassHatchet is about surviving in the wild.

We have since read and discussed other books of a similar genre and beyond. Hatchet has opened up another avenue for our father son time together.

I also like when he gets saved because I thought he would die. It is not just funny but it is also serious because he has to survive with out food. All he has is a hatchet.

His parents divorce is weighing heavily on his mind, especially when he knows the secret that split them apart. Boarding a small engine plane in which he is the only passenger, Brian questions the gift his mother has just given him, a hatchet. With the new hatchet attached to his belt, Brian sits next to the pilot and waits on the plane as it flies swiftly over the Canadian wilderness.

This novel is the utter definition of an adventure tale that is loaded with constant action and suspense. In true Paulsen fashion this novel captures every intricacy of the Canadian wilderness from the plant and animal life to the always pesky insects. This book can be utilized with upper elementary students all the way to eighth grade, and with its high level of interest and low readability this book is perfect for struggling readers."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson finds himself in a predicament!

Brian learns how to survive in the wilderness...he has no other choice. Brian is a character who is full of hope; not to be rescued...just hope about life and survival. It is this hope that changes Brian forever into a person who sees the world now in a different way.Paulsen has done a great job in portraying realistic fiction in this story. He parallels the divorce of Brian's parents to life in the wilderness. Brian will get through both of these situations through his perserverance and determination. The tone of the story is serious and the character of Brian is believable. This kind of survival story would be great for upper elementary, middle school and high school age children. When done reading this story, it makes the reader think about what could have possibly happened to Brian if he was not rescued. Since many readers felt this way, it is no wonder why Paulsen continued this series with the many adventures of Brian."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson, who is 13, is the only survivor of a plane crash in the Canadian wilderness.

If you don't like books where people die or someone has to kill and animal then maybe you should not read it. If you are the type of person who is willing too understand why someone must or has too kill an animal because of starvation then this book may be good for you. And if you are a person who is in between you may want to read the back or the inside front flap of the book before you start reading. It is a GREAT book for people if they don't mind some teensy bit of a little to many details. If you like this book you may want to try reading:My side of the mountain or it's sequels,on the far side of the mountian andFrightfals mountian or thebook for young children called Frightfals daughter.Another great book is,Island of the blue dolphins and it's sequelZia.Another book I recommened even though it has barely anything similuar with the rest,Watership down.READ THEM ALL!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a well written easy to read book.Hatchet is about a boy traveling to see his father by airplane. When the plane crashes into the lake, Brian is the only survivor. Brian learned to live in the wilderness because he had to do so until he could be rescued.The book is ok, not one of the best books I've read but if you like books about the trials of surviving...this one is for you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson was troubled for a while when his mother sends him to visit his serperated father over in norhern canada at an oil rig. Brian then gets excited and prepared for the visit as his mother gave him some presents, one of them being a small hatchet. As he was on the plane his personal pilot suddenly had a heart attack and died causing the plane to go an unknown amount of miles off the correct route and crash down in a lake. Brian is now forced to survive in the wilderness alone and out of reach of any civilization with just a hatchet. This book was brilliantly written to test the mind of a thirteen year old boy's survival skill in an unknown area in the Canadian woods.Brian was brought to life by the writer with precise details and actions to give the reader exactly what they needed to know about him. The book started out giving Brian's physical features and throughout the entire book there were different types of actions to express how he had changed during the book. He started out as a quiet, shy and fragile kid and survivingthw ilderness transformed him into a much wiser and stronger person. He even lost about 20% of his body fat during his stay alone in the wilderness.This book was one that made the reader keep reading and reading becaue Brian found problems and tasks to overcome every day so I couldnt put it down until i finished it. Once Brian \\"arrived\\" into the wilderness he had to make a quick shelter and camp site to warn off other animals. While he was there, all sorts of animals threatened his existance and made it more difficult for him but that was just more reason to try harder and accomplish things faster.The Hatchet was an original story with an exciting plot, setting and characters. There are not many books about testing the minds of teenagers in the wilderness making The Hatchet to be one that is much different from all others. With the original plot came the original setting and character which were the Canadian woods and a shy thirteen year old boy that hasn't a clue on anything about surviving.The plot of the novel focuses on a traditional man vs. nature theme. Although the outlook was grim, Brian managed to emerge triumphant in the face of adversity. Brian's internal growth and newly aquired survival skills enable him to survive. This book is interesting and inspiratational.-K. Hurdle"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetBy: Gary Paulsen(Book Review)Survival! Brian Robenson had encountered it face to face. Surving a deadly plane crash was the least of Brian's worries. Stuck in the wilderness Brian must develop survival skills or face death. With nothing but a hatchet that his mom gave him before he got on the plane. When his pilot dies in the middle of flight Brian doesn't know what to do. After the crash he built himself a home and tries to survive until somebody finds him. This is a really good suspense as well as adventure story. I would recommend this to people who like action and survival stories.One of the reasons I like this book is because of some of the suspense contained in it. When Brian is struggling to get out of the water was one of them. When you were reading it you were thinking that he wasn't going to make it out. Instead he just barely made it out with throbbing pain from the crash! After he woke up the next morning he had mosquitoes just viciously biting at his skin. I was wondering how he would get out of the situation. The resolution to that was building shelter and building a fire. The most suspenseful was when Brian found the new berries instead of those old awful ones and a bear was right there in front of his face. Most surprisingly the bear didn't attack. It just minded its own business and didn't even touch Brian!The book was also exciting because of some of the action. The part with the most action definitely was when Brian was crashing the plane. When Brian kept going up and down in the plane was the start of the action. The main part is when Brian runs out of fuel and has to crash into an L-shaped lake. Brian endured a really strong tornado that tore his house and took his supplies away. When the mosquitoes came back Brian decided to build his shelter and fire back. Then he noticed the tail of the plane was sticking out. It was then he remembered, \\"The survival pack is still in there!\\" He swam out and made a hole in the plane. He made it through the hole and he pulled the survival pack out of the plane. One other one that I really liked was the battle between the moose and Brian. The moose just constantly kept attacking him but Brian showed perseverance and bravery by getting up after every blow.Last but not least the author used really descriptive sentences. At times you probably thought you were Brian because it was so descriptive. One of those occasions for me was when Brian was escaping from the plane. You could feel the pain that he was going through. Like his lungs burning for air and the throbbing pain all over his body. Especially on his forehead. When the mosquitoes bit at him you could feel his agony. It's almost like you know Brian and he's your friend. Pain and agony wasn't the only thing that the author described in this book. For instance when Brian caught his first fish and had his first successful hunt you could feel the happiness and relief go through him. Brian's mother cheated on his father and Brian witnessed it. His father doesn't know and Brian just can't seem to tell him about it. The author made you feel sorry for his plight even though it wasn't real. It was like he was playing with your mind.This book is an adventure and survival story wrapped into one. I would recommend it to anyone who likes those types of stories. This book had plenty of action and kept you guessing. It was suspenseful until the point where I couldn't put down the book Hatchet has really descriptive sentences. It had so much of them that at a point I could have thought that I was Brian! All of these in Hatchet blended into one makes it one of the best books I have ever read.By: D. Bennett"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"If I could I would give this book 100 STARS .I like how it starts. A regular boy in a regular day.

It shows how one person can survive in the Canadian wilderness. Brian Robeson was going to Canada to visit his father. The pilot had hardtack and the airplane crash on the lake. But Brian was safe.

This book is the beginning of a good series which I have already read. I think that is why i like this book the most.

He crashes in the woods of Canada and learns to survive.Brian's Pilot is flying Brian to Canada to see his father but he has a heart attack and crashes.Brian's mother lives alone with Brian during the school year.Brian's father lives alone in Canada with Brian only during the summer and spring break.Plot: Hatchet is a story of a boy about 14 years old. Brian is on his way to his father's house in Canada for the summer. While flying over a forest in Canada the pilot has a heart attack. Before the pilot suffered his heart attack he taught Brian the basics of how to fly the plane. Brian was going to fly in the same direction and try to contact someone over the headset. Brian tried contacting someone over the headset, but no one responded.Hours passed, still no one had answered Brian's cries for help. He then looked to see how much fuel he left. The fuel tank was almost empty, so he needed a new plan. He was thinking of a way to crash land in the forests of Canada. Since he was running out of fuel, he needed to decide to either, run the fuel until he landed or push the throttle to down quickly.He decided to look for a lake to land on, since the bush plane had landing gear for water. Brian found the perfect lake, it was \\"L\\" shaped so he could land along the longer part. He took the plane down and on his way down, trees cut off the wings of the plane which messed up Brian's landing.Brian barely survived the landing. All he had was his hatchet and the medicine kit. Now that he was out of the sky, he needed to find shelter. That wasn't the worst thing on his mind. His worst worry was where and how long he would live, what could he eat and how to get the mosquitoes away. Brian needed to find some place to go.For days Brian looked for a cave, and finally he found one. Now he was able to fall asleep. Something in the back of the cave woke him up. In defense, he threw his hatchet at what ever was back there. He missed and when the hatchet hit the wall, he saw a shower of sparks. He figured out how to make a fire to keep the mosquitoes away and cook food when he found it. He set out to search for food. Brian told himself that he would make it out alive he just had to survive in the wild for a while. Now that Brian had food and shelter, his main objective, was to survive.Comments: Hatchet is an extremely well written book. Gary Paulsen has written one of his best books yet. He was very descriptive when it came to Brian's thoughts and what was going on in the story. Once you really get into about the third chapter, this book really gets exciting. It is a classic tale about a boy vs. nature filled with plenty of action but not to a gory point. It is about how a boy survived the wilderness and the courage a person would need to endure. I would recommend this book for all ages and give it a 9 out of 10 scale rating.Touchy Areas: NoneRelated Titles:Books:Brian's Winter, The River, and Brian's Hunt by Gary PaulsenFilms:Far From Home (1994) Hatchet (1990)"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I remembered this book fondly from my pre-teen days, and looking at it once again from a teacher's point-of-view, my original judgment was accurate. Paulsen is always a joy and a quick read, and this is no exception. The book is simply and concisely written; it won't expand a teen's vocabulary, but that makes it an excellent introduction to the wonderful world of realistic fiction for reluctant readers.Boys and girls will be thrilled at this up-close and personal view of the natural world, and at the book's end, readers are left wanting more. Since Paulsen has several sequels published, that desire can now be satisfied. For many, it may awaken a curiousity about the outdoors that is sorely lacking in the \\"digital\\" generation. The book also deals very effectively with the topic of divorce, which many children can benefit from and identify with as the main character comes to terms with his family situation.Paulsen describes his setting and plot conflicts in greatly convincing detail as an expert on the wilderness, and his well-devleoped themes are relevant to today's young reader. There are many teachable moments in this book, and no parent, child, or teacher can go wrong by adding Hatchet to their collection."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I have read the entire brian seriers and i am a HUGE fan of it.i think that the best book from the seires is hatchet it is amazing.ONE review i saw talked horribly about it horribly,but i can garentee that he is lying this book was spectcularPS:this book is a newbary honor book and over 2,000,000 copies were sold!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is an incredible tale of a young teenager, who must learn to take care of himself in the wilderness after the plane he is on crashes.

Well Gary Paulsen wrote a book about it in Hatchet... The theme is to never give up. I thought it was that because he never gave up when he was in the forest. The people in the book that were looking for the main character never gave up to find him.The main character in Hatchet is Brian Ropeson. He is a preteen who gets stranded in a Canadian forest. Brian Ropeson is a tall boy with black hair, but, sometimes he can be stubborn. One of the reasons he lived was because he forgot to take off the present he got from his mom, a hatchet.The setting is in present time. I know that it could have taken place between the 70's to now. The setting takes place in New York and Canada. About one and a half months went by in the book.The plot is vary easy to follow. It is about a boy who is flying a small plane to see his dad in Canada. Brian runs out of fuel and has to crash land the plane in the forest because there is nowhere to land. Then, he is stranded there with a only hatchet to survive.This book is one of my favorites. Out of a one to ten rating I give it a ten (ten being the best). I give it a ten because it is not impossible to do what he did and it was very interesting.

What should he do? Gary Paulson's book, Hatchet, is a great book for people who like adventure and survival books. Personally, I like the book for many reasons. First, the book has a lot of action, and second, I can relate to the book a little bit. One of the best reasons I read the book is because my friends said that it was a great book to read. When I started reading the book I could see how the boy who got stranded felt. The best section throughout the book was probably when the boy figured out how he really missed his parents and how he wishes he could have a second chance.

You will not be able to put it down until the very end."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a realistic fiction story. Gary Paulsen's vivid language allows readers to feel as though they are with Brian on his adventure in the wilderness. Brian is a very realistic character that struggles in nature in the same way that any teenager would when abandoned in the woods alone. His resourcefulness and intelligent ideas help him to survive the very grimmest of circumstances. This story is told in the third person. This allows Paulsen to explain what Brian is doing, and yet he still shares what Brian is thinking as he lives through this experience."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"There is something lacking in Paulsen's style. There was no distinguishable climax, and plot structure was no where to be seen. There was sometihng unrealistic about Brian's survival attempts. It was as if the book droned on for ever, and the end was no where in sight. Things that should have been summarized and made shorter took up pages; things that should have been packed with detail, description, and emphasis took a matter of sentences. I was itching in my seat for the book to be over. It's keeps you on the edge of your seat because you really want to get up and put the book down."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I thought Hatchet was an okay book. It was exciting at some parts of the book, but really boring, too. The author repeated things a lot when I already got the point.

He also left you wondering about certain things, like Brian's mom's secret, and what really happened to the pilot."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The novel Hatchet is about a thirteen-year-old boy who lived in New York City.

All you have is the hatchet that your mother gave you and the clothes on your back. You have to go throught a lot of hard, life threatening challengees.

If he didn't have that he would have died the first day in the wilderness. This book will keep you reading cover to cover, turning page after page, just wondering what will happen next to Brian. So do your self a favor and read this great book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"A thirteen-year-old boy named Brian is forced to spend fifty-four days in the Canadian wilderness after the plane is on crashes. He is on his way to his fathers new home, when the pilot has a heart attack and dies, leaving Brian alone to land the plane the best he can. Once he has landed, he has to find food, shelter, and protection for himself with his only possession, his hatchet. Brian is plunged into an unfamiliar environment, which inevitably causes him to grow from a boy into a young man, and helps him develop mentally. During Brian's adventure to survive, he grows from the boy he was into a young man, who doesn't need anyone's approval. In the beginning, he is upset about the divorce that his parent's have just gone through, but he eventually realizes that there are more important things in life to worry about. At one point he thinks that he will be rescued soon, but he begins to evolve into someone who doesn't need to be rescued, he figures out that he will be just fine on his own. Campbell's article entitled \\"The Young Adult Perplex\\" states, \\"Adolescents are both fascinated and repelled by the idea of being an \\"outsider,\\" one who is not part of the center of social power\\"(Campbell 75). Brian feels that he has to have someone take care of him, just as many children feel they have to be part of the in group, but he realizes he does not need anyone, so he grows from the boy he started the trip as into the young man who was eventually rescued on the island. Brian begins to realize how he has grown mentally, and he is proud of who he becomes, but when he makes mistakes and lapses back into his old self, he hates himself. In the novel, Brian tries to scare a skunk away and ends up getting sprayed. When he gets over the smell, he becomes angry for being the scared little boy that he was when he came to the island. Campbell's article states, \\"But to embrace that \\"outsider ness\\" and accept one's own uniqueness is a shortcut to maturity denied to the in-crowd-and the subject of many young adult novels\\" (Campbell 75). Hatchet is a novel dealing with survival, and mental development that exemplifies this statement through and through. When children are maturing into adulthood, peer reassurance is very important to them. In the novel Hatchet, Brian has no one to prove himself to and becomes a more grown up person for it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I just finished what I think to be one of the best books I've ever read, Hatchet.

Hatchet is outstanding book written by Gary Paulsen. Hatchet was a Newberry Honor book. Hatchet was also noticed by the Voice of Youth Advocates. Hatchet is a series of books. Including The River, Brian's winter, Brian's Return, and Brian's Hunt. Another good book by Gary Paulsen is Dancing Carl. In Hatchet the amazing strength of Brain will amaze you. Hatchet is one of the best books I have ever read.Brian is heading to the airport. When his mom gives him a hatchet. The thing she doesn't know is that it will become one of Brian's only things he has left. On his way to Canada on the plane. The pilot starts to complain about his chest. The pilot starts to have a heart attack. The plane crashes and Brian is left stranded by himself in the north canandan woods. With some creative ways he has food and a home. But one bad night sends him back to square one. Just when every thing seems to fall apart. He remembers something in the plane that might just help him get home.I like the descriptive writing of Gary Paulsen. I was able to paint a picture in my head. Gary Paulsen said he look at the water and saw his relflexing. He said Brian saw big deep cuts on his face. And big blue bruises. The descriptive writing of the character caught my inertest. It will for sure catch yours.I liked the descriptive writing of the setting. It made me feel like I was watching him do all the things he did. Gary Paulsen said he was standing by the bright green raspberry bush with big red berries. It made me well like I was watching Hatchet was an exciting book. I didn't want to put it down it was so interesting. I wanted to know what happen next. Once you read Hatchet remember to read the other four books in this series. Hatchet is a good book for teachers to read to their students. Hatchet is also good for fifth through seventh graders. I give Hatchet five out of five stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever wondered what you would do if you were stranded alone in the wilderness with no food, no clean water, no clean clothes, and no more than a hatchet to keep you alive? Well, in the book Hatchet, this thought is clearly and visibly brought into reality! Written by the reasonably well-known author, Gary Paulsen, this 159 paged adventure and realistic fiction book is focused on that precise idea - what would happen? Gary Paulsen will capture you through a vast and stunning adventure crammed with suspense, shockers, excitement, and relief as he has accomplished with some other of his award winning books, such as his recently wrote mini series for Hatchet. Some other books in this mini series are: Brian's Winter, which is the sequel to Hatchet. It claimed the IRA Youth Adults Award and was on the ALKA booklist, a huge honor. Brian's Hunt was the next book, and it was on the ALA Booklist and won the School Library Journal. The final book was Brian's Return, which won the Horn Book Award and the Kirkus Review. Hatchet is the first book that inspired these sequels. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Hatchet. It was well-worth my time to read this outstanding novel. I get bored with books very easily, but there was something about Hatchet that made me never want to stop reading! It was exciting and jam-packed with action and stimulation. I never wanted to set this book down.In the book Hatchet, Brian Robinson's parents file for a divorce and Brain's father suddenly moves to Alaska. Brian takes a tiny private jet to visit his father in Alaska, but on the way there something goes terribly wrong. You are suddenly caught up in a burst of suspense, strong emotions and jittery fright as the pilot abruptly suffers a massive heart attack and dies instantly! In a snap, Brain's world collapses and he fears he will die. He is alone in a plane sitting next to dead pilot, miles off course, and only a little gas left. He has two choices - go down then before the fuel runs out, or stay up and fly until the fuel runs out. He chooses to stay up, and the plane eventually crashes with a loud bang in a still, pristine \\"L\\" shaped shimmering lake in the middle of the untamed, rugged Canadian wilderness, and Brian is left with nothing but a hatchet to keep him alive. Gradually, Brian learns to take care of himself by hunting, fishing, and gathering plants, and learns a lot about himself. He maintains himself and remains cheerful and optimistic, but optimism rapidly turns to terrified panic as months race by and no one comes. Will he be rescued? Or will he be forced to live, and eventually die, out in the bitter, wild wilderness alone?The book Hatchet had a lot of suspense. The first event that sent an icy shiver down my spine was when the pilot steering the plane suddenly suffers a deadly, immense heart attack and dies instantaneously. The way the author described it made me grit my teeth nervously and break into an icy-cold, panicky sweat. Another thing that put me on the edge of my seat was when a massive, terrifying tornado rips violently across his quiet lake and ruins mostly everything he has. He almost lost his life in the terrible natural disaster!Another thing I enjoyed about this book was that the character was strong, brave, and determined. I noticed that when he first got to the lake, he was a city boy and he had no idea how to survive! But he tried hard and struggled to stay alive, thinking hard about everything he did. If it were me, I probably wouldn't be able to survive. I think that the main character is someone to look up to for his courage, self-control, and optimism.Overall, I think that this book is phenomenal. As I was reading it, I could vibrantly see all the events in the book happening because of Gary Paulsen's amazing portrayal and word choice. The plot was packed with action and anticipation. It was absolutely a thrill to read! When I was reading, I felt like I was right next to Brian and I felt everything that he felt. I highly recommend this book to everyone that loves a good read stuffed with adventure and suspense. Hatchet is a whirlwind of action-packet ecstasy and stimulation that is sure to get your heart racing! If you read the book Hatchet, I can guarantee you will thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It is a very exciting and dramatic novel.

It would be a great book for a outdoor loving boy (like me). I am 9 and my mom and I read this continuously every day for a month. My little brother would listen in as well - it was so good. I loved it so much, I might even read it again. It was mainly about a 13 year old boy coming from New York to Canada to visit his father.

It's an exciting adventure story about Brian, a 13 year old boy who must fend for himself in the Canadian wilderness. The author wrote it in such a way that I found myself wondering what I would do in Brian's situation.

The whole book was spent almost in one spot. Other than that alot of things happened in the fifty some days he was stranded in the forest.

Other than that it had a pretty good plot. thats why I gave this book 3 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I like the book Hatchet because it was pretty cool. What I like about he book is that he can survive in the woods so long, like when he found the turtle eggs. He cracks them open and ate them whole. I also like the part when he got the fire going from his hatchet and a twenty-dollar bill. That would be really hard to do. My favorite part in the book is when he made a raft and spent all day trying to get the survival pack out the water.This story is about a kid named Brian who was going to visit his dad in Canada because parents just slit up. Before he leaves, his mom gives him a hatchet. The pilot had a heart attack and the plane was about to crash, he had pulled up on the handles then the plane went down into an L shaped pond. When he woke up he found himself alone on a sandy beach surrounded by woods.I would tell almost every one to read this book because it has really good parts in it.

When the porcupine came he could make fire. He survived on fish and water from the lake and his hatchet to get animals from the forest. Summer is ending while winter is beginning... Will Brian survive or will he get rescued in time? To find out read Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.Hatchet is an awesome story. It has suspense through the entire book. Gary Paulsen makes you want to know what happens to Brian. If you don't you won't find out if he follows through with his ideas!Another thing that Gary Paulsen uses in his book is descriptive language that creates mind pictures. For example on p.180 when Brian went to look for the survival kit the pilots face was described well. And on p.155 when the tornado hit, it created a mental picture in your head. The author's words enable you to hear the sound in your head. This helps the reader understand and enjoy the story better.In addition, I really enjoyed the cause and effect relationships that occurred throughout the book. Everything that happens to Brian happens for a reason. For example, the tornado caused him to get the survival kit. Also, on p.80 when the porcupine attacked him the pain was intense. Brian threw his hatchet at the porcupine however, missed and hit a rock. As a result, sparks were created and he was able to make fire for survival.

I like this book because it has action, suspense, and shows alot of determination."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen year old Brian Robeson is stranded in the wilderness of northern Canada after the pilot of his plane has a heart attack and he crash-lands the plane in a lake. Without any real hope of rescue, he marshals his inner resources to scratch out a means to survive in the wild. He uses his sole tool, a hatchet given to him by his mother, to great effect. After barely surviving a tornado, Brian discovers that the storm realigned the sunken plane, enabling him to retrieve an emergency pack. After three months by the lake, he is able to turn an emergency transmitter on, and is rescued almost immediately. A short epilogue explains the changes that the ordeal wrought in Brian's character, and explains also that an impending divorce between his parents has occurred notwithstanding his adventure.The Good and the Bad:I liked this book a lot. The writing was clean and realistic, and Brian, existing in a cultural vacuum, seems to be a realistic, three dimensional character. I was reminded several times of the movie Castaway, as Brian and the titular character of the film share many of the same needs, obstacles, and triumphs. Despite the intrusion of the divorce subplot, the story is basically a stripped-down survivalist story and I like the simplicity. Compared to My Side of the Mountain, the story is almost painfully real; however, it may not be real enough to be considered 100% realistic. Brian's interactions with the wildlife are scary enough to keep our attention without being an epic battle ending with a slain wolf, or anything like that. There are also several \\"life lessons\\" woven skillfully into the text, such as the failure of self-pity to solve problems, and the meaningful interactions possible with nature.I guess my main criticism would be that the ending seems abrupt, although I suppose the rescue is done that way on purpose."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian is a boy whoes parents are divorced and is only fourteen. I enjoyed this book a fair amount. I would recommend this book to children of divorced parents. I really liked the beginning of the book because there was a lot of action and the last part of the book because I liked the way Brian got saved from an island but I was not so fond of the middle of the book. I found the middle part of the book kind of boring. I liked the thought of all of the dangerous animals in the book. Overall I really liked the book. I give this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is a great adventure book. When his parents divorce, thirteen-year old Brian Robeson is sent to visit his father in Canada for the summer. While flying in a small plane over the Canadian Forest, the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane eventually crashes into a lake and Brian is left to survive in the wilderness on his own. Using the hatchet his mother gave him, he makes fire and a bow and arrow for food. He encounters many wild animals that threaten his safety. This story is about how Brian learns how to fend for himself, deal with his parents' divorce on his own, and become a stronger person internally as well as externally.Overall, this book was very interesting. I liked it because of the way Brian had the strength and courage to make it own his own in the Canadian Wilderness. Every time Brian would just get settled in, another disaster would strike. I recommend everyone read Hatchet, a Newbery Honor Book by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"WOW!!! This book is great! I am a student in fifth grade, and we read this book recently. Normally, I hate reading books as a class, but this was different. WAYYYYYYY DIFFERENT! I highly reccomend this book, along with Brian's Winter, The River, and Brian's Return."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"A Review by KevinOne evening, Brian Robinson was on a small, 2 person aircraft on it's way to Canada from New York, when all of a sudden the pilot has a heart attack and dies with 13 year old Brian all along over Canadian Wilderness. Brian crash lands the plane in an \\"L\\" shaped lake. Will Brian be rescued or will he be out there for a lot longer than first thought? Either way the story goes on in, \\"Brian's Winter\\" and, \\"The River\\".I like how this book shows how complete ignorance can spawn into in depth knowledge of how to survive with only small tools such as the hatchet that Brian has through this series. I thought that this book was realistic as far as how he survived but some of the Problems he faced were not, such as a 40 or so year old pilot having a heart attack, and a tornado in the Canadian Wilderness. I believe that although this book had some unlikely parts, that it all in all was a realistic novel and reading it might be able to help someone if they were ever in that sort of a situation.I would recommend this book to people who like realistic adventure novels, although it had some unrealistic parts to it. It is an addictive story and not hard to follow, it keeps you in the book and ready to read more."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet is about a 13 year old boy named Brian who went on a plane to see his dad and the plane crashed in Northern Canada. After the plane crashed in the water Brian got on land, he had a lot of bumps and bruises and he keeped passing out. One day after he woke up he remembered that he had his hatchet with him, he used his hatchet to hunt and cut his wood for the fire. A few days later Brian found some berries, and water. He thought someone would find him. He met some animals like a bear, porcupine, and a turtle. Did Brian get saved? Did he survive?I thought the book was ok, but i really dont like the type of story that Hatchet is. I liked how the author had a lot of interesting information. I didnt like how there were to many details. The people that i think would like this book is boys that are 11 or 12 years old."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I will not sing the praises of Hatchet or Gary Paulsen here. Book and author are wonderful, but many Amazon reviewers have already pointed that out more eloquently than I could. What still needs to be said, however, is how brilliantly Peter Coyote reads this incredible story. He finds a lyricism in Paulsen's simple, heavily repetitive prose and he captures the pathos of Brian's every experience, both the terrible and the triumphant. Listening to Mr. Coyote one feels Brian's fear, his despair, his resolution and finally his hope.As a teacher, I would especially recommend this to younger students (5th grade and up) who have trouble reading. To listen to a wonderful book beautifully read can go a long way towards creating a life-long reader."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I have just read this book and it is an amazing story about bravery and survival.

Great reading by Peter Coyote. Brings the book to life!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book is about a young boy who is stranded in the canadian wilderness after the plane taking him to his fathers crashed. throughout the book he has to use his wits to survive though there is a learning curve, like what he can and cannot eat(as he finds out about certain berries). the story takes place over i believe 2 months, in this time Brian has to struggle to survive while also dealing with his own internal conflicts. though the problem with his parents divorce does slightly take away from the situation(hes in the middle of the wilderness, you would think hed be more worried about that) but in a way it shows how the character grows and develops from a teen to an adult. the story was very very good and id definitelly recomend it. there are i believe 4 total books in this series, being that the second is a \\"What if...\\" which segways into the 3rd and 4th books since the first book is THE book and cant continue without the secocond book, which changes the ending of the first book slightly. this is mainly why i gave a 4/5 not 5/5 because its almost like you have to ignore the first books ending to read the second but even with that it was an amazing read and definitely recomend it to all readers be they young, teen, or adult since you'll find something in this series for you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My son loved the book (me too!) but he had a hard time reading it because of the bad punctuation, or should I say, barely no punctuation at all.

Just an amazing story. Filled with page after page of breathless happenings to Brian, who is on the banks of a lake, by himself, in the Canadian wilderness. Mistake after mistake, leave Brian a totally different person, both physically and spiritually. Marvelous read, but I do have to wonder about all of the mature info that this 13 year old has. Seems like Brian knows a little too much about how things work and just how life goes along. Just a fantastic read for both youth and adults."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"You have to read this book! Hatchet is a great book written by Gary Paulsen with 195 pages.

My 8-year old and I read this book together and compared it to \\"My Side of the Mountain,\\" also a boy's survival story: Hatchet was preferred by both of us for its drama and the depth of emotion the author provides for the boy, Brian Robeson. Life lessons in this story include determination (building a fire) and the ability to change yourself by recalling things you have learned in your past and pulling from your inner strength. Brian's toughening to both the environment and his family's split makes the reader realize that we should appreciate what we have and accept the things we cannot control."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I ordered this for my grandson who loves to read.

He set out to visit his father for the summer. The plane he is in crashes into a small lake and he is stranded in the woods for months. Through the beauty of nature and the tough act of learning to survive Brian finds peace in the wilderness. He learns how to cope with his parent's divorce. While there, he reaches an all time low, but soon realizes that feelin sorry for himself won't help him. This story teaches survival and how to work through hard ships that children may face without giving up. This is a great read aloud for teachers of students in 5th grade. It deals with anger and depression issues that children face when their parents get a divorce. I think Hatchet is a great read for children that are facing a similuar difficult situation. I think the story teaches a lesson in survival period.Brenda Jones author of \\"Standing Up\\" and \\"No, I Don't Want to Play Today\\"Standing Up"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"An excelent plot,good sequels and good characters.who the hell could rate this a 1 star book?!Overall,a must read!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is based on a real story this is a book that leaves you in suspense it is about a teenager that his parents are separated.

He must think back to everything about survival he has learned. During this time he changes, from a city boy to a wilder hunter. He starts to use hs instincts for every move he makes. Although this change takes place, he is an emotion wreck, but soon pulls himself together to survive.Although this book is very exciting at times, there are some dull parts.

It's a great book for a young boy (12) who does not like to read, and reads below grade level. This way he can follow along on the written page as he is listening to someone else read the fascinating story. It's a book that kept his interest. Tracks on the CD do not always coincide with chapter beginnings and the reader on the CD does NOT announce the beginning of a new chapter. This is done much better on the CD for \\"Brian's Winter,\\" also by Gary Paulsen, where a bit of music lets you know you are coming to the end of a chapter, then there is a short pause, a new track starts and the next chapter is announced. This makes it much easier to find the next place to start reading and listening."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is the best book I have ever read before.

Every chapter I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did. The story is very predictable. Man gets on island, man makes fire, man gets saved. This story is just like the movie &quot;Cast Away&quot;, except instead of the man talking to a volleyball, Bryan talks to himself. What's the chance of your pilot having a heart attack, then you somehow land on a island, make fire, and survive 45 days in the wilderness? 1/1000. This book got 2 stars from me because the end played in well with all the dullness. This is like Maury, he always plays the same show more that once. But this time, Paulsen's show never got on TV.

Gary Paulsen gets into a rather decent part in the book and seems to get tired of writing then ends extremely abruptly. He never touched back on the secret between his divorced parents. Gary Paulsen is a great writer, but ending a book is not really his thing.

I felt I really got to know Brian as if I were a creature watching him or was in his head. I could see, feel, taste, hear, and smell everything that he could. Gary Paulsen can think of quite a wild idea and turn it into an amazing novel.In my opinion this book would be a story for, probably, 8+. It's an amazing book but there are some scenes that describe intense pain and some pretty mean animals. I recommend this book for anyone who loves adventure and survival."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is a survival book that I would recommend for ages 8 and up because some parts of the book can get a little gory. The main character of the book is Brian Robeson, an average kid with divorced parents and a secret. I would describe the plot as fast paced, exciting, mind blowing and surprising. Most of the setting of the book takes place in the Canadian wilderness.In my opinion, the conclusion of the book starts out very interesting and detailed. Gary Paulsen unexpectedly ends the book, in my opinion. This is a great book for everybody, especially if you love action and detail. I think what is unique about the book is the author's writing style and point of view. They're like a cross between a journal entry and a narrator. Over all, I thought Hatchet was a good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was so good, and it has taught me about being thankful for what I have now.

I'm in the 6th grade and I find this book interesting. Not only does it show that it's not easy to live alone, it teaches us to not take the little things for granted. Some of us wake up and bamm, food is there, but if there were only raspberries or turtle eggs to eat we would be looking crazy.This book has also showed me that I shouldn't give up no matter how down it may look. If Brian would have given up and killed himself imagine all the stories he would never get to tell stories he went through or the Secret. I think this is a book everyone should read and comprehend.P.S.- This should be made into a film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was one of the few required reading books I actually enjoyed when I was a young student. It had been so long since I first read it (15-20 years?) that the only thing I remembered about it was how much I liked it. When I recently purchased it again to read on my Kindle I was worried that I wouldn't like it as an adult and I'd spoil my memories of it. That didn't even come close to happening, this book is still great. In fact, I'm tempted to read some of the other Brian Robeson book that Paulsen has written. This is a great read for anyone."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Imagine you are a child on a plane flight in a small plane across the Canadian Wilderness, when the pilot suddenly has a massive and extremely lethal heart attack, leaving you alone. Imagine the sum total of your flight experience is the few minutes when you held the plane straight and level earlier in the flight. That is the position Brian finds himself in at the start of this novel. Surviving a crash landing, this city boy, with no survival training and nothing but a hatchet and the clothes he is wearing to help him, must learn how to survive in a wild and unforgiving place.This is a compelling survival story, well written, gritty and realistic. It captivated me despite being well over its target age range, and it will be equally captivating to a young adult audience. Thoroughly recommended."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is about a boy named Brian Robeson. He is 13 and his parents are divorced. He lives with his mom in New York during the school year and is traveling by plane to stay with his dad in Canada for the summer.

All he has with him is a small hatchet his mother gave him. Brian must learn to find his own food, water and shelter to survive the wilderness. He grew stronger mentally and physically.I liked this book because Brian has many adventures to survive in the wilderness. He learn many new skills. He was able to do what it takes to survive. The thing I didn't like was when the plane crashed. That scares me because I travel on planes to see my family.My favorite quoute in the book is, \\"My name is Brian Robeson. Would you like something to eat. I liked it because Brian is rescued.My favorite part of the book is when a tornadoe hits Brian's shelter and it's destroyed. Brian would have to start all over again.

This book was very suspensful and kept making me read one more chapter. I was very surprised at this at this because I am definatley not a reader.Also I liked that he comes to the conclusion that he is the best tool that he has and makes use of the stuff he has and makes life very livable. The only thing that I didn't like was that he cut himself in a suicidal attempt, but it actually was great because it let you almost feal the pain that Brian felt and all the stress he delt with.I would give this book a 5 star rating because the plot was great, it didnt get boring to me and had a great story and message to it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever wondered what you would do if you were stranded in the woods?In this book Brian survives in the north woods for a year and he finds what he wants to do in life.

Brian was moved by the woods, not only the beauty of them but the fact that if you don't gather food for yourself and make a fire, you die.I think that hatchet is a great book. I think that Hatchet is a great book because it has many different genres like action , adventure and a little bit of mystery because you wonder when brian is going to get rescued.

He finds out he can make a fire with the hatchet and get supplies from the crashed plane and almost forgets about his home. he makes arrows and a bow and he hunts and fishes for food.

The pilot taught him how to fly the plane, and the pilot had a heart-attack. Brian knew how to fly the plane, and he landed in an L-shaped lake. He ends up under water with the plane sinking, and he finds his way out of the plane and swims to the surface. Later, he built himself a shelter and some weapons. He was trying to survive alone in the wilderness. He tried to find food and used the lake water to drink. He found gut-cherries, berries, fish, and foolbirds for food. He was attacked by a moose and he became hurt. Then a tornado destroyed his shelter. He was attacked by mosquitos. He went to sleep and he visualized the tail of the plane sticking out of the water. He got the survival pack from the plane. He pulled out the transmitter. Someone found him and he was rescued. I liked the part where he got the gun so he didn't need the hatchet and bow &amp; arrow. I enjoyed reading this story. I liked hearing about Brian's point of view of what happened. The part about the moose attack and the tornado was scary."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Meet 13-years-old Brian Robeson. His survival adventures have sparked the imagination of millions of young readers. Following a plane crash, Brian was stranded alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a small hatchet and painful memories of his parents' recent breakup. Facing hunger, wild animals and harsh weather, Brian acquires inspiring survival techniques and on the same time develops as a human being.Brian's adventures in Hatchet were accepted so well by young readers, that author Gary Paulsen continued and published a series of sequels to become his Brian's Saga. The book was also awarded the Newbery Honor prize.For writing a book summary of Hatchet, I came back to reading it again. Although the story hasn't lost its appeal, in today's world and reality TV shows, some of the adventures seem somewhat small in scale. But perhaps this is exactly what makes Hatchet so unique.In my view, Gary Paulsen's Hatchet is a wonderful read for young readers and an excellent idea for a book report, for both elementary school and junior high."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It was good because it showed how over time Brian made more inprovements in his tools and used them well. Also the story was well written."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was pretty good. It is a good book if you want to know survive in the woods. Also it is a good book to see everything you can do with just one hatchet. This is also real good because it is very realistic. I would say that this book could be read by ages ten and up. Also what I thought was cool is that the cover says that it sold over 2,000,000 copies.It probably sold that many copies because it was a real godd book.This book is about a thirteen year old boy who gets in a plane crash and is stranded in the woods, but he happens to have a hatchet that his mother gave him. Now he has to try to survive until he is rescued. His hatchet is a big help though. If he didn't have his hatchet who knows what's going to happen to him."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"We read this with our 9 yr old son. He's advanced for his age and was fine with the content. The affair the mother had is brought up several times, but is not more than \\"She kissed him in the car. A real kiss\\". It resulted in the mom and dad's divorce. The suicide attempt comes out of nowhere but is specific to the circumstances and appropriate. The boy in the story is 13 yrs old.Overall the book sparks the imagination of children, and me, to be more prepared with the survival skills our culture has lost. I read the book in two nights. Its an easy read. It is very well written, brings up poignant points about how, if you're stranded in the wild, you must be \\"one\\" in the wild. You don't attack everything, and are at the mercy of quite a bit of nature. I think it is appropriate for our children and maybe that will get our kids to be a little more serious about outdoor skills, and not just the jumping, running skills of the game consoles."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I've been on the biggest reading kick of my life here lately and I've been a bit nostalgic as well, so when I decided to re-read some of the books from my grade school years, I chose \\"Hatchet\\" first based on its inspirational tale of one lone pre-teen boy's survival.Brian Robeson is a 13-year old boy on his way to visit his father up north. At the peak of summer, he boards a Cessna 406 in Hampton, NY bound for oil fields in Canada where his father is working as a mechanical engineer. The Cessa carries with it oil drilling cargo but before they can reach their destination, the pilot unexpectedly has a heart attack and dies at the wheel, leaving Brian to land the plane all by himself. Miraculously surviving the crash, he is now faced with trying to survive in the Canadian wildnerness with what little he has in wits and supplies. He will later realize that his mother, despite his anger toward her for his parents' sudden and vicious divorce, saved his life when she gave him a rubber-handled hatchet just before his departure. It would prove to be one of two preeminant tools that kept him alive for a total of fifty-four days before he was rescued.I can remember reading this book back in elementary school but never really appreciating the story. I am so glad I revisited this tale, for now I truly appreciate the power of the story and the power of Brian's will to survive. During his nearly two-month exile, Brian is subjected to the unmerciful climate, swarms of bloodthirsty mosquitos, dangerous wildlife (moose, black bears) and truly WORKING for his meals. In the process of his survival, he becomes incredibly innovative and learns how to trap swarms of fish at a time for easy meals. He quickly tires of fish and soon moves on to bigger game, figuring out how to trap and kill native grouse through trial and error. Paulsen even has Brian dying a metaphorical death and being reborn, the rigmarole of everyday tasks in order to survive creating in Brian a champion and expert in the hunter-gatherer sense.Most important was Brian's power of positive thinking, a thing drilled into him from a former English teacher named Perpich. As he assesses everything in his possession that he can use toward things like trapping/hunting and shelter, another mantra from Perpich enters his head, that second of his two tools that would ultimately keep him alive: \\"You are your most valuable asset. Don't forget that. You are the most valuable thing you have.\\" (pg. 51)Much of how Brian adapts and excels at his primitive way of life can remind one of the 2000 film \\"Castaway\\" in which the marooned Chuck Noland (played by Tom Hanks) at first clumsily and not without many mistakes learns to survive on his own; by the end he is extremely resourceful, expertly spearing fish, building a raft and making fires with the greatest of ease.Bottom line: \\"Hatchet\\" is a classic coming-of-age tale that teaches perseverence, the power of mind over matter and the irrepressibility of the human spirit. I hope that this book is a part of schools's curriculums for many years to come and I certainly plan to share this story with my children as they come of age."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Of course, like many of the reviewers, I had to read this for school. And it has turned out to be one of my most favorite books of all times! I LOVE this book!If you do not like wilderness, don't read itIf you do not like very vivid detail and description, don't read itIf you do not like to believe that a child at the age of 13-14 could survive on their own, don't read it.......I've read almost all of the 1 star reviews and a lot sound like they came from really immature people, or people who don't like really good descriptions of things (ie the repitition in the book)I for one really appreciated the detail that Gary put into the book. It really makes the story come to life. I went on to read the sequels, and while not QUITE as good, they are still good. I would recommend this to any child that has a very vivid imagination"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a riveting novel. The character is alive, breathing and hanging on for life the whole bumpy ride. This was my second (possibly third) reading of Hatchet, and as an adult there is a lot I didn't remember and feel I missed in my previous pass of the deep language and concept that is this novel.[...]"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is definitely a book that you don't want to put down!For kids keep in mind that there are several references to his parents' divorce and his mother's seeing another man. Also, the boy attempts suicide.My only complaint is that the main character, Brian, is a bit too...what...emotional? The writing is stream-of-consciousness and Brian is afraid of a lot, e.g. bird guts, dead people, he can't quite say \\"threw up\\" - has to say \\"got sick\\"...He comes across as delicate, but he isn't - he survives again and again. He just seems too introspective - and that really put me off."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My grandson and I are reading it and find it very interesting and informative. There is no foul language. I would recommend it for young people that may be going through a similar situation."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulsen \\"paints with words\\" as he writes a descriptive story about a fifteen year old boy contending with his parent's divorce. This book is rivoting. The reader wants to read on as a young boy learns through discovery about how to survive in the Canadian wildernes. I read this book to my students and they were lined up in the library to check out Gary Paulsen books. Gary Paulsen writes passionately with no holes barred, which is what makes the story believable, exciting and compelling."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson is a boy going through hard times. His parents are divorced and his head is full with mixed emotions. Well it's the summer time and he is going to fly to his father's house in Canada.

Everything seems to be doing well on the plane until the pilot starts to complain about his chest hurting. What the two of them don't know is that he is having a heart attack which eventually kills him. So now Brian is left all alone on a little bush plane and he doesnt know how to control the plane. Brian soon finds him self crashing into a lake outside of a tiny island. Now Brian is stranded on an island with nothing but him, the wildlife, and his heart. You will ahve to read the book to see what happens to him on the island."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is very real ,and astonishingly true. There are a few soap opera kind of stuff (like Brian's mother going out with another man), but Gary Paulsen's books were always good, clean, family entertainment. The fight with the moose (or deer, I can't remember)is the best part. I give it 4 stars, for it's truth about survival, but the bad part was the soap opera shtick. Rating:young. has violence, and sexual conduct."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think that this book was once of the top ten books that I've read in the past few years.

Once you read this one, you'll want to read the other ones! I will tell you what the story is about.One day, Brian [the main charater] gets on a plane to go and see his dad.

But there're are dangers out there and Brian has to do something about it. Can Brian survive until someone finds him? Or maybe no one will find him!

As he headed for his father, who lived in the Canadian wilderness, the pilot of the single engined plane had a heart attack. Brian vaguely knew how to fly the plane and landed it in an l-shaped lake. He survives the crash and is able to swim to shore. He then, builds himself a shelter and makes a fishing spear. To survive he used his hatchet and birch bark to make fire. To keep from starving, he ate gut berries, berries that made him sick, raspberries, and he eventually learned how to fish and hunt with spears. While fishing, he had an encounter with a moose that left him with broken ribs. To make matters worse, a tornado destroys his shelter and scatters his weapons. Right after the tornado, he realizes that the plane's tail end was sticking out of the water and the survival pack was still inside. He retrieved the survival pack and enjoyed the food, weapons and sleeping bag. There was also an emergency transmitter that, he believed, was broken. Little did he know, a nearby plane received the transmission and he was rescued. During the story, Brian learned many life lessons and had to learn things he would need to survive. He also developed a new outlook on life and an appreciation for what he had."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think Hatchet is rated a four out of five because it has awesome details and it is such a good book.

Brian crashes the plane and he has to survive in the Canadian woods.

These are the things that 13 year old Brian Robeson feels in the northern canadian woods, with only a gift from his mother: A hatchet. The book begins with Brian on a small plane, with a pilot named Jim, or Jake or something (quoted from the book.) Tears try to flow through his eyes, as he remembers The Secret. His mother, in a station-wagon with a blonde man. Kissing him. Brian snaps out of it as he smells something. He looks over to the pilot. He's rubbing his joints and letting gas go. Must be something he ate, Brian thinks. The pilot tries to call someone on a radio, but he stops in the middle. \\"OH MY GOD! MY CHEST! MY CHEST IS COMING APART!!!\\" Brian then knows. The pilot is having a heart attack. The pilot jerks one final time and knocks the plane off course. Brian takes control, and uses the radio to no avail. He finds a lake, crudley shaped like an L. The plane runs out of gas, and it begins to go down. Brian pushes the nose of the plane down, and throws up.All around, this is seriously The Best book I have ever read.

Brian was on his way to see his dad during the summer. Instead Brian got into a plane crash. I think this was a bad thing because Brian was not able to see his father. The reason that the pilot and Brian got in the plane crash was because the pilot lost control of the plane. I think this book is very sad because the pilot dies from a very serious heart attack just like my grandfather did. Brian lived in the wilderness for a while.After about two months the searchers stopped looking for Brian because they thought that he had possibly died but he didn't, he was still alive.

Either way the story goes on in, &#65533;Brian&#65533;s Winter&#65533; and, &#65533;The River&#65533;.I like how this book shows how complete ignorance can spawn into in depth knowledge of how to survive with only small tools such as the hatchet that Brian has through this series. I thought that this book was realistic as far as how he survived but some of the Problems he faced were not, such as a 40 or so year old pilot having a heart attack, and a tornado in the Canadian Wilderness. I believe that although this book had some unlikely parts, that it all in all was a realistic novel and reading it might be able to help someone if they were ever in that sort of a situation.I would recommend this book to people who like realistic adventure novels, although it had some unrealistic parts to it.

No matter who you are, you're likely to learn some important lessons about yourself.Thirteen year-old Brian is flying to visit his father in the Canadian wilderness. Brian has little time to reflect upon his parents' recent divorce - the pilot suffers a heart attack during the flight and dies. And no one else is aboard the plane. If Brian doesn't find a way to land the plane, he'll die too.To call \`Hatchet' an \\"adventure story\\" would be a gross understatement. It is so much more. In Brian, readers of all ages will see a broad range of emotions: fear, courage, hope, despair. Brian makes several discoveries, but the most important one is an inner discovery. To survive in the wilderness, he must not only find a new way to live, but a new way to think.\`Hatchet' is so well written, I never felt that anything Paulsen wrote was contrived or unbelievable. Everything rings true, which is both rare and welcome. \`Hatchet,' like Lois Lowry's \`Number the Stars,' is one of those books that everyone should read. You might just find a new way to think...and to live."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I was introduced to this book by a special needs child I was tutoring.

Anyone who is looking at buying this book would do well to buy this particular edition."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is an outstanding book centered around a young boy at the age of 13 named Brian Robeson. His mom had given a gift to Brian on his way to the airport that saves his life. It was a hatchet. He was stranded in the forests of Canada after he had made a crash landing when the pilot died of a heart attack and fell shaking to the floor. He knew he had crashed way off course and he realized that all hope was lost for survival as soon as he watched the plane sink to the lake bottom. He was faced with one of the biggest fears of all, hunger. He also was all bruised up after he had flown through the window of the cockpit. He was forced to drink nothing but the surrounding lake water. Brian encounters many animals on his journey of survival including an enormous black bear. With only a hatchet, he builds a sturdy shelter and weapons to defend himself such as a bow and arrow and spears. He even made traps for food such as fish. He made fire that protected him at night from animals, allowed him to cook meat and fish, and kept him warm. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading or needs a book for school. I could picture everything in my head from the crash to his rescue. The book is so realistic, I never put it down. Gary Paulson kept the excitement going through out the novel with many surprises. And Brian was such a well-described character. He was smart, brave, and realistic. He wasn't strong so he used his brain to overcome many obstacles. The part that I had enjoyed the most was when Brian encountered a moose that hit him three times before leaving."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This amazing book was really good!

Brian was on his way to see his divorced father up in the Canadian Mountains. All the while he thinks about how the divorce came about. The &quot;secret&quot;, the other man in his mom's life. He is filled with anger and hate. The book is about a 13-year-old boy who is in a plane crash and needs to survive in the wild. All though the pilot doesn't survive, Brian, the boy, survives the crash. He builds a house and figure out how to make fire. His hatchet is the key to his survival. The novel Hatchet explains how he survives and gets food. He encounters wild animals and has a hard time fighting the mosquitoes. He always relates to movies and how the people in the movies would have done everything to survive in the wild. He thinks about how people in the movies got rescued within two or three days. Brian is full of hope to be rescued. READ THE BOOK TO FIND OUT THE REST!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian is a survivor. I don't think I could have survived that long. His courage, determination, and lack of self-pity is a good example for not only the students reading this book, but for the adults as well. Some of the things he had to face (such as a bear) gave me a fright - and I was merely reading it from a book!This book took place outside in the wilderness. It is a book of survival. Brian had to survive the plane (he had to figure out how to land it); he had to survive the wilderness for about two months; and he also has to figure out how to survive his parents' divorce. Perhaps his parents' divorce is a much harder thing to get through than the plane-landing or the wilderness adventure.Gary Paulsen is a marvelous author. Everything I have read by him - both adult and teen - is remarkable."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book when I was in high school and loved it. I couldn't put it down. It was by far the greatest book I ever read. Back then I didn't read so much.I recently reread this book. It's definitely not as good as I remember. First of all, Gary Paulsen's writing style now drives me crazy. In my English classes through high school and college, I'd get marked down for repeating myself. Gary Paulsen makes an art out of repetition.\\"He was alone. In the roaring plane with no pilot he was alone. Alone.\\" Ok I get it, he's alone.\\"And then he knew. Brian Knew... Brian knew now.\\" Great, I know, you know, we all know that Brian now knows. It's almost as if Gary Paulsen wanted a bit of poetic flow in the story, but it came out as repetitious phlegm which nearly choked the storyline. At least for me.Other than that, the book is fairly realistic. Perhaps with age I've become more skeptical. I don't understand why Brian can't make contact with anyone via the radio. And why no one could locate Brian in the vast Canadian wilderness - even though the book never says that the pilot in his death throws threw the plane drastically off course. And the pilot would have had to have made a flight plan prior to the flight. But this would defeat the purpose of the book.For a crash victim, he has it made. For one, he has the hatchet. For two, he has a perfect rock overhang to make a perfect shelter for himself because apparently a tree and\\\\or a lean-to just isn't good enough. For three, just when the story appears to be going nowhere, a wily Canadian tornado spins straight out of fiction and saves the day. If only I was making that up. Apparently, a random tornado is the only idea the author could come up with to bring the plane (and the rescue equipment) to the surface. A tornado that can lift a plane off the bottom of a lake, but yet can't pull Brian out of his shelter seems just a bit far-fetched. I've been unable to continue on past this part.Overall though, this book did get awards for a reason. It is a good book.It's a really good book, with some really annoying, annoying, Flaws. Flaws that are annoying. Flaws. But if you can overcome the repetitive nature of Gary Paulsen's writing style like I can't, you will enjoy the book even more."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"After reading HATCHET, I can understand why it received mixed reviews.I think Paulsen should have started the story with Brian's life in the city, showing how much of a city boy he was with his only understanding of the world around him comming from TV and movies. In that way the reader would have had at least some true sympathy for him. As it was, I thought Brian was a total dim-wit for not knowing the basics of anything. I agree with one of the reviewers -- I was also rooting for the moose.I think Paulsen did not need to have Brian be privy to his mother's infidelity. Paulsen could have built sorrow over his parent's divorce in other ways.I did not appreciate Paulsen having Brian cutting himself with his hatchet during a moment of despair. There are more than enough juvenile suicides going around. Paulsen could have told of and shown Brian's despair in many ways other than attempted suicide.Finally, the novel was more of a diary/documentary than it was a fictional story. But it is next to impossible to have dialog and interactions when there is only one character.I would have liked Paulsen to continue the story after Brian found the emergency supplies. I think Paulsen ended the story too abruptly.All in all, HATCHET was okay. I just can't see it as a 5 or receiving all the awards."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"\\"As I walk slower and pick up my bow I can feel something breathing on my back.\\" These thoughts go through Brian's mind in the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen as he tries to survive in the wilderness.

Gary Paulsen's vivid language allows readers to feel as though they are with Brian on his adventure in the wilderness. Brian is a very realistic character that struggles in nature in the same way that any teenager would when abandoned in the woods alone. His resourcefulness and intelligent ideas help him to survive the very grimmest of circumstances. This story is told in the third person. This allows Paulsen to explain what Brian is doing, and yet he still shares what Brian is thinking as he lives through this experience."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson Was an ordinary teenager until he was sent to Canada to see his father !While he was in the plane his captain had a Hart attack . of coarse Brian tried to fly the plane .

TheBook won a Newbery honor. The author is Gary Paulsen. He writesGreat books, trust me you'll love it!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book is a survival story about a young man, Brian, who is struggling with his parent's divorce and the fact that his mother, unbeknownst to his father, was having an affair. His plane crashes into the Canadian wilderness en route to stay with his father for the summer with a hatchet as his only asset.That's the setup, at least. Brian quickly moves from teenager to existential hero, however, and the story ends up being an allegory for how Paulson believes individuals should deal with their emotions and cope with difficult situations. The problem with this is that wilderness survival skills do not translate well to dealing with complicated emotional problems like divorce. The book comes across as Paulson's wish fulfillment of how he'd prefer teenagers to behave, as opposed to giving teenagers tools to cope within the context of how they actually behave.I found the book well written and a good page-turner. I was only disappointed by the ending (which brushes off having to deal with the central conflict with a nifty little narrative summary). However, though written well, I found its central message disturbing and even destructive. I think it is probably every man's fantasy to be stuck out in the wilderness, left to his own devices, and to see if he can survive. The story from that angle was enjoyable. But to extrapolate that to an ideology is unhelpful, particularly for a teenage male who is actually trying to survive an emotional crisis.&lt;a href=\\"http://www.engenuous.com/blogs/jason/2006/08/book-review-hatchet-gary-pauslon-i.cfm\\">Read full review&lt;/a>"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Nicholas TarriconeEnglish period 6Hatchet is an incredible book. Gary Paulsen wrote the book in a way so you would want to read more. The book Hatchet is a survival story of thirteen year-old Brian Robeson. Brian Robeson was visiting his father up near the Canadian wilderness. During the trip, the pilot had a heart attack. Eventually the plane crashes into an L shaped lake. Now Brian must survive with what he has with him.Brian's parents are divorced which is why he was traveling to visit his father in the first place. Brian's parents were divorced because of a secret that Brian found out. Ever since then the secret has been tearing Brian apart. Before Brian left, his mother gave him a present. The present was a hatchet, and a belt to carry the hatchet. Brian must now survive on his greatest tool, the hatchet.I had a few likes and dislikes about the book. I liked the book because it was a survival story of what Brian encountered in the forest. He overcame many challenges such as finding food, living in the forest, and scaring away animals. I disliked the last chapter because he finds something that could have helped him throughout the entire book. That item could have made living in the forest a lot easier. I liked how the book kept the reader's interest by having interesting things happen to him. It was interesting how he tried to make fire. There was no dry wood and he had nothing that would help make a spark.The book Hatchet is like a television show on the Discovery Channel. The show is named \\"I Shouldn't Be Alive\\". The show is about people who get stranded in uninhabited places. Some of these places are islands, in the middle of the oceans, and forests. The show tells how the people get stranded in these places and how they survive. Some people have their planes crash, or their boats sunk. The book Hatchet is like a book version of the show."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is probably one of the best books I've ever read. I spent about 2 days reading it. While many reviews say that it stinks, it's really good! Brian, the main character, is struggling with his parents' divorce and the Secret. While Brian's traveling in a plane alone to his father living in Canada, the pilot has a heart attack and dies. Brian survives the plane crash into a lake. He finds shelter and food and survives for several months while hoping someone finds him and returns him back to civilization. While he lives in the wilderness Brian's personality changes from a city slicker to a survivor. This book is a good read for anyone who loves survival books or just wants to have a little joy in their life."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Lost. Gone.

In the middle of nowhere.He must find food, shelter, and necessities to survive to last him until he is found. He eats everything from \\"gut cherries\\" to \\"foolbirds.\\" His home gets torn down by animals and wind. He is attacked by porcupines, skunks, and even a moose.I thought this book was very good.

Now, Brian only has a windbreaker, his clothes, and a hatchet his mother gave him before he left. With the hatchet as his only tool, Brian must learn how to hunt, build a shelter, and make fire to remain alive.I enjoyed the book for four main reasons. One, it showed you that if you try hard you can accomplish great things. Two, it showed you to never give up. Three it was extremely exciting. And four, it showed you to always believe in yourself.I believe that people that love excitement will enjoy the book.

He had a lot of challenging things but the most important thing he had was a hatchet it helped him a lot. He learned how to make a fire with the hatchet.

Swore and hissed, \\"Chest! Oh god, my chest is coming apart!\\" Brian knew now. The pilot was having a heart attack.\\"Hatchet is one of the best books I've ever read. It's about a boy named Brian who crashes in a plane and now must live in the wilderness. By himself he has to find food, build a shelter, and more with only a hatchet.Gary Paulsen has written a few of these Brian books. Brian is very brave in this story, but I think in the beginning he was really scared and didn't now what to. Later on in the story he got use to the wilderness and started to like it. Once he was looking for berries and saw a bear. The bear was looking for the same berries that he was looking for so he just stood there until it left. He learned other things about living in the wilderness like how to catch a fish and start a fire.I recommend this book to whoever likes adventure, mystery, realistic fiction, or just books that Gary Paulsen wrote. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is the best book ever in my opinion. If I could rate it one to five, one being the lowest and five the highest. I would probably rate it a 5 star book. The setting of this book is in the Canadian wilderness. There is only one main character and that is Brian Robeson. The other characters are Brian's mother and father, and the pilot. The whole conflict of the story is that Brian is stranded in the Canadian woods and has to survive with just a hatchet, the woods around him, and the torn windbreaker on his back.This book is a must read for the reason that this 13 year old boy is stranded in the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. Also most pages left you wondering what was going to happen next so you kept turning the pages. It was almost like I was falling into the book's trap.Not only is the book good but the author is outstanding at writing books. Gary Paulsen is an out doors man. Gary has written almost 200 books. They are mostly outdoors books for example \\"Hatchet\\", \\"Woodsong\\", \\"Dogsong\\", \\"The Winter Room\\", and many more. The only reason I read other authors is that my English teachers make me. Gary Paulsen Books inspire me. I get interested in the book very fast when I read Gary's books. This shows why I liked to read \\"Hatchet\\" and it tells some parts in \\"Hatchet\\" and why I like Gary and some facts about him."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I started injoying this book in the fourth chapter because excitment was wild in my mind.

This book shows how a boy (Brian) is living through the Canadian Wilderness after a plane crash. It is an amazing story about how some movies and books about survival are nowhere near real life situations. This book is great for outdoorsy people and people that love the wilderness. But I am not that kind of person so that's why I only gave the book a 4 star rating. But if you want to find out what happens to Brian who is alone in the wilderness then read Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"well to start off, the book was really great. I really liked the problems that Brian had like the time he couldn't get a fire started. Plus he ripped up a twenty-dollar bill but he had to use some other materials to give the sparks a ''home''. I can't believe that he would eat pits of berries. You'd have to be crazy to do that. Well I think that when the moose trampled over Brian and hit him about a hundred times, I heard that moose aren't that aggressive like that, cause if you go hunting for moose you can't find that many of them it would only happen about 1 million to 1, and Brain was lucky number 1. In my opinion I would like to be Brian besides when the moose got really mad at him. The reason I like this book is because I like the outdoors, and I do a lot of what Brian did in the book like build a fire. I recommend this book to people that like the outdoors, not like in your yard but in the mountains. I give this book a 4 star rating, if I give you 4 star rating that's a good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet,by Gary Paulsen is about a 13 year old boy, Brian Robeson.

His parents are divorced. Brian gets stranded in the woods on the way to visit his father in the Canadian forest. The pilot has a heart attack and Brian ends up flying the plane. He flies terrified for a few hours and then the warning light for low fuel comes on. Brian knows he has to land the plane somehow. He manages to land in the middle of a lake. He then finds his way our and makes it to the surface. The cold blank dead face of the pilot haunts him. For 63 days he lives in the large Canadian forest. Happy and sad events take place while living in the forest. For example, he learns how to make fire and a territorial insane moose mauls him over. Over these 63 days, he learns important life lessons.I liked this book a lot. However, its one of those books that you either like it or you don't. My favorite part of the book is when he learns how to capture fish. I also like the part when he finally learns how to make fire.-Killian"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is about a boy who is going to see his dad.

This book has too many gross descriptions. For example, when Brian shoots the animals and when the dead pilot is mentioned, the author gives overly gory details. But, perhaps this is what living in the wilderness is like. Because of this, boys might like this book better than girls might. I did feel bad for Brian, since his parents are divorced and he was all alone. Besides being gory, The Hatchet is also a little depressing and a bit boring. I also read the sequel, Brian's Winter, and it too is not one of my favorites. I had to read these two books for school and I would not recommend them since I did not enjoy them."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetI think other readers should read this book because it has lots of adventures and it is very interesting.

As he headed for his father, who lived in the Canadian wilderness, the pilot of the single engined plane had a heart attack. Brian vaguely knew how to fly the plane and landed it in an l-shaped lake. He survives the crash and is able to swim to shore. He then, builds himself a shelter and makes a fishing spear. To survive he used his hatchet and birch bark to make fire. To keep from starving, he ate gut berries, berries that made him sick, raspberries, and he eventually learned how to fish and hunt with spears. While fishing, he had an encounter with a moose that left him with broken ribs. To make matters worse, a tornado destroys his shelter and scatters his weapons. Right after the tornado, he realizes that the plane's tail end was sticking out of the water and the survival pack was still inside. He retrieved the survival pack and enjoyed the food, weapons and sleeping bag. There was also an emergency transmitter that, he believed, was broken. Little did he know, a nearby plane received the transmission and he was rescued. During the story, Brian learned many life lessons and had to learn things he would need to survive.

Well Brains first time in a plane was a disaster. The Hatchet written by Gary Paulsen is a book about Brian who goes to visit his father in Canada and his plane crashes.The author made the setting very realistic. He talked about the forest, the clear blue lakes, and the blue mountains that Brian was surrounded by as he crashed and landed. I can compare the setting to where I live because I live in Bassett where there is a lot of trees, lakes, and streams.Brian is a thirteen year old boy that gets smarter as the book goes. His Mom and Dad are divorce so his Mom lives in New York and his Dad lives in Canada. His Mom is seeing another man, HIM. The pilot of the bush plane has a heart attack. Brian's friend Terry goes to the mall with Brian and they go to the park together. Don't forget the last character, the fur buyer that comes looking for fur and hears Brian's radio transmitter.The book starts off that Brian's parents are getting divorce. Then Brian goes to see his Dad in Canada and his pilot has a heart attack so Brian has to fly the plane. Brian fly's the plane until it runs out of gas and crashes. He is ok after the crash but the question is will he make it alone in the wilderness. You will have to read it to find out.I think this is a great book that is not too long or too short. Gary, the author, makes the book feel so real. He makes the reader believe in Brian as a real person. It seemed like I was there with Brian in the Canadian Wilderness.Here's a part that Brian says after the tornado.- \\"I hope the tornado hit the moose.\\"Here's a little more of Gary Paulsen's writing.- \\"It was beautiful and terrible at the same time.\\"- \\"He was whipped against the front wall of the shelter like a rag, felt ripping pain in his ribs again, then was hammered back down into the sand once more while the wind too the whole wall, his bed, the fire, his tools, all of it and threw it out into the lake, gone out of sight, gone forever.\\"So now you see a little preview of this book, now go to your local library and check out the Hatchet by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I got this book for my 27 yo son.

Very pleased w/ this purchase."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was written in a style that was easy to read. Probably intended mostly for adolescent boys. However, as a sixty year old female, I can say that I enjoyed this story as an easy, escapest read.The theme of the story seemed to me to be that the basic driving force in the animal kingdom is the search for food. To be able to successfully search for food, you need to have a safe sheltor from the elements and predators, and be able to stay healthy. For example, a human who is lost in the wilderness, and happens to break his leg could die because he would not be able to do the things needed to search successfully for food. This is the same as what happens to animals in the wild if they are injured.In our modern world which is so far removed from the truths of nature, it was enjoyable to read this basic survival story."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"VERY AWSOM!

Brian did in the book Hatchet. It's boring in the beginning flying, flying, flying, flying, then KABOOM!! The action comes in. The author Gary Paulson really knows what he is writing. If you want to know what happens to Brian, get this book now!Hatchet is a book with the main character Brian whose parent's are divorced and Brian has to take a plane from his mom to his dad. The pilot had a heart attack and Brian was all alone for about four days in the woods. He had a lot of challenges throughout the book. One is when Brian dug some turtle eggs and a skunk came and dug up the eggs. Brian tried to scare the skunk but it squirted Brian in the eyes before he could retrieve the eggs. After a few days, Brian was saved when a helicopter rescued him.My favorite part of the book is how Brian made his shelter. I mean how he described how he made it. It's clever how he made his shelter by himself. I also liked when he scraped the hatchet with a type of rock and did it again, again, and again until he remembered a commercial that taught him to blow on the wood when it sparked. Then he did the same thing. The book is filled with 195 pages of survival techniques.The most important thing I leaned from the book is how you can make a bow and arrow and a spear to kill fish and eat them.There is another book by the same author and the same series. It's called Brian's Hunt. There's Brian's Return, Brian's Winter, and The River and he has written several more books.I recommend that you read this book because it's like an instruction book of survival. I think it's a great book too. If you want to read this book, come and get it!I rate this book five stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Very good middle school book especially for adventurous readers. Completed for reading fair.

A hatchet. Well this boy named Brian Roberson did. He was stranded alone on the shores of a Canadian forest eighth only one thing. Well do you didn't know yet this book is named Hatchet and the authors name is Gary Paulsen.In this book there is a boy named Brian who is on an airplane and the pilot has a heart attack. He has to survive until he gets rescued which trust me would take a long time for anyone who crashed in the forest with only his/her clothing and a hatchet on your belt. He has to go hunting make all types of tools. And then there's some bad that happen along the way. It's a really good book. I can insure you that you will like this book. So you should defiantly get this book.My favorite part of the book is when Brian gets stuck in a huge storm. Its pouring buckets and there was a leak in the roof going drip drop drip drop. And his shelter has little rivers of water going through it. And remember the only clothes he has are the ones on his back. There's thunder booming like one thousand bombs going off at once.This book has taught me that being strong, mentally focused, not panicking will keep you alive in any situation. Including survival in the forest.Some other books written by this author are Brains return, Brains winter, tracker, woods runner and guts. Some other books like hatchet are the Hunger Games series.My recommendation for this book is that anyone aged 9-109 years old will like this book!

The main topic is about a boy, named Brian, who gets lost in a forest and does not know how to get out. This book does have a very detailed storyline. Its setting is not jumping from place to place and its setting transitions into one another. I mean that the settings always show the boy taking every footstep in the story; it doesn't jump around (for example: chapter 3 Going to die, chapter 4 The memory, and chapter 5 his eyes snapped open).Brian had awful memories of his family the whole time. It helps create the story in your mind by creating vivid pictures. I personally do get pleasure from this book because it was a very unproblematic for me to understand (unlike most chapter books). I recommend this book to those who like adventure, but it does have some disturbing things in it.The main characters in the story are Brian, his mom, and dad. He was in a plane going to his dads and it crashed in the forest. He had to survive and find a way to get help. Using his hatchet his mom gave him to survive out in the forest, he used it for multiple uses.

I remember not being that thrilled about reading, especially for recreation, myself until I found the book that caught my attention and swept me into a different world. My son had read this book in school for a report and wanted to have it at home and that told me something. Maybe he had found the book. I got this 20th Anniversary Edition and he plowed right through it again, happily reviewing the events of each chapter with me. As he had shown so much interest in this book, I even ordered the next two in the series to see if we could keep the momentum going and so I can report to you that he is just as interested in what happens to Brian in The River and Brian's Winter.Again, it has been difficult for us to find THE story that would catch his eye, that would garner enough of his attention to show him that reading is not only an assignment at school but entertainment that stimulates the imagination while giving the reader characters to care about and a story to enjoy in a way that movies can't. The tale of Brian's unfortunate adventures in the woods caught something in him. I can't say if it will work for you but The Hatchet has been that book for my son.For me? It was Up Periscope by Robb White. Boys will be boys."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Why did I never read this when I was younger?? I vaguely recall it being a popular book during my middle school years, especially with the boys, so maybe I somehow got the idea that it was a 'boy book.' I'm so glad I decided to finally read it. It was a quick read, and I was absolutely gripped by Paulsen's survival tale right from the very beginning pages. The author so expertly uses Brian's inner monologues as a writing technique, that I nearly didn't realize that the book has no dialogue to speak of. The writing and the story are just so good--definitely an 'unputdownable' book. Without being overly wordy, Paulsen paints a clear picture of 13-year-old Brian's weeks alone in the woods. I loved Brian; he was such a likeable and real character. My one criticism of the book is that the 'Epilogue' didn't seem to 'jibe' with the rest of the book. It was almost as if it had a different voice or style or something. But as a whole, I was hooked by this story.

The unprepared teenager is left with only a hatchet and his inexperienced mind to attempt to survive in a place he has never been before. Beautifully written, Hatchet takes readers into Brian's eyes as he tries to overcome physical and mental obstacles. This is one dramatic Newbery Honor book that you certainly won't forget. Gary Paulson, a 3 time Newbery Honor winner, also wrote Brian's Winter, Dogsong, and Tracker. Also, this book is not recommended for children 9 and under."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen-year-old Brian's parents have just gotten divorced. Brian lives with his mother in New York State, and is allowed to stay with his father, who works in the Canadian oil fields, during the summer. This will be his first summer with his father, and Brian's mother sees him off at the airport, giving him a gift that he feels is a bit silly: a hatchet.Flying in the small plane takes some getting used to; it's very noisy, it's cramped, and at first the pilot doesn't talk very much. After a while, the pilot does begin to talk with Brian and even lets him take control of the plane for a bit. Then the absolute worst possible scenario occurs: the pilot has a massive heart attack and dies, leaving Brian at the controls of an aircraft that he really doesn't know how to fly.Brian survives the crash, and then realizes that the plane has flown so far off course that he probably won't be found any time soon. He now has to survive the Canadian wilderness. He's a kid, and he does wallow in self-pity, but not for long. Brian isn't a typical soft city kid. Somehow he's able to put together bits and pieces of things he's learned in school, and he's able to carve out a place for himself on the shore of a remote lake. He takes pride in each accomplishment, as well he should. But the longer he lived in his lakeside home, the more nervous I got. Summers don't last all that long in Canada.This was a captivating read, and I can understand why it was a Newbery Honor Book in 1988. Paulsen had me on the shore of that lake right at Brian's side. I was slapping mosquitoes and taking pride in Brian's level-headedness and ability to survive. If you're looking for a quick read that's well-written and puts you right in the middle of the action, Hatchet is an excellent choice.Gary Paulsen's life is as interesting as the books he's written. In reading about the author, I learned that there are a whole series of books about Brian."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this aloud to my 8 year old. He really, really loved it. I myself didn't like it quite as much, but thought it was still quite good. Also, I don't think the suicide or marital infidelity plot points need turn anyone away. Both are dealt with using a fairly light touch. My boy and I had many great discussions prompted by the question \\"what would YOU do if..\\" after the introduction of each new challenge in the adventure.I highly recommend this book. Especially to be read aloud to boys between 8 and 12."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulsen, Hatchet (Aladdin, 1987)In the annals of survival kidlit, there are a few books that we always come back to. Twenty years ago, Gary Paulsen added Hatchet to the list, and it's a book that has cropped up again and again since on recommended reading lists alongside, or sometimes taking the place of, such stalwarts as Robb White's immortal Deathwatch. And I'm willing to admit that my thinking Hatchet doesn't hold up to Deathwatch could very well be because I first read Deathwatch as a fifth-grade reading assignment, and I didn't read Hatchet until I was forty. Who knows? One way or the other, though, while Hatchet is a very good book, I'm not sure it's the immortal classic that I've heard it made out to be many times.The plot is a simple one: Brian Robeson, the only survivor of a deep-woods plane crash, must survive until some chance plane flying overhead discovers him. He has some equipment with him, but most of it is buried in the plane, which is out in the middle of the lake, with all the access points underwater. All he has to work with are his clothes, the things he can find in the world around him, and the hatchet his mother gave him just before he left. How does a coddled city boy learn to survive, alone, in the wild?When your plot is this simple (and I have to say, it takes a writer with some stones to try and write an entire novel from a plot that simple), you have little choice but to focus on the other aspects of writing--character, description, theme (though god help the writer who replaces the Western prejudice towards plot with a similar reliance on theme, for he will almost certainly turn out unreadable dreck). This is one of the reasons that survival literature, that which survives the test of time anyway, is so great: the plot is always that simple, so the parts of novels that normally get short shrift, at least in this country, are forced to come to light. This is magnified in kidlit, which is, in general, so plot-heavy that the books that really work with character (The Giver, e.g.) are pretty much automatic classics. Hatchet is one of those books. Pretty much by default, survival lit is about its main character growing and changing, which makes it perfect for kidlit. Paulsen avoids one of the traps of this sort of thing by making Brian into a well-rounded character beforehand, rather than taking a two-dimensional character and making him into a three-dimensional one. Good choice.Still, from an action perspective (and action is another staple of survival novels, kidlit or otherwise), Hatchet doesn't work as well as other giants in the genre. Again, this comes from a gutsy decision on Paulsen's part; rather than giving Brian an antagonist, the bulk of the book is just Brian and the world around him. Interesting move, and effective to an extent, but the book does lag now and again. Not horribly; the pages keep turning well enough, and the character development here is enough of a reason to keep reading. It could've just used a kick in the seat now and again to get it moving a little faster.Darned good, but if you liked it, check out some of the other books in the genre and you may find you like them even better. ***"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a great book. I purchased it for my 12 year old daughter who had to read it this summer for a summer reading assignment. She actually enjoyed the book very much and finished it in 2 days."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet gives all children a sense of wonder and connection to the life around them. It shows what is possible. This edition is beautifully illustrated and should be in every library and on every private bookshelf."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Not only adventure and suspense, but documents perserverance, patience, and how reality comes through thought. Brian's struggles are at a magnified level of the ones we all face, but at the same time put ours in perspective. Paulsen has a wonderful way of communicating experiences and opening different perspectives of existence to young readers. This book is especially recommended to any young people going through difficult times, as it cuts to the quick with emotions, but provides the driving force to live and succeed."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This award winning book was recommended to me from a customer who works in a library to give my 9 year old nephew as a birthday gift. I always read my gifts and think this is just a truely great book on survival and how to appreciate learning to do things on your own as opposed to modern convienences doing all the work for you.

The ending left me hanging similar to Cast Away... I was or with the main survivor the whole way through the ordeal and only at the end of he book after finding the plane with the survival bag and gear, all that will help him (and me) in the struggle is here, finally, and then BAM!, the emergency transmitter locates the boy and he's home. What about some bridge to his new life and how it helped him survive in the City? To be fair there was a small paragraph of how his experience helped his senses but it isn't the same. Anyway, the ending was a bit unexpected not all that bad, just left me wanting more. I just wanted more, I mean, I stayed up late to finish it and then I was left with emptiness."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by Gary Paulson is a tragic adventure of a young boy named Brian Robeson. Brian Robeson is a fourteen-year-old boy that lives with his mother in northern United States. He is traveling by a Cessna 406 airplane to visit his father. Before leaving the airport, Brian's mother gives him a hatchet that will later save his life. While flying to Canada, the pilot shrieking, \\"Chest! Oh God, my chest is coming apart,\\" said the pilot. Brian knew now that the he was having a heart attack. The pilot was put to death making Brian crash land the plane in a lake. Brian has been stranded in as southern Canadian forest for about two months. This is not one of my favorite books. I would prefer this book to people that like intense reading. The only bad thing about this book is that Paulson repeats himself a lot.

I love how real the story is and once I started it was hard for me to put down. The author is so descriptive with the things Brian is going through. At times I can fell like him in the shelter at sunset. Watching the sun fill the sky with colors. Also I felt it when Brian got the survival bag. I was looking forward to read what Brian was going to do with all that stuff. Well as Perpich said \\"You are your most valuable asset. Don't forget that. You are the best thing you have\\". I think that that is so true. Even though the hatchet saved Brian's life a few times I think he would have some how still lived without it. I know that it would have been much harder but I think he could have lived without it.I think that the theme of Hatchet is to be prepared for the worst. I agree with it 100% because there have been times when I though that things couldn't get any worst but they did.I would so recommend this book like I said it is a masterpiece. The book will bring you right in and time will fly by without you knowing it. It's like a vacuum! Also I would read it because Gary Paulsen is such a good author. I also read \\"The Car\\". Also another great book. But that's another story to tell."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"For these past two weeks, I have been reading the novel,Hatchet, written by Gary Paulsen. Thirteen year-old, Brian Robeson is a very couragic and inspirational character. His Hatchet, that his mother gaev him, also played a heroic role aswell. It ended up basically saving his own life. This novel struck my interests because I really enjoyed the way Brian never gave up: \\"Now I have some food and I can do something about fixing this plane up.\\"(page 64-65). Brian inspired me with his never-ending persistance.The theme of this novel is that humans, when lost or trapped in an environment like tundra, Canada, they will try their hardest and make the best fo the situation that they're in - whether they survive or not. I definately agree with this theme because I have been in situations like Brian's. My friend and I had gotten lost on a camping trip where the temperature there (New England)was ten - fiftheen degrees farenheit outside. Luckly, we found our way back to the campsite within a couple of hours - nothing though, like Brians experiance.I would easily recommend this novel to others; to anyone who enjoys this fction genre, or to those who would like ot learn survivol tactics adn a moral of life. The novel tells a tael of inspiration, couragic behavior, and the shear will to survive adn enjoy and respect life .

Good job Gary Paulson and keep writing those great books."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"...I think that everyone should read Hatchet, a spectacular novel by Gary Paulsen. The foremost reason why I think Hatchet is great is because of the way Paulsen describes all of Brian's situations. He describes them so well that it feels like you're in that situation yourself. Then after some situations you just have to take a little break because they were so real. The next reason why I adore Hatchet is because of how Paulsen puts himself into the story. Almost all of the things thatBrian went through in the book Paulsen had gone through during his life. For example, like Brian, Paulsen had to hunt to survive in the wilderness. My last and favorite reason why I enjoyed Hatchet is because of the way that Paulsen always left you guessing. In the story you would for sure think that something was going to happen, but then there was a sudden turn of events. Sometimes the turn of event would be good then other times bad. As you can tell, Gary Paulsen truly out did himself in the spectacular novel Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet was a good book. I realy liked that book. When I was reading the book it made me feel like I was in the book. There was nothing I disliked in the book. The book taught me lots of suvival skills.In the book Hatchet, the best part of the book was the end. If I had to choose one part that I enjoyed the most, it would probably be when Brian got resqued. This was the most exciting part because Brian was out there so long. I wanted the book to end too.One of the most vivid parts of the book Hatchet was the setting. This was when Brian crashed the plane into the lake that was surrounded by land. He described it so well that I had to stop reading for a minute. The vivid conflict of this book was man against nature. Brian was faced with a lot of dangers by being stranded in the mountain. One example was when he got hit by a porcupine.

Well neither did Brian Robinson but it happened to him. Imagine having no electricity and not being able to eat anything but fish, berries, birds and turtle eggs, you would probably freak out, I know I would. Well this is what happens in Gary Paulsen's suspenseful book Hatchet.Hatchet is about a city boy named Brian Robinson. Brian's great adventure starts when he's on his way to his dad's house for the summer because his parents broke up. On the way there the pilot has a heart attack and dies so Brian takes the wheel and crash lands and miraculously lives. So Brian has to make shelter and hunt or gather for food. While he's living in the wilderness Brian meets some unwelcome guests. Brian gets to meet thousands of mosquitoes, a skunk, a fox and a moose.There are many exiting parts in Hatchet but here is one you'll never forget. One day Brian turned around and a gigantic moose was charging full speed at him and it hit him so far he landed in the lake. But the moose didn't stop there it kept hitting him again and again. So for the next two weeks Brian was in bad pain.The main theme of Hatchet is loneliness. Loneliness best fits Hatchet because for pretty much the entire book Brian is all alone in the wilderness.I would rate this book a nine out of ten because there was only about two boring parts but the rest of the book was very exiting.

Since Brian's parents are divorced, he was riding on a plane to visit his dad for the summer. Brian rode in a tiny plane with a pilot who was about 40 years old. During the flight, the pilot had a heart attack and died. Brian was in charge of the plane after the pilot died but he didn't have a pilot's license. Brian was very scared because he hardly knew how to drive a plane. He thought he was going to die. The plane then crash landed into a lake. Brian was able to swim a long distance to reach the shore. By the time he reached the shore, he was aching with horrible pains due to the plane crash. The shore was located in the middle of Canada. All around him was a forest with lots and lots of trees. The forest had terrible bugs that Brian had to endure. It was also cold and he did not have any food either. He was so hungry that all he could think about was eating a chocolate malt and a hamburger. Brian knew he had to find a place to sleep even before he found food. After finding a safe place surrounded by rocks, he searched and searched a long time for food. Finally he found bitter tasting berries. He ate the whole berry pit and all. Then he used his torn up wind breaker to carry the berries back to where he set up camp. Another source of food that Brian ate were snapping turtle eggs. Some other animals tried to eat the eggs so he had to shoo them away. Brian had to survive very harsh things. He had to be a very resourceful to survive in the wilderness. For example, he made a bow in order to fish and hunt rabbits. Brian also needed to find a way to make a fire. He knew a fire would keep him warm, cook his food and also keep the bugs away. To start the fire he hit his hatchet against a stone to make a spark. The spark then lit wood shavings he had carved which started a fire. Even though Brian had been very resourceful in the wilderness, he knew he needed the surival kit that was on board the crashed plane. He decided to make a raft and take his hatchet out with him. He dropped his hatchet into the water on his way out to the plane but luckily he was able to recover it. He was extremelly joyful that he was able to get the survival kit. This made his life in the wilderness much easier. Through this extremely difficult time, Brian was able to do so much more than he thought he could.

Its amazing how this 13- year old boy survives living in a forest for about two months. In the book Hatchet, Brian experiences a pilot dying, a plane crash, no food, no water, and a fight for survival. Right when he hears a search plane, he thought he would be saved. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. The plane turned around and Brian was stuck there. Right when things were going well, a mini tornado comes. Brian's camp site was all over the place. If you think you have problems, wait until you see how many Brian has!In the beginning of the book Brian rides in a plane to go see his dad. On the trip there, one big problem comes along. The pilot gets a lot of aches in his body. Then, sadly he dies. Brian is so confused. He doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know how to drive a plane! His only solution is to do his best job by landing it. He finds a clear path and try's to land it. Brian thought he was doing a pretty good job landing the plane, until it hit the water and some trees. The plane sunk into the water while Brian was struggling to get out. Finally he gets a way out. \\"pgs. 32-34\\"When Brian finally gets everything he needs to survive in the wilderness, a mini tornado comes Brians way. Brian's camp site got blown away. All the wood from the fire was gone. Everything he used to survive was gone. Luckily he got his hatchet before it could blow away. After the tornado Brian immediately started creating a new camp site. He found interesting planks of wood that he could use to cook his meat. He went on hikes searching for wood to burn. In no time Brian's camp site was back to normal. \\"Pgs. 155-160\\" During the tornado, Brian was very lucky he did not get hurt.Brian did a lot of good problem solving in Hatchet. When Brian needed something he quickly rushed into making something that could complete his task. Usually right away his tool did not do a thing. He studied what he was doing wrong and then he got it right. Overall Brian was a good problem solver.This book to me had some very boring parts to it and it did not come to my interest.

NO we dont!!!!!! i told my friend i would give her a chocolate bar if she could read it in a week and 2 days. she did it but she said she had to force herself to. the only reson i read it because i had to do a book report on it. we had options and since hatchet wasa supposed to be SOOOOO good i chose it. the only reason i didnt get a different book was bcauase i didnt have time to finish two. i feel sooo bad for those of u who read it in school. i have to say, it was worse then voyage of the frog and that was a really BAD book. its soo boring. in the first chapter brians on the island, in second chapter, brians still on the island ad for third, fourth, fifth ect. i would rather watch grass grow than read hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I couldn't stand this book about a young boy surviving in the wilderness when his plane crashes.

I recommend this book not be read, I was relieved to FINALLY finish it. Very predictable."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this in 2'd grade and hated it. The lack of dialogue and organization in this book made it seem very weak and unrealistic. I believe that if I mixed up the chapters of this book , I could re-arrange them in any order , and it would make just as much sense as it did before. This is because this book was incredibly contrived. The style of writing gets old very fast. With one single weak character you could care less about , and a weak plot , I suggest you dont communicate or make eye contact with an individual who finds this book even remotely exciting."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It looked as though a dog chewed on book....book was in very poor condition...Very disappointed in this purchase..Expected much better from Amazon.com"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"this book was advertised as being &#34;very good&#34;.

But as a survivor Brian wasn't so selfish and thought more about his actions.The part I didn't like was the gruesome details which there weren't a lot of them.

Brian is flying to visit his divorced dad in Canada in a small bush plane, when suddenly the pilot has a gruesome heart attack in the middle of flying. Brian is forced to live for weeks in an unforgiving environment with a small hatchet as his only tool that was given to him by his mother before taking off.I think that Hatchet is not very descriptive and lacks descriptive words, causing some parts of the book to be boring to read. Brian's survival in this environment seemed to be lucky in a way, and it seemed he didn't have many hard challenges, even though he is alone and is in the middle of nowhere.Hatchet is a well thought out story. Some parts are interesting and fun to read. I recommend this book for all ages. Even though the book lacks detail and description this makes Hatchet a fairly easy book to read and also makes the story go quickly."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I love Gary Paulsen books and I think that Hatchet is his best book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is the story of Brian Robeson. A young boy with a frustrating home life. But as Brian boards a small airplane taking him to see his father in Canada he realizes he is the only passenger. Quickly frustration becomes fear. However the flight seems to be going fine and the fear seems to wane. That is until the pilot dies of a heart attack and sends the tiny plane plummeting into the ground. Miraculously Brian survives the plane which landed in a small lake. But can he survive the hunger, the animals, the elements, and the loneliness he will find in the Canadian forest when he has nothing but a small hatchet to help him?This is a great story if you like adventure and nature tales. Though it starts out a little slow it picks up quickly and draws you in to it. The under story about Brian's parents and home life gets a little confusing at times but mostly it helps enrich the story. I recommend this book for ages 10 and up."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"this is the best book yet the beast thing that happens is he gets to fly a plane and then a distater happens read the book"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was a great book to read, and learn from.

I would recomend this book to a bot more so than a girl and i would recomend this to a person who likes reading adventurous books.I think that you should read this and recomend it to friends"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by Gary PaulsenDo you like to read adventure/action books? Well, you're in luck because the book I'm discussing is an adventure/action book. It is Hatchet by Gary Paulsen and I thought that it was a wonderful book.One reason why I liked reading this book is the adventure packed setting. The setting takes place in the wilderness, and non-stop action occurs in every chapter. For example, in chapter two the pilot experiences a heart attack while flying his plane.Another reason why I liked this book is because the author included his own real life experiences in his writing. He spent time in the wilderness, and this is evident in the story. In my opinion, only a really creative person could write about being stuck in the wilderness!Finally, I thought the book was interesting. I kept wondering what would happen next every time I read a page. I found it very exciting when the plain crashed. What was Brian going to do? I think it was very interesting how the author Gary Paulsen experienced this too.As you can see I really liked this book and if you read it, you will hopefully like it too. Gary Paulsen is a great author who seems to like adventure and exciting life experiences."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read in my life. I really liked the heart pumping on how he survived in the woods only using the resources he had. I mean a 13 year old kid nothing to lose only his hope and then boom!! His plane came crashing down. I will say that the theme is to never give up hope even if you feel hopeless. I think he wrote \`Hatchet' because he has done a lot of survivor stunts. Whoever likes reading adventure books this one is the right one for you. It's one of the best books he has ever written."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is the story of a 13 year-old boy, Brian Robison, surviving alone in the Canadian Wilderness. Brian is the only passenger in a small plane on a trip to visit his father who is recently divorced from his mother. The pilot of the plane has a heart attack and dies while the plane crashes into a small lake. Brian survives and swims to shore with only his clothes and a hatchet that was given to him by his mother as a present. Brian survives hordes of mosquitoes on the beach, and, later on in the story, a moose attack. He uses his hatchet to help him survive by using it to help start a fire, hunt for food, and to make his shelter. He also realizes that there is a survival kit in the fuselage of the plane; he almost loses his hatchet while attempting to retrieve the kit.Although Brian grows in character development so he can survive, the sub-plot of Brian's preoccupation with his parents divorce detracts from the main story. Additionally, the family's \\"dirty secret\\" (his mom was seen kissing another man) also preoccupies Paulsen and detracts from a good survival an adventure story."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is about a boy named Brian Robeson. He went down in a plane crash after the pilot had a heart attack. Brian was heading to Canada to see his father because his parents split up. All Brian had when he crashed was his hatchet, which was a gift from his mother. Brian made a shelter under a huge boulder beside the lake. One night a porcupine came into his hut and stuck him with his tail. Brian decided to make a door to keep the animals out, and a fire to keep him warm. Brian used his hatchet to make sparks to start a fire. Brian needed food so he made a bow and a spear to hunt fish and rabbits to eat. One day Brian was down by the lake when a moose attacked him, and in the same night a tornado tore down his hut. His bow and spear where also broken by the tornado. The tornado also pulled the tail of plane out of the water. Brian remembered the survival pack in the plane so he cut open a hole inside of the plane and retrieved to survival pack. The pack had food, fishing hooks, knife, sleeping bag, and other helpful things. The next day Brian heard a strange noise heading towards him so you have to read the book to find out what it is.I thought the book was very good because it was exciting and adventurous. I would recommend this book to people who like adventures or just like a good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson, a 13-year-old boy suffering from his parents' divorce, is the only passenger in a bushplane. After the pilot has a heart attack and dies, Brian maneuvers the plane until it crashes in a lake. Brian survives the crash and all he has is a hatchet attached to his belt. In pain and hunger, Brian manages to build a shelter, find turtle eggs, build a fire, and make an arrow and a bow. He learns quickly what berries he can eat and what is the best way to catch a fish or a fool bird. He is determined to use his courage, intelligence, knowledge, and patience to make life in the wilderness possible, although once he felt into despair and wanted to commit suicide. Then a tornado brings his plane to the surface of the lake. Using the hatchet, Brian gets into the plane and retrieves the survival pack. After turning on the emergency transmitter in the survival pack, Brian is rescued on his 54th day in the wilderness.Paulsen's story attracts readers with good pace, suspense, and realistic details. Paulsen successfully shows readers how Brian learns through trial and error. He always watches, listens, thinks, and learns from his mistakes. Brian's preoccupation with his parents' divorce and his mother's secret affects him like an emotional wound. However, as a result of his survival experience, Brian sees life in a different perspective and becomes more mature. Although this story aims at young adult readers, it is also valuable to children and adults. After reading this story, I come to be thankful for all I have. The story also helps me realize that in order to succeed, I must overcome despair, prepare to learn from mistakes, and be determined to achieve my goals patiently.I highly recommend this book to young adults because it helps them realize that they are their most valuable assets and that they should be positive in all circumstances."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is about a boy who goes to visit family but on the way he gets into a plane accident and is forced to survive in the wilderness. He learns the true meaning of hunger and he learns valuable lessons here. He also has a strong urge to survive. This is by far on of the greatest survival books of all time. Through this brutal adventure he learns from mother nature and faces the horrid reality of isolation. You should definatly read it. You won't regret. It is very cleaver how the author uses incidents from his own life and develops a character."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"There is something lacking in Paulsen's style. There was no distinguishable climax, and plot structure was no where to be seen. There was sometihng unrealistic about Brian's survival attempts. It was as if the book droned on for ever, and the end was no where in sight.

There was no distinguishable climax, and plot structure was no where to be seen. There was sometihng unrealistic about Brian's survival attempts.

Well, here is a book that I couldn't put down because Hatchet is the best survival book that I have ever read. The characters in the story are a boy named Brian, his mother, and a pilot. Hatchet is a very descriptive book. This book is about a boy who went on a trip in a pilot plane and crash landed into a lake. Brian is in the wild for almost a year. I thought that the ending was good. The book was very good and I think you could not put the book down."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is the best book i have ever read. I have read some other books written by Gary Paulsen and I think he is the best author ever. Hatchet is a fiction book where Brian Robeson is trying to survive the wild of Canada and his parents divorce. This book is a great book for people who are going camping for the first time. This book should be on everybody's bookshelf with other books on surviving.In the beggining of the book Brian is going to his dad's house because their parents got divorced a couple of months ago. Before the flight his mother gives him a hatchet to put on his belt and if his dad makes him go and chop wood or something like that. After he has been flying for a hour or two the pilot ask how he is doing and shows him how to fly the plane . After that the pilot lets Brian fly the plane for a couple of minutes. Then they don't talk for a hour and then the pilot starts making weird noises and starts letting out awful smells. Brian doesn't say anything about it. Then the pilot screams and grabs his chest. The pilot dies of the heart attack. Brian luckily finds a L shaped lake and the gas runs out the plane crashes into the lake. Will Brian survive?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I honestly love this book. Gary Paulson is true in is words, and brings the book to life. He wrote an amazing storyline and I would recommend this book to high school students. The ending was a little rugged, but overall this was an awsome book and obviously a very popular one at that. I give this book two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"i think the book hachet is a good book because it just has alot of adventure like in the woods and outside his adventure began when he gotin the plane crash"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think hatchet was a very good book and one of few books I actualy got in to. It made me feel like I was there with Brian. The book made me think about being stranded in the wilderness differently than I would have before I read the book. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes the outdoors or just likes to read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Think back have you ever been lost in a mall or something when you were little? Well brain was but he didn't have any way of contacting anyone either. Do you like exciting survival stories? That's what The Hatchet is. If you do, you will like The Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It's a great survival story about a boy. He has to learn how to live off the land and find food and shelter on his won. Find out what happens to a boy that lives on his own in the wilderness.Crash boom that's when Brain's plane crashes in the middle of nowhere. His pilot has a heart attack and the plane crashes. Brain is a 14-year -old boy and he was on his way to his dad's house. Then his plane crashes in the middle of nowhere. Then he has to try to live off the land until someone rescues him. Brain has no way to contact anyone anywhere. He has to find food, water and shelter on his own out in the wild. Find out what problems that happen to Brain and if he gets rescued.I liked the book and thought it was very interesting. But there were a few parts of it I didn't like. Some of the parts were nasty and gross. But otherwise it was a really good book. This book gives you some tips if your plane ever crashes in the middle of nowhere.If you like survival stories, you will like The Hatchet. When you are in about middle school you will probably like it best. It is a good book for boys and girls. The Hatchet has a sequel. It's called The River. It is about what happened to Brian in the winter.Well then this is the book for you if you liked the things I said about it. Even if you don't like reading that much you will get into it and like it. I didn't like reading and I liked this. So when have you been in the wilderness alone?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I recommend this book to whoever likes survival and adventure books. Another reason is that it has great suspense and action. When the pilot had the heart attack, no one knew what was going to happen next. When the narrator said, \\" The pilot stopped jerking, his legs contracted up into the seat and his eyes rolled back until the whites in his eyes were showing\\". This part of the book gave a suspense that time just stopped because Brian is stuck with a dead pilot and is still in the air. Brian doesn't know how to fly a plane but manages. When Brian eats a raw turtle egg that he finds in the sand, this shows his fight to survive. He is going to survive any way possible. He has to do some brave things like pulling out porcupine quills out of his leg. \\"He grasped one of the quills, held his breath, and jerked.\\" That was brave because they were deep and the pain would so bad that someone could go into shock. I think that the adventure that Brian has is very well put in the book. Everything that happens to him and everything that he does is exciting in some way. So if you want to read a book that has lots of adventure and action in it this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetBy Gary PaulsenIn the novel Hatchet by Gary Paulsen tells about the survival situation and the thirteen years old boy, named Brian. Brian was going to Canada to visit his father during the summer vocation when the plane crashed in the wilderness. Brian spent a lot of time in wilderness without any help just his mind. In the wilderness, Brian learned how to live by himself, by using survival skills. The most important thing, which Brian had with him, was the hatchet, which his mother gave to him. This hatchet helped Brian do a lot of important things to survive in the wilderness.When Brian woke up from the plane crash, he was afraid and did not know what to eat how to stay alive. At first Brain made a lot of mistakes, because he did not know any animals and what kind of plants he can eat. Brian saw several wild animals such as: porcupine, skunk, turtle, moose, and bear. After some time, which Brian spent in the wilderness he knew already what was safe for him to eat and how he needed to behave with wild animals.Brian first days were horrible. He was afraid of everything and did not know what to do. Brian knew some things about the wilderness and what to do there, but then, when he was alone, he forgot everything. Brian made mistakes at first, however he learned from his mistakes a lot of useful things, which helped Brian to be safe in the wilderness.Time passed, Brian grew smarter with each day and knew more new things. After that time, which he spent in the wilderness Brian changed a lot. He was becoming more independent and could survive by himself. He was a young boy, who I think was brave, because he tried to do something new all the time and did not give up.I liked the novel Hatchet. It was somehow different from other novels, which I had read before. I liked the book, because it was written about the real life, not like science fiction. You can learn a lot of useful things from this story, and if you were in the same situation, this book Hatchet could help you to survive. So it is useful to read. I like the author of this novel, because he writes about events that could actually happen. In the rating scale one through five I would rate this novel a five. I would recommend to read the novel to other students and adults too.The novel Hatchet was about the young thirteen years old boy, who was going to visit his father during the summer break and crashed in the wilderness. This event was the most important in Brian's life. He changed inside and also outside, he became independent and could live by himself. Before those two months, which Brian spent in the wilderness he was just little mother's boy, but now Brian became smarter and had more knowledge. This event gave him a lot of good experiences, which helped him to be independent."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a book that is about a 13 year old boy named Brian Robeson who is left in the woods with nothing but his hatchet that his mother gave him and the knowledge that he has earned. Brian was on his way to his fathers house when something happens, the pilot dies, and the plane crashes into an L shaped lake in the Canadian wilderness. The whole book is about decisions, questions, and other things that Brian stumbles over during his adventure in the wilderness. The one thing that bothers him the most in this book is &quot;The Secret&quot;. The only thing I didn't like in this book is that they didn't share the mother and fathers perspective. Other thatn that, I gave the book an amazing 4 stars! I encourage everyone to read this book!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian is a thirteen-year-old boy whose parents have separated. He is on his way to visit his father in Canada when the single engine plane crashes because the pilot suddenly dies from a heart attack. Brian is forced to land the plane on a lake and swim safely to shore. The rest of the book deals with Brian's survival in the wilderness. Quite simply this is the best book I have ever read! It was a book that hooked me from the first pages. The story is written with such detail that I could see each step Brian took. I felt like I was an invisible observer in the woods. Gary Paulson has written one great book that everybody should read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"An exciting adventure story. Our fifth grade class read this book as we listened to the audio tape of it. After we read the book we watched the movie of it and discussed the differences between the book and the movie. The book gave better details concerning Brian's feelings, the things he did to survive, and the thoughts he had as he learned he could take care of himself. This is the type of experience which holds your interest and makes you want to read it all at once. Some of the students enjoyed the movie because we could see the scenery and realistically understand where he was and how it looked where he was. This is such a good story that we want to read another of Gary Paulson's books. GREAT STORY!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a story about a boy named Brian Robinson.

When the plane crashed I felt so sorry for Brian. I could have never survived the way he did. He had nothing but a hatchet, which he used to make weapons and to protect himself.

While in the jungle he has all kinds of adventures."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book, &quot;The Hatchet,&quot; by Gary Paulsen was a great book but just barely missed getting five stars. The reason I gave it four stars was because it wasn't as good as other books I read. It as often confusing and I did not no where the character was at or what was going on. Other than that it was a great book. The book was very exciting and some times he would be doing very well with the conflict he was in then another conflict would come and mess every thing up like a tornado or getting attacked by a mouse. The Hathcet was a great book for those who do or don't like adventure. I recomend this book to anybody young or old. This book makes you look at things differently, and I hope everybody reads it.THE END!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I became interested in reading Hatchet from friends that told me about it. They said it was a great book to read, so I did. The book has really only one character in it . His name is Brian Robeson. He had just gone though a divore of his parents and was very unhappy and upset. His dad moved to Canada. He was flying in a small plane. About half way thogh the trip the pilot died from a heart attack and died which left Brian alone to fly and land the plane. It all goes down hill after that. Brian's first few days he gets eaten by bugs and also eats piosonous berries. After wards Brian start to figure out how to survive in the wild. His first major achievement was making fire and it was his most important. Brian also figures out how to catch food and cook it. Then Brian thinks his good luck had ran out when a tornado hit and wrecked most of his stuff. The day after it hit he notices that the tail end of the plane was sticking out of the water and he remembered there was a survival pack in there with an emergency transmitter. Brian swims out to the plane and cuts a hole in it and finds the pack. He then turns the transmitter on and is saved within a few hours. The conflict of this book would be man vs nature because Brian had to deal with nature to survive. Man vs himself is the other conflict and I think it is that because Brian had to use his knowledge and talents to survive. Over all I thought this was an excellent book and I recommend this book to any one that wants to read it. If you like exciting, adventeruos, hard to put down books then read this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a fine work by Gary Paulsen.

I am an eighth grader at a school in Italy. I have read the book Hatchet, and I thought it was great! I liked the authors use of imagination. Gary Paulsen is a very creative writer. I enjoyed this book because it was very down to earth. I thought it was excellent concerning how the author went down to pre-teens and adolescent age. Many kids can relate to this book because many have parents that are divorced and can relate to Brian's pain. I really don't have a favorite character because Brian is practically the only character in the book. I admire Brian's actions and how he took care of things. I also admire his confidence and patience. Brian is one of the most courageous character's I have ever read about. I thought the book was great and all, but it wasn't perfect. There were some qualities in the book &quot;Hatchet,&quot; that I disliked. I disliked how the author described the scenery too much. I mean, sure, Mr. Paulsen can describe the scenery, but not all that much. It got kind of boring after awhile. I also didn't enjoy how Gary Paulsen said words over and over again. I think it is quite ridiculous how the author kept on bringing up the so-called &quot;Secret,&quot; out of the blue. For example, he'd be telling how Brian was scared to fly in the plane, then all of the sudden he would bring &quot;The Divorce,&quot; up or &quot;The Secret.&quot; He did it throughout the book. But I didn't mind, after all, Gary Paulsen is human. The book &quot;Hatchet,&quot;is a great book that should be read by all. I thought it was fun-filled and exciting. I encourage pre-teens and adolescents to read this book. I could not put this book down. So, if your a person who hasn't read this, I encourage you to."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I am 13 years old and I have read Hatchet. It was a great book and I enjoyed it a lot.

And it is these seventh grade students, struggling with reading, who enjoyed a feeling of competence as they read about Brian, the boy from the city, who must learn many of the facts which they find second nature. Because the chapters are untitled, the novel allows for discussions of main ideas and application of vivid imaginations to come up with illustrations and titles.

The stories and analogies allow the principles to be individually personalized within one's own heart and life. I laughed and cried.

Henderson may be a wizard, but a communicator he is not. He comes across as an arrogant geek who can't remember what it is like not to understand, and as a consequence his manner and method do nothing to enthuse the reader. This book needs to be completely overhauled and re-written, as it is unbelievably difficult to follow. My first project was to produce a CD rom with some interactive buttons which had no more than the usual light-up-if-the-mouse-passes-over-it kind of action. If this was detailed in the book, I couldn't find it, or anything like it, so I had to go to a bookshop and read other books, as I paid 40 for this one and couldn't afford another. I can honestly say that I learnt nothing from this book of any value to me, and I feel thoroughly ripped off. The author is obsessed with listing Xtras and apparently not particularly interested in orgainising basic information in an attractive and coherent manner. An awful book, and an awful shame."},{"Title":"Mastering Macromedia Director 5","review":"I cannot recommend this book. The examples (and CD-ROM) are totally useless, and the book goes in no apparent order. The largest chapter is on third-party Xtras, which have nothing to do with learning Director. Anyone trying to learn Lingo will be totally confused by the Indexes and References, and should probably get a Lingo Refernece Manual instead."},{"Title":"Mastering Macromedia Director 5","review":"the book is a drag , it is not clear on important cocepts -lingo to"},{"Title":"Mastering Macromedia Director 5","review":"Henderson does a great job of showing not only the power of Director 6, but detailed descriptions of general multimedia issues (color palettes, digital video, etc.). The only downside to this book is that it seems to be a little dated. For example, there are times when Henderson tells how to perform a particular Director function, but the function has changed from Director 5 to Director 6. This is a minor inconvenience, however, and is more than outweighed by the in-depth coverage of Lingo and Xtras."},{"Title":"Irving Penn Regards the Work of Issey Miyake","review":"Irving Penn Regards the Work of Issey Miyake displays the wordless harmony of the artistic relationship between Irving Penn, one of the great photographers of the twentieth century, and the designer Issey Miyake, one of the few figures to have taken clothing design into the realm of art. For more than a decade and across different continents, the work of one has provided a mirror for the work of the other. Miyake offers Penn the forms and textures that have been the substance of much of his long career. Penn's photographs allow Miyake to look again at his designs as if they were completely new. This is an invaluable representation of the intuitive partnership between two artists that Miyake describes as a \\"silent understanding.\\""},{"Title":"Hattie The Backstage Bat","review":"I used this with storytimes and the story was too involved for the preschoolers in a group setting.
