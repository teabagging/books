His discourse is more question and answer to the theological and philosifcal issues surrounding Francis than a history or biography. As my readings enlarge my scope I will go back to this title and hopefully appreciate the discourse more than at it's first reading."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"The reason I went away disappointed with Chesterton's work on St.Francis of Assisi is because I expected it to be a thorough biography full of chronological details like that of Augustine by Peter Brown or the two volumes of George Whitefield's biography by Arnold Dallimore. Instead, Chesterton only provides a sketch of Francis Bernadone and plenty of analysis on the man in chapter 1, his contributions in chapters 2 and 10. The remaining sections of the book only cover the highlights of Francis' ministry and how he got there. This book cannot be viewed as a biography but more of an introduction of who Francis is, as Chesterton himself acknowledges (p. 79).Chesterton depicts Francis as a humble man who loved to help the poor so much that he swore before God that he would never all his life refuse to help a poor man (p.19). In his young age, he was a failure as a soldier when he was sent home due to sickness, an event he called a descent into the valley of humiliation (p.24). But the worst was yet to come when, disappointed with his failed military career, he decided to steal some clothing from his father's store and sell it so the money could be used to rebuild the ruins of the Church of St. Damien. As a result, Pietro, Francis' father took the whole matter to court and put Francis in prison. Francis then gave himself to the Catholic Church to be a monk and established the mendicant Franciscan order. Chesterton did not elaborate much what this order was all about. He barely discusses \\"The Rule of St. Francis\\" and what the Franciscan friars did. The impression I received from Chesterton is that Francis was a very kind and courteous yet strange mystic. He treated everyone with respect and did not seem to ever hesitate to help anyone in need. On the other hand, he seemed to think that animals and inanimate objects understand human language. He treated each tree as \\"a separate and almost sacred thing, being a child of God and therefore a brother or sister of man\\" (p. 47). His communication to the fire and the birds strikes me as odd yet hilarious. When his eyes were about to be cauterized with a red hot iron as a remedy to prevent blindness, Francis pleaded to the fire in the branding iron, \\"Brother Fire, God made you beautiful and strong and useful. I pray you be courteous with me\\" (p.51). In addition to preaching to the birds, perhaps another famous account of Francis is that he received the stigmata, the wounds of Christ (p.75). Whether or not this account is true is disputable. I am not sure what Francis' theology looked like since Chesterton barely covers it. He only mentions that Francis tried to end the Crusades by attempting to convert the Muslims which he failed to do in his evangelistic effort to the Sultan of the Saracens (p.50, 71). I only learned a glimpse of Francis' theology somewhere else, namely from his famous prayer that God would use him as an instrument of his peace, which again, Chesterton does not mention.The conclusion I arrived at after reading Chesterton's brief sketch of St. Francis of Assisi is as follows. First, I am afraid the readers would be disappointed if they expect Chesterton's treatment goes like a story in a movie or a novel, because as I have pointed out, this book is more of an introduction or a biographical sketch or review. Second, if there is anything to imitate from St. Francis, it is not his excess mysticism or visions and dreams, but his life of simplicity and full of gratitude and praise in the midst of the abyss of poverty and suffering as well as his good manner, kindness and generosity. As I thought about the hypothetical prospect of being a Franciscan, I actually don't mind joining such an order committed to simplicity, study and helping people if only the Catholic Church holds to reformed theology or even their pre-medieval theology. The only ground for hesitation is that I'm not sure if I can live by asking people for money, food and clothing all the time like the Franciscans did back then. Anyhow, since I am not very happy with Chesterton's version of St. Francis' biography, I was thinking of trying \\"The Lessons of Saint Francis: How to Bring Simplicity and Spirituality into Your Daily Life\\" by Talbot and Rabey or \\"St. Francis Assisi: A Biography\\" by Omer Englebert."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"If you like Chesterton then you'll probably like this book. However, he can get on my nerves. I was wanted to learn about Francis. When I finished the book I thought, &quot;You know, I didn't learn a thing. Chesterton told me the little I already knew about Francis.&quot; Yet for some reason it took Chesterton 158 pages to tell me so little. This isn't a biography. It is GK's commentary on what he thinks about Francis in relation to modernity."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"G.K. Chesterton is one of the best Christian writers of the twentieth century. Prolific and artistic, he had the knack for combining a classic British commentary sense to any historical Christian subject, making it both the object of cultural interest and often historic reverence. As St. Francis of Assisi was one of the primary influences on Chesterton's decision to convert to Roman Catholicism (Chesterton once described his conversion as being largely due to wanting to belong to the same institution that had produced St. Francis), it makes sense that Chesterton would devote considerable energies toward this biography.Chesterton said that there are essentially three ways to approach a biography of a figure such as St. Francis - one can be dispassionately objective (or at least as much as can pass for such a stance), looking at things from a 'purely' historical standpoint; one can go to the opposite extreme and treat the figure as an object of devotion and worship; or one can take a third path (and you've guessed correctly if you assumed this was Chesterton's route) of looking at the character as an interested outsider, someone in the modern world but still one involved in the same kinds of structures and virtues as the one being studied.Chesterton's prose is snappy and lively, witty and bit sardonic at times. Chesterton is not afraid to digress to make his own points, and like the intellectual critic who cannot contain the myriad of responses to particular points, Chesterton treats us to a generous collection of tangential observations. One discovers, for instance, Chesterton's opinion of modern British history (that it reads more like journalism than like a developed narrative) - he makes the observation that journalists rarely think to publish a 'life' until the death of the subject; this of course cannot be helped in the case of Francis of Assisi, but the method of the media serves to highlight the difference in world-view between then and now.This is a spiritual biography - it does not simply go from event to event in Francis' life, but rather looks as the development of his spirituality, his calling, his order and his influence in later church (and more general) history. In his discussion, he looks at miracles and poetic production, political realities and logical fallacies, ancient sentiments and present-day practices. Francis is seen in many ways as the Mirror of Christ (not quite the same thing as the WWJD fad of the current day, but approximating the sense in some regards), but this sets up an interesting logical situation - if Francis is like Christ, then Christ is in some ways like Francis. Chesterton points out the importance of the difference, likening it to the difference between creator and creature, but there is still the interesting development in history where some tried to make Francis a second Christ (something Francis himself would have opposed bitterly).Fun, fascinating, spiritual without succumbing to kitsch, intellectual without being overblown, this book is a classic on Francis, and a classic by Chesterton, a small miracle of Francis (in the many sense of the term)."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"The first time I read this book, I felt almost as impatient with Chesterton's &quot;verbosity&quot; and &quot;hot air&quot; as some of the reviewers below. In regard to the bare facts of Francis' life, one comes to feel a bit as Chesterton said of the Troubadours' lovers: &quot;The reader realises that the lady is the most beautiful being that can possibly exist, only he has occasional doubts as to whether she does exist.&quot; Moments came when I found myself thirsting for dry facts. But I think the problem is that Chesterton assumes his readers, as educated persons of his period, know the story already, and only need to be enlightened as to its meaning. One can get facts anywhere. Few can take us inside the thinking of a man like Francis. And absolutely no one I know writes with such entertaining flair, of a healing kind so different from modern books and movies that wound our souls with their pleasures.On second reading, I find I enjoyed this episode about as much as the biography of Dickens -- which was very much. Chesterton looks at Francis, in varying cadences, from the inside, to help us think and feel as he did, then from the outside, as children of the Enlightenment, a two-perspective approach that gives us a rounded figure. Those of us who have no other knowledge of Francis may sometimes wonder how much of that figure is Francis and how much Chesterton, (who was, after all, probably the more rounded of the two). But the insights are always brilliant. And many still cut like daggers. (Or rather scalpels, to heal.) &quot;We read that Admiral Bangs has been shot, which is the first intimation we have that he has ever been born.&quot; &quot;The moment sex ceases to be a servant it becomes a tyrant.&quot; &quot;All goods look better when they look like gifts.&quot; &quot;There is only one intelligent reason why a man does not believe in miracles and that is that he does believe in materialism.&quot; Anyone who finds such digressions merely &quot;hot air,&quot; would be best advised to keep to dry-as-dust historical commentaries, or skeptical comic books, as the case may be.This book is not so much a biography of a single man, as an episode in Chesterton's ongoing spiritual biography of mankind. It is one in a series of what Solzhenitsyn called &quot;knots&quot; and Thomas Cahill calls &quot;hinges&quot; of history. The series continues with Chesterton's equally subjective but enlightening biographies of Chaucer, Dickens, Joan of Arc, and modern &quot;Heretics.&quot; He gives the outline of the project in the Everlasting Man, which is one of the most brilliant and wisest books of the century.As a non-Catholic Christian (&quot;Protestant&quot; would place the emphasis in the wrong place), I don't agree with Chesterton's take on the Albigensian Wars, and am more ambivalent about the Crusades than he. But he does not exactly justify the Inquisition, as the reader below implies; he admits that in later stages it was a &quot;horrible thing that might be haunted by demons.&quot; How many modern leftists admitted that much about, say, the Russian Revolution? But I agree he may try to &quot;understand&quot; the sins committed by his side a little too hard.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man (July 2000)d.marshall@sun.ac.jp"},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"G.K. Chesterton's &quot;St. Francis of Assisi&quot; is not your conventional timeline of the events in a man's life. Instead, Chesterton focuses on Francis' relationship with God and his historical context, background and impact. I first read this book a year ago and have just read it again - it's one of those books that are so rich that you discover something new each time you pick it up. If you've ever read &quot;The Little Flowers of St. Francis&quot; (about the events in Francis' life), this is the book to read next. It is a great aid to understanding Francis as a person and not just as &quot;the bird bath saint&quot;. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"Chesterton's book on St. Francis of Assisi was &quot;avowedly only an introduction to St. Francis or the study of St. Francis. Those who need an introduction are in their nature strangers. With them the object is to get them to listen to St. Francis at all ... .&quot; [Chpt. 9] But Chesterton, in 1924, expected an audience familiar with a variety of subjects--the Investiture Controversy, the Adamite Heresy, The Provencal Moment, for example--unfamiliar to most of us today. I think, therefore, that &quot;St. Francis of Assisi&quot; can no longer serve as a general introduction for the general reader.If you are only interested in a chronological outline of St. Francis' life, this book is probably not yet for you.Nonetheless, you would be remiss if you pass on this book because it is a wonderful work of art.Intellectually &quot;St. Francis of Assisi&quot; serves mostly as a brilliant meditation on the man, his role in the Catholic Church, and his influence on the intellectual history of the West. But it best serves as an example of how one might write and write well. Nearly every sentence is a delight and nearly every page a piece of rhetorical flash and filigree.Chesterton sometimes chooses sound--especially alliteration--over sound reasoning and makes more than one straw man argument. But you need not be a Christian to appreciate the skill with which he makes his case. Sometimes it sounds so good or so funny that you simply wish it true. To whit:&quot;In short, he [the writer attempting to write a life of St. Francis] may try to tell the story of a saint without God; which is like being told to write the life of Nansen and forbidden to mention the North Pole.&quot; [Chpt. 1]&quot;To write history and hate Rome, both pagan and papal, is practically to hate everything that has happened. It comes very near to hating humanity on purely humanitarian grounds.&quot; [Chpt. 2]&quot;It was a rude and simple society and there were no laws to punish a starving man for expressing his need for food, such as have been established in a more humanitarian age; and the lack of any organized police permitted such persons to pester the wealthy without any great danger.&quot; [Chpt. 3]&quot;Shelley, when he wished to be a cloud or a leaf carried before the wind, might have been mildly suprised to find himself turning slowly head over heels in mid-air a thousand feet above the sea.&quot; [Chpt. 6]&quot;The modern mind is hard to please; and it generally calls the way of Godfrey ferocious and the way of Francis fanatical. That is, it calls any moral method unpractical, when it has just called any practical method immoral.&quot; [Chpt. 8]&quot;A man in Voltaire's time did not know what miracle he would next have to throw up. A man in our time does not know what miracle he will next have to swallow.&quot; [Chpt. 9]Whatever you think of Chesterton's broader themes, &quot;St. Francis of Assisi&quot; is a profound and insightful investigation into the psychology of the saint which would be helpful to anyone trying to figure how to think about the man. It is also wondrous writing."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"I have just finished reading \\"St. Francis of Assisi\\" by GK Chesterton, and I know that it was pretty good. In fact, it may be very good, but I don't really understand it! If you know anything about GK Chesterton then you know that his books are deeper than the ocean. This one is no exception. If you are looking for a biography (the story of St. Francis throughout his entire life) then this is not the book for you. (I would suggest buying St. Boneventure's biography from Tan Books) This book is really an essay on the life of St. Francis. It is difficult reading, and not a bed-time story for your kids. I think for your benefit, it would be good to read a normal biography on St. Francis (like the one mentioned above) and then read this essay. That way, you will not be frustrated in not getting many stories of St. Francis's life, and you will have perhaps better understandings of what GK Chesterton is talking about. Anyway, if your a Chesterton fan, then I'm sure you will like this, but remember--- this is HARD TO READ."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"G.K. Chesterton's titled ST FRANCIS OF ASSISI demonstrated once again Chesterton's charm, polite criticism, wit, and logic. Chesterton also showed that he had actual insight to St. Francis'mission and thinking. Chesterton also realized that modern misinterpretations had to be corrected to give readers a clearer understanding of a man who was complex, apparently mad, and had a passion for creation and the Creator.Chesterton began this book with a brief explanation of the political situation in Italy whereby small politics vied for power and land. St. Francis was part of this environment and began his younger days as a soldier. In one encounter, St. Francis was captured involving Assisi and another city-state in which St. Francis was captured. This was not what St. Francis expected or wanted. This event led to dispair and depression which Chesterton said changed St. Francis from an Italian citizen and soldier to a saint. Chesterton wrote that the man who emerged from such depression and dispair emerged from this experience as a far different man. Chesterton gives a good analysis of Medieval war in Italy. Men fought for their homes, loved ones, their shrines, and their rulers with whom they were much more familiar than modern mass and mindless democracy. Chesterton accurately contrasts Medieval Italian wars with modern war which is based on false media lying, government propaganda,and vague useless slogans for war in remote areas far from family and homes. Chesterton wrote that St. Francis could be a soldier and still love people. Chesterton explains this paradox by commenting that men could do so because they knew what they were fighting for and could accept an enemy as a friend as long as the fight was fair.Readers should know that St. Francis was a frair rather than a cloistered monk. Modern men do not understand the cloistered life unless they understand that pagans worshipped nature to the point that such worship became perverted and unnatural. The cloistered life was a reaction to such unreasonable nature worship. One could argue that St. Francis appreciated nature, but St. Francis worshipped whom he considered the Creator of nature. St. Francis was not a pantheist. Chesterton explained that the cloistered monks prior to the active frairs such as the Franciscans and Dominicans made invaluable contributions to Western Civilization. They hand copied books. The cloistered monks and nuns were Europe's first teachers during the so-called dark ages and saved learning. These people taught men how to effectively breed livestock and cultivate land. Chesterton stated that the cloistered monks and nuns were severely practical. They were severe with themselves and were practical and compassionate with everyone else.Another aspect of St. Francis' life was that he was a poet. Chesterton made the comment that poets write about romance and love. St. Francis' poetry was devoted to Divine Love and God. St. Francis may have influenced Medieval poets such as Dante (1265-1321) whose DIVINE COMEDY had obvious religious overtones.In spite of St. Franics poverty and asceticism, he was not a gloomy man. St. Francis was cheerful, optimistic, and free. Chesterton wrote that the Franciscans were more free than others because they took an honest vow of poverty. Anyone who is attached to his possessions could not be completly free. No one could contain St. Francis and his follwers by economic and social neccessity. Chesterton commented that he expects nothing will not be disappointed. Chesterton also commented that the Franciscans expected nothing but enjoyed everthing because they believed that creation emerged from nothing.Chesterton related a charming story of St. Francis and his followers who were poor and had nothing unceremoniously approaching great rulers and Popes for audiences without fanfare and pomp. Yet, more secular men who had wealth and power usually received St. Francis with politeness and respect. Another charming story is that of St. Francis and his followers approaching powerful Islam rulers during the Crusades. These rulers would have executed most Catholic if approached by other Catholics. Yet, the Islamic rulers showed respect to St. Francis. These rulers did not accept Catholcism, but St. Francis' kindness and manners made the Islamic rulers respect him in spite of severe religious differences. Many crusades want to kill Moslems in battle. St. Francis went to the Middle East not to kill Moslems but to create Catholics.Chesterton wrote this book to present a brief history and commentary of St. Francis and the Franciscans. Chesterton presented a more authenic of the Medieval era to give an authenic view of St. Francis and the Franciscans. Chestertoned showed what modern men in a crass materialistic world could learn from the Middle Ages which was intensely more religious as opposed to what has become of modern religion or what Bonhoffer called \\"cheap grace.\\"This reviewer believes that G.K. Chesterton admired both St. Franics and St. Thomas Aquinas. Chesterton's nonfiction work shows the logic and reason of St. Thomas Aquinas and the compassion of St. Francis. As an aside, readers should read Chesterton's book re St. Thomas Aquinas which is a good companion volume to this book."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"G.K. Chesterton is one of the most interesting people who ever lived. His prodigious output and outlandish appearance have made him an unforgettable part of Western culture. But in this book, we have the eccentric Chesterton writing about the even more astounding character of St. Francis of Assisi. Chesterton goes through several interesting sketches of St. Francis' life (which are interesting by themselves) and then draws all sorts of fantastic conclusions from the episodes. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is curious about Chesterton's writing and Francis' life."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"Without exaggeration, this book changed my life completely.St. Francis is by far one of the most important and influential men inthe history of the world, aside from St. Paul and Jesus Christ, himself. Francis' life--like the lives of all the Saints and great Christians--is a testament to the message of Christ. He lived \\"in the world, but not of the world.\\" He made \\"the world a means and heaven the end.\\" Francis denied the power of the material world over God's gift of spirituality, for who can hurt a man who rejoices in the pain--which he uses as his vehicle to reach eternal life--caused by the world? Who can starve a man who is constantly fasting? What can anyone take away from a man who's way of life is poverty? Without possessions and employment, no one could hold anything over him to persuade him to change his life. Francis had one master, and that was the Lord, Christ Jesus.Though Saint Francis would not let the world rule over him, he was not blind to the beauty in it. He saw everything as a great and divine painting, with God as the master painter. The world is simply the canvas, and all of God's creations make up the picture. In a way, time is the paintbrush... But, enough about that! Back to Francis!Francis refused to overlook Jesus' commands to seek God with all one's heart and life, and to leave the material world behind and deny the self to seek that goal. However, Francis was no mastermind who read every book and asked everyone for their opinions before he could give himself fully to God--that is not Francis, and he would never have become the Saint he is, had he been so stubborn. Like C.S. Lewis, he prayed, not because he made a conscious choice to pray, but because he could not help himself. God tends to work that way in our lives.My name is Michael Shirk, and I am a 17 year old high school student in Washington State. I owe much to G.K. Chesterton for his book. It taught me not only the ideals of a great man in our human history, but a deeper way to look at the message of our Lord, Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"Chesterton does not attempt mere biography here. This is not some skeletal and bland litany of names, dates, and events able only to provide the meagerest comprehension the rich charater of St. Francis. In point of fact, the author makes mention of only those relatively few events salient to the developing the personhood of St. Francis. Though it is short, to the extent that Chesterton reveals for us the character of the founder of the Three Orders, he achieves his goal nicely. The author provides wonderful insights into both the mind and the times that shaped the worldview of Francis Bernardone. Beautifully written, respectful, and dynamic, this is a truly wonderful work and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying to develop a balanced understanding of the man who is St. Francis of Assissi."},{"Title":"St. Francis of Assisi","review":"Don't be put off by the reviewers who complain this book has too much Chesterton and not enough Francis.

As a biographer, though, he is inadequate. True, Chesterton is not writing a traditional biography; he is writing an extended essay, full of meditative insights on a prominent Christian saint. However, a good biography should combine both facts and insights, with the latter deriving from the first. Chesterton's insights come mostly from himself; consequentially, this book tells us much more about its author than its subject.This book has some value because it gives us a peek inside Chesterton's head.

The author's verbosity gets down right annoying from the very start. He does, however, make one interesting point about Francis: he says that the Saint praises God much in the fashion of the troubadours of the day. Francis's love for God, suggests Chesterton, is almost like the intense feeling one has for one's beloved.

He manages to wrap it all up beautifuly, and has a very sensitive/sensible perspective way of seeing things. The book is written in small chapters and each of them flash with ideas and afterthoughts smart enough to carry you away and make you want to applaud. The end is so breathtaking. The point of all this? Well, one for sure is the mixture of the journalist's vision of details and analysis and the way Ren&eacute; Barjavel picks up the scientific facts and compares them to something you have always noticed before but never thought of really. He talks about God in a dramatic way. In fact this book was offered to me for the first time by a friend who promised me that you HAVE to believe in God after reading &quot;La Faim du Tigre&quot;. So far I have read it over ten times, and it is one of my favorite gifts, for the people I really care for. But do not think that this book will leave you neutral...it will change your vision of the world with you in it...and not with supposions....with real facts. Telling people that a book is good is a subjective manner. I just hope that someday that you will have the chance to read &quot;La Faim du Tigre&quot;."},{"Title":"Fellow Passengers: A Novel in Portraits","review":"Writer Auchincloss usually writes tedious family-history novels but here he writes a book wherein each chapter is about a separate unconnected character. The result is insightful, different, and fascinating. I held back one star in my rating because I just don't care for books about the well-to-do; they seem (as this one sometimes does) pretentious and self-congratulatory. But the characters here are fully realized and will hold your interest. The book has the added advantage of each character having said just enough about him/her, so that you do not get tired of the personality. If you're looking for something a bit different, that you can pick up and put down, this is a good read."},{"Title":"Fellow Passengers: A Novel in Portraits","review":"Many stories have predictable plot points that are rehashed with new characters and settings. However, this book exemplifies Auchincloss's ability to tell a story without falling into the trap of one of these expected archetypes. Each chapter in the book corresponds to one person in the narrator's life, including family members, co-workers, school buddies, and family friends. Each character sketch is thoughtfully presented with delightful details. Although these portraits are totally unrelated in that each does not refer back to details in the previous chapters, they come together coherently to tell the story of the narrator, who not only ages with each chapter but also matures in his opinions about each character. The language flows easily, neither being too fast paced, nor too dry. A great read."},{"Title":"Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain","review":"To what pressure did Asimov bow in writing this book other than his own? And, incidentally, this is no sequel to the first Fantastic Voyage. There is no mention of anything from the first novel here. Asimov's first Fantastic Voyage was not his own: he merely novelized a movie, and was never satisfied with the end result for all of its scientific and otherwise flaws. II is a much better example of Asimovian sicence fiction: totally cerebral, and I like that at the end of the plot, there was no &quot;getting the girl,&quot; as one sees all to often, even in Asimov's novels. The victory here involved no sexual liason of any sort-- it was merely that of a scientist having his views validated by grueling experience. There is too strong a tendency in many novels, especially in science fiction novels, to present the attaining of a woman's affections as the &quot;prize&quot; toward which the male hero works and eventually succeeds in getting. Here there is the setup of that, but in the end no actualization. Asimov presents enough scientific notions throughout this book to spin any reader's head, and more than one is are presented a little too didactically. But Asimov could not help it. In the end he was the disseminator of scientific knowledge that earned him the distinction &quot;Great Explainer.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain","review":"As the previous reviewer points out, the first Fantastic Voyage was not Asimov's story, but merely his novelization of the movie plot. So Asimov decided to write his own story on the same theme.

He often bragged about the huge volume of output from his typewriter. The problem is that quantity does not equal quality, and much of his writing wasn't worth much. This book falls into that category."},{"Title":"Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain","review":"As the previous reviewer points out, the first Fantastic Voyage was not Asimov's story, but merely his novelization of the movie plot.

One is caught up in wave after wave of freebooter, noblemen, kinights and peasants that took up the challenge of the Bishop of Rome and pledged all to cleanse the Holy land of the unbeliever. When Baldwin finally takes the City of Jerusalem and storms the Temple Mount, one is left with a feeling of exaltation seldom felt in modern literature. He is equally gripping in his accouting of the excesses of the Knights Templer and others, against which Sahla Haddin (Saladin) rose up in righteouss indignation. Saladin drove the invaders who had come from Europe from the Lands of the Prophet, and cleansed the &quot;land&quot; from the infidel. Altogether one of the most memorable books on that period of history that I have read. His descriptions of ancient warfare are, factual, captivating and superb. He gets to the underlying motives on both sides. Why the Crusades were successful for a time, and why they were doomed to ultimate failure. He also shows why there is such undying animosity between the followers of the Prophet and the followers of the Nazarene."},{"Title":"the crusades the flame of Islam","review":"Lamb has always been a scholar quite interested in the East, its inhabitants become real living people, our peers, and then he draws the characters, situations, and forces that build up a completely new, unseen, unheard of, historical movement. The deplacement of Europe to &quot;regain&quot; the Holy Land has been reviewed and studied, for the last l00 years as a phenomenon of real Christian faith, and from the point of view of the European cultures: France, England, Austria, Italy, etc. But, what about the point of view of the so-called infidels? Lamb has the skill to keep himself neutral, nevertheless he gives us the facts and gives the reader the golden opportunity: the possibility to make its own judgement, based in, more or less, non-fictional facts. And that's Lamb's greatest achivement. He novelizes a subject, but finally it is only a very valid literary resource to lead us to the precise point of human History where the author wants us; and at the same time, Lamb makes Aquinas &quot;tolle, lege&quot;, his own. So, after reading &quot;The Crusades&quot;, and paying careful attention to the subtitle: &quot;The flame of Islam&quot;, we understand that greed, false piousness, false pride, ignorance; the arrogance of the self-conceited christian warriors, lustful, bored -perhaps with a tint of real faith-, made the Europeans cross the seas and barren lands to get to Jerusalem, the three-times blessed City. But, from the pages of Lamb we may be able to point out that failure of the enterprise was due, from the 1st Crusade, to jealousy, envy, and the search of personal success.It was not their main goal to recover The Holy Land. If it had been true, they would have succeeded. Lamb has his personal favorite hero: Saladin, the most chivalrous of enemies, a very intelligent and skillful men, with a good warfare knowledge, quite learned and, by far, the most important Islam's defender of the Faith. The brilliancy of the exposition of Lamb, his excellent use of terms, and his profound knowledge of the ! East provide the ambience. His academic background provides real historical facts, and, ...you have in your hands a must-be-read book!"},{"Title":"the crusades the flame of Islam","review":"I truly like this Author. I rate this book as one of my best. Lamb's books are all factual as he visited each area he writes about. Often being allowed into temples forbidden by others. The Crusades is a fast moving novel that underlines the different movements of Europe and Asia fighting. Showing the heroes and villians from both sides. One of my favorite section is when Richard the lionhearted and 300 knights rush to save a castle, that was being attacked. These mobile tanks waded ashore and were immediately were attacked by Salidin. The knights were able to swing 5 ft swords which wrecked havoc on the enemy. At one point, the horse Richard was riding went down. The fighting was stopped so that another horse could be given to him by the enemy, as a show of respect for his fighting prowess. This book is well worth the read. Harold Lamb wrote in the 20's to 50's so his books are hard to find. They are worth the search. In fact he inspired alot a writes including Robert E.

Harold Lamb quoted contemporary Muslim and Christian accounts of numerous events of the crusades. Most of these were utter lies and propaganda, such as, \\"We slew 500 of the infidels for the greater glory of Allah\\" and, \\"We slew 500 infidels for the greater glory of God\\", and then folded them into a meaningful and coherent whole (\\"As near as we could see, the Muslims slew 130 Christians and the Christians slew 200 Muslims\\" (I'm paraphrasing here)).At this time, (I'm writing this January, 2002) when we now find ourselves fighting battles for many of the same reasons as during the original crusades of over a thousand years ago, his writings are even more essential than they have been in the past.I have not read this book for many years, only recently getting my hands onto a copy. Maybe the book will not have nearly the effect now that it had on me so many years ago, but I'm excited for having the opportunity to read it.

The characters were products of what they experienced but they seemed to be predictable in behavior. There were several parts that in my opinion were slow moving or tedious.It was still a good story which shows the power of love and it how it helps to heal wounds. I just think it could have been a bit better."},{"Title":"Knight Triumphant","review":"This is the 4th in the series of Drake's (aka Heather Graham's) Graham clan saga based in Scotland (the list: Come The Morning, Conquer the Night, Seize the Dawn, Knight Triumphant, The Lion in Glory, When We Touch and The Queen's Lady). This one, set in the early 14th century, tells the continuing story of Eric Graham who we met in Seize the Dawn when he was by the side of Brendan Graham. Eric is now an outlaw, a follower of Robert Bruce who has been named king of Scotland but who still battles Edward, king of England, for the right to rule. While he is recruiting more men to follow the Bruce, Eric takes aboard his ship an injured man who has the plague and unknowingly brings death to his people, including his young daughter and beloved wife, Margot. who die along with other Scots while prisoners at Langley, the estate in the Scottish borderlands ruled by English lord Afton. Afton, a good man, has also succumbed to the plague brought to him with the Scottish prisoners. His widow, the beautiful dark haired, violet-eyed Lady Igrainia, has used her healing powers to help those who can recover, both Scottish prisoners and English. When Eric comes to Langley for his wife and daughter and those of his men among the prisoners, Eric seizes the castle but then falls prey to the disease. He is nursed to health by Igrainia. He intends to allow Robert Bruce to use Igrainia as a bargaining chip to free Bruce's women held by king Edward, since she is the daughter and sister of an earl. But Edward will not bargain and so Robert the Bruce tells Eric to wed Igrainia to irritate Edward and claim her lands. Eric is brutal with her and forces her to wed him. Then, following another order of the Bruce, he sleeps with her to create a child that will validate the marriage-all for the glory of Scotland. Eric doesn't want her as he is still mourning Margot and his daughter but he does find himself attracted to her beauty and Igrainia is seduced by him. Nevertheless it is clear that Igrainia was used by him, for which she despises him at times, and both English and Scottish leaders see her as their pawn. Igrainia is a strong-willed, creative and courageous woman who loved her husband, a kind gentle lord, a man of books and letters, but she can see that Eric has an honorable nature in contrast to the English leaders who would use her. Eric is a man whose soul has been deeply wounded and whether he can care for another woman is the big question. Graham does an excellent job of bringing out the emotions surrounding all this. I liked this book in the series very much. It was more complex that some of those I've read thus far (see my other reviews of the earlier books in the series), and the history was woven in very well. Her character development is excellent and the love scenes are \\"real.\\" A well told tale by Graham in this Scottish historical romance series."},{"Title":"Knight Triumphant","review":"Loved this book.

I would not have liked this novel if Eric would have been lusting after the heroine from the beginning totally showing no respect to Margot's memory. This did not happen.

This is a realistic, restrained yet still quite romantic story. Waiting for 2/3 of the story for the two lovers to come together was a bit of a trial but worth the wait. I am glad I did not get to know Margot and Eric in the previous novel in the series, since I believe romances, being the realm of fantasy, should stick to one shot deals in love matches (the ones portrayed, anyway). Yet knowing his previous relationship helped me to understand why it takes this knight so long to respond to Igrainia. Each is an interesting character in his and her own right, but he is particularly engrossing, with deep loyalties that are attractive yet still exciting! I wish Drake had put us inside his brain to build up the romantic tension while we wait for the delayed get together--so we can see the \\"he thought/she thought\\" along with \\"he said/she said\\" that is shown. His mind was worth probing. I wanted more!"},{"Title":"Knight Triumphant","review":"I really wish that this book had been better, but it just isn't a &quot;keeper&quot; for me.

These parts are, of course, included in the stories for readers whom have not read the first books in the series. In \\"Knight Triumphant,\\" these parts are short and easy to skip over. Also, the author has veered from the type of couple that she used in the first three books (a Scottish knight, and an English heiress) to make this story unique.Knight Triumphant:The war between Scotland and England has been a bloody battle for well over a decade. After years of fighting for their freedom, Scotland is at last feeling the triumph of winning back their country. King Edward I of England is old and his health is failing. Scotland has finally crowned their own king, Robert Bruce, and has united to fight as one people. In their new power, Scotland brings down many castles that have been taken over by the English. The one castle that they will not touch is \\"Castle Langley.\\" It has been infected with a plague that has killed nearly everyone within it's walls. The English inhabitants blame the Scots who contracted the plague while at sea, then infected much of Scotland.Eric Graham is desperate to get to his beloved wife, Margot, and their little girl, Aileen. They have been held prisoner in Castle Langley. Both have been stricken by the plague. The lady of Langley, Igrainia, is known to have knowledge of herbs for healing. Her people have cast her out of the castle, in fear that she may also become ill while nursing the countless victims. Eric finds her en-route to a safer territory. He seizes her and demands that she give him passage into Langley, as well as heal his wife and child. Igrainia has already lost her own husband to the plague, and knows that there is little she can do.Upon entering Castle Langley, Eric and his men find that there are very few people left alive and well enough to guard it. He instantly claims the castle in the name of his king, Robert Bruce. He puts his wife in the master's chamber where he insists that Igrainia will save her. Eric sits at Margot's side as he prays for her life. While doing so, he also becomes infected. Now he is fighting for his own life. In his half- conscious state, he realizes that his wife has left this world. He is utterly devastated.Igrainia knows how it feels to lose someone so dear. After losing her own husband, her compassion fuels her attempts to save Eric. She works tirelessly to see him through the plague that has taken hold of his body. Many people of Langley suggest that she should let the enemy invader die. But fear of retaliation by his men, and her own sense of honor, demand that she try to save him. When he revives, he is determined to find revenge against the people who took his wife prisoner. His greatest enemy is the man who imprisoned Margot, and is now trying to capture and marry Igrainia, Robert Neville. Neville wants all of the wealth that Igrainia has been left after her husband's death. He'll murder anyone who stands in his way.Eric is angry and racked with grief. He is also afflicted with unbearable guilt as he finds himself growing to care for Igrainia. He learns that Igrainia is suffering the very same devastation. In their months together defending Langley, they progress from blaming one another for their lost loves, to giving one another a reason to hope for the future.While reading \\"Knight Triumphant,\\" you'll come to adore Eric's cousin Jamie. You'll look forward to reading his story in the 5th book, \\"The Lion in Glory.\\""},{"Title":"Knight Triumphant","review":"I started not to read this b/c it didn't sound very appealing to me, but I am so glad that I did b/c I would've missed out on one of the sweetest romance stories out there. I am also very selective about romance novels, but adoring medieval novels like I do I read it. I have NEVER cried while reading a romance novel, but I had tears running down my face reading this one. I really can't understand the negative reviews for this book. This book is so well written. Shannon Drake writes like she lived in that time period. It wasn't repetitive in any way, and they didn't keep throwing things up in each other's faces. The only thing I can see that might be negative to some is the slow paced beginning. But after about page 100 it sped up and never slowed down. It was so worth the wait. The book is so good, that I wasn't even bothered that there wasn't a love scene until 2/3 into the book. I loved Eric's character. He is so strong. Igrania is great as well. This is one of the most realistic medieval romances I've ever read. I was so sad when I was finished reading it. I hope Drakes's other romance novels are this good.

I have read hundreds of the aforementioned books. Drake certainly does something extra special with this book, as I was hard-pressed to put it down...even lost several nights of sleep. That's saying a lot since I have been known to throw cheesy non-realistic historical romance books out the window!There was something about Eric's character that made him feel so alive to me. Usually I am fully aware that I am reading characters in a book, yet with \\"Eric\\", I could see his handsome and strong norse face too clearly. Hear the actual tone to his voice, feel his courage, his fear, his pain, his determination to overcome and live life, and his appreciation in whatever happiness those choices bring to him...which in this case was the gift of Igrainia.It is a unique and unusual read. For those of you who like tons of romance in each chapter you may well be disappointed. Yet, romance does exist in acceptable doses. Those of you like myself who have read epic novels ...who also adore romance books, but can respect when the author deviates to work extra hard for hard-core realism and character developement (the kind that loops you into the book and the time-era in which it is set) - - will be thrilled by the depth of thought Drake puts into this one.I do agree that Drake needs to brain-storm up some different basic outlines for her historical adventures, as they can be repetitive, and thus predictable. Which is never appreciated by any avid reader. Still, I can't do less than recommend this book as an engrossing and satisfying read."},{"Title":"Knight Triumphant","review":"I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.

I can't give it a 4 or 5 but due to the level of structuring Ms. Graham created, i can't give it less than a 3. Usually, her books are wonderfully paced, but at the halfway point, her characters have only had one scene where they *might* have felt something other than anger and loathing for each other.You always know when the heroine is going to throw up her beloved, but dead, husband Afton and when the hero is going to bring up his dead wife. I like the characters when they are by themselves, but I do not like them together, all that much. They are both entirely too stubborn and clash too often. They feel so much animosity towards each other at even the half way point, I don't feel like the story is going to improve much."},{"Title":"Knight Triumphant","review":"In 1307, when ailing King Edward I sends troops to end Bruce's campaign for Scottish freedom, Scots take over the Borders' Castle Langley after defeating the depleted English forces that are struggling with the plague. Scottish leader Eric Graham learns that his child is dead from the plague and his wife is near death. He blames Lord Afton for their plight feeling the inhuman treatment of the Scottish prisoners caused their deaths, but the English aristocrat has also died from the plague. Afton's widow Lady Igrainia tries to heal the sick, but Eric treats her with scorn and warns her that if his wife dies she dies too. Eric becomes ill and Igrainia heals him, but his wife dies.Eric informs Igrainia that King Bruce has ordered him to marry her because Edward plans to wed her to Afton's cousin Robert Neville. Igrainia says no, but Eric forces her to marry him anyway. Eric admits that Igrainia tries to help Scot and English alike and begins to fall in with her. She reciprocates after observing how much Eric cares for everyone, but she wonders if his gilded cage is any better than the one Robert would lock her inside.KNIGHTS TRIUMPHANT, the fourth Graham Family novel, is a well-crafted medieval romance that displays the impact of the Kings on the lives of nobles. Though the squabble between the lead characters feels overdone, the cast provides a deep look at the point when Edward I is nearing death.

If you get a chance, I highly recommend reading this entire series. You won't be disappointed, a little tired from staying up late because you can't put the books down, but never disappointed."},{"Title":"Knight Triumphant","review":"Knight Triumphant gives the reader a story set in Scotland during the ascension of Robert the Bruce that rings true, with lots of satisfying detail. The turmoil, politics and mixed loyalties fo the time make for a solid background to the story of the Hero and Heroine. Unfortunately, although the antagonistic characters eventually come together, the process is not justified. We are not shown the chemistry between them, and indeed, there may not be any. Both are brave and admirable, but nothing of the process of their falling in love by the end of the book is mentioned. As a result, when it all came about in the end, I wasn't convinced.The Author gave the Heroine an inordinate fondness for water; she demands a bath once a day, loves to get her feet wet and plunges into every stream she can manage to find. It became unintentionally humorous for me by the end, as if she was turning into a sponge, or some kind of frustrated mermaid. In a time when she was supposed to be a distressed captive, it made her seem self-indulgent. Indeed, this Heroine, for all of her constant, desperate attempts at escape, is certainly not motivated by suffering. The Hero and his cohorts seldom subject her to any worse abuse than locking the door to whatever room or cell she happens to be put in, and she's often put there because she herself insists on it, chafing at the reality that she's a \\"prisoner\\" of politics. She's often her own worst enemy, physically throwing herself forward into danger and conflict again and again without reason or thought, until she reminds the reader of a mindless moth, battering itself against a lightbulb.All in all, this is a satisfying read, but the characters could have benefitted from a more carefully constructed relationship."},{"Title":"Clearings in the Forest: Methods for Studying Leadership","review":"Clearings In The Forest: On The Study Of Leadership by Nathan Harter (Associate Professor of Organizational Leadership, Purdue University) employs the metaphor of a forest to discuss the philosophical aspects of analysis and synthesis with respect to the meaning and practice of leadership in human activity.

Can anybody tell when the next edition will be coming out?"},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"The title for this review of Ralph Kimball's book is chosen with set purpose in mind. Within the past several days, I've completed reading both Kimball's data warehousing tome, here reviewed, and that of Bill Inmon. Now, ostensibly there rages a debate within the corporate data warehousing community between the disciples of Kimball's and Inmon's competing approaches. For this reason, it was interesting and enlightening to read both books in short succession. It is also important to note that my assessment of the debate is influenced by over twenty-five years worth of experience in the discplines of logical data modeling and relational database design. And this is the reason for the selection of my review title, mentioned above. I employ a term from the relational world to draw attention to the fact that, when we are talking about databases today, we still must reasonably do so from a relational perspective. And it is this important perspective that is so evidently absent from Kimball's approach.Kimball's concept is founded on the notion of a \\"dimensional model\\" for database. Quite interestingly, Kimball pleads ignorance relative to the question of the actual origins of this dimensional approach. With this, I can be of assistance. In the early days of the Decision Support Software industry, there was a product known as Express. I believe the vendor was Management Decision Sciences, Inc., or something like that. This product competed, at one level, with IFPS, the Integrated Financial Planning System(IFPS), which was sort of like fancy Fortran, and at another level with the then emerging world of relational database software. I still remember meetings from back in the early 80's when proponents of Express would argue passionately that data ought to be organized in \\"cubes\\", the forerunner, and predecessor, Ralph, of dimensions. Now, when you pinned the technical folks advocating such an approach down, they would finally admit that what they were talking about was really nothing more than a fancy array processor. That's what it was. And that is the essence of this whole \\"dimensional model\\" concept.It is interesting to compare and to contrast the approaches taken by Inmon and Kimball in their respective books on Data Warehousing. Inmon acknowledges that there is a debate extant. He also respectfully cites Kimball's contributions to the debate within the corpus of his text. Kimball is silent on the identity of his rival. And this silence really speaks volumes. He, Kimball, that is, is also strangely silent on even the efficacy of a relational design of any warehouse data structure, finally allowing that you may allow such a thing in a \\"staging area\\". But you mustn't let your users know about it. This is the strangest sort of censorship of important corporate data I've ever encountered. Consider the following: Suppose we work for an organization with say, seven million customers. Should we not, in this instance, have a relational database table somewhere that has seven million rows, one row representing each customer? And should not this table be readily available to our user community? These questions are intended to be rhetorical. However, on reading Kimball's book, we judge that he, and his followers, would strongly resist such a common sense line of reasoning.Kimball's book is noteworthy in so far as he does present many interesting, and potentially useful, designs. However, his mute avoidance of the essence of the ongoing debate says all we really need to know about his outreach. Were the good Dr. Codd, inventor of the Relational Model for Database, alive today, it seems clear that he would give Ralph Kimball a good scolding, and direct him to stick to end user analysis, leaving actual issues of database design to more fully arrived professionals."},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"The mandatory bible for any datawarehouse developer.

Why should I be forced to add comments.Amazon - home of the 85% awesome consumer experience!"},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"The book's complete title is \\"Data warehouse toolkit: the complete guide to dimensional modeling\\". What is dimensional modeling? Chapter 1, \\"Dimensional modeling primer\\", will surely explain. Page 1 - nothing, page 2 - nothing... page 8 - nothing, page 9 - \\"By default, normalized databases are excluded from the presentation area, which should be strictly dimensionally structured\\". What is \\"dimensionally structured\\" though? Have I missed the definition? Leafing back... no, Kimball is just using a concept before he defined it, moving on... Page 10: \\"Dimensional modeling is a new name for an old technique for making databases simple and understandable\\". Great, what is it then? Page 11 - \\"Dimensional modeling is quite different from third-normal-form (3NF) modeling\\". Yees? Page 12 - nothing, page 13 - \\"If the presentation area is based on a relational database, then these dimensionally modeled tables are referred to as star schemas\\". Finally! Now, this sort-of-definition would not help someone who did not know about star schema, but thankfully I do, and anyway, this is the closest thing to a definition that you get - although things start to get clearer on page 16, where fact tables and dimension tables are introduced. The essence of dimensional modeling, it seems, is \\"Star is good; snowflake is bad\\".A couple of pages later, on page 18, I see this passage. \\"The fact table itself generally has its own primary key made up of a subset of the foreign keys. This key is often called a composite or concatenated key. Every fact table in a dimensional model has a composite key, and conversely, every table that has a composite key is a fact table. Another way to say this is that in a dimensional model, every table that expresses a many-to-many relationship must be a fact table\\". I am confused, for three reasons. A fact table's primary key is \\"generally\\" made up of a subset of foreign keys? This is not the case with Kimball's own first fact table on page 36 - \\"POS Transaction Number\\" definitely should be part of a primary key (he does not define one, so I assume), but it does not foreign-key into anything. Oh, and Sentence 3 means it's \\"always\\", not \\"generally\\", if we follow the \\"conversely\\" path. Is the \\"another way to say this\\" part true? ... And overall, isn't this all just a confused way to say that fact tables have foreign keys and dimension tables don't? \\"Stars, no snowflakes\\". (What's wrong with snowflakes, apart from the increased design complexity? Among the reasons listed on page 60 - views are never mentioned - the technical and the scariest one is \\"snowflaking defeats the use of bitmap indexes\\").The two examples above are representative of the book's style, and I am quite sure that it could use a lot more editing. I wish that somebody did a better job, but don't know a reasonable substitute. (Yes, I have seen Inmon's book - not a fan). Nonetheless, it's an impressive, concrete book that will give you a lot of practical ideas, and, when it suggests something that looks suboptimal or incomplete or self-contradictory, will make you think about schema design. Not a sufficient reference on the subject, but a very necessary one."},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"I had the fact and dimensions tables backwords.

By the end of it, I had enough understanding to design and build a data warehouse that works for our international company. It has been a long process, and it is not finished, but the fundamental design is based on the things discussed in the book.

What I like especially about this book:- The business/industry based approach which leads quite naturally to different concepts per business (as the CRM outriggers due to the very large customer dimension). Nevertheless, as the authors point out, these concepts may also be valid in other businesses/industries. It is only a best practise example. I like very much this open connection between businesses and concepts, this is exactly how our world is like. I had so many deja-vus reading the book, now able to sort-in issues and concepts I encountered at my customers.- It is EXCELLENTLY written, a real pleasure to read which I could not really stop since the beginning - like a good piece of fiction."},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"There are at least 3 excellent books from the Kimball Group in their data warehouse toolkit series. This one, \\"The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling\\", is extremely interesting and useful, especially because the various concepts are presented in the context of a widely varied series of specific business requirements being addressed by a data warehouse. The reader not only gains insights into dimensional modeling details, but has a great opportunity to learn and compare the different requirements and issues that relate to applications for retail sales, inventory, procurement, order management, CRM, accounting, HRM, financial services, telecommunications/utilities, transportation, education, health care, electronic commerce, and insurance. So the authors give us much more than a technical guide, and they provide the reader with meaningful, practical insights into multiple business application domains. One gets the impression that the examples in the text have been adapted from actual real-world projects, and the depth and breadth of those examples are the fundamental strength of this book, which is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"There are many aspects to setting up a data warehouse and I have not found a book which adequately covers enough of the bases to think that it gives enough information that I might actually be able to build a data warehouse from scratch. This book covers the fairly narrow domain of how should I setup the database schema for my data warehouse. So, if you're question is - how do I start setting up a database for my data warehouse, this is the book for you.The book is unique in that it presents several case studies of how data warehouses could be setup. In some ways, these examples are so simplistic, that it hardly seems necessary to put them down. But along with each example, a different aspect of the data warehouse is explored and this is how the author has chosen to organize these topics in this book.What appeared to be lacking was relating the new data warehouse schema to what you might already have in your production environment. If the examples were enhanced to show what the original production database schema looks like, that might give not only a better idea of how to create the schema, but how to translate it and the problems associated with that.So much of data warehouse design is inter-related so the concentration on dimensional modeling is limiting and no generic book can ever describe the situation you are facing in real life. You might begin to suspect that the reason why data warehouse projects are so complicated and fail is because of books like this which specify a specific and non-intuitive method for constructing database. The methods described in this book are certainly not intuitive. In my experience, things like creating tables to represent dates and abandoning the natural pkeys in your prodcution schema (as is recommended by this book) tend to make things more complex and difficult to understand as a developer. So beware of implementing things from ths book that don't make sense to you, because they probably don't."},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"Ralph got it right with this book: focus on the model and the system will perform.

When the authors demanded my full attention by advising in the Intro section that the book has to be read from beginning to end in a sequence, I was initially put off. But then once I got going, it was un-put-downable. I have another take on this book - if you are a data practitioner with formal technical training (aka database/programmer geek) and are contemplating an MBA or training on management skills, this book is your place to start. I understood the importance of an Invoice here faster than I have ever understood from a management tome or even an Idiot's Guide - if you are relatively smart, you can map the concept of \\"invoice\\" to other application domains/scenarios. You get a holistic view of how data is organized and how it is consumed - vertical industry wise, and importantly, how it is to be organized for easy consumption. I'd have been happier if the fact and dimension schemas were even more fully laid out - but then, that is asking for too much. That is what Kimball Institute is for! The authors viewpoints on dimensional modeling vis-a-vis ER modeling may appear dogmatic for folks coming from OLTP land - those of us who carry badge of honors for understanding 1-4 Normal Forms. But advances in computing seem to justify their exhortations for denormalized data representations, and further, they back up their dogma - if you will - with examples that clearly show the superiority of dimensional modeling for publishing data.

Why data warehouses are needed to help businesses make better decisions - why the OLTP systems that run the business can't do this - and sometimes even why businesses ought to invest in data warehouses. These books were terrifically useful to us years ago, when we needed help (and scholarly footnotes) in our data warehouse project proposals. This book is not one of those - it is all about:HowHow to actually design and build a repository that will deliver real value to real people. In this reviewer's opinion, Ralph Kimball's many contributions related to the 'how' of data warehousing stand alone.An engineer wishing to jump-start his or her data warehouse education would need to read Ralph's Data Warehouse Toolkit first edition, his Data Webhouse Toolkit... a bunch of \\"Data Warehouse Designer\\" Intelligence Enterprise magazine articles... AND lurk on the Data Warehousing List Server...for a few years (all terrific resources - by the way) - in order to stockpile the knowledge that is crisply presented here.No shortcuts taken by the authors that I can spot: all of the toughest dimensional design issues that I've tripped on - and that I can remember surfacing on in discussion groups over the past few years - are addressed in this significantly updated text. Not all of the solutions are 'pretty' - but it is clear that they thoughtfully address the problem. This approach, in my opinion, instills student confidence - and lets us know that we are getting sound instruction - not dogma.The authors have been listening to and addressing the data warehouse community's 'pain' through periodicals and posts for years - but this book pulls these point solutions together very nicely. I learned a surprising number of really useful new techniques, and was genuinely enlightened by the 'Present Imperatives and Future Outlook' section.As in the first edition, there is minimal philosophical lecturing, and zero religion. Instead, we get generous helpings of real-world case studies - aptly applied to progressively more advanced series of design concepts.This style absolutely works for me. And I suspect that engineering mindsets typical of the folks that build these things will likely agree. In short, the Data Warehouse Toolkit Second Edition will significantly lighten the load of books that I carry between data warehouse engagements.Jim StagnittoLlumino, Inc.www.llumino.com"},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"If you want to understand data warehouse design either as user, architect or developer, you need to read this book cover to cover.Things I like about this book:* Coverage of all core principles in dimensional data modeling using examples.

This alone makes the book a must-read* Recap of major principles at the end of the book to bring it all together* Excellent writing -- Ralph does not treat you like a dummy; neither does he assume that you have an IQ north of 200* When you purchase this book, you are in effect purchasing a sliver of the combined knowledge of both authors in the data warehousing field.

The project was a resounding success and is the most popular application in the financial services firm that I implemented it in. (Infact when I lost my job at an Internet company, they immediately offered me a job based on this implementation).

The best part is how solutions I used in the past which were appropriate for those problems are contrasted with solutions for problems like the ones I am facing now. Almost as bad as solving a problem the wrong way (or overlooking it entirely) is reusing an old solution that does not fit the new problem.

Data Warehousing (DW) involves constant tweaking and the goal of good DW project management is minimizing the associated operational cost.I have been a fan of Ralph Kimball as he writes as a person who has been through many implementations. With Mr. Kimball there isn't a miracle cure being touted - stay away from publications that claim such a cure.Mr. Kimball approached the subject with good advices and encourages the readers to watch out for the pitfalls and follow best-practices in design implementation. It is similar to working with a well experienced supervisor.The core to successful DW implementations is - LISTENING. Listening to the users on their needs and gauging the software resources available at your disposal.Trade-offs in design versus cost/performance are a must. You will never have all the resources you need to implement the DW of your dreams. And if you did, chances are very high that once the DW is ready for use the business cases have changed making the design redundant.Mr. Kimball will help in passing these information and much more.

Although there are some chapters (the last two that deals with process and other issues, the biggest part of the book is solely about dimensional modeling. Yes the first chapter deals with what it is (in general), why we would like to use dimensional modeling and some myths and caveats. However, from chapter 2 through 12, the book is hand-on.Chapters 2 - 5 is for me the most impressive chapters of the book as it takes several business processes that is common in many businesses and discuss the design of the star cshemas in great depth. However, nowhere in the book is any design upheld as a panacea -- everywhere the book discusses at great length the possible problems and the design decisions to be made. It thus emphasizes that there is no \\"one-size fits all\\" in dimensioanl modeling.Chapters 6, 7 and 8 deals with CRM, Accounting and HR respectively, while chapters 9 - 14 deals with different industries and their peculiar problems. The industrues are: Telecomms and utilities, Transportation, Education, Healthcare and e-commerce. Each chapter introduces new design guidelines and new problem areas anbd their possible solutions. Chapter 15 deals with the Insurance industry and essentially serves as a nicesummary of the proposed techniques as most are emplyed in the Insurance case study.If you do not have a fairly good understanding of dimensional modeling after reading this text I would be very surprised.However, it is more than just a read to know about dimensional modeling. The way the case studies are handled and the problems identified and discussed also makes it a true reference book. I think evrybody involved in dimensional modeling should have one on his/her desk."},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"This book delivers exactly what it says. Except that word \\"toolkit\\" in its title - you'd better think about this book being a single tool, not a whole toolkit. Ralph Kimball actually has a whole lot of books on data warehousing published, this is one of them, a tool in the toolkit. This one seems like a good starting point to the entire series, and it only shows a single facet - the dimensional modeling.The book explains the basic principles of creating dimensions and fact tables in a data warehouse (assuming a relational star schema), and then dedicates a chapter per industry to show how those principles apply to sales, order management, CRM, accounting, human resources, financial services, telecoms, logistics, education, health care, e-commerce, insurance etc. Each one appears to be significantly different from the others.There is a couple of teaser chapters starting with \\"we have that other book covering this, but will brief you out\\". Nice and makes you want to read the other books too.The book also includes guidelines to the warehouse building process, in terms like \\"know your business sponsor\\", \\"talk to your users\\" and so on. Difficult to say what it has to do with dimensional modeling, perhaps it's included in all the books in the series.There is no word on software, hardware, physical architecture, tuning or performance in this book. It is a textbook in dimensional modeling, period.The book is written clearly, has a handful of simple and uniform diagrams and is easy to follow. It only leaves you wondering just how exactly large is the whole data warehouse area, how many pieces you need to collect yet.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"This book is a great primer on data warehouses: what they are for, how data should be organized in the warehouse, and what you can do with it. There's no code or programming - just a solid explanation of the concepts along with many good examples.This book was perfect for me. I have data that I needed to analyze; I understood normalized relational databases and pivot tables; I'd heard the jargon such as \\"star schema\\" and \\"snowflake schema\\" but didn't know exactly what they meant. This book put all the concepts together and moved my level of understanding up to a new level. I am not building the data warehouse myself but now I can talk the talk with those who are.I had been using pivot tables in Excel to do some analysis, but had been frustrated at times by not being able to get things to work out as I wanted. After reading this book, I understand why - it was because I had not organized the underlying data correctly. To anyone with a relation database background, the organization of data in a data mart or warehouse is very different and goes against one's instinct to normalize and eliminate redundant data. Getting past that was key to getting my data right, and that's what this book did for me.However, if you are the person who will actually be building the data warehouse, you will need to go beyond this book to one that shows you how to actually do what you need. For example, this book does not go into \\"details\\" like ETL - how you actually get data into the warehouse from the transaction database - and the other practical details you will need to know. This book is also database and tool agnostic - those are all details that you will need to find elsewhere once you understand the concepts here.My only quibble is that this book is quite pricey for what you get."},{"Title":"The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling","review":"This book deserves merely a one sentence review.&quot;Simply awesome&quot; .

It was hard to put down, sounds great, huh?! The trouble is, the entire first part, about the crazed gunman, Jack's injuries and recovery, had nothing to really do with the rest of the book. Aside from giving them an excuse to want to leave town. Anson Oliver is thrown in there with, I believe the intent to make us feel that this is connected to Eduardo's mystery, when in fact it turns out to be nothing of the kind.Yes I was ASSuming that Oliver's behaviour was part of the Giver's manipulations, and that the fate of Jack and family moving into the ranch was all part of some interwoven plot. Seems to just be unrelated, and if it wasn't and I'm wrong, I found no hint of how it was connected.The Eduardo Fernadez chapters are great, made me want more. And I got more but only after 400 pages in of a 472 page book did the pace pick up and then just suddenly END! I could see the remaining pages getting thinner and realizing that there was no way there could be a satisfying resolution in that amount of paper and I was right! All the first parts were just a tease for a slap-dash ending out of a 'B' movie where the house is secured against monsters and they breach the first door so why even make a pretense of security.I'm going to leave this at 3 stars for \\"It's OK\\" but I can't recommend it. That would be like recommending a delicious cake that turns sour on the last bite. Not worth it.:("},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Dean Koontz did a great job of creating fears in my mind throughout this story. These fears came from humanly creatures on earth, in Los Angeles, and from creatures from another place in Montana no less.I liked the setting of most of the story in Montana, where people are closer to nature. Also where people loved, respected, and prepared for Nature's wrath. I also always enjoy a story where people are able to prepare and defend themselves against threats to their families and to themselves and do not rely on others to protect them.This story was scary and a real \\"page turner\\".

The story seemed a bit lacking however, and a bit anti-climatic; however if you're looking for a good horror story this one is worth having a look at."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This book reminded me a lot of 'Phantoms'...allthough1)the first part of the book is very slow, the part of the story that is set in Los Angeles is afwully boring, but the part in Montana is very enjoyable. Nothing horrible happens in the first part, only the ending2)This part grips you by your throath, and it won't let you go till the end of the book. The style remind me much of Phantoms,the suspense lasts over more than hundred pages. And the monster well, well it has a lot in common with the 'Phantoms' thing. This part is so good that the book deserves four stars.A job properly done!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"this book scared the bejeezus out of me. as i sat reading it on a bus, i found myself holding the book with one hand and clutching my chest with the other! definitely one of his best, and i know from whence i speak, having read anything of his i can get my hands on!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"OK. I read this novel a number of years ago and, had I reviewed the novel upon first reading it, it would have gotten 4 stars. But, being an older and (somewhat) wiser person now, I discovered that this novel generously borrows from Lovecraft's short story &quot;THE COLOUR OUT OF SPACE&quot;-which i just read for a Modern American Fiction course yesterday. The story features glowing foliage and odd behavior in animals...and all of it stems from an extraterestrial force. Wow...all these details are true about WINTER MOON too! fancy that. I was experiencing some serious deja vu while reading this story. of course, Lovecraft wrote his story 70 years ago...i just happened to not get turned on to him till a month or so ago. As for the novel WINTER MOON itself...i DID like it. It's entertaining, suspenseful, and I LIKED the characters, actually. They're very much like Koontz's others...but this, to me, is a good thing. it's like revisiting old friends:) *note* for fellow, die-hard koontz fans like yours truly, check out another Lovecraft tale, &quot;The Call of Cthulhu,&quot; and discover what may likely be the inspiration for Koontz's awesome PHANTOMS novel"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I am a huge Koontz fan, and the whole time that I was reading this, I was enjoying it. The characters were okay, the plot was not bad, but the ending was horrible. I can't express in words the dissappointment I felt after completing this book. Many of my questions were not answered when it was finished; there was no closure. I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out what the monster was...this is undoubtedly my least favorite Koontz books out there"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Perhaps the most worthwhile part of this meager offering from Koontz is his bleak perspective on the downward spiral of civility in our society. There isn't much more to recommend after the first hundred pages. Koontz quickly switches gears away from the MacGarveys' struggle with the living, breathing monster that is L.A., and concludes with a tired alien/ghost story. The lackluster and unsubstantiated ending is particularly disappointing."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"The writing here is pretty good (quite suspenseful in places) though the plot was fairly dry. The events surrounding Ed as he tried to figure out what was happening at his ranch were the best. I found it amusing that this character eventually is looking at science fiction books trying to find stories about people in similar circumstances. Indeed, there was one (old man and his dog wintering in an remote water-powered mill - remember this one, Dean?). I wonder if the character's actions aren't the result of DK recalling this fine old story. Wish I remembered its author. But I digress, overall the book is good though it tends to be similar to several other DK novels."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This is one of my top 10 favorites of Dean Koontz's, and I've read about 75% of his books. However, the ending was disappointing and didn't leave me with a satisfied feeling. But other than the ending, I liked the characters and the way the book moved. I like his old style of writing better than his new style. His last two books have been a bear for me to read, and I don't like the characters as much. Let's hope he doesn't lose his touch!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"A thing from another dimension enters a ranch in Montana and explores us. It can take over animate and inanimate things, and doesn't know the difference, so it animates corpses. This would make a good short story, and it was once. It makes a mediocre novel. He just fills in extra words to reach novel length, with no new substance. All in 8th grade English. The one bright spot is his technique of keeping you reading on by stringing bits and pieces of expectation in front of you. Otherwise, it's not imaginative, original, or especially entertaining. Sorry, not recommended in the face of so many other better novels on the market."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This is one of the better Koontz books that I've read in a long time. Lately, most of his novels that I've read have followed a definite pattern: woman in peril, guy assists, woman finds inner strength and proves to be stronger than guy, all the while they work together against a corrupt corporation/government agency. Happily the only part of the pattern that carried over was a strong female character. Thus all potential of predicting and second guessing the story was useless. Rather than being entertaining and bland, it turned out to be quite suspenseful. The last hundred or so pages had me jumping at every sound. This is classic Koontz and well worth it."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I must say this was the worst Koontz book Ive laid my hands on. I thought the plot was thin, and the characters boring. I wouldn't recommend picking this one up; at least not as your first Dean Koontz book; because your first impression wouldn't be a good one."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"this book was very good even though it had its slow points at the beginning it really picked up at the end. i thought it was funny how the snowplow driver was eager to help jack, heather, and toby once he knew they were fighting an alien."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"A very &quot;imaginative&quot; thrill ride. Unique, and as always, SCARY!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This book ties in with &quot;Strangers&quot; as one of his all-time best. Way to go, Mr. Koontz! He proves that even though he writes book after book with no hesitation, he doesn't do it only for the money. He clearly LIKES what he does, which unfortunately is a bit uncommon nowadays. Koontz's elegant writing and ability to hold out the suspense without appealing to horrible graphic scenes make him one of the best in his field today. He may be saving an otherwise dying genre."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Koontz manages again to take a supernatural story, and scare the pants off of his readers! Well, he managed to at least scare me!Winter Moon takes place in the woods, in a cabin, among all of the creatures who live in the dark- that picture he paints alone is enough to freak anyone out! But when strange things start happening, it's nail biting time.Winter Moon wasn't my favorite of Koontz's, but it certainly left a lasting impression. That alone earns it some stars!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Considering this is a heavy revision/rewrite of one of the author's earlier, less-developed, short sci-fi originals, it's really not bad.An old hermit in Montana experiences numerous odd phenomena around his remote home. The animals don't act naturally. They gaze at him with an unearthly intelligence - an analogy that proves too true for comfort, when he receives one unnatural nocturnal visitor too many, and his heart gives out with the shock. A family seeking escape from the dangers of California jump at the chance to move, when they inherit his ranch house...and whatever it is that's been stalking him.The novel is uneven. Too much time is spent dwelling on the California family's history and woes, which would have been better dealt with in a backstory chapter upon their arrival in Montana than a number of chapters that diffuse the focus of the plot.However, the Montana scenes all have atmosphere to spare, and there's a pervasive sense of menace throughout. Fans of the old Outer Limits series will recognize elements from the second season &quot;Cry Of Silence&quot; episode, and should especially enjoy this book.Not the author's best, not without flaws, but a good, creepy-crawly read."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This was a great, scary, spooky book. I loved it! Wish I could find more authors, that write similar to Dean Koontz."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I have read nearly everything Koontz has written and this certainly wouldn't be anywhere near the top of a ranking of books in order of quality list. He has written worse though. I would recommend Watchers, Mr Murder, Night Chills, Intensity and The Voice of the Night to name but a few of the Koontz masterpiece novels instead of this but if you can get this cheap or free it is a worthwhile read to pass the time.In Winter Moon Jack McGarvey almost dies after he and his partner encounter a Hollywood film maker high on drugs with a sub machine gun who flips after receiving a Pepsi from a vending machine which he didn't order in a petrol station. Meanwhile Eduardo Fernandez witnesses strange things at his Montana ranch and then something knocks on his door.Stressed and targeted by Beverly Hills rich kids with spray paint whilst her husband is recovering in hospital Heather McGarvey is paranoid for the safety of her young son and herself and growing to hate LA. They are also having money problems so when they find out they have inherited a Montana ranch from a relative of Jack's ex partner who died a year before the petrol station incident they are thrilled to escape the cesspool of LA. Of course what knocked on Eduardo's door will also knock on theirs too."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Koontz is my favorite writer. I found Winter Moon as thrilling (start to finish), as scary (maybe scarier!), and hard to put down as all his others. But, with about one-fifth of the story to go, I began to suspect an ending I wasn't going to like. So I peeked, and there it was. BOOOO!!!Without that ending, this would be 4 or even 5 stars. I'm referring to the terribly disappointing relocation, not the resolution of the plot. Shame on Dean Koontz. Can I demand a rewrite?"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I have read numerous, maybe even all of Koontz's books, and this one by far is my least favorite. The characters were all set up well, but the plot went nowhere. It wasn't creepy at all and the ending was a huge let down. Nothing was answered. Not worth the read in my opinion. Very slow moving."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I enjoy Dean Koontz's writing very much. He really has a style and prose all his own. The book was easy to read and started out suspenseful and the main characters were likable enough, but about halfway through the story, I realized that he was stretching out what could have actually been an interesting short story, into a 400-page novel. Although his demonic aliens were somewhat bland and unimaginative and the ending was weak, his writing style saved the book somewhat. \`Winter Moon' will surely give you something to do if you're just looking for something easy to read, but it's quite far from being considered one of Koontz's better books."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I've read this twice. The first time I read it was the early 90's.. apparently I forgot how much I disliked it, because I picked it up and read it again in 2000. I hated it. Halfway through, reading it became a chore. It was mostly just a bunch of senseless babble with no real plot. You knew what was going to happen from the very beginning.I'd suggest picking up one of his better novels. Start with Lightning, Strange Highways I was real fond of too. Plus the Fear Nothing and Sieze the Nights books were pretty good.Stay away from this one is my opinion. :)"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"this is not one of his best novels. the plot isn't amazing and so aren't the charecters...but you still can't help loving it. it gets you in the mood very fast' and it's like those 1950's sci-fi stuff with aliens in an isolated ranch. it's a scary book, entertaining and thrilling. fun sci-fi horror. but if yourlooking for better koontz books try hideaway or watchers."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I loved, loved, LOVED this book, and finished it quicker than a few of the other Dean Koontz books I've read. My only problem is that he gives no definate nor logical explanations for the incidents that occured on Mr. Fernandez's farmland... Not to be giving anything away, but I really expected some incredible explanations that were as shocking as in Phantoms and Whispers. Oh, well. It was full of violence, some gore, and plenty of creepy stuff (those animals on the ranch gave me the shivers). Also, the scenes that showed Jack McGarvey getting better were useless."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"One of the last traditional Koontz &quot;creature features&quot;, this piece of work is not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but still a fast-paced, moderately enjoyable read none-the-less. The setting initially begins in Montana, where Eduardo Fernandez comes upon an evil presence in the woods. The solitary man begins a battle against the horrific unknown, only to succomb to its terror. Skip to Los Angeles, California, where police officer Jack McGarvey and his partner are ambushed by a killer, murdering the partner and serverely injuring the protagonist. To avoid the dangers of the big city, the recovering Jack decides to take his family away to a secluded old ranch in Montana.The new lives of the McGarvey family seem simple and enjoyable enough. They do not have too many nearby neighbors, but they are happy enough in their new sanctuary and are ready to begin a new life together. However, this was before some strange occurences start to take place in the home. This is before they realize that a merciless, undead terror is about to make their lives a living hell.Not as symbolic as many of his other novels, this Koontz romp is strictly horror business without the extraneous variables. The McGarvey family is only fairly likable; readers obviously are not rooting against them, but they are slightly under-developed compared to other character families in some of his past tales. Overall, &quot;Winter Moon&quot; will not put you to sleep, but it not cause you to read the last page in triumph either."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This book was a tricky one for me. The reason i say that is because usually i love how Koontz begins his stories. I think he really excells at instantly pulling a reader into his story, and usually by the end of chapter 3 at the latest, there's no doubt that i am finishing that book. This one didn't appeal to me at the begining, just because i felt it was too similair to the way he has started other ones, namely Dragon Tears, which i had read not too long ago.I decided to stick with the book, because once i had reached page 70, page 80, even though i wasn't enjoying it as much as usual, i never quit a book that i get more than fifty pages into. Boy was that a good decision. Once i hit page 93, the book starts getting good, and the book starts getting CREEPY. Two storylines are happening. One concerns a cop, who is involved in a shoot out at the beginning, as he recovers and his wife tries to deal with the adversity it had caused her and her son while he is in the hospital. That story line is nothing special in my opinion, not that it's bad, just that i've read that before from Koontz. The beginning is why i give this four and half rather than five stars.The second storyline is excellent, as it takes us to an isolated mansion in Montana, into the home of a 70 year old man named Eduardo Ferntandez. He begins to see a strange light coming from the woods at the edge of his property. This is when the horror starts hitting hard, and when the book starts getting great in my opinion. I won't say anything else as i don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't read this. Let me just say if you're the type of person who would get nightmares after reading a scary book, you may want to stay away from this one! Under-rated, and under appreciated book in my opnion."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I loved this book, it had a strong feel of foreboding and was laced with mystery. If you want a pure thriller from start to finish, this is the one. Beautifully written with a suspenseful twist and a satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I enjoyed this Dean Koontz book but felt that it was very padded out. The chapters of Edwardo could have just been written as a prologue and there are a lot of chapters during and after Jacks injury which I felt were unneccesary and, were they in a movie, they would probably have been covered in a montage.I liked the fact that this book was quite origional for Dean Koontz in the fact that it was very different (especially the ending) to his other books in the fact that it deals with the supernatural.As usual with a Koontz book the charactors are likeable, it can be hard to put down in places and, of course, one of the main charactors has a pet dog.Recomended to Koontz fans because the theme of it is a nice change from the usual."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Bottom Line: LoanerNot every book can be great, and this book for me, was one of the not great ones.It was okay, ended up skimming a lot of it just to get to the interesting parts. The dual stories going on at the same time was a little weird, until the author revealed who the guy on the ranch was. Also, none of the characters really peaked my interest either.I'd recommend Koontz's Intensity or Icebound."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This is a highly entertaining, quick read, that is sure to provide some chills. Here, a heroic, Los Angeles Police Department cop, Jack McGarvey, is shot and almost killed in a wild shoot out which sees several civilians killed, as well as his partner, the second partner Jack has lost inside of a year. After a four month convalescence, Jack, his wife Heather, and their son Toby receive an unexpected gift, seemingly from the Gods. Eduardo Hernandez, the father of his former partner of eleven years, died and left Jack a six hundred acre ranch in Montana, as well as a substantial sum of cash. Having decided that enough is enough, Jack and Heather agree to relocate to Montana.Unbeknownst to Jack, before seventy year old Eduardo Hernandez died, he had been experiencing some mighty strange goings on at the ranch. One night, a bizarre, electronic oscillation pulsed through the bone deep quiet of the Montana air, coming in disturbing waves, accompanied by the sense of an alien presence. An amber radiance resonated through the pine woods surrounding the ranch. Lasting only seven minutes, the phenomena disappeared, only to return a month later in an even more disquieting fashion. Louder, with more rhythmic pounding, it caused the house to vibrate. An undulation of sound lured Eduardo out of his home, where a luminescent amber radiance once again emanated from the woods, calling out to him, the sense of an alien presence overwhelming. It then disappeared, as quickly as it began. A month later, the same thing occured, only this time a two dimensional doorway into infinite blackness appeared, a portal into the unknown. Soon after this portal appeared, the surrounding wildlife began to act strangely. Just what was going on?Read this book and find out. Just remember...leave the lights on!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"A friend of mine who likes Koontz a lot like I do, told me to try this book out. It was his first Koontz book and he really liked it and it was really creepy to him.Now I can see how this book, if it's your first 'creepy' book or first Koontz book, could be pretty good. It's got great characters, a mysterious occurence, intense moments, and moments that some will wish they hadn't started reading while being alone in their bedroom.The thing that made me drop the score on the book was the way everything was laid out. The beginning of the book starts off with a bang. I was captured in the madness that was created in just moments of what should have been a regular day at a gas station. Then, I'm reading about someone else in the next chapter and everything is incredibly slow due to Koontz using an incredible amount of detail to make the chapters longer than they need to be (I dont mind that he does this usually, but it's ridiculous in this book). Then a few chapters later, the book begins to pick up again, only to go back to being very boring and reading what seems like the same thing in 3 chapters. We get it Koontz, the guy has a lot of rehabilitating to do. Gotcha. Then more action, slowness, etc. You get the drift.I'll usually finish a book I really like in about 2-3 days. This book almost took me a week to get through the middle. When the good stuff starts to happen at the end though, the book get very good again and I really could not put it down for maybe like the last 10-12 chapters if I remember correctly. And that is what makes the book pretty darn good. The beginning and a lot of the end makes this book a good read. You just got to get through the boring parts of the filler.I know I've reviewed a lot about how the book felt to me instead of exactly what the book is about so let me explain it real quick. I wont say much because a lot of the book needs to be read so you can be surprised.Winter Moon has 2 main stories, Jack and his family...and Eduardo. Jack is an L.A. police officer who gets caught up in a gas station psychotic shoot out that Michael Bay would EASILY waste 10 million dollars on if he was able to film it for a movie. The event shakes up his life as well as his wife and sons (whose names I cant remember while typing this). Will he be able to ever work as a street cop again? Will he be able to support his family with his low income and budget cuts happening? Will his son be safe walking to the same school an innocent girl was walking to when she was killed by a stray bullet from some gang members?Then there is Eduardo. A widower and a father who outlived his son. A caretaker to a ranch that was owned by a very wealthy man who gave it to Eduardo after he died. Eduardo lives alone and gets by daily doing yard work, reading books, drinking a few beers. Just normal activities. Until one day he has a wierd experience at night. A strange thing is happening out in the woods. In the next days, after seeing the wild life acting very peculiar, Eduardo knows that something is not right, and there is about to be a showdown.Though I dont think this was one of Koontz's best books, I did like it. I loved all the Eduardo parts. But the hospital scenes were boring me to death. Though at the end, there is no way I would've been rooting for Jack and his family like I was if it wasnt for those boring scenes. I just think the biggest fault in the book was that Koontz used a LOT of detail during the hospital scenes that just did not have to be there."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"There were some scary, suspenseful parts in the book but overall I didn't think it was very good. Wouldn't recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Winter Moon was only the second Dean Koontz novel I have read. It was well worth the effort and expense. Since the other reviewers go into great detail, I only want to point out a few things of particular interest to me:1) Strong characters, entirely believable. They were also intelligent and reacted as you might expect people to react if the novel's events were real (except for the wife buying a mini-Uzi - come on!).2) Some very interesting details about the alien life form (which I won't give away here). Koontz created a fascinating alien life form different than that which appears in other sci-fi I have read.3) And ending that is not quite what you would expect.4) You should read this novel at about the same time you read Koontz' The Taking to note differences and similarities. I found some very interesting similarities (but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone). I would have liked the chance to read the original version of this novel (published in 1975 as Invasion) but I have not been able to locate a copy yet."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"While not my favorite by any means, this is great Koontz! Jack McGarvey is one of my favorite Koontz characters even if the story seems a bit odd and difficult to read at times.It's strange the way life plays out. And this story is no exception. Jack McGarvey's life has always played out rough. Two partners lost in as many years and anything that can go wrong does go wrong....UNTIL...He inherits the farm upon the death of his dead partner's father...But is this the blessing in disguise it first appears to be?Well if you've ever read a word of Koontz you know that all is not as it appears.But in the end, ol' Jack is a better man for all he has to endure.And that makes this story WELL worth the read. If you can get past all the weird creatures and strange \\"body snatchers\\" (as I call them) you have a wonderfully imaginative story."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"As Jack McGarvey is caught in a shoot out, he second partner within a year is shot and killed.

She was not quite sure what it was, but she knew that there was something lerking around. Toby, their 8 year old son, had become its first victim. Not knowing that he would soon become possessed with the \\"supernatural.\\"As the McGarvey's soon realized that their son was a victim of this horrible monster. They knew action had to be taken. As they tried to kill this \\"alien\\" they found out nothing could slow it down like a shotgun, an uzi or even fire. As the end came near Toby figured out that he could control it with his mind. The boy was amazed that he could control such a powerful and large creature with just his mind. With their lives being threatened the creature was destroyed.Reading this book kept suspense and wonder running through the head. Not knowing what was going to happen next was a great feeling and keeps it interesting. Recommended for those who like suspense and the \\"aliens.\\""},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I am an big Dean Koontz fan and have read about 19 of his books. This is one of my top 5 favorites. An easy read but very entertaining. I think this book has one of the most suspensful scenes in any DK book (...the tapping on the window scene). I still get chills thinking about it. Not a book that draws you in very deep on an emotional level but the story around Heather, Jack, and Toby is a sweet one that makes you want to see good things happen for them. The reason I put the comment about Cold Fire in the title was because in that book I was hoping for a more extraterrestrial villian, (because it seems to be leading there) and was dissapointed with the overall outcome. Everything that wasn't delivered with Cold Fire is delivered in Winter Moon and more."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Though I am normally immediately enthralled in Koontz's vivid storytelling by the bottom of page one, Winter Moon left me yearning to reach the end not for my usual motive of discovering how the story wraps up, but for being able to justify my purchase of the novel. Much like The House of Thunder, the plot of Winter Moon seems derived from the bottom of the author's usually well-stocked barrell of intriguing theme. Though it did entertain me, Winter Moon was nothing short of a grown-up Hardy Boys story. Not that the Hardy's were ever that bad....."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"KOONTS IS THE MASTER OF SUSPENSE. NO AUTHOR WILL EVER TOP KOONTS'S STORYTELLING"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Winter Moon would have been better as a short story. The first 300 pages are unnecessary drek. The characters are pathetic and bland (and does anyone else notice Koontz seems to have the same 3 main characters in nearly all of his novels? There's the heroic, faithful male, the strong female, and the young, innocent child). The story has real potential, as most of Koontz's novels do, but it is wasted in bad writing. It really seems like there was no editing at all, or if any, sparse and uninfluential. The book doesn't seem unsalvagable, but, unfortunately, it was left in a wreck on the beach. I would recommend against reading it."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Man, this book had me at some points closing it and then throwing it across my bedroom because it shook me up so much!! To all who said it was lame and wasn't past fifth grade, what grade are you in? I may just read this one again very soon! Great suspense!!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I think this book is one of his best. This is a book I put off reading for a while, not knowing what it would be about, but once I read some of the online reviews from Amazon.com, I just had to. I wasn't dissapointed. I really liked the way he portrayed Toby as a hero. I think that Mr. Koontz has outdown himself this time. GOOD JOB DEANY!!!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I read this book about 3 years ago but I still think of it now and then. Although the ending was rather vague, the writing itself was great. It starts off as two separate stories: A family in L.A. and a old retired couple living in Montana. To find out how the two get intertwined into an exciting and scary mystery, read the book!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"The plot of this book is so silly it's not even funny. The characters are one-dimensional, which isn't surprising since the dialogue is cardboard too. This is the kind of book you thought of writing in 6th grade, but you never made it past the first 5 pages; it looks like Mr Koontz is a little more perseverant, but that's not necessarily a good thing. How this crap ever got past the editor is beyond me. There are a lot of great horror novels out there. Save your money and buy one of those instead. You'll be grateful you did."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Okay when I read this the first thing that comes to mind is a cross breed of THE SHINING & DREAMCATCHER. The catch? Dreamcatcher was written after this book. Maybe in the end this book is just a case of two good (not great) minds that think alike. Winter Moon-does start off with a bang and keeps you turning the pages-so in that sense-the book is worth the paperback price tag."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Copyright: 1994Pages: 472Yet another supernatural thriller from Koontz, proving that an experienced writer always needs old tricks to satisfy his ever-growing audience, as well as his dedicated early fans. Telling the story of two very different men, Jack McGarvey, a Los Angeles cop whose greatest fears as a polic officer come true when he is shot down by a psychotic film director, and Eduardo Fernandez, a Montana native who discovers an extra-terrestrial force that no one would be able to believe. When McGarvey recovers from his injuries, fate brings his famiy to Fernandez's ranch and into the deepest part of Montana, where they come face-to-face with the evils that have surfaced to destroy the current human race. Koontz spends much too long developing the McGarvey family and he finally gets to the roots of his story well past halfway through the novel, causing him to rush the latter part. \\"Winter Moon\\" does incorporate many fast-paced chase scenes, a terrifying alien villain very similar to that of \\"Phantoms\\", and a climax that seems to end too quickly and leaves a few unanswered questions up in the air. Koontz proves that he can still write with the best of them, but he may want to consider staying with his recent \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart\\" formula rather than relying on those old tricks he has already mastered."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I have read just about all of Koontz's work and this is his poorest effort. Usually I can't put down reading his novels--but this one was work. Too slow and weak plot.

I won't give anything away, but it's not Dean Koontz best."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"The plot intertwines the chaotic city of Los Angeles with the eerie solitude of a Montana Ranch. It combines mystery and horror into one suspenseful, spooky read. I recommend it. The only negative is the ending which does not quite resolve all of the questions the reader would expect to find out about at the end."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This is a mediocre effort by the king. It had the SHINING thing going on with the little kid with ESP and a vague, nondescript monster trying to kill the protagonists. Ho-hum. Not great, but not too terrible either. Dean, take your time - you can do better. Check out the BAD PLACE for vintage Koontz."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"What a disappointment. This would have made a tight, suspenseful short story, but is stretched way too thin to be a successful novel. Nearly a hundred pages given to a subplot involving a drug shootout and the neurotic exploits of a cop's wife? Come on, was that really necessary? This subplot has no bearing whatsoever on the remainder of the story. The plot was unfolding in Montana not in LA. No, it didn't even lend itself to advancing character development since the characters are very boring and stilted (Ed being the exception). I found myself skimming through much of the first half of the novel. I believe this book is a good example of cut-n-paste editing in order to meet a deadline."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Dean Koontz delivers exceptional writing in the majority of his novels.

It isn't as easy as it looks! It takes real talent to consistently churn out novels like DK does! He is one of the few who turn out quality after quality!!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I usually like Koontz, this is by far the worst novel I have read by him. VERY dull throughout and it seems like its going nowhere for a long time. The ending was especially poor.There are a few nice parts however and these are when he almost gets close to Lovecraft's style.My recommendation is to find and H. P. Lovecraft novel and curl up with it instead."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This was my first book by Dean Koontz that I had read, and I loved it, it is my favorite book that I have ever read.

The action in the novel was great, it could not have been better, 5 stars all the way, I loved it from page one! I am defiantly going to read this book again. If your looking for a good read, then pick up Winter Moon."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Its ok, but not my favorite. Koontz really beats around the bush here. Its a pretty good story, but not very well written. It took everything i had to keep me interested for the first part. He writes a good part, and then he slacks off for a while, then he writes something else that was interesting, then he slacks again. Most of the book you can skip over, but it would have made a good short story rather than a novel."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Was a gift. It was well received. I was told the book is very good."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Even though this was not the best book Dean Koontz has written it still grabbed my attention to the point where I did not want to put it down. The ending is somewhat surprising and it gets you really into it."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I have read about five or six of Dean Koontz novels and I must have been lucky, because each one took my interest within the first chapter. With this book, the first chapter took me, but the chapters after that grabbed me by the collar and dragged me along like a ton of concrete. It took to page one hundred to kick into some kind of suspense and fifty to seventy-five more pages to get to the next plot, and from there, it was all I could do to keep reading. It wasn't a bad book, it just took too long to get to, well, anywhere. The monsters introduced were grotesque enough, but to have to be introduced to them within the last quarter of the book didn't make the grade for me. On top of that, questions remained that weren't cleared up, like why was Toby affected by the aliens and not his parents? Was it because he was a child and his mind was not fully developed, or was it something dealing with his subconcious? Only if you have time to waste and you have got to read something, ANYTHING, then here's the book for you."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I found the first half of the book somewhat disjointed and a bit slow moving, rare for a Koontz book. It did congeal in the second half, and managed to hold my interest until the end. Koontz can do so much better than this, that I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I've read every novel by Dean Koontz, and I would put WINTER MOON in the bottom third. This is not a terrible novel, but it's very slow paced in the middle and the ending is not particularly satisfying. This is supposed to be an alien invasion story, but the alien is essentially little more than a two-dimensional monster. Little explanation is provided for why the alien behaves as it does, and I found this story made very little sense as a result. Koontz has told this type of monster story much better in other novels, most notably PHANTOMS.This novel also is very preachy in spots, where Koontz promotes his personal views on gun control, urban crime, the film industry, graffiti artists, heavy metal music, and a variety of other subjects. Although I mostly agree with Koontz's views, I don't read fiction to validate my own political beliefs. In any case, the sermonizing slows down the story.I'm a big Dean Koontz fan, and my advice is to avoid this novel if you've never read Koontz before. Instead, read some of his stronger novels, such as WATCHERS, ODD THOMAS, PHANTOMS, INTENSITY, LIGHTNING and FEAR NOTHING. Those novels will turn you into a fan."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Jack McGarvey, one of L.A.'s finest, is wounded in a violent and spectacular gunfight. In Montana, Eduardo Fernandez encounters something in the woods...something which means him harm.When Eduardo dies, and McGarvey inherits the man's cabin, it seems like a dream: a chance to get away from the city and really LIVE. But living may turn to dying, and the McGarvey family is about to find out. There is still something in the woods, and it wasn't satisfied with Eduardo. It want's McGarvey's young son...and is ready to do anything to get him...This isn't Koontz's best, but as a sci-fi thriller, it's pretty darn good. A &quot;creature feature&quot;, yes, but it's more than that, as any Koontz novel is: it's a novel of a man defending his family against an unknown evil, and coming to grips with himself. A reworked version of an earlier Koontz story, this novel is, like most of Koontz's work, a nearly-flawless thrill ride of chills and suspense. Dean Koontz is a masterful writer; &quot;Winter Moon&quot; is an incredible novel. Get the picture?"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Well, wow! does this book have punches!!I have to admit to a particular part of the book when Eduardo encounters one of these \\"Givers\\" on his front porch. He hears them walking and aproaching his door, he demands a reaponse, but there is none; and finally when he comes face to face with this entity it kills him!Another disturbing part of the story is when little Toby and Jack are out in the cemetary where most of the family appeared to have been buried a few yards from the house and when Jacks tries to figure out what his son, Toby meant by when he said: \\"Where do we go when we die?\\"And with that said Toby looked up from the epitaph and looked directly at his father and Jack noticed that it was not his son he was speaking to. His eyes were completly black and it was though you could almost see through to him...THis was beyond scary!!!! I definatly recommecnt this thriller to anyone who isn't scared easily!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"This is a highly entertaining, quick read, that is sure to provide some chills. Here, a heroic, Los Angeles Police Department cop, Jack McGarvey, is shot and almost killed in a wild shoot out which sees several civilians killed, as well as his partner, the second partner Jack has lost inside of a year. After a four month convalescence, Jack, his wife Heather, and their son Toby receive an unexpected gift, seemingly from the Gods. Eduardo Hernandez, the father of his former partner of eleven years, died and left Jack a six hundred acre ranch in Montana, as well as a substantial sum of cash. Having decided that enough is enough, Jack and Heather agree to relocate to Montana.Unbeknownst to Jack, before seventy year old Eduardo Hernandez died, he had been experiencing some mighty strange goings on at the ranch. One night, a bizarre, electronic oscillation pulsed through the bone deep quiet of the Montana air, coming in disturbing waves, accompanied by the sense of an alien presence. An amber radiance resonated through the pine woods surrounding the ranch. Lasting only seven minutes, the phenomena disappeared, only to return a month later in an even more disquieting fashion. Louder, with more rhythmic pounding, it caused the house to vibrate. An undulation of sound lured Eduardo out of his home, where a luminescent amber radiance once again emanated from the woods, calling out to him, the sense of an alien presence overwhelming. It then disappeared, as quickly as it began. A month later, the same thing occured, only this time a two dimensional doorway into infinite blackness appeared, a portal into the unknown. Soon after this portal appeared, the surrounding wildlife began to act strangely. Just what was going on?Read this book and find out. Just remember...leave the lights on!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I have read many of Koontz's books, and honestly there wasn't one that I didn't like. He is pretty consistent with his writing.That aside, this was a good book. I am not sure why it's titled as such, but I liked how the stories of the family in Los Angeles and of Eduardo on Quatermass ranch, got brought together in the middle, only to finish in an explosive end. Without giving the plot away, and writing yet another summary, I liked this book for a few simple reasons;- The main characters, Jack and his family are really likable. They are storing people, and I found myself reading thoughts they expressed, and feeling that I feel the same way about things in life.- Eduardo is an older man, living alone on Quatermass ranch, far away from any cities or people, and he discovers creepy things. Animals around him acting weird, dirt and stench in his house, scary pulsating and noises that grows stronger and stronger.It was hard to read it at night, because the old man was alone, and I literally had to remember to breather when he kept discovering things. Good read after all, another nice book form Koontz.I only with the ending was longer, in so many Koontz books, the fight up the hill gets to a dramatic climax only to let go and end very quickly on a page or two.-"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Winter Moon was an okay, but by no means fantastic, read. The story goes like this: Jack McGarvey is a cop who gets shot up on the job in LA and decides that he just can't take the mean streets anymore. He moves his family out to a Montana ranch inherited from Eduardo Fernandez (his dead partner's father). Before his death, Fernandez discovers a strange 'alien' being of some kind that has no purpose or motivation other than to 'become' and 'hate'. A face to face confrontation with this being is what causes Fernandez'a ultimate demise, from a heart attack. When the McGarveys move to the ranch, they soon discover this being. Before long they find themselves in battle for their very survival.This story would have been much better, except for a couple of problems. 1.Way too much backstory. The whole first half of the book is literally split in two. You go back and forth between Jack's recovery from the shooting in an LA hospital and Fernandez's various encounters with the alien. Because it takes literally half the book for the main plot to get going, you feel like you are reading two different books, and end up unable to fully get involved with the plot of either. Really, DK could have split this up into two books that could have stood on their own. 2.The alien's lack of any motivation that the reader would be able to understand was just unsatisfying. While it might be true that we could never understand something that is truely alien, because of it's very 'alien-ness', it doesn't make for very satisfying story telling.This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but DK can (and has) done a lot better. As long-time fans know, he is a little hit or miss. Newcomers to DK novels should not let this novel put them off of future readings."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"When ever you read a story wherein the evil the emotes throughout remains mostly of unknown origins, I find it chilling.

Koontz's writing in the book is superb. There are a few flaws (Anson Oliver's shooting spree and the events at Quartermass Ranch aren't linked together too well), but everything else makes up for it. Two more notes: I finished reading the book in about two days. You'll hopefully like it as much. Also, the part where Ed finds evidence (dirt, fabric) of the &quot;intruder&quot; is trully creepy. I couldn't sleep!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I have read a few Dean Koontz books & I have read a number of books in the 'Horror' genre but the last time I was this frightened by a story I was 17 & reading the Shining by Stephen King.Can't quite put my finger on what it was that frightened me so, but i rememeber reading on my way home & experiencing terror at what i was reading. Koontz delivered the characters fear so expertly that i was locked into the story & couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Winter Moon really picked up in the second half of the book. Dean Koontz weighs heavily on character development during the first half of the book. At times it felt a little long-winded, but Dean Koontz never disappoints. The first half of the book was more drama. He's such a good writer, that the story was intriguing regardless. The second half of the book was really spooky and chilling. There really was no surprise twist like some of his other books, but even though you kinda knew what was going on, it was chilling nonetheless. I don't know if I would categorize this as a tale of horror per-say. The story was excellent and reminded me why I love Dean Koontz so much!"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I listened to the audio book of Winter Moon. I have been a Dean Koontz fan for many, many years. Winter moon is easily my least favorite Koontz book.I love the premise of the story and the climax, once we got there, was fantastic. But getting there took way too long. The book moved very slowly. I felt way too much attention was spent on everyday menial tasks, which is quite boring to read about, or listen to in this case.The book started out strong. Jack is a police officer in Los Angeles. The very first chapter starts with him and his partner getting into a shootout. From there, we go to Quartermass Ranch in Montana where we meet Eduardo. Eventually, Jack moves with his wife and son to Montana and live at Quartermass Ranch, which is when things start to get strange and the story starts to pick up. However, this is about three-quarters of the way into the book already.I had considered more than once to stop listening and put the book aside, but because I am such a huge fan of Koontz I kept expecting it to get better. I guess they can't all be winners. I won't hold this against him.

I do prefer Koontz's books that have a bit less of a supernatural theme, but even the others that I've read I liked more than this one. The main characters were okay, but the alien monster really never went anywhere and too much was left unexplained. The book ended far too abruptly with no follow-up on the characters afterwards (I was sure there'd be something made of how heroic the boy acted in particular), and there were parts that I laughed out loud at how absurd it became. He included a golden retriever as so many of his books do but the dog seemed totally unnecessary to the story, and introduced a glaring plot hole (why did the alien not just take control of him as it did other animals??) Overall, not his best work and a book you can skip without really missing much."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I found the first three-fourths of the book boring and slow moving. I normally love Koontz, but I do not recommend this one."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"When I first heard about Winter's Moon I thought it was going to be like Stephen King's Dreamcatcher (I heard that they both had similar career paths and the only other story with aliens in it by King that I have read was Dreamcatcher so I figured that this was his version of it) but its more of a Phantoms clone then anything.The story is very good with two plots going on at the same time. One of them is about a Police Officer and how he has to deal with almost losing the use of his legs and the other one is about a retired man who is sure that something is happening in the back of his house.The second story about the man and the thing growing in his backyard was interesting and gripping while the first story I sort of tugged along with. Things could have been taken out of this book (Koontz should have dropped the whole Dog thing unless it was vital to the story) but you could do worse."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"\\"Winter Moon\\" is and awesome 300 page novel...stretched to 480 pages. While not awful, \\"Winter Moon\\" is sooo slowly paced that you will lose interest.The book is actually 2 (possibly 3) seperate tales..all wrapped in one. The first part of the novel switches back and forth between a Los Angles cop caught in violent shoot-out and a widowed rancher in Montana dealing with some strange things happening in and around his home.The parts of the story dealing with the cop and his road to recovery simply drag, and read more like a condemnation by Koontz of modern society. While I agree with most of the points he makes....it's still fairly dull. The highlight of the story for me is the portions dealing with the elderly rancher. Strange lights, odd animal activity and other bizarre occurances will keep you turning the pages.The third and final portion of the book kind of merges these two storylines together. But passages of this final portion (the 2nd half of the book) really drag and story elements get kind of shoehorned in for no good reason. A dog is introduced, but really doesn't add or bring anything to the story (but it's Koontz and a Dog must always play some kind of role), and we meet a new character in the final pages that plays a vital role in the story's outcome which felt almost like a \\"cheat\\" on the author's part.Still, it's not an awful book, and it is a relatively quick read, so if you've got nothing else for the beach you could do a lot worse."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I read this one back when it first came out.

So much so, we're looking for more of them for our next trip, as we've finally finished the first little book."},{"Title":"Larousse Mini Dictionary: French-English/English-French (Larousse Bilingual Dictionaries) (French Edition)","review":"This little pocket-sized beauty got me and my family through France! I have no formal French language training, but with this little book and a willingness to tackle the French language, the trip was a rousing success. The French people (yes, the snobbish Parisians) were absolutely wonderful to us and this book enabled us to communicate adequately to enjoy the sites and tastes of Paris thoroughly. I took this book on a return trip and again it proved itself indispensable. I am planning to buy the Italian version for a trip to Italy later this year. Worth its weight in gold!"},{"Title":"Larousse Mini Dictionary: French-English/English-French (Larousse Bilingual Dictionaries) (French Edition)","review":"Simple vocabulary if you need it for English classes but very useful in the daily life and for basic words."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"Mastering Secrets of Yoga Flow is one of the few yoga books you can purchase that encompasses all aspects of the yoga practice from lifestyle to postures to environment. Doug's approach to yoga welcomes all styles and embraces each unique practice through his beautiful flowing movements. This book is a must buy for any yoga student or teacher, whether your a beginner or advanced practitioner."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"This book contains an incredibly useful piece of information: holding yoga poses cultivates prana, one's intrinsic energy or life force; however, that force is dissipated by moving statically from one pose to another. But when you link the poses with a connecting movement called a vinyasa, the prana is amplified and strengthened. I never understood before why Ashtanga and Ashtanga-based yogas emphasize vinyasa. That said, this is a good basic book on Ashtanga-based yoga by a gifted practitioner. Whether I would choose this over, say, Power Yoga, is a hard question. Apart from the vinyasas, much of the information is basic stuff contained in a dozen other hatha yoga books. If you're looking for the best book on classical Ashtanga practice, I recommend skipping this one in favor of David Swenson's (Doug's brother) masterpiece ASHTANGA YOGA, THE PRACTICE MANUAL. David Swenson's videotapes also are excellent and, having had the good fortune to take a class with David, I can tell you he's also a very nice guy. Caveat: if you are in fact looking for a book on Ashtanga yoga or Ashtanga-based practices and cannot find a good teacher, videos are a must. You have to see the movements and the coordination with the breathing to understand it. So, if you are a collector of yoga books, Doug Swenson's MASTERING THE SECRETS would be a fun addition to the collection. If you are seeking a text to learn from, it's a good book but you'll need supplemental materials and are probably better off with his brother David's most excellent book--so good, it's even bound to remain opened to whatever page you're using as you work out so you can refer to it easily. Doug's book is nice. David's is a truly great work on this subject."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"Doug Swenson's Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow is for you if you are interested in starting a home practice or if you are wanting to incorporate yoga into more aspects of your life. Part II offers detailed, yet easy to follow instructions for asana practice, and covers sequencing and linking the asanas with vinyasas. The vinyasas give the routine its unique flavor, since Swenson connects one asana to another through tai chi-type movements that work with the energy of the natural environment. The book encourages creativity, giving the yogi choices of asanas from which to choose in designing a safe practice. I loved Part III the most, though, for its discussion on meditation, diet, cross-training, and bringing yoga into your daily life. In a very non-judgmental manner, Swenson describes how to progress to a diet plan that is healthy and life-sustaining. I expect to refer back to the book for years to come."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow is an excellent book on a truly unique form of yoga personally developed by Doug Swenson. Doug's Sadhana Yoga is one of the most graceful and naturally flowing I have seen. Doug's experience with tai chi is very much evident, with beautifully flowing vinyasas concentrated on the movement of energy. Using the power of the breath and the strength and energy of nature he literally seems to flow like water. The book eagerly covers both soft and hard flowing asana and includes modifications and instructions with props, making it ideal for both beginners and those looking for a more sophisticated and meditative yoga style. Doug provides not only complete routines for beginner and advanced students, but includes in-depth sections on meditation, discussing breath, visual and sound exercises; nutrition; and life beyond the mat. I found the chapter on nutrition and the advocating of a raw food diet especially interesting. With our current culture of Atkins obsession, Doug's discussion of the importance of protein and carbohydrates in a balanced diet was refreshing. The chapter discusses a healthy attitude toward food, and includes meal plans for three levels of dieters. Mastering the Secrets is a wonderful book with a fabulous holistic approach to yoga. I highly recommend it not only for great instruction but for purely magical inspiration."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow is an excellent book that captures all of the components of yoga.There are clear instructions and excellent photos for the postures, suggested routines for all levels, tips on nutrition, and guidelines for meditation.My favorite feature of the book is the openness with which it is written. Doug encourages the yogi to be creative with their practice and offers modifications and sequencing to boot.Check out his DVD of the same title; it helped me really understand the flow of the practice by watching his demonstrations."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"A+ for Dougs new book, &quot;Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow.&quot; This book is a great book for any Yogi. I love the way Doug flows in and out of asanas. And in this book, he shows you how. He also has alot of information on diet and nutrition, which many yoga books don't. His book is filled with so much information. I am co-director of Seaside Yoga, and I strongly recommend this book to all of our students that come to our studio. It has something for everybody and for every level."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"Mastering The Secrets is a great read covering everything from poses to nutrition and lifestyle. Pretty easy and user friendly languaging and helpful pictures to boot. Dougs style has a very natural and invigorating flow which I liken to yoga meets tai-chi.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"This is a wonderful book. There are easy to follow instructions for all levels. Doug has developed an inspirational, multidimensional, and transformational approach--Sadhana Yoga--to a 5,000 year old tradition.

This book will make you want to study with him."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"Having been practicing Yoga for only a year, I am picking up books left and right trying to find some that help me to incorporate the spirit of what I learn in class with my own private study. This book does just that. I was lucky enough to attend one of Doug's workshops in Pensacola, and this book does a really good job of explaining the concept and practice of &quot;flow&quot;. I have visited visited many studios and been lucky enough to find one that truly centers on the concept of spirituality versus exercise. I search for this &quot;feel&quot; when I am searching for good yoga books. Doug's ability to effortlessly float through vinyassas is perfectly translated and easily understandable in this book. I consider it essential to my book collection and would strongly reccomend it. It really was a wonderful way to interpret and review the wonderful experience of Doug's classes."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"Doug Swenson - Author MSYFIn writing this book...my goal was to support and enhance all different styles of yoga practice through the use of a unique wholistic approach.

I have named this new Style of Yoga - \\"Sadhana Yoga Chi\\" which means - (Practice Quest - Union of Energy) - We are all different and have a variety of interest, goals and dreams...yet our common interest is yoga. All those who actually read this book will find the words and concepts to touch their heart, mind and practice in a positive way.

The author, who has been practicing yoga for over 30 years, has devised a new style of beautifully sequenced postures in such a unique and wonderfully flowing manner that you just seem to glide effortlessly along. There are clear instructions and inspiring photographs for complete beginners through to the very advanced and a lot more .. pranayama, meditation, cross-training information and a great section on nutrition. Overall, I think this is an excellent guide; clearly and beautifully written, offering a complete holistic approach to your practice and life."},{"Title":"Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow","review":"Not only are the vinyasas at once fresh and yogically sound, the chapter on nutrition is wonderful. Doug encourages us to move gently into a whole or possibly raw food diet by first starting out with juicing. He emphasizes raw juices and a diet of almost 70% raw foods in a do-able way. How many yoga books have new information in them? They can introduce and inspire us to read the sacred texts, and that's important to us all. But as far as asana and pranayama go, at best, we can discover innovative vinyasas and sequences, and this is what Doug delivers. Plus, he demonstrates them beautifully! Doug has successfully created a whole body system for someone not new to yoga, but possibly new to wholistic health. This is a great addition to my yoga book library."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"I found it really hard to follow his writing style - and also found that most of the book is comprised of emails that he sent out to hundreds of friends and family members to keep them updated. The story is remarkable and Wong is to be commended, but I can't honestly say that I walked away having learned or experienced anything."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"I love reading thrillers, medical mysteries/marvals, true life and social history. This book has it all. It's a fascinating read that doesn't let you stop the ride until you've laughed, cried, sighed and sung."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"That pretty much sums up this very readable book. I was a little put off at first by BD's unusual writing style, but once I grew accustomed to it, I felt very connected to his experiences. His personality shines through. He is as articulate and creative in his writing as he is as a performer. I basically sat on the subway and cried through the whole book, and found myself looking at things in whole new ways - through BD's eyes, I guess. Jackson is a lucky little dude to have such parents (and followers!)."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"First of all, I must say I have NEVER read anything like this book. I find this book very hard to categorise, as it's not exactly a memoir and not quite a journal ... it's a diary of thoughts, musings, worries, soliloquies, rants and observations, a stream of consciousness that the author has poured out through the medium of e-mail, then gathered together here in this volume.This is a very honest book, as the author bares his soul to the world. You will hear Wong being selfish, paranoid, afraid, but he acknowledges and faces up to these emotions. You will pick up his guilt as he is forced to fulfil work obligations on a movie project and the HBO TV show 'Oz', endlessly jetting between sets and visiting his son throughout his first crucial months, and you can taste his self-disgust, sweetened by his awe as he gives Jackson his first bath, or feels tiny fingers squeeze his. There is also a fine thread of humour running throughout the narrative, sometimes dark, often self-deprecating, but never inappropriate.As you are drawn into the book, you will pick up little asides about what he feels about his career, witness his strong love and appreciation for his family and friends, catch glimpses of his private life (hosting dinner parties in his Manhattan apartment for the likes of Alfred Molina), and awe at the miracle of the little ball of life that was now his responcibility. You learn a lot about the Wong behind the camera, who, completely unlike any of his screen or stage roles, is by turns manically obsessive or laid back and completely affable.The style of the book is, well, all over the place, but in a deliberate, Iain Banks sort of a way. His writing techniques, though myriad, are beautifully written and employ an often striking way of emphasising particulr words or moments.The book comprises the e-mails in which he circulated 'news bulletins' to friends and family, and the return messages of support from friends and well-wishers, but there are also poems, there are lyrics to songs, and there are clinical explanations of the ordeals of his child, all presented by the author in endlessly inventive typefaces and font sizes.Above all else, anyone who reads this book will have no doubt that Jackson Foo Wong is lucky to have parents like Richie and B.D. Wong. These guys are just so full of love and postive energy and a dawning appreciation of everything they have. I somehow felt it was a privilege to read this book and get a peek into these lives."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"It's so full of drama that it feels like an episode of ER, but it's REAL LIFE! The story of the trials and tribulations of B.D. Wong's (&amp; Richie's) twin sons being born is told with humor, heart, and every kind of emotion. I COULDN'T PUT THE DAMN THING DOWN! You'll be drawn in immediately. If you have children, or want to have children someday, it's a beautiful book. I usually hate this cliche, but it truly did make me laugh outloud, and cry my eyes out. B.D.'s not just a wonderful actor, but a great writer, too."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"So, after finishing the wild ride/read on 3 different plane trips and stops at several coffee shops. I was crying, laughing, experiencing a roller coaster of emotions and everything else of this intense, personal family story. I kept having to stop to wipe away tears or suppress laughter in the very pulic spaces that I read the book. I guess B.D. can write as well as act. All of us can thank this family for sharing their experience...and making us all realize that alternative or traditional families are the same.

It shows B. D. Wong to be more than just a talented actor. He displays a unique humanity and virtue which causes the reader to want to meet him in person and have a chat."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"This book is remarkable. I could, literally, not put it down and then was disappointed when I finished it. It is a real life, soul revealing, sad, funny, inspirational story. I feel that my life is richer for having read it. I am quite picky when it comes to how I spend my time, especially with regard to reading and I would read this again without hesitation.I was recommended it because I just lost someone close to me through death and this book allowed me to grieve openly and fully for my loss and for all loss.This book made me proud to be human. I await more from B.D. Wong."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"a perspective, from a single woman, with no children-yet:Believe it or not, this book is one of my birthday presents to myself, to help improve the quality of my life.BD has helped me become a better woman. Hopefully, I will also become more responsible, as well. Hopefully, I will be better to cope with life's emotional issues, and handling them better.That's what drew me to the book.You see, while growing up, many, many people automatically assume that any given person should be able to handle anything thrown at them. You ask those around you for help, or you are impacted by something trumatic, and those around you automatically assume that you're tough enough to go through it, by yourself. Many a time, I would go through life, and not tell of my problems, because I felt that those around me would make the problem worse - or blame me for it.Some of us have a harder time getting through things. To say &quot;get over it&quot;, is a cruel thing to say. I feel that sometimes, those saying such a thing, are really digging deeper into the mess, and allow for things to continue to spiral downward.I feel that this book allows people to communicate, in ways that go beyond the core scope of what the book was essentially written about.I find it ironic that 2 men, sharing their account of parenting, pregnancy, and love with the world, including me, would have more of an impact on me, than that from any woman, since I have never received this type of insight from women.I shouldn't have to get this type of insight about childrearing, etc., from men. However, I am indebted to BD and Richie, nonetheless.You see, women have this thing out there, where they feel that they don't like sharing, esepcially when it comes to things like child-birth and pregnancy. It's like this secret, kept to hurt those women coming up in the world. Growing up, you ask your female relatives about such things, details inolved, and those female relatives keep quiet!Women do not share everything, contrary to popular belief.Needless to say, this is one of the first things that has impacted me, while reading the book.The other is, of course the trauma, and roller coaster that BD talks about.Some of the things mentioned, bring me back to the trials in my life.I am thankful for the book, and the impact that the book has on my life."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"What an amazing book, great read, I reccomend everyone read this book."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"When I saw this book, I just had to read it. Not because of who the author was or that he was gay, but because he LIVED what I was LIVING. Mr. Wong's book is the ONLY book about NICU babies that I would suggest as a MUST READ for critically premature parents! It doesn't help you understand the medical terms, it helps you understand YOU, as a parent of a tiny ray of life in a plastic box.I lost a premature daughter (Mary) at 23 weeks, eleven months after that my second premature baby (Julia)was born at a whopping 28 weeks. I still was grieving Mary's death while trying to stay \\"upbeat\\" and \\"positive\\" about my Julia in the NICU. I joked, I laughed, but I hid A LOT of emotions. Everybody tells you how strong you are, what a brave person you are, while inside you are screaming \\"WHY MY CHILDREN!?!\\". You feel like you are the ONLY person in the world who feels that way.Well, Mr. Wong's book is the ONLY book I have read that made me feel like I wasn't going crazy. He not only addressed the issues of being a parent of a NICU baby, but losing a child, and the realities of coping with that loss while being exatically happy your child has made a huge accomplishment (She either pooped, or ate half a teaspoon of breastmilk... major things in a NICU).His humor at the most critical of times is very similar to how I dealt with things when the dr.s would say... \\"Well, Julia had a good day today, she only stopped breathing twice, and oh, by the way, her blood levels show she may need a transfustion, etc.\\"Life in the NICU is like constantly waiting for the shoe to drop! And when it does, it is usually a size 15 triple E!I would love for Mr. Wong to do a follow up to his book, maybe \\"Following Foo, The Early Years\\". Julia is now 18 months old, and we are dealing with Early Intervention, Boston Children's Hospital, Weight issues, and Mom (or Dad) going nuts trying to keep it all in check. I would dearly love to hear some advice. Plus, I fell in love with his adorable son in this book and would love to know how he is doing!"},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"...It was on this evening that the actor/singer B.D. Wong and his talent agent partner, Richard Jackson, became fathers in Modesto, CA. Their twin sons were born woefully, dangerously, nearly 3 months premature. Over the next several months, Wong kept his ever increasing list of friends informed of the roller coaster progress, the ups and downs, through a series of emailed updates. These introspective, mesmerizing, hopeful, honest emails got passed around, and have been compiled to create this book. At times it elicits chuckles, sometimes you will thank god for unsung heroic healthcare workers, and at other times your eyes will well up with tears. The book is an adventurous journey into fatherhood, Jewish and Chinese American families, medical miracles, social work, gynecology, as well as sprinkling asides into life in television and film acting, food, and parenting.The words are presented in a variety of fonts and styles to add drama to the reading. Graphics from the Milton Bradley games of Operation and Ka-boom also drive home some messages. Wong also includes some of the songs he wrote, such as his ode to Poop.The book is impossible to put down, as you hunger to learn whether first-born Boaz Dov Wong (Boaz: the swift, strong, hospitable, giving biblical character who rescues Ruth and fathers the line of King David; Dov: the quiet strength of a peaceful bear) and younger Jackson Foo Wong (Jackson/Yohanan: for his father's surname, graciousness of god; Foo: wealth, for his grandfather) will survive and thrive. At the end of each update, Wong includes snippets of the emails responses he received from friends, family, nurses, and doctors, including other famous celebrity/parents, such as Joel Gray, Jane Kazmarek, Barbara Barry, Margaret Cho, Michelle Kwan, and John Lithgow. David Hirson, a playwright, wrote it best when he repsonded in an email to Wong, that each bulletin [was] \\"...melancholy, funny, spirited, rallying, sometimes buoyant, sometimes exhausting...\\" For readers who need linear stories, start with Update 8; all other can begin with the Preface."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"Following Foo is actor and writer B.D. Wong's account of the saga of his and his partner Richie's decision to have a child through surrogacy, and how that choice came to beautiful and heart wrenching fruition through the premature birth of twin boys Jackson (Foo) and Boaz. Oh, but it is so much more than a chronological recap of events in the process of pregnancy, birth and nurturing. It is a window into the daily and hourly emotional upheavals that attend the impending birth of a child (in this case, children)as well as the joys and sorrows experienced by loving parents and dedicated medical professionals as they join in the struggle to nurture new life. Moreover, this exceptional work is a moving tribute to the human spirit exemplified in the courage of two beautiful souls, Jackson and Boaz. Mr. Wong captures the very essence of the human capacity and need for love in this warm, often times humorous, always compelling work. A significant portion of the book is composed of supportive e-mails from friends and family. While at first glance, this might seem a distraction, it is actually an integral and enjoyable part of the journey, which serves not only to lighten the tension that is so ever present in the struggle for survival that all premature infants undergo and so effectively communicated to the reader by Mr. Wong, but it also serves to show a beautiful community of love and concern that was empowering and life-affirming. This superbly paced narrative is intelligent , whimsical and keenly observant of the human condition. It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"What strikes me most about Following Foo is the amazingly creative writing style of Mr. Wong. Through his words I was immersed into the emotions, minds, and lives of he and his family. Not only did I get to learn what happened in this incredible true story but I actually felt some aspects of the pain and joy that these brave people experienced. This is an incredible feat of writing. Mr. Wong communicates his feelings in words to totally move me. There I was on a plane reading the book, one minute crying, next laughing out loud. Those around me, each in their own time, all inquired as to the nature of the book, having watched me for several hours. Mr. Wong captivates the emotions of the reader through his moments of happiness and grieve, laughter and pain, all within the snap of a finger. Sure the book is a tribute to parenthood and Gay life, but it is far more than that. Through words he captures the dream of life. I really felt as though I was living through parts of the story! I was so moved by the book and the atmosphere that Mr. Wong creates that I can only but jump up and down with joy and gratitude that he choose to share with the world this story. He really opens his heart and mind to the world through this book. I wait with baited breath for the next written work by the author (although I would be most thankful if it were not such a difficult true story for the author to write about). Mr. Wong may have long been a noted as an accomplished and acclaimed actor. Through his book he certainly has earned the title of author extraordinary. It is rare indeed for an author's first book to be so excellent. Finally, much of the book is a compilation of e-mails written by the author to his loved one as updates during the events of his life. Much to my surprise the web site is actually real and a most delightful accent to the book. Buy it, read it, laugh and cry through and with it. You will not be disappointed. I would not be surprised if someday it is required reading for college courses.

Just when I thought all would go well, there was a shocking, and very emotional story that happened in the ICU step down area. BD Wong is a remarkable father who told a very difficult story. I was lucky enough to get to see BD read at &quot;Books Inc.&quot; in San Francisco last week. His reading brought even deeper meaning and emotions to the book for me. I would recommend this book to EVERY parent."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"I just finished reading \\"Following Foo: The Electronic Adventures of the Chestnut Man\\" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having just read another book called \\"Gay Dads: A Celebration of Fatherhood\\", I felt that these two works perfectly compliment each other. \\"Gay Dads\\" gave 21 examples of gay men who wanted to have children and the ways they expanded their families. This story is an extension of that theme, showing the unexpected problems that can crop up in any birth. There is no guarantee, no matter how much you fantasize about the birth of child, that the stork will have a smooth landing and bring a baby that is perfectly formed, completely healthy and on time. B. D. Wong and his partner, Richie, learn this first hand when their twins, carried by a surrogate, come very early and riddled with complications. Wong, an actor in television programs such as \\"Oz\\" and \\"Law and Order: SVU\\", is obviously a creative man that uses email as a way to reach out to friends an family to update them on the progress of the baby (one twin, sadly dies shortly after birth). He soon receives responses from many people, giving him words of encouragement and showing a great deal of love for the tiny little boy trying his hardest to stay in this world with his two stressed out and loving dads. This book reveals what a serious undertaking parenting is and how dedicated and trying it can be. I'm not a parent but I certainly felt for these two men as they struggled with the constant health issues and feared for the life of their little tyke. There are lots of interesting responses and some are from familiar names: John Lithgow, Margaret Cho and Michelle Kwan, to name a few. But it is little Jackson that is the star in these pages and you find yourself drawn into his world, breaking out the pom poms and cheering \\"Go, Jackson GO!\\" A great book for any parent (gay or straight)....actually a good read for anyone!

But, once into the book, you are drawn into the world at the NIC unit. You see what is happening as if you were there experiencing it. To see the raw emotion, experience the day to day happenings is to fall in love with the little life that is so fragile at this stage. Then on the other level you see how much love is shared, how everyone is drawn to this family. And yes, it is a family just like any other. I keep going back to the book and reread passages - when after a bath, little Jackson has a breathing problem, you read the \\"prayer\\" that BD Wong has going through his head. You get so imvolved that you actually feel emotionally exhausted after you put the book down. I so hope for more books by this particular author! Bravo!

Remarkably, the writing is so immediate, you'll find yourself holding your breath. It's not just stories BD wrote to his family and friends to keep everyone posted on the latest developments, it's a love letter from a parent to his children; a sweet, scary, tough, funny, emotionally exhilarating memoir. Jackson's email musings are some of the most original and satisfying passages. You will believe you are inside his head. Looking at the picture of the quarter in Jackson's hand, and the picture of him now, you'll suddenly appreciate the depth of the drama in this book."},{"Title":"Following Foo: (the electronic adventures of The Chestnut Man)","review":"An awesome tale every parent should read.

For me, Sense and Sensibility is another classic and classy example of this master at work. While not as complex to read as something like Shakespeare, the formal language and speech of the nineteenth century is more subtle and difficult for many modern readers, it's not a fluffy beach book. I think it does the modern-day reader good to read a story that requires one to slow down and savor the words and the subtleties of interactions as well written by a great author. This is your chance.Read the book and then watch a movie version- such as the one with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. You could do the same for Pride and Prejudice, but for that movie version I highly recommend the A&E; version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.

I wrote a letter of complaint to the publisher, but received no reply."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was first published in 1811, although it appears that Jane Austen had worked on various versions of the novel since the 1790's. It is less polished than the later, classic \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it contains all the familiar elements we expect and enjoy in an Jane Austen novel.The novel is built around the two Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, whose contrasting styles are the \\"sense and sensibility\\" of the title. Elinor is the elder sister, patient, considerate and practical. Marianne, on the other hand, knows no halfway love of anything in life.As the story opens, their father has just died, leaving the family estate to his son by a first marriage and his second wife and three daughters in near destitution. The widow and three daughters move to a small cottage on the estate of a distant kinsman in Devonshire. Elinor leaves behind the cherished Mr. Edward Ferres, a shy but loyal and seemingly compatible friend, who has however strangely not offered marriage to Elinor. The beautiful Marianne attracts two suitors soon after their arrival in Devonshire, the older, sober and respectable Colonel Brandon, and the young, handsome, and charming Mr. Willoughby. Willoughby wins Marianne's heart, and an engagement is expected momentarily.To Marianne's immense disappointment, Willoughby unexpectedly departs for London without proposing. The two sisters are persuaded to travel with an aunt to London to take part in the social scene. In London, the sisters will learn shocking news about their respect suitors, and each will learn to cope with the help of the other. The journey back to Devonshire will set the stage for dramatic developments for Elinor and Marianne.Austen's sense of dialogue and ability to set up scenes staging are less acute in \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" than in later novels, but she makes up for it by a more emotional approach to the characters and some savage if indirect commentary on the social customs of the day. Those readers whose introduction to the story is the excellent 1995 movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" will find a longer, more subtle, and complex story in Austen's novel. This novel is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is about the Dashwood girls Elinor and Marianne.The time is the Napoleonic years of the nineteenth century though nothing so sordid as the little Corporal's baleful visage will appear in this novel of domestic romance. The girls are forced to leave their home following the death of their father. The estate they live at is invaded by their dullard half brother John and his insufferable wife. The two girls, their mother and younger sister Margaret are off to the West of England to live at Barton Cottage being supported by John the brother.In this novel Miss Jane Austen tells two convoluted love stories. Elinor who is the oldest and most sensible of the girls is in love with Edward Farrars. Farrars is an Oxford man who eventually goes into the ministry. He has been involved in a longterm engagement to the odious but ambitious Lucy Steele. Elinor is heartbroken at this lost love but keeps her stiff upper lip in order to minister to the needs of her younger and more emotional sister Marianne.Marianne is in love with the rake Willoughby who has had a torrid affair with Eliza Williams. He jilts Marianne but lives to rue his rejection of her.As in all Austen novels all is resolved with a wedding. Elinor will eventually wed Edward Farrars and live in a parsonage. Her sister Marianne will become Mrs. Brandon as she weds an older and wiser manColonel Brandon.Along the way we meet the lovable Mrs. Jennings, the fautous Steele sisters and Robert Ferrars the stupid brother of Edward Ferrars. Mr. and Mrs. Palmer are also satirically viewed as a dull married couple living in luxury.It amazes me that no one in a Jane Austen novel really works! As Emma Thompson who directed the film \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" quipped one wonders why these women don't go out and get a job! In an Austen novel there are the inevitable long walks and conversations, mixed romantic signals with mixups aplenty and the occasional dance across the ballroom floor.Austen can be tedious and it can be a challenge to keep up with the characters and conversations. She is a great artist with a very narrow focus; a few middle class families living in the country with a love story to be told. Within this baliwick she is peerless, witty and wise. She brings a few hours of quiet where the only sound heard is a bird singing or a carriage rumbling up to the house.Sense and Sensibility published in 1811 is a classic of English literature. Jane Austen is unsurpassed in the realm of Regency romance!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have recently read the novel Sense and Sensibility for an English class project. It was a great love story but it was a very difficult book to read. I wasn't used to reading books that were written many years ago in that type of writing so it took me some time to understand some things.I love to read love stories and dream about how my life will turn out. Jane Austen did a good job of writing this love story. I think it was so sweet how Colonel Brandon loved Marianne since the moment he met her and in the end, they were together. I was also very happy about Edward and Elinor that they loved each other and another engagement was about to keep them from ever being together but thankfully things worked out.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a great reader or used to Jane Austen's writing. Otherwise, I suggest you just go out and rent the movie becuase it pretty much follows right along with the book and it was very good."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have fallen in love with it.

Absolutley stunning!!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" is a masterpiece. It's greatness and universality, besides it's pure entertainment value, can be extolled all day long. So its very easy, when you are dealing with a masterpiece, to lean on clich&eacute;s to describe a work.But I don't want to do that. I will, however, tell you that for young romantics who believe in Mr. Right and long walks on the beach, this novel takes you through the breathtaking ride of falling, captively, into love and falling, quite willfully, out. Also, you vicariously experience the emotional stupor of coming out on the other side of such a relationship exhausted...and wiser. Also, if you're like me, you can wrestle with the tale of a woman who believes in the security of decisiveness. Her conflict is how to be sensible in an insensible world, and then, finally, how to reconcile the whimsicleness in herself. Where does the mind retreat and the heart take over? \\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" lastly is a tale for sisters. A truly unique relationship, Jane Austen captures the complexity of sisters--persons, peers even, that are equipped with the same tools in life but that often are very different. And despite these differences, share an eternal bond that can only be severed by themselves. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is worth the time and money any day."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Unfortunately, this is one of those novels that depend on style to carry its weight, so after seeing the movie and discovering beforehand what was to happen, the book was a bit bland (though through no fault of the author's).

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash.

There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

Postage was fast. A great transaction. Thank you."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Though not as dazzling in wit as Pride and Prejudice or as passionate a love story as Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility gives the modern reader a true feeling of what it would be like to be a woman of limited means falling in love at a time when Romance was a matter of public discourse. In Regency England, many Britons hailed Samuel Johnson, Isaac Newton, and philosophers of the Enlightenment as voices of reason and logic who relied on empirical data rather than religion or emotion to support their assertions. Perhaps as a reaction to this matter-of-fact and somewhat dry philosophy, there arose a movement called Romanticism which hailed instinct, spontaneity, and feelings over careful analysis. While ostensibly a novel about two sisters' journey to love, Sense and Sensibility is also an extended metaphor comparing the competing intellectual philosophies of Reason and Romance.The title Sense and Sensibility is confusing to many modern readers due to the words' virtually identical meanings in today's vernacular; however, in Regency England, \`sense' was synonymous with 'logic' while \`sensibility' meant something more along the lines of \`sympathy.' In the case of the novel, Elinor Dashwood is a woman of sense whose attitudes toward love are so rational that they leave the reader (and her sister Marianne) wondering if she is capable of falling in love at all. Marianne, by contrast, is so in love with the idea of love (as sensationally depicted in literature and the arts) that she is quite literally swept off her feet without understanding the character of the object of her affection. As the story progresses, Elinor and Marianne must deal with the not always pleasant consequences of their very different approaches to love.Although the novel focuses on the two sisters, Austen supplies the reader with plenty of entertaining supporting characters. While Fanny's calculating manipulation of her husband John Dashwood results in the impoverishment of the Dashwood girls, it also provides the reader with an entertaining twist on the classic stereotypes of the evil sister-in-law and the henpecked husband. Likewise, Mrs. Jenkins' always uncomfortable references to husband hunting make the reader squirm in her chair, even as Sir John Middleton's endless commenting on hounds elicits eye-rolling.The men of the novel do not disappoint, either. Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon all portray characteristics that make them worthy of the heroines' attentions, though they are quite the diverse crowd. The reader may even find her own attitudes towards love deepen and evolve as she reacts to the dashing Willoughby, steadfast Brandon, and thoughtful Edward.In sum, this novel is beautifully written and well worth reading at least once, if not several times."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"A story of two sisters who search for marriage partners. What is nice about Jane Austen is the quality and quantity of conversation, so that the reader imbues a sense of the 1800s among the countrified gentry. The memorable characters run the gamut from respectable, cultured Colonel Brandon to his opposite John Willoughby, who is out for a good-time with the ladies. The lady between them is Marianne Dashwood--inexperienced, beautiful, artistic, and idealistic. She is lovingly censured for her candor and romanticism by her older sister, Elinor Dashwood--rational, proper, loyal, and stoic. Before they marry an appropriate partner, a whirlwind of misjudgments, gossip, and surprises threatens to upset their chances at happiness."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is about a family of women: Mrs. Dashwood, the mother, and Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, the three daughters, who are made to relocate as a result of their father's death. Their home is given to their gullible half-brother who means well and their manipulative sister-in-law who does not mean well at all. Settling in a cottage given to them by a generous distant relative in Devonshire, the girls experience romance and heartbreak.I've heard of Jane Austen's work before, and I read this as a prelude before I read Pride and Prejudice. I have to say, even though it was engaging towards the end, in the beginning I had trouble plowing through the introduction. There was nothing there to grasp my interest, only long, insipid descriptions of the surrounding countryside, and a long build-up to the main plot. About halfway through, when Marianne begins her romance with Willoughby, I actually found myself wanting to read the book and thinking with excitement and a feeling of suspense about what would happen next.The characters weren't perfect, with both flaws and redeeming qualities, such as Elinor, who is very intellectual and polite, but may be missing out on life because she's very reserved, and Marianne, who likes to live life to the fullest emotionally, but is completely devastated when bad things happen to her.I liked that it gave me a feel of what life was like for people in the moderate and upper end class in the early 1800's, as I'm used to stories such as Oliver Twist, where the main subject is life in the low slums, so it was nice to see the other end for a change. In regard to the storyline, it was very interesting in the latter part of the book, when its it is full of romantic betrayal and unseen engagements, and people turning up unexpectedly.This was a good introduction to Jane Austen's books, but based upon to the admiration she has received, I don't believe this is her best, and I'm ready to see what she can do in Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Not as good as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" of the same author, although some chapters are brilliant.

Sense and Sensibility describes the trials and tribulations of the young Dashwoods who strive to keep their senses about them despite the dramatic flurry of relationships. There are a number of wonderfully entertaining characters, including Ms. Jennings with her loud squawking and gossiping, as well as the Steeles. And, of course, she neatly wraps up the ending as always.Jane Austen is simply brilliant in conveying the idea that indeed, sense and sensibility may not always guarantee happiness and certainly, neither can money and matches of material gain. More was gained than was lost- both knowledge and true happiness were the result of simply answering to the heart and not to the powers that be who called for marriage on the basis of dowry. The Dashwoods, for all their gentleness, sincerity, and society, certainly deserve all of the contentment and satisfaction which can be afforded to them.Anyone who is looking for a cozy book and craving some entertainment and emotional support from a relationship- this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"...It is a suggestion in the way that you read this book.

I did it backwards and I wish I had staved off watching the film all the way through...I began my S&S; journey by discovering characters through Mamma Mia, of all places. The groom in the movie, Dominic Cooper, was intriguing to me, so I looked him up and guess who he turned out being? None other than Mr. John Willoughby himself. From there I was hooked on the youtube.com 2007 BBC version and HAD to read the book because I just knew there were holes in the story!The first few chapters of the book were hard to get through, but I had Willoughby's smouldering eyes to keep me going. I read a few chapters, then listened to the chapters over again. I found the audiobook for free on iTunes, under a section by Southern Florida University called Lit2Go. It helped IMMENSELY that the reader had an English accent because the colloquialisms came right through and there were many \\"aha!\\" moments.When I finished both, I bought the DVD of S&S; (BBC version) and I will be purchasing/renting the Kate Winslet version soon.

And, now that I think of it, the story is not very much fast-moving. The story lacks of excitement and it drags in every scene. As in, there seems to be a lot of time spent in reading about a particular scene where nothing much actually happened. All in all, this book did not make me read it for a second time.

Sense and Sensibility is in fact interesting, but lacks something. The ending is disappointing, and overall, it wasn't nearly as good as Emma."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Although this book is not about the two sisters of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the primary characters are two sisters (which will remind you of Jane and her sister), Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Again, as in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the underlying theme is marriage. There is a lot of misunderstanding due to partial, or erroneous, information. The sense and sensibility is shown in how the sisters handle the different predicaments.The cast includes, among others, the sisters, Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and John and Fanny Dashwood.This edition has the complete text and not much else. The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book. There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult. It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.I do recommend this book.

At every moment of the book vanity is criticized, from its opening to its ending. Many of the characters, even if not actively participating in the story, are vain as they can be.In the very opening of the book, as Mr. Dashwood passes, there is the interference of Mrs John Dashwood , who, in the fear of losing part of her wealth ans status, has her husband, a weak character, reduce the pension that he had promised his dying father that he would provide to his half-sisters.When Edward Ferrars declines to wed Miss Morton, Mrs John Dashwood quickly sets a fit and expells his future sister-in-law from her house due to her disapproval to that engagement that is, in their views, less than favourable. Edward also falls victim to the rest of his family , who disconsiders him as a member of the family due to his choices.Willoughby is another example. In love with Marianne, he chooses to marry a rich woman who will provide him of his extravagances (as he himself later admits) than to open his heart to true love. He is also an example of cruelty, for he leaves a young girl he had earlier seduced to her own luck.A last exaple will be Lucy Steele. Fearful of what might happen to her, she is secretly engaged to Edward Ferrars, but leaves him for his own brother who can provide her comfort in a better way.Although vanty is not exactly the theme of Sense and Sensibility , it is at every moment of the book criticized, and vanity in its own way supports the plot."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"It takes little time for the reader to become completely engrossed.

Yet I found myself caught up in the story of two sisters, one levelheaded(sometimes hiding her emotions) and the other very dramatic. This is a tale of sisters who struggle to learn what love is truly about and of their unending loyalty to each other.What made the book interesting to me were the notes added by the editors. They included Historical and cultural details, information on Jane Austen's life, references to Sense & Sensibility in films, an unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters and themes of faith drawn from the novel and Jane Austen's life. I actually caught myself laughing out loud as I read some of the side notes. The comments helped lighten the tone of the book and made it painless and even fun to read.

The love and loyalty between the sisters is astounding, but they do not understand each other. Elinor is a quiet, sensible and sensitive young lady cheerful and putting others first. Marianne is just the opposite. She has a quick temper, speaks before thinking, is often rude and is full of herself. Her wishes and desires come first regardless of who is hurt.The family lives in late 18 century England where a person is judged by breeding and wealth, looking down on the working class. Circumstances change in the sisters lives and they are forced to move from the family homer to the country. Their half-brother has good intentions as to their welfare, but is overruled by his wife. Through the goodness of a distant cousins and friends, the sisters remain in polite society. Both have feelings for two gentlemen of the upper class, but whose feelings do not appear to be in their favor or any chance of marriage. What transpires in the lives of Elinor and Marianne along with their friends leads to some interesting conclusions.Jane Austen has always been a favorite author of many. However, this is a reprint of the original book first published around 1811. The trivia and notes that highlight this \\"Insight Edition\\" in the right margin is very distracting, and at times I found the story rambling without anything worthwhile being said.Jane Austen fans who want to reread the book will, no doubt, purchase the reprint for the interesting trivia, but I found it very hard to follow, due to the inserts in the margin, and to only hold my attention for short periods of time.This book was provided by the publisher for review."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"If you love Jane Austen, you will love this edition of Sense and Sensibility.I admit I was at first a little skeptical of reading an \\"insight edition\\" as often I have found, in the past, insights to be annoying and often detract from the story. That is not the case in this edition of Sense and Sensibility. I found most of the insights to be very helpful and often amusing.This timeless classic is brought to life in even greater detail through the insights included in this version. It includes many fascinating details from Jane Austen's own life which help explain her perspective on many different situations. Many of the insights have to do with bringing the rich cultural details out to a generation who may not immediately relate to life and places in the early 1800's.For those who have loved (or even hated) the many movies and mini-series' based on this book, you will find frequent comparisons, applause, and criticisms of the film versions.The faith that is evident, though not always clearly, is brought out and given Scriptures references for throughout the book. I found these very interesting as I had never thought of Sense and Sensibility as a Christian book before.This is definitely a book all Jane Austen aficionados will love.

Some things are just meant to be cherished and savored.While I have taken the time to do a little research on Austen's life and works, I was curious about the new Insight Edition of Sense & Sensibility by Bethany House Publishers. The Insight Edition seeks to provide readers with a deeper level of understanding of Austen's world and that of her famous characters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. No \\"Googling\\" required.This recently published version provides clever trivia and tidbits which are sprinkled throughout the margins of the book. Also included is a helpful Quick Guide that acts as a key for deciphering the note's symbols, and a Questions for Conversation section that can be used for book club discussions.While I admit to feeling almost giddy with anticipation over this book, I found myself feeling a bit disappointed by some of the commentary. I was very interested in both the historical and cultural notations, but I really didn't care to read what felt like an overabundance of \\"opinion\\". For example, \\"Mrs. Dashwood would've loved HGTV.\\" {page 33} To me, that felt completely unnecessary. Also the flash of \\"today's society/vernacular\\" while reading a novel set during the early 1800's felt a bit jarring at times.However, the Insight Edition does hold many interesting bits of information that most, if not all, Jane-ites will readily appreciate. I also enjoyed the fresh new cover art, which added a lovely ambiance to this most delicious diversion. :)"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I was excited to receive a free copy of the Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition by Jane Austen($11 .99) from Bethany House!

Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash.

Much, I believe.Austen wrote a book that is very instructive in how people face life and love. Set in a time when many seemed to thrive on that which was deemed genteel and appropriate, but were very superficial, Sense And Sensibility shows the manner in which two (There were several others, but the Dashwood sisters are the two main characters.) sisters dealt with love. Elinor was prudent, careful, and thoughtful (She used sense). Marianne was passionate (Sensibile is the way Austen described her.). They both fell in love, and both were hurt in different ways. In the end, both learned the value of having a balance between careful, well-thought out approaches to love, and a passionate approach to love.The ins and outs of their loves are not too different from our times. Neither are the people. The great difference is in the setting. Human nature remains the same. We can learn much about life from this book.Bethany House Publishers has done the reader a service by providing appropriate historical details, references to various movies based upon the book, and humorous comments along the way.Who would have ever thought that reading a classic could be so much joy!?!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible.

I believe that this can relate to a lot of girls in today's culture. All of the girls in today's culture are always looking for love. They are always seeking for a boyfriend. This book is about two older women who are searching for the love of someone. This book can also relate to the lives of people today because it is about broken hearts and finding the right person. A lot of people today think that the first boy that they date, they are going to marry. That is not true in a lot of cases and that is a lesson that can be learned from this book.This book is about two sisters. Marianne and Elinor are both looking for someone to marry. They are at the age when it is time for them to be married and that is what they want. In the beginning of the book, Elinor has fallen for a man named Edward Ferrars. He is a respectable gentlemen who Elinor falls on love with at first site. When Elinor and her family move away, he promises to come and see them soon. He never comes and only sends a letter. This makes Elinor very upset. While all of this is happening, Marianne meets a man. His name is John Willoughby. He is also very respectable and helps Marianne when she falls down. He carries her home because she cannot walk. This is when it happens. When John meets her family, they instantly like him. He hangs around and is then called out of town. Then, before they know it, Willoughby is called out of town.When the two sisters go into town for a few months, they hear some devastating news. They hear that Willoughby is marrying another woman and so is Edward. This devastates both of the girls and they are in a wreck. In the end, They both ended up getting married. You will have to read the book to see how the end turns out because I don't want to give away the ending for those of you who have not read it yet.In the end, The book was good and I would recommend it to some people. I would not recommend it to all people because as I would put it: \\"The book is a chick flick\\". I would recommend this book to people who like romance and fiction. This book I think would best fit teenage girls. This is what I feel about the book."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"The Kindle edition was well-formatted with only two recurring issues: (1) every 4-5 pages or so, some sentences or phrases were repeated on separate lines near (but not perfectly next to) where they first appeared or were about to appear, but they were easy to spot and ignore; and (2) bracketed numbers appeared occasionally within the text, but it was unclear what they referred to. Content includes table of contents with chapter titles and a somewhat antiquated preface (not by Austen, of course) from the out-of-copyright text.With respect to the content itself, Austen's story and story-telling is amusing and witty, her language is ornate and sometimes a bit tedious, and most (though not all) of the characters are sketched vividly. This was the first Austen book I've read (and the first she published), but I rather doubt it would have remained so popular without the success of her other books; I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or another of her books as a first read.

I caught on pretty fast. The beginning is confusing but afterwards, it makes more sense. Things such as He is very agreeable or five and twenty (25) come up a lot.

Everything from how things were depicted in film adaptations, to what was happening in Jane's real life at the time of her authorship, to giving the context and definition to various phrases and references in the books, the Insight Editions truly give that extra little verve and interest to the classic works. The extras are well written and added with care by a fellow author (Julie Klassen) who has a genuine love and appreciation for Austen's work.Now, of course, Jane Austen stands on her own just fine, but having always been an avid watcher of DVD Bonus Features, the Insight Edition was right up my alley!

I can't remember the last time I had read one of her books, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this book. It even inspired me to rent the 1995 movie with Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant in it.

A widowed mother taking care of three daughters. Being evicted from their home and moves into a relative's home. The daughters all taught that they don't have to marry into money or their social class. They're also encouraged to be well educated in all subjects.Now in the early 1800's, women were not allowed to own property. They didn't have civil rights that we do now. So when Henry Dashwood dies, the successor of all of Henry's property is John Dashwood (son by Henry's first marriage). Henry's second wife, Mrs. Dashwood (40 y.o.), is forced to find another place for herself and her 3 daughters. John Dashwood is a man who allows his wife to manipulate him. He wants to do right and follow his father's dying wish, but the spoiled wife convinces him otherwise.The title \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was not Austen's original decision. None the less, the title is an example way English teachers want for comparison and contrast essays. The usage of the two terms are also fitting. In this case, sense refers to Elinor Dashwood. She is the eldest daughter and 19 years old. Elinor is reasonable and reserved toward her feelings. Romanticism is apart of the definition of sensibility. Marianne (the 16 y.o. middle daughter) and Mrs. Dashwood both where their hearts on their sleeves. They rely on their emotions for all the decisions they makes. The youngest daughter, Margaret Dashwood (13), is also romantic but is still young.Mrs. Ferrars, Fanny Dasholwood, and Robert Ferrars believe in social class and high status of wealth. None of them have job or money income. They live off their inheritance and marriage dowries. I was very pleased with Edward Ferrars' decision."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's work is timeless and her writing beautiful, her flow of words, and the unfolding of a story full of interesting and diverse in the personalities.

It has changed the way I look at some things.The author is not overly wordy and keeps the book moving along at a pace well enough to hold the readers' interest."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Still a great book. Has lasted not because of its silly plot turns in romance, but because of its one-dimensional characatures of English society in her time, with the perfect heroine, Elinor, at its core. Everyone else falls into a niche, is a type, but as the satire is at times very pointed, the story is forgiven. What is not so obvious, because Austen was probably not aware of it, is the utter dependence of all these peoples' lives on the servants who support them. These people do nothing. They walk, eat, dress, visit, read, play games and music, and do needlework or write letters. That's it, with an occasional shopping trip thrown in. It is this underlying life, the life of the servants, that is never mentioned. Only one, Thomas, has any lines at all. It beats me how they filled their days. They simply lived to amuse themselves."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sence and Sensibility has neither the clever mystery of Emma or the endearing heroine of Pride and Prejudice. But we all must learn to except that she couldn't top those two novels.That said Sence and sensibility is worth the read for any Austen fan.The Dashwood sisters various dilemas in love make a good story. We don't care for them as much as our beloved Elisabeth and Jane Bennet, but we wish them the very best all the same.Marianne's self-sensure near the end of the novel for the indulgence of her self-pitty and the lack of obsevance of common civility (in contrast to her sister)is not quite as satisfying as Emma's repentance.And sweet sensible Eleanor is just not as witty or charming as Elisabeth. Neither of the girls tempt us with Fanny Prices sweetness or modesty. And none of the love tangles are as interesting, mysterious or hard to figure out as in Emma.And the villians of the piece just don't match up to Mrs. Norris of Mansfield Park, Miss.Bingley of P+P irritates us more than Lucy Steele.Mr.Dashwoods fraternal neglect doesn't spark the indignation of the Bertrams insensitivity and self involvment.We find more dissapointment in Henry Crawfords disgrace than in Willoughbys.It's a great novel in it's own right but just not Austen's finest work. Which considering how good a book it is, should be a great compliment to the author."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811. It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles. Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel. Austen is a romantic writer. In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel. In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood. Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy. While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town. Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother. Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies. Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her. The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility. Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility. She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life. This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them. We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships. People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel. Marianne acts like a typical adolescent. She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts. Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period. She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death. Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This book is an excellent way to see how English society ran hundreds of years ago. The only issue that people will have with the book is that it is written in an older style of English which can be hard to follow."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"A book that has a happy end, and lets you dream of long flowing dresses and dashing gentelmen!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Out of all of Austen's heroine's these two sisters were my favorites, particularily Marianne. I liked this book a lot and swooned as Marianne did over Willoughby! A wonderful classic and most definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This is a story about a family, of a mother and three daughters, as well as their extended family of cousins, step brothers and sisters-in-law and their current love interests. There is selfishness and greed; there are parties and laughter; there is music and books and love; there is heartbreak and deceit. It seems a formula for success.The eldest daughter, Elinor, is the only rational one. Her next sister, Marianne, is a silly, selfish flighty girl who cares nothing of anyone else's problems and wants everyone to focus on her own. The third sister barely gets mentioned, as she is not old enough to fall madly in love with the wrong guy and then make a scene about it when he doesn't love her back.The brother and sister-in-law are greedy and care only about money, even though they have plenty and don't share it with the rest of the family. The cousins are only focused on parties and gaiety and fun.My impression of this book was that they spend the whole time having parties and looking for a husband. They fall in love with men who are unfaithful and they act quite silly about it upon realizing the man doesn\`t love them. The men are all fickle and quite rude about it, pretty much ignoring the girls once they have had enough of them and never communicating with anyone. I almost didn't like them until I recollected that this book was written roughly 200 years ago and times WERE different then. However, I find it hard to relate and also to distance these girls from our modern times. If they were here right now, they would be completely out of place. I would tell them to shut up or to stand up for themselves for God's sakes!This is an era where men and women still marry for money and class. An era where your mother can arrange your marriage to a \\"suitable\\" beau. An era where the women didn't work and then men were landlords as an occupation. It is an era that I do like to read about and would like to understand, but that I have a hard time relating to. Maybe it's Austen's style of writing. Maybe it's just the era.However, for such an old book, it is sometimes amazing how much things really haven't changed. I think this quote still holds true today. \\"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy\\".This one just cracks me up. \\"Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition\\". So she didn't argue with him. She was snubbing him by not giving him the satisfaction of an argument. I love it. What an insult!But the best quote is this one at the end, which redeems Marianne. She finally turns around and realizes that she is not the only person in the world and the learns to respect and care about other people. She realizes that the man she loved when young was worthless and the one who has stood by and loved her for years is priceless.\\"Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give her hand to another!\\"I cannot say I really liked this book as much as I thought I would. From hearing what other people have said, I thought it would be absolutely great. It was just okay. I have found that there are several classics that I feel about this way. Maybe the hype is just too much. My expectations are too high. Or maybe I am just not into this style of book. I will keep trying however.I give it a 3 out of 5. I liked this book but I did not love it."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Not only did I receive my purchase in a timely manner, but I also found the book to be in excellent condition and exactly what I asked for.

Elinor and Marianne fall in love with two men, who end up breaking up with then off and on throughout the book until the end when one of them actually marries one of the men. And it is the most boring piece of garbage ever to be written. I'm going to burn my copy after I'm done with it, which should be soon. This book is for women. Not for a man such as myself.

It is a fun introduction to Jane Austen's books for those new to Austen, and it's just another way to enjoy this classic book and really feel a connection to and a part of the kinds of conversations of \\"Janeites\\" JASNA meetings and book groups.

(Emma first, then Pride and Predjudice.) But Sense and Sensibility is very good on its own if not compared to those two:)Well to begin with Marianne is not as bad as some of the other reviewers have made her out to be. They should take into mind that she spends more than half of the book with her heart most cruelly broken by a man that I fell for just as hard as she did. (Willoughby.... Willoughby!)On a happier note though, there is one man whom I can still love at the end of the book, Edward Ferrars. He is not the wildly romantic man that Willoughby was, but what he lacks in that area he makes up for in others, such as his strength of charachter, his sweetness, and, as another reviewer mentioned, his loyalty. Yes, he is so loyal he almost left my heart broken twice. Luckily, Lucy did one thing right and saved us all from having to see that unhappy arrangement:(Well I really think I've said enough to give you the picture that this story is filled with drama and romance.(For all you that like that sort of thing, I know I do!) Also the romance in this book is completely clean! I definetely appreciate that, and if Jane Austen were here I would thank her for making all of her novels clean, so that girls like me who don't read books filled with trash can enjoy a good love story every once in a while!! :)"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This was my first Jane Austen experience, and it turned out to be mostly what I expected. Flowery writing, wandering storyline, and mostly emotional drama, this is not at all like my typical reading fare. That being said, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was an enjoyable read, with undeniably beautiful prose and often biting social commentary of old British society. While Elinor and Marianne didn't face any life-threatening scenarios or experience any true danger, their experiences trying to attract mates while navigating the social maze of British aristocracy was nonetheless interesting and amusing. The ridiculousness of that society when compared with our norms of today is spectacular. When an entire class is judged by nothing more than the family coffers, and labor seems unthinkable, marriage is of the utmost importance, especially for those unlucky 2nd and 3rd born children who are unlikely to inherit the estate. It seems totally bizarre today, but this kind of thing was apparently the norm a couple of hundred years ago, and is actually quite fascinating to think about (and learn about) while reading this book. And while we still have some elites today, it is hard to imagine the massive social divisions, bigotry, and unequal opportunity of the past. Jane Austen succeeds in her goal of highlighting the wrongs and inconsistencies of old British society. This book is worth the read if you have the time, even if mostly for the stark comparisons it provides with current times."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This was my first Jane Austen book and initially I was unmoved - even bored - by the torturous romantic entanglements of two well-bred Regency young ladies. But the elegant prose, twisting plot and amusing characters won me round.

So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Love Jane Austen!

I am working on collecting them all!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen's first published novel, is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Marianne is young and flirtatious and has very set ideas about what sort of person her true love, her knight in shining armour will be. Elinor, much more restrained, mature and sensible, has quite a different attitude to life and love. Both meet the man they believe is for them, but for neither does the course of true love run smooth. This charming novel has some very likeable characters, as well as a few to despise or disdain, and plenty of muddles, misunderstandings and wrong assumptions. Altogether a delight to read: easy to understand why this is a classic."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This review is my personal commentary on &quot;Sense and Sensibilty&quot; and, as such, explains and analyzes the novel. Eleanor Dashwood, the main character, is an example of a young woman's position in eighteenth century England. Her dependent situation in a typical Pre-Victorian setting introduces the reader to a common stereotype of the times. Miss Dashwood, a prospective bride at the tender age of nineteen, possesses adequate beauty and genteel manners making her attractive to select suitors. Chestnut hair, rosy cheeks, and plump figure serve her well, in accordance with the latest standard of femininity. However, she is a victim of circumstances. Her father's recent death has left the meager dowry of one thousand pounds, which presents the illusion of an unfavorable marriage As there exists minimal monetary gain, any match would be for the companionship of Eleanor alone. The equilibrium of both attractiveness and virtue offers an amiable personality. Although she is reserved almost to the point of appearing indifferent, the case is quite contrary. She sacrifices personal feeling to uphold and protect the reputations of any worthy acquaintance amid slanderous social gossip. These qualities of self-control, prudence, and nobility are exemplified in daily life. Perhaps they are best noted in her treatment of Lucy Steele, an undermining ninny who neither desired nor expected Eleanor's kindness. Eleanor's selflessness is her most outstanding characteristic, as seen in constant care and consideration for those around her. When her own heart is aching under the strain of Edward Ferrars' impending marital rejection, she suppresses it to help her younger sister Marianne heal from Willoughby's own recent announcement to wed another. Even against the incogitant avarice of the former fianc&eacute;s she bears no lasting grudge. The unprejudiced man who seeks Eleanor Dashwood would have to be satisfied on these terms, as they are more precious than fortune, though rarely esteemed in a material world. The conflict of this book that will intrigue most readers is recognized in the title. Sense, comprised of the model attributes of Eleanor, opposes sensibility, a glamorous self-indulgence. It is sensibility that governs the outrageous conduct of Eleanor's and Marianne's former fianc&eacute;s. Lucy Steele, ignorant of Eleanor's affiance to Edward, confides in her of their own secret engagement four years previously. Lucy is beneath the Ferrars family in class and fortune, therefore making their future marriage a disgrace. Willoughby's guise is still worse. He has fathered an illegitimate child with a scoury maid, unconcernedly teasing the affections of many an earnest young woman. Unbeknownst to Marianne, he is currently betrothed to Miss Gray, daughter of a gentleman and recipient of a forty thousand pound dowry. These hindrances, intended for personal amusement, have now blinded them both to true love. The ceaseless appetite of sensibility has devoured their past and is eyeing the present. Will it be allowed to overtake weakened wills? The climax, predictably tragic, is inevitable for such foolish young men. A third party reveals the secret arrangement between Edward and Lucy, thus Mrs. Ferrars' anger resolves her to transfer the inheritance of eldest son to the other brother, Robert. Eleanor is resigned to believe he will wed the luxurious Miss Morton as arranged by his mother. Marianne receives a formal letter from Willougby informing her that any such engagement must be entirely a figment of her clever imagination, a sort of wishful thinking for a girl of her social position. This throws her into a desperate melancholy, which leads to potentially fatal illness. Everyone is at this point unhappy or unfulfilled in his or her expectation of the future. A complicated code of social formality coupled with personal confusion checks the true desires of each.The resolution to all these issues, however, swiftly materializes. Upon learning that Edward would no longer be the endowed heir Lucy desired to marry, her affections quickly change to Robert. Edward then realizes that he never really loved the fickle Lucy, and relies on sense to direct him back to forgiving Eleanor. Willoughby is not so lucky in his domestic outcome. He forgoes personal happiness to marry Miss Gray, as his own fortune has diminished. Ironically, a breach from sensibility occurs after he has taken a pint of liquor, and he confesses his true feelings about Marianne. He acknowledges all that has been lost for the gain of cold, inanimate money. Marianne recovers from her lovesick illness, and marries a family friend who deserves her. All is well in the marrying off of the Dashwood sisters; their fianc&eacute;s attain whatever it is that they desired and deserved in the first place. Despite mishaps and malignancies along the way, sense triumphs over sensibility. I would higly recommend this book to anyone interested in the gentry of the times, or is a fan of Jane Austen. It is truly one of her finest works, set in flowing language and adequate print. The paperback edition is fine for study, but I would select another for one's family library."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility follows the lives of two sisters, Eleanor Dashwood (Sense) and Marianne Dashwood (Sensibility). The story begins when the Henry Dashwood passes away, leaving his estate to his son, who is only half related to the Dashwood sisters. The girls, their younger sister, Margaret, and their mother are obliged to leave and seek residence elsewhere since they are no longer the rightful owners of the Dashwood Estate. Without much money to themselves, and a conniving sister-in-law who keeps their brother from providing them with any income, the family is forced to move miles and miles away near to their obnoxious cousins who have offered to allow a low rent. As if it weren't bad enough having to leave their home, the move brought with it some other negative outcomes. For one, Eleanor had to leave her love, Edward Ferrars (who happens to be the brother of their snobby sister-in-law), and Marianne ends up falling for a man who is not quite what he appears to be. The story follows the lives of the two girls and their tumultuous relationships, as well as their loyalty to one another. Full of twists and turns, broken hearts, reputation-ruining secret, and surprising turns of events, this novel is sure to hold you until the end!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"It's been years since I first read Sense and Sensibility. I was nineteen, and while I loved it back then I've had the feeling that I'd probably appreciate it more as an adult reader. Or who knows, I'll probably end up hating it the second time around. Lucky for me, that wasn't the case. This is definitely not Austen's best work (I'll explain why later), but its simple tale of two sisters who are as different as night and day and how they deal with financial destitution, heartbreak and feelings in general is still wonderful to me after all this time. Those who have read S&S; know that this is the story of the Dashwood women -- a mother and her three daughters -- and how they have to adjust to a new situation after the girls' half-brother inherits their large country estate. The aforementioned readers would also know that the two elder sisters, Elinor and Marianne, fall in love for the first time. Elinor is the oldest and with the most sense, preferring to suffer in silence in order to honor promises and not bring her family unnecessary pain. Marianne, on the other hand, believes in total emotional and passionate abandon. Transparent to a fault, she often ends up hurting and alienating people in her whims and heartbreak. Throw in meddling neighbors, a womanizing cad, a gentleman colonel, a jealous little interloper and you get a story full of intrigue and twists.As said earlier, I love Sense and Sensibility now more than I did thirteen years ago. Austen is one of those writers that draw you in with her sharp wit and satirical look into the society around her. I couldn't put this book down and it proved to be the perfect antidote for my cold and flu. I still think Edward Ferrars is awkward and gutless, Willoughby is a total player (and I so don't feel sorry for him when he explains himself to Elinor. He made his bed, after all. Elinor is far more forgiving than I am), Marianne is whiny and rude and Lucy Steele is probably the nastiest character in the whole book. Mrs. Jennings is still hilarious and I laughed at Austen's ironic narrative. However, this novel is not perfect. There are way too many twists that Austen pulls out at the last pages that strike me as bizarre and like a copout. I won't go into detail in case someone who hasn't read the book is reading this, but those who have read it probably know what I'm talking about. But flaws and all, Sense and Sensibility is still my third favorite Austen (Pride & Prejudice and Persuasion are my two first faves, in that order) and rereading this book was like reuniting with old friends. What a wonderful treat!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"At first I was disgusted with this book; the characters seemed to be mere shadows of characters of P & P and Emma. However, as I continued reading I was pleasantly intrigued by the plot and the characters were more fully developed (although the still are quite similar to P & P and Emma characters). Although I really like P &P and Emma, I would say that their plots and endings were quite predictable. S & S leaves you in suspense and doubt until the last few chapters. A really great read--if you stick with it."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I don't know why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry but the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and only get better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading. The Enriched Classic edition also has excellent notes to help you understand references or words that may be hard to decipher more than 200 years after the book was written and I found this very helpful."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"What happened to me when I first began reading this novel was that at first try I put it back on the shelf because I thought it was dreadfully dull. Little did I know that I just was not ready to read such a classic, much less a Jane Austen piece. But when I decided to give it another chance I realized that I almost passed such a great opportunity to expose myself to how a novel should be. Sense and Sensibility's twisted plot was a treat, and although the movie was somewhat truthful to the text, I still enjoyed the novel much more. I recommend this novel to people who are ready to face Austen's sometimes frusttrating vocabulary, but trust me, you'll be reaping benefits and will love to read this novel again and again!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a remarkable novel. Ostensibly a social comedy centered on romance, this book is really an unusually acute description and analysis of the collision of Enlightenment rationalism (Sense) with the Romantic ideas of the early 19th century (Sensibility). Austen uses the romantic entanglements of 2 sisters to present these contrasting views of life. This is a remarkable way of showing how ideas permeate and influence the life of society as a whole. The plotting, laden with clever irony, is brilliant, and the characters are drawn with Austen's usual insight."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is a story about two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who are as different as night and day. Elinor represents &quot;sense&quot; - thoughtful, considerate and calm, while Marianne is &quot;sensibility&quot;: wild, emotional, and talented. The story opens with the death of Old Mr. Dashwood, who leaves his estate to his nephew Mr. Dashwood (the father of Elinor and Marianne). Mr. Dashwood is about to die as well; he passes the estate to his son by his first wife, John Dashwood. Unfortunately, he has nothing of value to leave his second wife and their three daughters (Elinor, 19-years-old; Marianne, 17; and Margaret, 13), though he does manage to get John Dashwood to promise to look after them. But John Dashwood's selfish wife, Fanny, convinces him to give very little. And so, Mrs. Dashwood moves them to Barton, where they live humbly in a cottage on her distant cousin, Sir John Middleton's, land.Before their move, Elinor had met and fallen in love with Fanny's younger brother Edward Ferrars. But Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars are much too snobby to let their relationship prevail. When they moved to the countryside, the two are further separated. Meanwhile, Marianne's romances are just blossoming in Barton. She gains the admiration of Colonel Brandon, but she prefers young, dashing Willoughby, who helps her home one day when she fell and twisted her ankle. This however proves disastrous, as Willoughby abandons Marianne for wealthy Miss Sophia Grey after a long, intimate friendship. Elinor is also suffering from love-loss. She discovers that Edward had been engaged for four years to Miss Lucy Steele, a distant relative of Mrs. Jennings (Sir John Middleton's mother-in-law). At this point, &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; seem to coincide and we learn that we must have both &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; in a balanced, corroborated manner to have a truly blissful life.The story is very interesting and entertaining, though Austen tended to drone a lot between events. In my opinion, she spent too much time trying to convey Elinor's judgement during parties and other social gatherings (which was wayyyy too often). On the whole, this was a wonderful book, full of fun and surprises (especially at the end!). I highly recommend this book to people at or above the age of 14 (which is how old I am, and I'm telling you it was a bit of a stretch for me - or maybe it was just that I was a little impatient to get my AR reading points). My only advice is have patience, prepare for a lot of rereading (things can get kinda confusing - there were a little too many characters for my comfort), and to watch the movie (fabulous!) afterward. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have read all of Jane Austen's novels at least once, and&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is, at the moment, my favorite,because it was the last one I read. Jane Austen is - and always willbe - my absolute favorite writer. I love the way she can take just an average person and reveal the hero or heroine inside.This is just what she does with Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. The central theme of this novel is not the love between a boy and a girl; it is about the love between two sisters and how they come to a better understanding of each other when they are forced to endure similar situations and handle them in completely different manners.When each sister, through dissimilar circumstances, discovers that the happiness she had believed she would find in marriage is not to be, it at first appears that Elinor is rather cold and heartless - more worried about propriety than feelings - and that Marianne is more in touch with her emotions and would rather express her grief than take into account how her display will affect those who love her...As for the relationship between the sisters, at the beginning, Marianne seems to pity Elinor for her lack of esteem for art and poetry, and she believes that Edward is not worthy of her. Elinor, while seeing the youthful faults of her sister, always keeps a sense of humour and does everything out of love for her and the rest of the family. In the middle, Marianne believes that no one has ever suffered as she, and continues to pity Elinor for her inadequacies...This is a wonderful and deeply moving novel that should be read more than once to be thoroughly understood and appreciated."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sessanbility is one of the greatest novels I have had the pleasure to read.

When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed.

Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense & Sensibility has been reviewed ad infinitum, but I wanted to say that this is one of the most beautiful books I own.I was looking for a series of classics that I could purchase in hardcover to spruce up my personal library.

The covers have so much character and they're sturdy. The fonts are classic and easy to read, and the paper is substantial. The ribbon bookmarks, that match the cover, are a really nice touch. The only bad thing I can say, and it's so minor, is that the binding is a little stiff when the book is new.

I highly recommend this novel for all readers."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"One thing needs to be made clear before reading this book; the words \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility\\" do not mean the same things today as they did in Jane Austen's time. Though \`sense' referred to intelligence and the ability to judge situations well, \`sensibility' had connotations to having appropriate sensitivity toward moral and artistic issues, linked with the superiority of a person's aesthetical \`senses'. As such, there is room for debate over which sister represents which trait, something seemingly obvious from the outset of the book, but which dramatically changes by its conclusion (which amusingly mirrors the ongoing debate over which traits Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy embody in the title of their story \\"Pride and Prejudice\\").\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was Austen's first novel, and as such is considered her weakest by the critics, though this also means it is also the most accessible and easy-to-read novel. First novels are almost always the most amateurish, and as such it is a much simpler work, from the storyline to the sentence structure, which leads to an easier reading experience than her more complex novels (\\"Emma\\" and the aforementioned \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"). Anyone new to the world of Austen is best to start here as the easiest book with which to ease into her range of novels.The sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood are extreme opposites; oldest sibling Elinor uses her head, whilst the younger Marianne follows her heart; but for all of this, the two are very close. After the death of their father, Elinor and Marianne - along with their mother and younger sister - are forced to give up their comfortable estate to their stepbrother (the product of their father's first marriage) and sister-in-law due to the inheritance law. But before relocating to Barton Cottage, Elinor forms an attachment with Fanny Dashwood's brother Edward Ferrars, a shy and awkward, but good-hearted man. Hoping that her feelings are returned, but unable to make any advances, Elinor travels to Barton Cottage in the hopes that he will return to her there in the near future.At Barton Cottage, the girls make many new acquaintances, in particular the loud and bustling matriarch Mrs Jennings who is determined to marry the girls off as quickly as can be, and the quiet and gentlemanly Colonel Brandon. As for the romantic and dreamy Marianne, she's fallen hopelessly in love with the dashing John Willoughby after he rescues her from a rainy day and a twisted ankle whilst out walking in the countryside - much to the dismay of the smitten Colonel Brandon. Already concerned at Marianne's overly romantic disillusions, Elinor is concerned at her rather wanton behaviour in the presence of her new beau, but is then has her attention drastically diverted on being introduced to a Miss Lucy Steele who has a secret to share about Edward Ferrars...The story winds its way through the girls' negotiations with the society they live in, the restrictions held upon them and the individuals which hold power over them - not with the same deftness that Austen displays in later novels, but still with much thought-provoking commentary. The family's plight in being reduced to guests in their own home at Norland, at the mercy of their somewhat dim-witted brother is particularly revealing as to the social injustices of the time, and though the frustrations of the girls' status is never explicitly stated, it is readily evident for anyone willing to read between the lines. At the end of the day, all they have is each other and the fervent hope that they will find both happiness and security in marriage. Their trials in love are perhaps the most heart-rending experiences of any other Austen heroines, (where romances are either touched by irony or poignancy) in the fact that a happy ending is not guaranteed for the sisters and that their future happiness depends on a good match - it particular it is hard not to feel your heart break for Marianne, whose unswerving belief in her own feelings and the raptures of her heart are so cruelly put to the test.The characters of Elinor and Marianne are utterly irresistible. Elinor is the sort of person you would desperately wish for in your life in order to benefit from her good sense and protective nature, whilst Marianne is utterly charming in her romantic flights of fancy (in fact she's so winsome and dreamy that it's almost a shame when she gains some \`sense' at the novel's end - one would have been contented to have her indulge in her dreaming forever). Though the novel is told almost solely through Elinor's eyes, in several ways Marianne is the main protagonist, who goes through the most trials and changes. Whatever your own opinions, the two provide an excellent foil for each other, and at all times the sisterly bond between them is apparent.There have been so many adaptations of Jane Austen novels throughout the years, though to my mind none is better than Ang Lee's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. As I was reading the novel, I often found myself switching on the DVD in order to compare the two. It is a beautiful film, loyal to the themes, storyline and characters of the novel and in some cases improve upon it, and so comes very highly recommended as a companion piece to Austen's first novel."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"The audio is great if you can play it.

Here we follow the adventures of the Dashwood sisters as they find love in an class-conscious Regency England.The Dashwoods, impoverished when their father dies, are forced to live in a small house in the coutry on 500 pounds a year. With such unfortunate pospects as those, it will be difficult for the elder two, Elinor and Marianne, to find good marriage prospects. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferras, a match that seems much more suitable. But again, things are not what they seem, in this delicious tale of love. The young women must use their sense to see what is really there, and their sensibility to see what will be (unfortunately, Marianne uses neither, much to the detriment of the family). Colonel Brandon is the unassuming, unlikely hero who falls in love with Marianne and saves her from death.Having read this book several times, I can safely say that it gets better and better with every reading. I also recommend the 1995 film starring Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and others."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I don't know which book of Jane Austen, I love more. Sense and Sensibility is just so romantic. Pride and Prejudice is awesome and Emma is just fabulous. To think that Jane Austen wrote those books so long ago just goes to show that women have felt pretty much the same about love for always."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"The present novel is about two young women, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. They are part of a family living in Sussex. The family is of average financial means or a bit higher than average but the family loses its home when the father dies; and, the mother and sisters move to a smaller cottage in Devonshire. The novel follows the romances and complications of the two girls. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a young Jane Austen and honed for over a decade before being published. By way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Still, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I had the pleasure of reading two of Jane Austen's books, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and loved both of them. Austen writes in such a romatic way that you wish you could be there in person to experience every word. Anyone who found the book to be boring, needs to re-read it again. It speaks of honesty, integrity and love that is lacking in todays books. Elinor in, Sense and Sensability, was a strong and smart woman while on the other hand, the younger sister, Marianne, was weaker but became a stronger individual because of the strong bond between herself and Elinor. Every young girl should read Austen's work because it protrays love as good and bad and shows that no matter how much someone can love you, there maybe a hidden agenda behind that affection."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This is a good size for a paperback.

I'm not sure why, I just never had until I was given the opportunity to review this Insight Edition published by Bethany House. I have to admit that I am not going to be a Jane Austen fan. I struggled with Sense and Sensibility. I actually felt like Tom Hanks in \`You've Got Mail'. It just was not my cup of tea, which is strange because I love books that take place in Regency England and I love Jane Austen themed books.But, I'm not really reviewing Jane Austen here. I'm reviewing the Insight Edition. This annotated edition is filled with trivia, themes of faith, and other nuggets meant to enhance the reader's experience. I have to say that I like this concept with classic literature. I enjoyed taking a break from the story and reading the side notes. The notes are written clearly on the pages, but they do not get in the way of the story.One devoted Austen fan told me that reading a book like this is like watching a movie with the commentary on. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. Sometimes a reader just wants the story and nothing else.

If that is the case, I highly recommend the Insight Edition of Sense and Sensibility for those who want to add to their Jane Austen experience."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the first published novel of Jane Austen. Originally published in 1811, the novel went through several versions perhaps starting with \\"Elinor and Marianne\\" in 1795, though it is not certain. I suspect that \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the second best known work of Austen after \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and I would say that it is not as easy to read as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". One of the reasons for this is due to the importance of what was considered proper behavior at the time, and without an understanding of that standard of behavior, the motivation of the characters is hidden from the reader. Nevertheless, it is still worth the effort to read and overall it is worthwhile. At the same time, it is well worth reading an edition like the Penguin Classics version, which helps the reader understand the period and societal standards which play an important role in this novel.The main characters of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" are the sisters Elinor and Marianne, who are the daughters of Mr. Dashwood and his second wife. There is a third daughter, Margaret and of course his second wife Mrs. Dashwood. When Mr. Dashwood passes away, his estate passes to his son by his first wife, leaving the Dashwood women into lives of reduced means. The two elder sisters experience nearly the same situations. Both find love, then the shock of learning that those they love are pre-engaged.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is written in three volumes. The first deals with the transition of the Dashwood women to their new lives where they leave their Norland home move to stay with distant relations (the Middletons) at Barton Park. Elinor cares for Edward Ferras, the brother-in-law of her half-brother, and Marianne meets and is courted by John Willoughby. Willoughby leaves suddenly for London, causing Marianne distress. This volume also introduce Anne and Lucy Steele, two relations of the Middleton's who arrive as guests, but their arrival causes problems for Elinor who learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to her Edward. In Volume II, it is Marianne who learns that Willoughby has become engaged to another, due to his wasting his fortune and need for wealth. In Volume III the situations with the two sisters and those who they thought they loved is resolved, though in different ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\", in my opinion, is more difficult for a modern reader to digest, but that does not mean that it doesn't have anything to offer. There are some wonderful moments and when presented in a scholarly format with detailed notes it can still be enjoyed the same way it was when first published. I don't personally rate \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" as high as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it is still a very good novel and an important piece of literature."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorite books by Jane Austen, who happens to be my favorite author.

Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I find the illustrations slightly disappointing so I deducted one star.

Bethany House Publishers recently released the \\"Insight Edition\\" which includes footnotes of trivia, notes, and inspiration to help readers understand more background to this story. It is important to note that the story has not been changed in any way. Some of these notes are historical, that expand on life in England in the 1800s; others are facts about Jane Austen that coincide with the story; still others are themes of faith, or comments on the characters or plot.This was my second reading of Sense and Sensibility and I definitely enjoyed reading the extra tidbits included in this version. The culture of the 1800s is very different from current culture and there were many times that the notes gave me a greater understanding of various situations.I recommend this version to all Jane Austen fans, you will probably have new insights after reading this book. And to those of you who have not yet become Jane Austen fan, give this book a try, it's a timeless story."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I love Jane Austen. A couple summers ago, I set out to read all of her books in one summer - even those I had read before (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility). Even after realizing that many of her characters and stories are similar, I still loved her. I love the way she writes with wit and intelligence. And I really enjoy how everyone who deserves to be happy in the end does indeed end up happy.Sense and Sensibility, for those of you who haven't ever read it or seen one of the many film versions, is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne who are both alike in passion, except that Marianne is all passion and impulsivity on the outside (sensibility) and Elinor is all composure and caution on the outside (sense). The story tells of secret love, not so secret love, lost fortunes and selfishness, and deep sisterly love. This story, even more than Pride and Prejudice, makes me wish I had a sister or two.This insight edition is different from other more \\"academic\\" versions of classic works, because rather than pages and pages of footnotes instructing the reader as to the socio-historical background of the book.... Well, it's like the editors are reading the book with you. Occasionally there are informative footnotes which tell you what a \\"Barouche\\" is (a four-wheeled carriage pulled by 2 horses that seated four people), or tells you about \\"Harley Street\\" (a street in London populated chiefly by medical professionals). But there are also 6 other types of footnotes that occur throughout the book - usually as an \\"aside\\" on the edge of the page - including notes about Jane Austen's life and how a part of the story relates to it, references to S&S; in film and television, themes related to faith, and notes on characters that the editors dislike throughout the story.While at first, I thought that this tongue-in-cheek note system was a little distracting, as I went onward, I began to enjoy the voices of these women. It was kind of like I was reading the book with a friend or with a book club. So that as I read about something really horrible that Fanny said to John or Lucy said to Elinor and thought, \\"UGH! I think Fanny is such a jerk!\\" there was the comment by my \\"friends\\" in the margin saying the same thing.This version of Sense and Sensibility does not add anything new to the text that Jane Austen wrote, and thus the story of course is great. The Insight Edition does add some contemporary fun to the novel however, and it is likely you would also enjoy taking these friends with you on the journey through 19th century England.Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen? 4.5 out of 5The Insight Edition? 3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" by Jane Austen focuses on sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood and their search for love.

Sure enough, there was an end cap in the fiction section covered with retellings and sequels to Austen's beloved novels. Austen's influence can even be found in the popular paranormal genre; Mr. Darcy (Pride and Prejudice) and Jane Austen both appear as vampires in two such books. The Insight Edition offers a newly packaged look at the original story of Sense and Sensibility, with a few fun surprises in store.I'll be honest with you. Up until this week, Sense and Sensibility was the only Jane Austen novel I had not yet read. Without this new edition of the beloved classic, it's more than likely I never would have made it through. A few months ago, I attempted to read it from beginning to end, but gave up less than a third of the way into the story. I was baffled. If I can read Pride and Prejudice in two days flat, then why was I having so much trouble with Sense and Sensibility? Like in other novels, Austen writes about marrying for love and/or money, first impressions, and differences in class.Sense and Sensibility is the story of the Marianne and Elinor Dashwood. They are the late Mr. Dashwood's children from his second marriage. At the time of his death, he asks his son Henry to care for youngest three daughters and his new widow. However, Henry's wife has his ear and persuades him to give them less income annually than the promise he made to his father. Marianne and Elinor can only hope to preserve their future by making smart matches. Bold and romantic Marianne has her sights set on the charming Mr. Willoughby, and sensible and logical Elinor has fallen for Edward Ferrars. Neither gentleman is what he seems, and both girls soon suffer from a broken heart. The loss of Mr. Willoughby prolongs Marianne's sickness, and Elinor silently suffers through Edward's upcoming nuptials with Lucy Steele. Just as it seems all hope is lost for a happy ending, Marianne opens her heart to a new love, and Elinor learns that things are not exactly as they seem.This annotated edition of Sense and Sensibility enhanced a story I already knew through the 1995 Kate Winslet/Emma Thompson feature film. The editors provided trivia about the movie, ranked their favorite characters and least favorite characters, offered facts about Jane Austen and the Regency period, and provided definitions of difficult words. Whether Sense and Sensibility is an old favorite or a new-to-you text, this is the edition you should read. Lovingly put together by some of Austen's biggest fans, the Insight Edition will earn a slot on your bookshelf.*A copy of this book was provided to me by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"How do you take a book that is almost 200 years old and make it interesting and new to the modern reader? That's a trick question, I can't imagine not enjoying Jane Austen's writing no matter how antiquated the society and its ideals are. Of course I took as many literature classes in college as time allowed so I may be an exception to the rule.The story itself? The cast of characters is impressive; you've got the calm introvert, the passionate young thing, the rake, the snob, the neighbors you roll your eyes at whenever they show up, the man of integrity, etc. And the plotlines are almost as thick as the characters! Frivolity and fun, true love, desperate, gut-wrenching heartbreak, intrigue and secrets, scandal, mix-ups, horrible nasty people you want to punch in the nose (I know I'm not the only one who thought that.)I've made it a personal project to read all of Austen and this was my third foray and probably my favorite to read - which surprised me because as absolutely wonderful as Edward and Col. Brandon are, I don't swoon over them like Mr. Darcy or Mr. Knightley. Not to sound smarmy about it but I think it did have to do with the \\"insights\\" in my margin.The book has a pictographic key so the notes in your margin are categorized by things like historical and cultural details, film references, themes of faith, Austen facts and tidbits, and comments and asides as well as frowny face and smiley face comments. As much as I LOVE tidbits and asides in all categories what I really enjoyed were the smiley and frowney faces - it was like reading the book with a friend who hated the same parts you hated and loved, laughed and smiled at all your favorite places.(I got quite the laugh out of the film reference which stated: In the 2008 miniseries, Edward's bad mood leads him to chop wood in the pouring rain. The film was written by the same person who had Darcy jump in a lake. We approve of both.And yes I did run out and rent the 2008 miniseries after reading that. Kidding. Sortof.)If you were one of those women (or girls - I knew lots of teens who did this) who ran out and bought Pride and Prejudice the book after watching the 2005 film and found the book hard to read - I'd recommend trying it again with the \\"insight edition\\" which will inevitably lead you to Sense & Sensibility. These editions really do a brilliant job of bridging a 200 year generation gap.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have always enjoyed Jane Austen's books and film adaptations of Jane Austen, and I have always been troubled by the fact that more younger people are not exposed to the classics rigorously enough in high school English literature classes.For schools or parents who feel like Jane Austen's books may be a bit cumbersome for their students or children, then this book provides an alternative. Instead of tampering with the language or feeling of the original manuscript, it provides fun asides.The margins of the book are dotted with factoids. Some of the details focus on Austen's life, others on English life in general during the time period. Historical details are discussed in some, while slight religious themes addressed in the book are presented in others.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good.

I give this a C-."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"There are two schools of Austen. The first, her ardent admirers, adore everything she does; the second find the snobby world her characters inhabit a perpetual turnoff. Belonging to neither category myself, this book strikes me as somewhat tentative, in regards to Austen's development as a writer. This opinion I'm sure won't endear me to the legions of Austen fans who treasure every word she wrote. But though the story itself is a fine one, the novel as a whole lacks the attention to detail, character, and metaphor that Austen would perfect in her later novels (particularly \\"Mansfield Park,\\" which never seems to get the accolades this novel and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" do). Though Austen compensates for this with various literary techniques (creating an opposite foil for all of her characters, constructing parallels for various scenes, etc.), when it comes right down to it, this is the work of a beginner, a writer just beginning to get her bearings. I know \\"S&S\\" has its passionate proponents, mostly on the basis of its romantic plot, and heartfelt depiction of the love lives of two very different sisters. But on the whole, this book derives its strength mostly from straightforward storytelling, rather than imaginative and poetic writing. Not a bad beginning, but Austen definitely improved her game with her future novels. (...)"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I read Sense and Sensibility for my English IV Course. This novel was written by Jane Austen. This book is for a romantic person, adult or young adult. If you are someone who is interested in 19th Century society and the roles of women, this story is for you. Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. The author is well known and the quality of literature is world class, because it is so well known.Sense and Sensibility describes the adventures of two young ladies (Marianne and Elinor) falling in love. Elinor is always in control of her emotions and senses. Marianne is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who have no evidence of wholly encompassing emotions or are without them entirely. She ultimately marries her long standing admirer, Colonel Brandon. Also Elinor is the heroin of the story. The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is weird; she is always after her daughters minding their business. She is the opposite of Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice. She has inherited no fortune of her own but wants the best for her daughters and shares Marianne's romantic sensibilities. The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward and Marianne falls in love with Willoughby.The conflict of the ideas about marriage between parents and daughters is the main theme of this book. If the girls were not yet married, their mothers employed themselves in matching the younger women with eligible men.I recommend Jane Austen's work to all readers who are fascinated with love. This is an excellent book for those who enjoy 19th Century Literature. Even though I missed some details because of the language, I identified with one the girls in the story."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I love all of Jane Austin's works. She captures real life in her day, and it still applies to my day."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Perhaps one of my favorite Jane Austen books. It's perfect in every way!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811. It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles. Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel. Austen is a romantic writer. In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel. In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood. Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy. While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town. Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother. Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies. Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her. The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility. Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility. She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life. This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them. We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships. People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel. Marianne acts like a typical adolescent. She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts. Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period. She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death. Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I was hoping for another masterpiece when I ordered Sense and Sensibility but, other than the eloquent language, it contains none of the charm of Pride and Prejudice. Not a single character in S&S is likeable, and that I find to be a real travesty. In P&P you have the bold and clever Elizabeth and the mysterious Darcy to adore, and even Jane and Bingley have their charms.... but S&S is a dull read, or at least, as dull and the wonderful Jane Austen could muster. I don't recommend it to a Pride and Prejudice lover."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"As SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY (S&amp;S) was Austen's first published novel, it is perhaps a forgivable sin that this work is almost wholly without that inimitable touch of greatness that makes her later works so wonderful. To be sure, S&amp;S is not completely without charm; as usual, her characters are described along the same uber ironic and caustic lines familiar to fans of her later work, and the soap operish quality of the narrative is, as always, tempered by her wry wit. When Austen sets her baleful eye on the often ridiculous mores of her society, deftly skewing her demographic representing characters with the graceful, devastating wit she made her stock and trade, there is no one better. Yet, in S&amp;S, the other part of what makes Austen so great - the biting, social commentary which is always indistinguishably entwined with plot and that sterling character development we've come to expect - is absent. And though Austen sets her novel up as a didactic tale centering around an overmeasure of both sensibility and emotional excessivity, in the end she fails to create any application, to make sense of the lessons she so clearly intended to teach. The two main characters seem to have suffered trial after trial for nothing, and the rest of the characters, those that MADE them suffer, get off scot-free. That sense of Austen Justice so unavoidable in her later efforts is conspicuously absent here, leaving the narrative in want of purpose and the reader ultimately dissatisfied.A lesser effort from one just setting her foot on the Alpine Path to greatness."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I read Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen. I thought the book was very good. Austen portrays Elinor and Marianne very well. She shows the love and friendship and the jealously of two sisters. She shows how one sister can be in love and the other is trying to find the bad in that person.In the beginning, Elinor finds someone she really likes and Marianne trys to find the bad in him, like he doesn't like drawing and Elinor does. Marianne is just jealous that her sister has found someone and she hasn't found anyone yet. Marianne wants Edward, Elinor's boyfriend. Elinor and Edward don't last that long anyway because they move to Barton Park.The Miss Dashwood's cousin, Sir John Middleton, writes them a letter and invites them to move to Barton Park and live in a cottage. They gladly accept. They tell their brother and his wife and send their belongings in advance and leave. They agree to try the cottage out for a year. Sir John and his wife are very hospitable to the Miss Dashwood's. They always invite them to their house to meet the people of the neighborhood. The Miss Dashwood's rarely accepted.There was on certain time they accepted and met Colonel Brandon, who is a friend of Sir John. Colonel Brandon sets his sights on Marianne. Colonel Brandon likes Marianne's singing and piano playing. Elinor does not like that idea. She would rather him be interested in her instead. Elinor is now jealous of Marianne. She doesn't even care that Edward is supposed to be coming to see her. Their good-bye was like that of a brother and sister. They didn't even kiss good-bye.The Middleton's are always having someone stay the night at their house. The Dashwood's would rather keep to themselves. When Sir John's wife invites them to come to the house the Dashwood's are always busy. The Dashwood's are the type that would rather do for themselves. They are not really the social type. Mr. John Dashwood and his wife live in Norland. They moved there after his father died. Mr. Dashwood made his son promise to provide for his mother and sisters. Which meant that he was to give them money. His wife did not like that idea. She thought that they could find their own money and that the money was the only reason they were still living in Norland. Which in fact was not true. They were still living there because they had no where else to go. Miss John Dashwood thought that they didn't deserve any money from them whether they were family or not. She thought only of herself and her son not of her husband's family.John Dashwood wanted to give them three thousand pounds apiece. His wife wouldn't hear of it. She thought that they would never pay it back because they had no source of income. She managed to talk her husband down to about five hundred pounds. They managed to get out of paying the women any money because they decided to move Barton Park. In the end they both marry and are happy. They don't live too far away from one another, so they can still fight as they please. They can stay in touch with one another because family means so much to them. In reading this book, I had a little trouble understanding and following the context in some places, but I enjoyed the book. I would recommend it to young women who like to read romances. It is very much so a romance, yet it is also a book about the love that two sisters have for one another. Sense and Sensibility is rather difficult to follow in some spots. I highly recommend this to young women who enjoy reading romances."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"In Sense and Sensible the storyline dwells on the two elder sisters of the Dashwood family, Elinor and Mariane. Elinor is always in control of her emotions and is governed primarily by prudence (sense). Her younger sister, Marianne, is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who do not evidence wholly encompassing emotions are without them entirely. As in Pride &amp; Prejudice, the family home of the Dashwoods has been willed to another member of the family not in the immediate nuclear family. In Pride &amp; Prejudice, the home was entailed to Mr. Collins, a distant cousin. Where there was only an overshadowing of the loss of the estate in that book, in Sense &amp; Sensibility, the house is actually lost to the half brother whose wife, a Ferrar, not only talks her husband out of the generous support to his half sisters that he promised (albeit vaguely) his dying father but makes life in general unpleasant for the Dashwood ladies until they find a situation with a cousin, John Middleton. Part of the unpleasantness surrounds an apparent but unprofessed affection of her brother, Edward Ferrars, for the eldest Dashwood, Elinor.It would seem that the move has quashed the supposed attraction, leaving Elinor attempting to contain her disappointment. Marianne meanwhile strikes up an intense relationship with equally extroverted Willoughby. When Willoughby suddenly disappears, the two girls come together to support each other emotionally through a storm of discoveries, pleasant and unpleasant.Sense and Sensibility develops into its own independent storyline after many similarities with Pride &amp; Prejudice. Although this novel holds its own and is an enjoyable book, I still feel that Pride &amp; Prejudice is its superior in pace, story line and general feel. Sense came out well before Pride and it almost feels that the same idea is being worked out in both - an idea that got clearer and was better communicated in Pride. Pride had a much more natural (believable) feeling to the events where Sense does require a little suspension of disbelief in some of the contrivances to get to a happy ending (specifically referring to the actions of Robert Ferrar). If you liked Pride and want more Austen, this is your book. If you are choosing between the two, choose Pride ... than come back for this one."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Since enough people have reviewed the novel's plot itself, I'm writing instead about the formatting of this particular (Kindle) version of the book. I liked the illustrations, though they came only at the beginning of each chapter. There definitely could have been more. As to this version's formatting, it was pretty bad. Line's were frequently unintentionally cut off, making the dialogue difficult to read. Also, as a stickler for grammar, I was frustrated with the mistakes in the book, which I believe are due to the publisher's mistakes (I've read other versions and have never noticed it). For example, words are misspelled and punctuation is missing - very annoying. I realize this version only cost me 99 cents, but I was still aggravated while reading."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Although SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Jane Austen's best novel, it is nonetheless a major novel, with the author's then-young talent in full display. Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed. Reserved Elinor and exuberant Marianne are expertly drawn, with Edward, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon (whose lovesick hopes for Marianne are dashed again and again) also engaging creations. Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters. It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.Even though this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book. I highly recommend this novel for all readers. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This is my second Kindle purchase of S&S. This one includes the classic illustrations (which look awesome in color on the Kindle ipad app). However, I usually read it on my Kindle 2.

I have a nice collection going and prefer her above all others. She gives clear distinction to each character and her dramatizations are perfectly pitched. I highly recommend listening to the unabridged versions as so much of Jane's stories end up on the cutting room floor otherwise. Give yourself an afternoon break by listening to a chapter or two of these insightful and softly painted word canvasses. I love being a \\"Janeite\\"...won't you join me?"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY chronicles the young lives of two sisters, spirited Marianne and the more stable Elinor. After being driven away from home by their step-brother and his wife, the Dashwood family (Mrs. Dashwood, Marianne, Elinor, and younger sister Margaret) settles down in a small cottage in the countryside.Each sister proceeds to fall in love in her unique way: Elinor quietly and seriously loves somewhat-awkward Edward, while Marianne impetuously and passionately gives her heart to the dashing Willoughby. As with most of Austen's works, disparity in social class and inconsistencies in personality cause the lovers turmoil.Austen uses some of the satirical techniques that are so prevalent of her other works. While not as funny as her other satires, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY presents some characters' absurdities quite well.When I read this at the age of 14 or so, I did not enjoy it nearly as much. Older readers will like the subtle humor that Austen invariably includes in her work.Overall, a good introduction to the classic work of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Austen's S&S follows the same line of experience that all of her other books seem to follow, down to the family of sisters and the problems of proper behavior and good connections. But like a truly masterful artist, she can write, essentially, the same story over and over again and still have it be exciting and interesting for all readers. This is a book that can be appreciated by anyone over the 6th grade, and possibly younger. It is a classic that should be a part of any avid reader's repetoire."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"&quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; Jane Austen's first published novel (1811), tells the intertwined stories of two contrasting sisters, the lively, passionate, impulsive Marianne and the reserved, self-disciplined, dutiful Elinor. Both experience love, heartache, and eventual happiness in marriage, and both have their beliefs and value systems tested. A host of memorable, comic minor characters combine with the principal heroines and heroes to develop a tale that is both lively and thought provoking, humorous and psychologically astute. Anyone who has ever struggled with conflicts between spontaneity and caution, heart and head, can identify with the central characters of this novel.This edition of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; includes a number of helpful supplementary materials that enhance the reader's understanding and appreciation of the novel. Excerpts from contemporary texts clarify the historical context of the terms \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility.\\" Among the works included are selections from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther,&quot; a classic example of the novel of sensibility, and Maria Edgeworth's &quot;Letters of Julia and Caroline,&quot; an earlier novel of contrasting female characters, in this case two friends, one of whom is sensible and the other romantic and impractical. The edition also includes the whole of Jane Austen's &quot;Love and Freindship&quot; (sic), a hilarious parody of sentimental fiction written when Austen was fourteen. Besides background materials, the volume includes four essays from recent critics that represent a range of different interpretations of the novel.Finally, the introduction provides useful biographical and historical information and outlines a variety of critical approaches to the novel: some critics believe Elinor is clearly the favored sister and the sense she embodies the preferred value system; some critics by contrast believe the novel either consciously or unconsciously betrays sympathy for Marianne and the sensibility she represents; and other critics believe the novel advocates a middle ground between sense and sensibility, according to which both sisters need to abandon aspects of their initial beliefs and adopt attitudes and behaviors associated with the other sibling. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; has sometimes been criticized for being too didactic and formulaic, but those who read the novel along with the various background, critical, and introductory essays in this volume should discover a work that is richly complex, ambiguous, and many-sided in its exploration of the competing values of emotion and reason, spontaneity and restraint, and personal fulfillment versus duty to others."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first Jane Austen novel to achieve publication. Its reception was just sufficient to open the way for the publication of more of her novels, and the next to be published was \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It has been a matter of speculation ever since whether, if nothing other than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" had been published, Jane Austen would be remembered today.Those who believe this novel would not have sustained her reputation offer several reasons. They cite a lack of comic characters, a lack of male characters who excite interest or stimulate the imagination, an overabundance of unmemorable minor characters, and prose that is sometimes too heavily overworked.Those who believe this novel could alone preserve Jane Austen's fame produce different arguments. They cite the depiction of the two sisters Elinor and Marianne and their approximation to the concepts of sense and sensibility, the famous passage near the beginning in which the wife of John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother, pares down the deathbed promise her husband made to his father to provide financial support to John's half-sisters, and to Jane Austen's detached but involved, good-humored but stern narrative stance.Having re-read the novel recently for the umpteenth time, I could see the merit in all these arguments. Nevertheless the reading experience held me enthralled. Accounting for this is difficult. I read hundreds of pages in which women talk about men. I read of a world where every quality, every characteristic, every manner is put in little boxes, clearly labeled, and arranged in order from desirable to base. These things do not usually appeal to me. Ultimately, I believe it is Jane Austen the storyteller that casts the spell. My sense and sensibility are alike spellbound.Readers who like to refer to film or television adaptations to help their reading of the classics, will benefit from seeing a 1995 version of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" adapted, scripted and starring the English actress Emma Thompson."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Several well-spaced readings of this novel during a long life have not yet enabled me to tell what happens in it. There is a superb early chapter in which Elinor and Marianne's sister-in-law pares away the direction expressed by her dying father-in-law that his son share his inheritance with his half-sisters and their mother. Jane Austen manages this almost as well as Shakespeare has Goneril and Regan stripping King Lear of his \\"retinue of an hundred knights\\". Then towards the end of the novel, when Elinor keeps vigil at her gravely ill sister's bedside, a horseman arrives who turns out to be the very last person she expected. Between these memorable events, try as I might, I cannot distinguish between most of the numerous female and the few aloof, mysterious and unpredictable male characters, neither can I sort out how they are interacting.What delights me, however, on every page is Jane Austen's prose. Every sentence is carefully fitted into its place, every word connotes its precise meaning, every adjective such as \\"affable\\" and \\"agreeable\\" carrying a specific ranking in a scale of values.In today's parlance, I suppose I would say that the plot and the characters lack the edge that is so sharp and memorable in other of Jane Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811 when Jane Austen was just 36 years old, and only 2 years before the publication of Pride and Prejudice. In the span of such a short time, and almost 200 years ago from today, Jane Austen produced two timeless classics. I find it bitterly ironic that in almost every case, a classic is known by the whole world over - celebrated, written about, studied, discussed in painstaking details in a classroom, read aloud in packed lecture halls and admired by masses - yet the creator of it all is spared this knowledge of success.Sense and Sensibility's characters add richness and color to the story, where the central theme revolves around two sisters, opposite in character and ideals, both in mild struggle with the life choices afforded to them because of their situation, their connections, and their small fortune. The Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marrianne, live with Mrs. Dashwood, their mother and younger sister, Margaret. When Mr. Dashwood dies, he leaves the decision of their care in the hands of his son, John. John has never played the role of a compassionate step-brother to his father's other family but he is not vindictive or evil. His wife Fanny is. The Dashwoods are politely and slowly forced out of their beloved home in Norwood, as John is persuaded out of any kindness that Fanny found appropriate for their living situation. The compassionate cousin of Mrs. Dashwood, Sir John Middleton, offers the family to live in a small cottage, Barton Park, for as long as they shall like.The sense of duty and responsibility from Elinor is unparalleled. When she learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to the love of her life, Edward, she is stunned and saddened when the terrible news is confirmed as true. We do not see a single outburst of anger, frustration, disappointment from Elinor's lips or thoughts. She continues to care for Marianne's deep wounds over Willoughby and does not mention a word of her own loss. For four months, she is resilient and silent to even Marianne, for she has promised Lucy to keep the secret for her. How she endures it all is a testament to her character. She exerts herself to be strong, and act with dignity even at the expense of her own happiness.Perhaps it is ironic that Elinor who is the sensible one with such measured approach to her desires is in the end united with the true love of her life, Edward - while Marianne, who is the sensitive, emotional, passionate, idealistic one, is rejected by Willoughby, suffers greatly in love, and is at last united with Colonel Brandon, whom she neither liked nor respected earlier in the story. Is Austen telling us that it is better to be sensitive or sensible, or that both will do as they may, and life will happen all around us, and we shall never choose our destiny - rather, it chooses us?Whatever the answer may be, Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors of all time and I can't get enough of her!

Her brutally sarcastic observations of the British upper class reduce her antagonists to sniveling school children who cry and grovel and simper their way through life behind a thin veil of dignity, a veil gleefully ripped open by Austen.From her opinions of parents:\\"...a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow anything...\\"to the value of children:\\"On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of others.\\"Austen constructs a tantalising slaughterhouse of a book, inside which she adorns her hooks with a dazzling array of conceited, deceitful and shameless characters, few of whom escape her witty blade. All this however is not to say the novel is bereft of heart. As the title suggests, the central theme is the conflict and reconciliation between heart and mind, exemplified respectively in Marianne and Elinor, both of whom are endearing characters in their own ways, despite their flaws. It is this respect, no matter how faint, that Austen shows her characters that elevates the story above a satirical denunciation of her society and allows the reader to lose themselves in her narrative and become attached to her players.The overall flaw for me, were the happy endings handed out like charity flyers, though the fact that everybody gets one - from her most hated of villains to the most saintly of maidens, somewhat tempers the sacchariferousness. Sense and Sensibility was an utter pleasure to read - and surprisingly enjoyable when read side by side with Game of Thrones Book 3 - A Storm of Swords. When the clumsy fantasy writing made me cringe too much I could switch back to the succulent eloquence of Austen, and when sitting around in parlours reading the subtext behind eyebrow lifts became a little tedious, I could flip back to sex and bloodshed. Unfortunately due to the size differences in the books, I was only 44% of the way into Game of Thrones when I finished Sense and Sensibility and was forced to endure another six hundred pages of undiluted lumbering nerd prose."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"had not read this book since school days , its a joy to read , and one gets a real feel for the times when women were dependent on their men folk , not allowed to own property in their own right , and a good marriage was the aim"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Love Jane Austin.

I have been a fan of Austen's since I read the first page of Pride and Prejudice. I currently own all of her published works, some having been replaced a couple of times due to wear. Since my latest copy of Sense and Sensibility bit the dust a month or so ago, I was thrilled to get Bethany House's copy in the mail this week.In terms of the actual novel, no changes have been made to Austen's original work. The novel is printed in all its glory with my favorite characters and places still in tact. What has been added by several of Bethany House's writers are notes and annotations about the life and times of Austen.The book comes complete with a key, which indicates the type of note/annotation being applied in each instance. The notes fall into the following categories: \\"historical and cultural details [...] from England in the early 1800's,\\" \\"fact and tidbits from Austen's life,\\" \\"references to S&S; in today's culture, particularly in film,\\" \\"unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters,\\" \\"themes of faith drawn from the novel or Austen's life,\\" \\"comments and asides on the book's characters or plot,\\" and \\"the parts of the novel that just make us smile.\\"I LOVE the additional comments, quips, and bits added to Austen's work. They serve to add the insight intended into a world of ladies and gentlemen. The authors who have offered their take on Austen's work compliment the novel by adding interesting references and inserting a little comedy into one of the best loved novels of all time.On the minus side (if you can really call it that), the novel did take more time to read. I found myself reading a page, seeing the notations, and reading the page again to see if the added information changed the image I create in my head of Austen's world. In most instances, it certainly did! It did make the reading more cumbersome at some points, but overall I really enjoyed this take on one of the best loved works of literature. I plan to order the Insight Edition of Pride and Prejudice and look forward to many more such editions.This book was provided free of charge by the publisher as a review copy.

My love for anything and everything Victorian has helped me embrace this novel set in the Regency Period, and so, naturally I fell in love with this timeless piece. This story of the very different Dashwood sisters and their clashing tastes in their choices of men to love, was endearing as well as very frustrating at times. Just when I thought the obvious about Colonel Brandon, Edward or Willoughby- the story took a different turn just to add to the intrigue of it all; classic Austen at its best.The story revolves around love-sickness, love-triangles, a marriage of convenience, age and love, differences of choices and opinions, wealth and social status, influence, family conflict, secret-filled pasts and ultimately...and appropriately so: sense and sensibility. I'm still not sure which of the sisters I concurred with the most; Elinor or Marianne... Austen brilliantly shifts us from one perception to the other while embracing both depending on the situation. Ultimately the girls' reconciliation and love for eachother blends the disparities of state helping them come to terms with their own serenity. Love can then be found and accepted under a new light.Sense and Sensibility is a light read embedded with deeper meaning that brings comfort, peaks interest and offers a colourful variety of figures (the comical busy-body Miss Jennings is indeed very special!) On the whole, this read meshed excitement, passion, drama as well as \`sagesse' in the lives of two otherwise very ordinary ladies of the times. The book doesn't skip a beat with essential meanings and turn of events within every paragraph- With this one, you won't want to blink:)One can never get enough of elegantly written suspense-filled love twists and pangs. At least I can't- Loved it!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Being a Patrick O'Brian fan and knowing he was an admirer of Jane Austen, I gave her a try a few years ago with Pride and Prejudice and found it stunningly good and unforgettable. Sense and Sensibility is my second Austen novel and I hoped for an equally good performance. I would not have had the patience to get very far with Jane Austen earlier in my life. Austen can be stilted, wordy (to say the least), obtuse and just plain difficult to read and understand. She also leaves a lot to the imagination which although frustrating, actually adds depth and emotion. There is also a keen, many-layered understanding of people at their best, worst, and various shades of in- between, along with the associated foibles. Sense and Sensibility is a great story that, at times, had me rushing through many chapters to see the end result. For example, Marianne's encounter with Willoughby in London would make my top ten of dramatic literary scenes (if I were to ever compile such a list). As Sense and Sensibility neared its end, I hoped for and expected the sort of satisfying, happy, and witty ending I enjoyed in Pride and Prejudice, but found an unsatisfying, matter of fact (but perhaps realistic) anti-climax instead. I feel like I am defacing something sacred, but I have to give Sense and Sensibility only 4 stars. It is well worth the time, but if one is to pick their first Jane Austen book, based on my limited experience, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Next on my list is Emma."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This is the first full-length novel that Austen wrote, and - although it's easy to find proof for something you know is true - it shows. This book just wasn't as well-designed as Pride and Prejudice, where it feels like every character and scene has its purpose. But the characters and charming and the story is light and fun, and it's definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This book arrived very quickly and is just what I am looking for. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"After finally getting round to reading the books that launched my top three period film loves (P&P;Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996), S&S;Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition), and best of all PersuasionPersuasion), it was fascinating to note what Emma Thompson did and did not use in her screenplay of S&S.;As to the novel itself-most surprising and gratifying was the biting satire, wit and sarcasm in Miss Austen's writing. Her carefully veiled views on \\"society\\" good and bad will stand as a historical and societal timeline into the era. A woman's place, or lack thereof, is keenly felt, as is the feeling of helplessness of women with the unfortunate prospect of being born without means. As well as what some women gave up to secure \\"a good match\\". Knowing Miss Austen's own background, the reader doesn't have to wonder how much of her own life was catalyst for her social commentary dished up in the beguiling text of romance.4 stars-recommended."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"A wonderful Jane Austen book.

I decided I wanted to read the book to get the real version. I was not disappointed. I enjoy all of Jane Austen's books. I wish she had lived longer so she could have written more. She was an amazing author."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Two sisters have come of marrying age. One loves rashly and deeply, the other cautiously and with no little reserve - the sense and the sensibility. The contrast set up, Jane Austen takes the two young women through nearly the same set of events. Through love's introduction, intervening conflict and ultimate disappointment, we observe the impacts and the results of these two disparate manners of dealing with the opposite sex. This being a Jane Austen comedy, don't be surprised if things work out for someone in the end.While obviously very well written and full of interesting characters and insights, this, like most of Jane Austen's work, simply \\"doesn't do it for me.\\" Certainly Ms. Austen is not without her modern relevance, but many of the important ideas running through her novels, including this one, are foreign and even offensive. For example, her casual indifference toward the unmoneyed, her obvious belief in the natural limitations of the female sex and the importance she sets on formality set my teeth a-grinding. She writes, as they say, of a different time. Similarly, her writing style is often, including in this book, tedious and opaque. Economy of words and clarity are not so important as obeisance to formality and avoidance of perceived impropriety. As I said, writing of a different time. As one can likely see, my complaints about Jane Austen are more due to my own predilections than any shortcomings of the famed authoress.That said, I do believe that reading this book is good for a person - it will make you more informed and provide material worth thinking on. Several of the characters will stick with you. Ms. Austen has a way of making her characters very distinct despite the smallness of her authorial world. The characters are not Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but the Dashwood girls are worth remembering. Furthermore, the major themes, while not \\"big ideas\\" are relevant to most everyone and persuasively resolved. Sense and sensibility was for me, however, less enjoyable reading than I would prefer. The plot line moved slowly, the ideas seemed dated and the language obscured rather than revealed."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet.

But it's a very good book, promising much better to come, a promise which was abundantly fulfilled in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Marianne's histrionics drove me up the wall. It took a while for me to realize that Marianne is meant as a caricature; that Austen thinks her as ridiculous as she appears to the reader. Witness Marianne's rhapsodizing about the fallen leaves at Norwood and Elinor cutting her short with her observation that &quot;not everybody shares your passion for dead leaves.&quot; Elinor is the more sympathetic and likeable of the two sisters and Austen clearly identifies with her; Elinor's calm, rational sense and balance promises much better for happiness than Marianne's overblown romanticism. We can see in this first book the emergence of an awesomely talented writer."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"In recent weeks my wife in rapid succesion read this book and Pride and Prejudice and then ran out to the store on a Sunday evening to pick up Mansfield Park. What a disappointment. I hit the wall about p. 20 and could never find a way to get involved. The characters were uninteresting and the situations dull, and I had to force my way to the end. I haven't had this much trouble with a book in a long time. Since this is a minority view, I would only ask: Is this book the best introduction to Jane Austen? Should I have tried anoter title -- Pride and Prejudice, say?"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"There is no greater author than Jane Austin. Some may disagree, as is their right, but I will NEVER agree with them. I love her. LOVE, isn't a strong enough word. And, this book is on my TOP FIVE favs. of all time. The story of these sisters is timeless and the struggle for independance while still searching for love, could have been written today. Jane Austin was SO ahead of her time. Elinor and Maryann's relationship is so endearing and the heartbreak you feel for them is all consumming. You won't be able to put down this novel until you are satisfied that this wonderful and amazing women will be content in their respective lives. The language, whit and concern taken with these characers is a true testament to the talent of Jane Austin. She's amazing. No doubt about it."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have read 5 of Jane Austen's 6 novels (all but Mansfield Park) and Sense and Sensibility is without a doubt the best of them all. For those of you who were disappointed that it did not match up to Pride and Prejudice, I assure you, it did, and then rose far above it. My English teacher in 6th grade always talked about Sense and Sensibility and how much she loved it. After I read Pride and Prejudice, my first Austen experience, I knew that I had to read that novel. As a warning for you as well, do NOT watch the movie with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet before you read the book. I did that and then I was totally thrown off by the book. Now, it is a great adaptation of the novel, but they mix up the scenes and so I found myself constantly confused because I did not meet Lucy Steele until much later than I thought I would. The movie introduces her much sooner. Another recommendation: if you want to see Jane Austen at her best, read Emma. (My second favorite) Persuasion and Northanger Abbey are good, but nothing like those two."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I was only 11 when I saw the movie.

The language, the style of writing was not in contrast with her other works, but the characters and plot did not interest me. Marianne was decidedly a young woman whom I had no interest in. She was too wrapped up in her own little world to be a girl who deserved the compassion which Austen tried to ilicit. Besides this, Marianne and Elinor's prejudices made them seem as ill-bred as the company they ridiculed for being such. Although I liked Elinor for her honesty and compassion and hated Willoughby and Lucy Steele because of who they were, I was so disappointed with the conclusion that these three did little to save this book. My recommendation: read Pride and Prejudice or Emma instead."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I thought that after all these years I might as well pitch in and give my two cents worth in regard to one of my favorite authors. The plot has been well covered with these reviews and others, and even if they had not, you would have had to almost spent your life living under a rock not to be aware, so I certainly will not beat it to death here.Briefly though, this is the story of two sisters of the Dashwood family, who find themselves in a state of reduced circumstances upon the death of their father; a plight not uncommon during that era we know as Regency England. This is the story of Emma Dashwood and her sister Marianne, the relationship between the two sisters, their family, friends, neighbors, and most importantly, possible suitors. The story is told mostly through the eyes of Emma (sense?...I wonder), but through her eyes we get a wonderful picture of some very unforgettable characters. Note: If you watch very closely, you will see these same characters amongst us even to this day! More about this later.Now, for one of my pet peeves; most of the members of the reading Western World will tell you that this is Austen's first novel and it is not her best work, or one reason or another. Now being something of a semi-cultural barbarian, I have a problem with this statement. While I will admit that Austen's later works are some of the best turned out in the English language, I do strongly feel that it is quite unfair to compare and contrast this work, Sense and Sensibility, with her later works. Had this been the only novel Ms Austen had ever written, she still would have been listed with the literary greats on this work along. It has all of the elements that her later works include; the insight to human nature, the subtle humor, the fantastic dialog, the complicated relationships, the unfortunate conditions many young ladies of that class suffered during this period of time and the raw emotions that are so understated in each and every line of her work. I hate to beat dead horses, but the dialog in this work is along with the read!I take my peevishness further in noting that many refer to the situations, manners, mannerisms, attitudes and situations as being typically of those of only this period on English history. As far as I can tell, most, if not all, of the situations encountered by the Dashwood sisters are with us even to this day and are merely cloaked in different clothing. Emotions are emotions are timeless and what was true then, is true now, the truth just manifests itself a bit differently now than it did then. We all want love, security, understanding and companionship; have since time began and I suspect we will until time ends. Not all that much has changed. I also strongly feel that if you feel that there is not a definite class system in existence today, as there was at the time this novel was written, then you well may be missing something. It may no be a blatant now as then, but it certainly is alive and well even to this day.Now all that being said, the bottom line is that this one fine bit of writing; a timeless bit of writing and the reader will certainly be much richer for having read it, and as a matter of fact, it does not hurt to give this one, along with Austen's other works, multiple readings over the years. There is much we can learn here. I've often told people that they should read at least one of Jane Austen's books each year just to keep in the front of their minds what writing is all about. And for goodness sakes, I agree fully that there have been some very fine film adaptations of this work over the years and I certainly do recommend that you see them (I personally love several of them), but READ the book also! You are missing out on a real treat if you do not.This review was of the Penquin Classic edition, one of quite a number of editions I have laying around the house. Between my wife and myself, the get quite a workout...I do not know what I would do with out good old Penquin.

The younger sister, Marianne, represents \\"sense,\\" as she views and lives life in a romantic, sensual, and dramatic manner, while Elinor, representing \\"sensibility,\\" is more reserved in her expressions of feeling, and her pragmatic, moral way of making decisions. While treating one other, at times, with brutal honesty, attacking the other for who they are not, each eventually learns that there is a deep love between them. Additionally, the sisters learn that there is something of value in the dominant characteristics of the other's personality, and this works to positive effect for the love lives of both as time passes.Austen paints a picture of early nineteenth century England, especially with a focus on the position of women, who were largely dependent on marriage for their survival. Yet, in spite of this, Austen's characters hunger for their dreams, for love that does not compromise their existence merely to pragmatic ends. In narrative terms, Austen's genius never fails to come through with unseen twists in plot and beautiful, moving dialogue that has been kept at bay to be delivered to the anxiously-waiting reader at just the right moment."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"i didnt like this one as much as i have like some of austens other works. there just seems to be some element of fun missing from it."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness.

But having re-read it recently (it was the first selection for our Jane Austen Book Group on The Book Club Forum), I found myself falling in love with the story for the first time. Elinor is a heroine that one can easily love and respect, especially in the way she controls, and yet deeply feels her emotions. Marianne, however, did grate on my nerves some, but I respect her allowing herself to give herself completely to Willoughby. Elinor and Marianne really do seem like opposite sides of the same coin: one hold everything in, one lets everything out.This book also has some of the best comic characters, especially Mrs. Jennings, the jolly matchmaker. One has to admit how uninteresting her life has to be if her ambition is to marry off every eligible young woman she meets! I also think that Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother and sister-in-law are hilarious in their coldness and selfishness. You can tell that John likes to think of himself as charitable toward his sisters, but in reality he is completely self-centered.

I earlier enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and just finished Sense and Sensibility. It is clear to my why this is a classic. It is a fine romance and a great study in character. It highlights how outward appearances and popularity are not necessarily the most important characteristics. The heroes and heroines in this book have their flaws, but are easy to like and root for. The bad guys are not all bad, and do have some redeeming qualities. This is classic 19th century literature of which I am a fan.The reader for this audio book is Susannah Harker.

(and yes, the 21st century reader will need to be patient with the language, but the novel is well worth it.)"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is very good--but as one of Austen's earliest works, it's just not her best. That's not a criticism, merely an opinion. And wherever one thinks this falls in the Austen cannon, everyone should read S&S.; Because even when Austen is not at her best, she's is much better than most 19th century authors. There is the humor and romance one comes to expect in a JA yarn, however here it is not so finely honed. Also, there are no minor characters of the caliber of Lady Catherine de Bourgh or Mr. Collins. However, most novels don't have minor characters as compelling, so again chalk this up as observation.The one rub I do have with the plot is Elinor's love for Edward Ferrars. Frankly, Edward is more than a bit of a drip, and it is hard to imagine him inspiring love much less devotion. A bit more believable but still odd is Marianne's transformation (after recovering from death's door because of a broken heart). Once truly, madly, deeply in love with Willoughby, after a period of convalescence and introspection she transfers her affections to the not-it-the-least alike Col. Brandon. It's rather pat, and though plausible, it is just barely so.It is a vast improvement over Northanger Abbey, JA's earliest work; showing the writer to be well on her way to the style and substance of her later masterpieces."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen has a way of writing that pulls you in, or at least for me.Sense and Sensibility is about two sister struggling through the trials of relationships, and doing their best to keep their senses. I specifically liked this copy because of its look. The cover and design is simply beautiful, and that of an older book you'd find in a forgotten bookstore. I saw many copies of this book, but this one caught my eye."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Since I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice so much, I thought I would follow up with Austen's first book Sense and Sensibility. Sadly disappointing. Although Austen's excellent writing style is evident here in her first attempt, the plot is maudlin and predictable. Two sisters, one beautiful, sweet, and trusting and the other more prosaic in appearance, but wise beyond her 19 years (if this sounds a lot like P & P it is because it is) alternate their time between the rural English countryside and cosmopolitan London. The more comely of the two is enamored with a dashing chap who turns out to be a cad. Dumped unceremoniously by said cad, she proceeds to mope and weep through 150 pages. A good smack to the chops would do her a world of good, but sadly never happens. In the end every thing works out, more or less, in a contrived and unbelievable manner and every one lives happily ever after.Most interesting aspect of the book is the description of British customs, class distinctions and the courting ritual. Also, it is remarkable how little has changed in the English language in the 200 years since this book was written. Austen is a superb stylist, but beyond the fascinating historical descriptions of the British upper classes, circa 1790, there is little there here(to paraphrase Gertrude Stein's description of Oakland, California)."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I used to wonder why so many people preferred Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. What differences were dynamic enough to make so many people sway? I read the novel and was intrigued, yet not as much as I was when reading Pride and Prejudice.Sense and Sensibility is a delightful story with characters easy to fall in love with. You automatically root for Elinor at the drop of a hat, and though we prefer to think of Marianne as someone completely different from ourselves, we resist reproaching her and root for her instead. Though I wouldn't call it Austen's best, this book is a great way to pass time, especially on a shaded porch swing in a drizzle."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen begins in her first novel what for her was to be her life long concern: what is the proper role that society should take in the relationship between men and women? In this novel at least, her response is that potential lovers must strike a balance between accepting the limitations upon romance imposed by a society that was ruled by a complex web of social, political, and legal restrictions and rejecting or at least tactfully ignoring those restrictions and thus incurring the wrath of an outraged society that does not easily suffer its laws flouted. In her later novels, Austen implies that wit may be a leavening agent (as in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) that may succeed where pure sense comes up short or raw emotion may be used (as in PERSUASION) for the same purpose.Unlike in her later novels, Austen divides her heroine into two psychologically different young women. There is Elinor Dashwood, who possesses sense in abundance, and then there is her sister Marianne, who cultivates sensibility. In the context of 18th century English genteel society \\"sense\\" refers not to what we would call today as common sense but the unspoken assumption that single women realize that they do not live in a cultural vacuum. The rules concerning the legal distribution of inherited property, the social rules concerning who may dance with whom at approved balls, and the need to marry \\"upward\\" all interlocked to place a velvet-gloved bear hug on women who had some very real and serious decisions to make concerning marriage if they did not want to end up as the next generation's spinster aunt. There is Marianne Dashwood, who is more than willing to make such daunting choices not based on the sense that guides her sister but on the trashy and sensational pulp romance novels of the day. Where Elinor falls in love with Edward Ferrars, a man of honor, if not of the hidden type, she makes her choice based on premises of which society could approve. Where Marianne has an infatuation with the roguish John Willoughby, a man with clear character flaws, she makes her choice based on her own artificially heightened sensibility of dime-store romance books. The basic thrust of the novel is that both sisters slowly and painfully grow to accept that a life based solely on the one or the other philosophy is unworkable. Austen implies that there is a golden middle, albeit one which probably is more closely allied to sense than to sensibility.In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen limits her view of the often convoluted knots of human relationships into a deceptively smooth and flattened perspective in a manner that would slowly change in her later books to include a more realistic, if not more necessarily complex vision that would allow women and men to interact in a forthright way of which even an entrenched society might approve. Though SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Austen's most popular book, it clearly shows in a restricted way the limits that her culture placed on the rights of women to call their own shots."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a book that describes the adventures of falling in love in the 19th century. Love back then wasn't as simple a thing as falling in love today is. Women and men had to abide by the rules their society presented- marrying based on money and status- as the main characters of this book had to do.The book follows sisters Elinor Dashwood, a sensible young woman who does not let her emotions rule her behavior, and Marianne Dashwood, a person who exaggerates and acts on her many emotions constantly. Their journey starts off when their father dies and they are forced to move out to the country to live on a very small allowance. At their new home, they meet a numerous amount of people who turn their life into a whirlwind. Willoughby, a suave and prominent young man, steals the attention of Marianne and an old love of Elinor's returns. Both of these relationships turn out differently than anyone can expect, through many twists and turns.This is a wonderful book that holds your attention through the end. The beginning pages that describe different relations, deaths, and monetary concerns were difficult to follow, as well as some of the different situations throughout the book. But Jane Austins ability to portray the hardships, and results, that both of these sisters had to endure, through different situations of love in the unruly 19th century, was without compare."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"If you are not interested in 19th century society and the roles of women, this story is not for you. The plot is excellent, with many unexpected twists and turns, but the way in which Austen goes about presenting this dramatic story is occasionally hard to follow. Although her descriptions of society in the 19th century are very interesting, they are different than society today, so they are sometimes difficult to understand.Austen presents the roles of women in 19th century society in a new and interesting way. In her book, women were expected to stay at home with the children, and they were not even offered the option of working out of the home. The women in the novel longed only to fall in love, get married, and have children. If they did not get married, they employed themselves in matching younger women with eligible men.The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward, but hardly shows it, while Marianne falls in love with Willoughby and, through her actions, announces it to the town. Both eventually reach a happy medium where Elinor learns that, in order to win Edward, she has to show her emotions more.

I read Jane Austen first in the 8th grade, and found it difficult to follow, and difficult to understand the humor. After the 10th grade, a student gave a lecture on Irony and Seven Common Uses as Seen in Jane Austen's Three Most Famous Novels. After hearing this, I came to a new appreciation. Not light reading, it is the type of book that can be read over and over, and enjoyed more as the years go by. I finished it for the fourth time three days ago, and still find myself dreaming, writing, and even speaking in the cautious and conscious turn of phrase that Jane Austen can so well suspend. While not a book for a younger generation, it is definitely the kind of book that should and will be read. Not, however, as sintilating as her future novels, and not as humorous as Emma or Pride and Prejudice. A good starting point to get into reading British Literature."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"The truth is...I cannot esteem it as well as I should like. It can't be explained in entirety, but I find the novel noticeably lack-luster after reading Austen's other outstanding novels. A plethora of secondary characters and sub-plots choke out a lot of the brilliance of its main characters. This is a rather surprising realization for me, being an avid Austen fan - but it is spoken with all honesty.

Pride and Prejudice would have to be the best book I've ever read, it's witty, smart and enjoyable and it's heroin Elizabeth is someone that everyone can releate to whereas Ellinor is quite pompous and boring. I wish S&amp;S had more of a storyline like the other Jane Austen books because I truly love her books but having said that S&amp;S is still a very good book and I'd recomend it for all Jane Austen fans.

I saw it on the clearance rack for $2 at Half Price Books and just had to buy it. I was definitely not disappointed. I have two older sisters myself, and Elinor and Marianne constantly reminded me of them. My oldest sister is full of common sense like Elinor, always thinking of the outcome and how actions will affect her and everyone around her before she does them. On the other hand, my other sister is sensible and romantically charged like Marianne. She lets her emotions get in the way of her common sense and is in the \\"right now\\" instead of looking ahead to the future. Some of the situations they were in and the things they did and said also reminded me of myself and things that have happened in my life. Jane Austen did a wonderful job of making these characters \\"real\\" and easy to imagine actually living, breathing, and doing and saying the things she described. Even though I am only 16 and some of the ideas and language in this book were hard for me to understand and comprehend (I am trying to become more \\"well-read\\" and expand my vocabulary by reading books such as these), I was still easily able to relate to the characters and thoroughly enjoy this book.

Now that I have started downloading audio books to my iPod, I can wear my armband and get tons of things done around the house and go for long walks while having my favorite stories read to me. The best of both worlds! Sense and Sensibility is performed by Juliet Stevenson and she does a wonderful job. Her voice gets a little 'nasal-y' (I'm sure that's not a real word.. lol) and stuffy sounding at times, but I'm not sure if she does that on purpose to suit the characters.

They are vaguely unwelcome at their stepbrother and sister-in-law's home, but they don't have sufficient funds to live easily elsewhere. Luckily, a relative steps forward to offer them a home at a small cottage some distance away.The two older Dashwood girls, Elinor and Marianne, are of marriageable age, and begin scrambling to find appropriate matches. Elinor is attracted by Edward, an awkward man who is her sister-in-law's brother. The match is not approved by Edward's family, who is more well-off than Elinor, and they conspire to separate the couple. Elinor is reasonable and stoic, and bears her hurts quietly.Marianne, an impetuous and emotional girl, falls for Willoughby, a charming man who seems to have good prospects and who dotes on her and the family. But there may be trouble brewing in their relationship as well.I find Austen's novels to be a fascinating glimpse into the difficulty of life in England in the late 1700s. The society is so complex and so rigid, and the characters spend so much of their time trying to navigate their way through the social restraints before they are even free to try to fall in love and choose a spouse.I liked reading about the struggles and triumphs of the Dashwood sisters, although I found the ending of this story to be a little abrupt and not quite satisfying."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible.

With Sense and Sensibility, I finish a read through Austen's work with her first novel. It is a strange genre, maybe, but I think Austen wrote as much for men as women, and there is something in her male characters, good and bad, for us to think about.Why Austen appeals to the Marxist in me, I cannot really explain. Somewhere, on the edge of her books, the world is moving, rapidly, from a feudal society to one the Bourgeoisies. Maybe there is an idea in a rewrite of Austen from the servant's point-of-view. They are, as I read, only inches from the page.Sense and Sensibility is a decent example of Austen. The characters are well drawn and do not suffer the familiar defects. The story is somewhat predictable, but so are all her story-lines. The story resolves a bit too quickly and neatly, and it ends far too abruptly, but, again, it is the same with all her story-lines.With S&S;, I find that I cannot tell if Austen is parodying, as I have always believed, or if she is not, instead, pining for the world she depicts. I think her readers probably wonder that about themselves sometimes.Probably I did not give the book as much attention as I could have, as I read three of her books in quick succession through the spring and summer in order to finish (be done) with her from my reading list.None of Austen's work can really approach P&P; and so, for me, was somewhat disappointing in comparison. I have also since, read Wuthering Heights and I think it somewhat eclipses Austen on all points except, maybe, that of pure language."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have come to appreciate this more and more. I love austen's works and the struggling characters and emotions in this novel is so accurate that it's scary. The opposite personalities or sense of that keeps this book intense. Their is intense love in this family unit which I find delightful and you are sucked in the whole novel."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I really didn't enjoy Pride & Prejudice, so I didn't expect much from Sense & Sensibility. But I found myself truly enjoying Austen's wit and tongue-in-cheek descriptions of silly women and men who can't make a proper decision to save their lives.And the DRAMA! My God! Did people during this time really act like this? With every 18th and 19th century book I read, whether it's Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, I am amazed at how it was so normal to over-react to everyday disappointments. We have mad people locked in attics and sad people dying of broken hearts. People marrying out of spite and people running away from responsibility. It's insane! If anyone thinks that today's society is any less dignified than 200 years ago, well...we may talk with more slang and have short attention spans, but...well, I guess we are pretty ridiculous in our times as well.At any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't call it light summer reading, so I'm not sure what made me pick it up and start reading it (it's August), but I would venture to say that it was just as dramatic and ridiculous as any other book I would have brought to the beach with me. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I'm a relative newcomer when it comes to Jane Austen; I didn't finish my first Austen until well into my twenties, and I'm still working my way through the set. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is my third of her novels, and I find myself loving the overall story but at the same time seeing where there are problems with the text.For those who are unaware, the story is about Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who are near-opposites of each other. Elinor is calm and stoic, bearing personal difficulties and disappointments in silence and with great dignity. Marianne is vivacious and feels everything to extremes; when she has an emotion, everyone around her is aware of her great passion. After the death of their father, the girls, their mother, and their younger sister, Margaret, move to Barton Cottage, where they meet several men who will influence their futures. Marianne quickly falls for Mr. Willoughby, a young, dashing, impassioned man who may not be a good match. Elinor is in love with her sister-in-law's brother, Edward Ferrars, but due to their shy natures, their relationship isn't always viewed by others for the reality that it is. And Colonel Brandon, a friend of their neighbor, has a secret about one of their beaux that is imperative to future happiness.In typical Austen fashion, problems ensue, with deception and courtship mixing in equal measure. To be quite honest, it's very similar to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", with Willoughby clearly an early forerunner to Wickham and Colonel Brandon a prototype for Mr. Darcy. But unlike that great novel, this one is slightly unfocused. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is clearly about Elizabeth Bennet, but \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" can't quite seem to make up its mind as to who the main character is. It's told from Elinor's point of view, but most of the story focuses on Marianne and her troubles, though the ending abruptly revereses course and focuses on Elinor, relegating her sister as almost a footnote. And, like some of Jane Austen's other novels, it does wrap things up very quickly.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is clearly a classic. It's one of the most beloved novels in the English language, and its countless film adaptations are proof of its greatness. But while the story is wonderful, it's not the best of Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's first published novel, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", has lost none of its charm and ability to entertain over the years. Two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, are thrown on hard times by the death of their father. Living in straitened circumstances in a tiny country cottage, their prospects for marriage are set at risk in an age in which a young woman's first job was to find a good husband. The two sisters will pursue much different methods in searching for a suitable man. The sensible Elinor exercises almost superhuman patience in waiting for the man of her choice to make the right choice, while her emotional sister will throw herself into an impulsive love affair. Their lives will be further complicated by the well-meaning and often humorous interference of friends and relatives.Austen's talent for ingenuous plotting and excellent dialogue carry a superb story to a most interesting conclusion with an ambiguous moral that fans are still arguing about.

Sure there were fewer ebook copies on the market than hardbound, but even a cursory search on Amazon.com offers over 2,000 Sense and Sensibility listings. How could they stand out in such a crowd?Enter the combined creative talents of Margaret C. Sullivan and Cassandra Chouinard. Sullivan, no novice to the historical world of Jane Austen (she is the author of The Jane Austen Handbook) first collaborated with Chouinard when writing There Must be Murder, a sequel to Austen's Northanger Abbey, set in Regency Bath. Laura McDonald, founder of Girlebooks, had recently prepared There Must be Murder for ebook publication and knew that Ms. Sullivan's meticulous research abilities and smart, fun style were a \\"matchless match\\" with Ms Chouinard's lively illustrations--a perfect pairing for a beloved classic.So- as Sense and Sensibility turned 200 years old, a fresh look was taken at the book. For the first time in years, new illustrations for an unabridged copy of the book were created. Characters come alive--not in a dated, Victorian tinted way, but with faces and expressions which display both sense and sensibility--along with charm, alarm and a variety of other emotions drawn from a book that seems at times to be \\"nothing but a succession of busy nothings.\\" Certainly most of the major activity happens off page, and yet, there is nothing boring or monotonous here. Ms. Chouinard has provided 23 large illustrations...and, in a nod to Hugh Thomson, a charmingly illustrated chapter header for each of the 50 chapters! These darling headers give a glimpse of \\"what's to come\\" to even the most rapid reader, flying by the scenery in order to discover Willoughby's secret and Marianne's fate.While Cassandra was busy sketching and drawing, Ms. Sullivan was hard at work, researching the allusions which would have been readily apparent to Jane Austen's contemporary readers, but have been lost in the following centuries. Her plan was to read it with an eye towards the first time reader--not creating a scholarly treatise, so much as answering the questions that arise when considering Colonel Brandon's supposed \\"nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins\\", for instance. (Incidentally, I discovered that these are a: an Englishman who became rich by doing business in the Indies, b: an Indian coin, and c: a litter carried by four attendants and covered with a shade).Sullivan's insights also help reveal the depth of coquettish conniving betrayed by the Steele sisters in choosing to join the \\"Doctor\\" in a post-chaise all the way to London, for \\"it seems that the party was made up of just Anne, Lucy and the Doctor, and as the post-chaise seats only three, it would have been a very cozy party indeed.\\"Although it has been many years since I first read Sense and Sensibility, I confess that I learned more, and understand it more now, than I ever have before. It is one thing to view someone else's impressions of the book on film, but reading the book again, this time with clever chapter notes (97 in all) which answer so many of my questions before I can even begin to ask them, I finally feel like I begin to understand the world that Jane Austen was writing in. Certainly, the book is far deeper and more complex--and better told--than any film adaptation to date.Along with providing ample notes on the text, Ms. Sullivan has added to \\"the improvement of [our] mind by extensive reading.\\" Included in this edition are a biography of Jane Austen and inclusive bibliographies on subjects as diverse as \\"Biography and Criticism\\", \\"Authors Having Fun with Jane\\" and \\"Fiction inspired by Sense and Sensibility\\".

This is essentially the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, who are different in temperamentbut experience similar disappointments in romance. It's interesting to see the contrast in their personalities in deealing with their heartbreaks. Prudent Elinor puts up a strong front, confiding in no one and worrying no one while Marianne becomes the very picture of wretchedness.It started off slowly but once you get into the main plot it's hard to put this one down! You hope for each of the sisters to achieve happiness in love, you smile at Austen's wit in observing the upper social strata, you condemn those who are against the sisters and their family and you eagerly read on for each new development. And, of course, there's the lovable supporting cast of characters who at first are viewed as obnoxious but become dear friends in light of true folly from others.

In the historical fiction novel Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen it proves that a story can be more interesting than what it appears to be. One character represents sense (Elinor) and the other represents sensibility (Marianne). The story which takes place in the early 1800's when two teenage girls who move to the country with their mother and sister to live on their cousin's estate. While there, the two girls enter into several relationships. Some will last and others will not. Marianne meets the \\"dashing\\" Willoughby and they soon fall in love, but when Willoughby goes to London things take a turn for the worst. \\"Old\\" Colonel Brandon soon expresses his love for Marianne which complicates things even more. Elinor becomes close with Edward Ferrars (their sister-in law's brother) and eventually makes it clear she has fallen for him, but when Lucy Steel tells Elinor a big secret her feelings are forced to change.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a romantic, comical novel. This book is suitable for anyone about 12 and up. Overall, I really enjoyed Sense and Sensibility. I thought that it was a story that was fairly easy to grasp and it taught me a few things about life back in that day. Very few really learn what these people went through. For us, playing piano, playing cards, writing, taking walks, and visiting may not sound that ideal. This is because we are exposed to so many more interesting things, but you learn a lot from seeing the way the girls coped with having a much simpler life. My only complaint about this book was that since it was written so long ago, some of the language is difficult to comprehend. I would rate these book 4 stars out of 5. In conclusion, I think that Sense and Sensibility is a excellent book that has a good storyline and is perfectly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and this my second favorite, after Pride and Prejudice. I've heard from others that they found the language used in this book hard to understand. I didn't have any problems but this was not my first J.A. novel. These books aren't for everyone but I definitely recommend at least giving them a try."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"i was so excited to order a classic book with such a beautiful and well thought design. i love this book, and also love that making my library pretty isn't a lost art in the age of electronic readers. i am so excited for my daughters to discover this book when they are grown and also excited for their admiration that will undoubtedly come from the smart design."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have just spent a delightful week with Jane and the editors of Bethany House. It is called the Insight Edition. It was with great anticipation that I opened the pages of this book for I had never read it before. I had only watched the movies which lent me great enjoyment. I knew, having read other Austin classics that the novel would be much better than the movies, and Jane (and her story) proved to be a most amiable companion.What sets this edition apart from any other, except Pride and Prejudice, is the wealth of added information from a Regency historical aspect, tidbits of opinion which evidenced delightful humor, and movie trivia. I even learned there was a S&S; under the sea movie which I had heretofore never heard.Astoundingly, I was somewhat surprised at myself because I truly enjoyed someone else's pain and agony for a change of pace. For fully 30 chapters, Marianne was just as full of passion and sensibility at Willoughby's disgraceful treatment of her as any movie depicted. Elinor was just as full of suppressed passion and sense as the movies depicted her, and of course Mrs. Dashwood was so much more sensible than Mrs. Benton of P&P; fame, which made for quite satisfying reading without the frustration of stupidity.If you do not have a copy of Sense and Sensibility for your library, I suggest you pick up this copy. It is well worth the money and is quite a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility, Insight Edition by Jane Austen is the classic story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who are different in every way ~ but both discover love. This insight edition from Bethany House provides the original story and include historical details, facts, comparisons to today's culture, themes of faith, and additional comments.In all honesty, I love this insight edition and am planning to also purchase the insight edition for Pride and Prejudice...and sincerely hope that there will be insight editions for Jane Austen's other novels. Aside from the covers being gorgeous, the content is a wonderful help and really adds to the original book."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I'm not sure how the die-hard fans of Jane Austen will feel about this \\"amplified\\" version of the classic but I found it very interesting. Having never read any of Jane Austen's books before (because I just have a really hard time getting interested in the regency genre), I found that this version actually piqued my interest.I really enjoyed the little tid-bits of information that were included throughout the book. Several of the comments made me laugh out loud! (Though I wonder if Jane Austen would appreciate the humor in it!) For example, about halfway through the book, there's a conversation with \\"proper, flowery\\" English verbage between Elinor and Marianne, talking about a love interest. Then, in the side note it says: [7] As Beyonce says: Put a ring on it! (page 173) LOL!I really enjoyed the \\"tone\\" of the comments and notes - it kept the book very current for me and made it easy (and fun!) to read. The notes are on almost every page of the book and include historical and cultural details, definitions from the early 1800's in England, facts and trivia about Jane Austen's life, comments on the characters and plot, themes of faith drawn from the novel or Jane Austen's life, and various other references.There are also conversation questions in the back of the book which make this perfect for a group discussion."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibilty\\" by Jane Austen has always been a joy to read, but what I love the most about this latest edition of \\"Sense and Sensibilty\\" by Jane Austen,published by Bethany House, is the fact that throughout the book, there are little side notes that help give the reader a little insight to the time and traditions that \\"Sense and Sensibilty\\" by Jane Austen is set in.At the end of the reading, are \\"Conversation Questions\\" for both Jane Austen fans and book discussion groups to use to explore the world of Jane Austen, and what I personally think is Jane Austen's work, but then, as a lover of Jane Austen's writings, each book is her best work.I couldn't help but chuckle at the Editor's Note that apologize for the living dead (Thank goodness says I with a chuckle), but what is offer is a well-edited, easy to read, trivia filled work that just helps bring a deeper depth into one of many of Jane Austen's classics.Personally, I don't think one can own too many copies of \\"Sense and Sensibilty\\" and this particular edition has quickly won my heart as a must favorite and I have to regret to the Norton Edition of \\"Sense and Sensibilty\\" by Jane Austen, that this is now my all new favorite and soon to be well-loved, well-worn, well-traveled and well-read copy of \\"Sense and Sensibilty\\" by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's comforting classic is based on the dichotomous relationship between reason (Elinor) and emotion (Marianne). Austen's greatness lies in her backing out of the box of 19th-century literary moralism and seeing the areas of gray in human relationships and within the individual. Over and over again in this \\"early\\" work (Austen was only 41 when she died) we see characters acting in unexpected ways, even while social strictures are so much in evidence. The most outstanding characters are those who go against the social grain, and Austen unfailingly creates classic foils against whom these interesting individuals can stand out. Entertaining, existing in a stable social world, clever, and funny, this novel is like \\"comfort food.\\" If you're in the mood for a diverting stroll into another century, let this book be your guide. I also highly recommend the Penguin Classic that has an introductory section by Tony Tanner (if you can find it). Tony Tanner's brilliant insights into Austen and this work deeply enriched it for me. But this section must be read after you read the book."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"So you want to read SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. Great choice! Jane Austen's first published novel (1811) can get lost in the limelight of her other \`darling child', PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, but is well worth the effort. There are many editions available in print today, and the text can stand on its own, but for those seeking a \`friendlier' version with notes and appendixes, the question arises of how much supplemental material do you need, and is it helpful?One option is the Oxford World's Classics new revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY that presents an interesting array of additional material that comfortably falls somewhere between just the text, and supplemental overload. This volume offers what I feel a good edition should be, an expansive introduction and detailed notes supporting the text in a clear, concise and friendly manner that the average reader can understand and enjoy.The material opens with a one paragraph biography of the life of Jane Austen which seemed rather slim to this Austen enthusiast's sensibility, and most certainly too short for a neophyte. The introduction quickly made up for it in both size and content at a whopping 33 pages! Wow, author Margaret Anne Doody does not disappoint, and it is easy to understand why after eighteen years publishers continue to use her excellent essay in subsequent editions.Amazingly, the introduction is not at all dated. The material covered is accessible to any era of reader, touching upon the novels publishing history, plot line, character analysis, and historical context. Doody thoughtfully presents the reader with an analysis of the major themes in the novel such as; the dichotomy of sense and sensibility as it relates to the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, the portrayal of negligent mothers, men represented as the ultimate hunter, secrecy, deceit and concealment, and the crippling impact of the inheritance laws and primogeniture on women during the Regency era. Interlaced with Doody's interpretations are her astute observations of Austen's writing style with references to pages in the novel and outside sources. The entire essay is well researched, populated with footnotes, and an enjoyable complement to the text.The notes on the text explain the editorial trail since the novel's first publication in 1811, whose subtle changes and their significance might baffle the nonscholars! Moody. The select bibliography is indeed select, and includes many editions that deserve recognition as the best of what is available in print on Jane Austen's life, works and critical analysis. One of my favorites listed is JANE AUSTEN: A FAMILY RECORD (1913) by William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, revised and enlarged by Deirdre Le Faye (1989). I was also pleasantly surprised to see a category including film versions and commentaries which is often overlooked by other publishers.The chronology of Jane Austen's life lists both significant events and what transpired historically in matching columns. The choices are relevant and interesting with the exception of two events that this writer found humorous; - 1795 Jane Austen flirts with Tom Lefroy, and in 1815 Humphry Davy invents miner's safety lamp. I have yet to be convinced that Austen's flirtation with Tom Lefroy had a significant impact on her life, nor am I clear how a clergyman's daughter living in southern England would be directly affected by the invention of a miner's safety lamp. Just thinking out loud here!The two appendixes on rank and social status, and the intricacies of country dance touched upon both subjects clearly, but briefly, using stories from Jane Austen's life to put the era in context. I appreciated the humorous example of how young women attending balls and assemblies were accompanied by chaperones, usually a mother or an older woman, who were expected to pass the time with cards or socializing rather than dancing themselves. In a letter to her sister Cassandra, thirty-seven year-old Austen recognizes the transition from dancer to on-looker when she writes \\"Bye the bye, I must leave off being young, I find many Douceurs in being a sort of Chaperon for I am put on the Sofa near the Fire & can drink as much wine as I like.\\" Too funny! Even though each of these appendixes is short, they do offer a list of books to explore further reading, which I was inspired to investigate.Since contemporary novels do cease to be contemporary the day that they are published, growing even more distant with each generation, notes can become indispensible to the enjoyment of the modern reader. Prof. Claire Lamont has supplied excellent and insightful explanatory notes, allowing for instant gratification with detailed descriptions of language usage, social and historical context, and character and plot insights. I found this the most interesting aspect of this edition, and reading the explanatory notes alone was like reading a condensed dictionary to Jane Austen, her times, and the plot and characters in SENSE AND SENSIBILTY.In short, Oxford World's Classics has pulled together just the right amount of supplemental material from reputable and readable sources for their revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILTY. I found very little wanting in this edition, and recommend it to first time readers, or veterans seeking new insights.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I ordered this version of P & P as I wanted a hard back to add to my few other hard back Jane A.'s novels.

Happy Reading!!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"The audiocassette of &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot; read by Sarah Badel is truly outstanding. I love S&amp;S anyway, but Ms. Badel's reading has enriched my understanding of it enormously, especially Jane Austen's sparkling dialogue. I don't know how often I laughed out loud (at Mrs. Jennings), or exclaimed with worry about poor Elinor and her carrying of everyone else's burdens. No, I'm not crazy, it's just that Jane Austen read aloud by an expert, articulate, dramatic reader does that to a person. I highly recommend this for those who listen to books on tape; you will cherish every word. Ms. Badel and Maureen O'Brien are the best readers I've encountered yet."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This is a superb reading by Sarah Badel. I can find nothing to carp about; she scans the language with such assurance and close attention to the meaning that she shows up the deficiencies in almost every other Austen reading known to me. In most cases these readers brush over and miss the point of Austen's remarks but Badel is so clearcut and precise she consistently illuminates the writing rather than obscuring it as so many others do.It may however be a little understated for some listeners. She is rarely overtly dramatic but then neither is Austen. I think Sarah Badel tracks the author's lightly satirical voice almost perfectly but if you prefer a more animated reading you might try some alternative versions."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"In these days of rampant incivility, when we know far too much about each other, I find it relaxing to escape to the early 19th century and immerse myself in Jane Austen's world. Okay, I'll ignore the lack of plumbing and the whole layered economic system that allows some people to do nothing while others are ground down with toil. Instead, I'll celebrate the courteous manners and the formality of even close relationships.The Dashwood sisters are in a difficult position: their father had two families, the first of which produced a son who inherits all his property, and the second of which produced three daughters who are not entitled to any specific amount -- only what the half-brother (and his greedy wife) thinks is fair. So the girls must find husbands who can support them. Austen's skill is that she can deal with these economic uncertainties and class expectations in many of her novels without being repetitious. Everyone knows the rules of the game, and when impulsive, emotional Marianne goes off the deep end, we are all caught up in the fallout of her disappointment. Elinor has a different disposition and an equally complex set of problems that she must face, albeit alone.The great thing about this audio book, and others in the Naxos series, is that it is read by Juliette Stevenson, who does a wonderful job. Her voices are consistent and her trained (and natural) accent is perfect for Jane Austen. Whether I'm in the car or hunched over a sewing project, an audio book is a perfect companion."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I'm not a romance novel kind of guy, but decided to check it out on my Kindle (free). I found the old English a little hard to read comfortably, but that passed. With all the hoopla about Jane Austin and her novels, I cought a movie during a plane ride entitled \\"The Jane Austin Book Club\\" and enjoyed it too. Don't be afraid guys, it wont hurt and you might even like it."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Though not considered to be her best work, Austen's Sense and Sensibility is definitely my favorite. The novel tells the tale of two sisters: Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Having been left nearly penniless after the death of their father, the Dashwood family moves to a small cottage in the country. Elinor, the more sensible of the two sisters, is concerned with keeping up appearances and not letting her feelings for the object of her affections, Edwards Ferrars, be known. Marianne on the other hand, is the more flighty of the two. She wears her heart on her sleeve, a heart that beats for the charming and alluring Mr. Willoughby. The two sisters struggle with their own love affairs and their social standing in what I would call Austen's finest work.I know I go against the majority when I say I prefer this novel to Pride and Prejudice, but I do. Elinor and Marianne are much softer, more endearing characters than the Elizabeth and Jane Bennett. While the plots are similar, I would say that Sense and Sensibility reveals more about the main characters - their emotions, thoughts, etc. - than Pride and Prejudice does with its main characters.Either way, I adore this novel. If you have never read Austen, I definitely recommend starting with Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Most people who have read Jane Austen will have read Pride and Prejudice. With a title like Sense and Sensibility, most readers will assume that the two books can be interpreted and enjoyed in the same way. Other than having three word titles that employ alliteration in the first and third words, the two novels are more different than similar.While Pride and Prejudice is primarily about miscommunication, Sense and Sensibility is about the maturation of two sisters as they find themselves confronted by adversity. The former topic allows Ms. Austen more room to roam, but within the later topic she has plenty of opportunities to display her story telling and comic talents. While maturation is an important sub theme in Pride and Prejudice, you see maturation better developed in Sense and Sensibility.When their father dies, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret find themselves in exile from their family home with their mother. The family estate had been left to their half brother whom their father exhorted to take care of them. But that promise is soon diluted into doing almost nothing through the selfishness of his wife and his vacillation. A relative kindly offers them a country cottage near his home and takes obvious pleasure in their company.At this modest new home, Elinor found herself entertaining the welcome attentions of Edward Ferrars. Elinor's younger sister, Marianne, is all aflutter over John Willoughby who seems to be committed to her. In fact, everyone assumes that there will soon be wedding bells for Marianne and Willoughby.All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways.In vintage Jane Austen style, all bets are off near the end of the book as characters take unexpected steps that open up new possibilities. There's no one quite like Jane Austen for pulling great twists in her romantic comedies. These twists will cause your jaw to drop.Try not to compare this book to Pride and Prejudice. It's clearly a lesser work, but one that can certainly be enjoyed in its own right."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's 1811 novel, her first published, \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" receives a grand treatment in this Broadview Literary Texts edition, edited by Kathleen James-Cavan. Anyone who knows me knows how I doat on Jane Austen, and for the first time reading her in a Broadview edition, I find myself doating excessively. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first public exposure of Austen's masterful characterization, plotting, and satire to reach the reading public of the Romantic Era. Austen thrives on what I like to call 'the middle of the book,' writing the situations that complicate the lives of her characters, better than almost anyone - almost, it seems, preferring getting her characters and readers in a position to learn from their mistakes, than actually getting them out.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" begins with the illogic of early 19th century British inheritance law. The hereditary owner of Norland Park is on his deathbed, and invites the heirs of his estate, the Dashwood family, to reside at Norland. The Dashwood's and their three daughters come to live there, but are put into jeopardy soon after by the demise of both Mr. Dashwoods - bringing the next male heir (and the girls' half-brother), John Dashwood and his manipulative wife, Fanny to Norland. Greedy as they are, John and his wife soon drive their half-sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, along with their mother, out of Norland, Sussex, to the Devonshire countryside. Here in Devonshire, in a small cottage, and at a considerably reduced income, the Dashwood sisters and their mother struggle to rebuild their life, while the two eldest daughters, Elinor, 19, and Marianne, 17, try to deal with life and love in the English countryside.Like the well-known \\"Pride (Darcy) and Prejudice (Bennet),\\" \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"s title can be seen to refer to the character traits that mark its two principle characters - Sense on the side of the Enlightenment-influenced, almost certainly emotionally-repressed Elinor, and the overfine Sensibility of Marianne, a great admirer of dead leaves and the dirty ground. As opposed to the former novel, Austen does not really disparage either, except when carried to excess, as each young woman does, instead seeking, as was popular during the period, to reconcile, or strike a balance between rational logic and emotional response. In their love affairs, Elinor's with a distant cousin, the diffident and somewhat mysterious 24-year old Edward Ferrars, and Marianne's with a younger, and very handsome rogue John Willoughby, the young ladies' moral, social, and aesthetic principles are put to the test. While Elinor and Marianne are two of the most cultured, educated, and refined characters in the novel, and while Austen certainly privileges the country over the London metropolis, she makes clear that the ladies' limited interaction with society at large leaves them in a kind of sheltered ignorance which they must come to terms with, both for their sakes and for the sake of their lovers.Austen always does a great job with her minor characters, especially those who serve in comic relief roles - or as the butts of her satire, and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is no different. In their avarice and greed, John and Fanny Dashwood are the epitome of wholly uncultured social climbers and mindless landowners. In her less than refined, but wholly maternal attitudes toward the Miss Dashwoods, Mrs. Jennings (mother of the neglected, but ever cheerful wife Charlotte Palmer and the reticent to a fault Lady Middleton) is as amusing a character, and as warm a mother as one will find in Austen. Colonel Brandon is a fit counterpart to Mrs. Jennings, in his reserved melancholy, while caring just as much about those around him as Mrs. Jennings. The comic pairings of Mr. Palmer and Sir John Middleton with their wives is absolute genius, both being the mirror opposite in style and attitude to their wives - and in particular the relationship between the Palmers, including the continual laughing of Charlotte at the fact that Mr. Palmer \\"never listens to me\\" and \\"never tells me anything,\\" is both highly entertaining, and at the same time, one of the most troubling relationships in the novel.I've praised James-Cavan's handling of this Broadview edition, and now may be a good time to say some more on that head. Broadview and its editors, like the people who put together the Norton Critical Editions, concern themselves with really presenting literary texts in a solid foundation of cultural, theoretical, and critical contexts. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" contains a real treasure trove of such material - the two contemporary reviews of Austen's novel from 1812, generous selections of essays from the late 1700's and early 1800's on contemporary debates on the meanings of the words \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility,\\" and on the cult of sensibility and the picturesque. Also included are exerpts from poems referenced by Marianne throughout the novel, illustrations of the vehicles they travel in, and a map of the character's London residences. James-Cavan's excellent introduction also lays out the novel's issues in their contemporary, cultural, critical, and theoretical contexts, none more obtrusive than any other, and all quite helpful. Altogether, the Broadview \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a tremendous edition for Austen scholars and casual Janeites alike."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austin is one of my favorite authors. I think that \\"Persuasion\\" is her best novel, with both \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride And Prejudice\\" tied for second place. \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is an absolutely wonderful book, capturing beautifully the English Regency period's mores, manners, and lifestyles. The central theme deals with the extreme differences in temperaments between two sisters, and the eventual reconciliation and moderation of both their characters and temperaments.Marianne Dashwood is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters, is much more practical and sensible. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Elinor does have a wonderful, dry sense of humor, and her witty comments enhance the novel. Throughout most of the narrative, Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she dearly loves, is too cold, and restrained - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. She is obviously judgmental concerning Elinor's reticence to freely express her emotions, and she also pities Elinor, for her perceived inadequacies. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute.The story opens with the death of Elinor and Marianne's father. He, unavoidably, has left them, along with their mother, (his second wife), and younger sister with little money. They are forced to leave their home, the Norland estate, and move to Barton Cottage, close to a distant relative's estate. Norland and all its treasures have been left to Dashwood's son, by his first wife. The four women have been left on their own, to pursue life, love, and loss in their different manners.Both Elinor and Marianne fall deeply in love, while at Barton, and each, in turn, are disappointed by their choices. These devastating losses, plus their adjustments to an entirely different lifestyle, serve to modify their temperaments and change their lives.\\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is a deeply moving novel, with biting satire, especially demonstrated in the characters of Fanny and John Dashwood, and Lucy Steele; and of course Elinor's fine wit adds much to make the reader smile. Ms. Austin's writing is pure elegance. Her female characters are well developed, including those in minor roles. The men, particularly John Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon are very different in nature, and not at all stereotypical. I loved the scenes at Barton Cottage with Marianne and Willoughby, and with Willoughby and the Dashwood family. I also really enjoyed the visit to London and the tragic ball scene.I found myself laughing and crying while reading this book. So with all the discussion about moderation and passion, Jane Austin, once again, brought out the gamut of emotions in me. I cannot recommend this delightful novel highly enough!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"A very difficult slog: this was written by an 18th-century woman, for 18th-century women (not even 19th!) And it was not even popular in its day. Few modern day woman would enjoy this book, and even, far, far fewer modern day men.Basically plotless (excepting cliches) and almost totally irrelevent to the modern reader (who marries for position nowadays?) The only value of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" at all is in its prose, but, here anyways, its quality is not high enough to be a saving grace. This was a stepping stone, but it is from here, next to the Bronte sisters, then to George Elliot before we get something half-tolerable to read, if we are reading for pleasure.Austen's prose is better than average, but it is not the perfect syllable/phenome-diction of some others. And there is nothing -- absolutely nothing else. In one scene, Austen attempts humor by poking fun at some random male character's superficiality, but her only effect is to highlight her own.If you have ever struggled with a Victorian era novel, you will be surprised here, by how much worse it can get. Though published in the early 19th century, this book was basically written in the late 18th century. Some 18th century books are readable, like \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\" Some are even, in part, very good, like \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" or \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" But the hit percentage was very low back then. The competition of years, of each author trying to do better than his or her influences or predecessors, had not really developed back then. There wasn't much evolution or refinement of entertainment back then because the market had yet to develop.Jane Austen not only never saw a movie, she probably never dreamed of one. She was writing in an agrarian age, before the invention of the steam locomotive or the telegraph. She probably had no conception of an edited, plot-driven story. Indeed, though the world she was living in was more similar to ancient world than ours, I would rate not one but several thoroughly ancient books as being far more meaningful and entertaining.I will be the first to admit most modern popular books are trash, but though this may be slightly better written, it is as superficial and brain-destroying as anything on the NYT's bestseller list. There is not a single scene of imagination, nor one character you can root for. I actually saw someone lulled to sleep by the reading of \\"Jane Eyre.\\" No doubt, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" would put him in a coma or in an early grave."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I'm sure if I hadn't seen the movie, (DVD) I wouldn't have had the least understanding of what was going on half the time.The book was very boring, with long unending sentences and characters that made no sense. Yet, I kept reading and reading until I was done. I think I was determined to make some sense out of it. After words and words of whatever, the ending came to a short, brief end. To this day, I'm not sure if Marianne was ever in love with Mr. Brandon, or she just admired him and married him because her family thought it best. Nor could I find one single reason why Elinor who was to have had some sense would have fallen for an idiot like Edward.The long silly relationship between Edward and Lucy was ridiculous, and made no sense at all. For the older sister to even care for a nerd like Edward when she was the one who was supposed to have some sense, made no sense. As to the rest of the characters, they were all ridiculous, pompous or stupid, and had no sense or sensibility at all.The film was much better. Don't bother with the book."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen delivers an interestingly romantic story of two sisters and their everchanging love lives. Written in a time when a woman's fate was decided by her marriage, the characters in the novel depict the role of women in the nineteenth century. As for exiting and adventurous, Austen's novel doesn't have it. This book was sometimes hard to stay focused on because the story does not relate to modern relationships. Although, the intriguing manner of the Dashwood girls did have me interested at times. I found myself laughing at their wit and quirky dispositions. I would recommend this book to an older audience who can appreciate a more old-fashioned style of romantic novel."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen wrote about what women in her time lived through. Marriage and society. Unfortuantly, in present times those subjects can become tedious after the 400th page. If you are not up to an extremely slow book, do not read Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I so much wanted to like Jane Austen and, specifically, this book. That's because I dearly loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" directed by Ang Lee with an amazingly good screenplay by Emma Thompson. Now that I've attempted to read the book on which it was based, I'm all the more impressed by Emma Thompson because she extracted the story from this novel and told it via dialog and made it interesting, engaging and charming.So I have to credit Jane Austen, at least, with having invented the characters and their situation. I've heard she was an astute observer of human beings and apparently she was.But her style! Reading Jane Austen was for me like swimming through half-set concrete or undergoing a root canal.Mark Twain made two observations about Jane Austen.First, he wrote in \\"Remembered Yesterdays\\": \\"Jane Austen? Why I go so far as to say that any library is a good library that does not contain a volume by Jane Austen. Even if it contains no other book.\\"Second, in a letter to his good friend William Howells, Mark Twain wrote in response to remarks Howells had made about Edgar Allan Poe:\\"To me his [Poe's] prose is unreadable -- like Jane Austin's [sic]. No -- there is a difference. I could read his prose on salary, but not Jane's. Jane is entirely impossible. It seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death.\\"I find Twain's prose eminently readable and agree with him about Jane Austen. I can't read her prose and I couldn't even if I were paid to do it.I greatly admire those who can read Jane Austen. I credit them with great patience and intelligence. I'm not stupid, but my own gift of patience is utterly inadequate to the task. Yes, I would put up the ongoing tedious annoyance of root canal to save a tooth, but when it comes to reading a novel, I can find no reason to put up with tediousness. There are too many other novels written by authors whose style is both engaging and entertaining.I simply have to have sentences of prose that hold my interest and make me want to read the next sentence and then the next and the next until the book is done. If after reading several sentences, I feel as though I've just endured a lengthy session of reconstructive dentistry, I just can't be bothered.It's probably not Jane's fault -- she was a product of her time and place and that's how they wrote back then. If it makes Jane Austen fans feel any better, I'd put Nathaniel Hawthorne in the same category. I've heard they were paid according to the number of words written, and if that is true, it would explain a lot. But whatever the explanation, I understand completely Twain's hyperbole that she shouldn't have been allowed to die a natural death."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"(Warning!! I do give hints to events in the book) Simply put the book is a romance novel that is very long and some what drawn out. It takes Austen pages to discuss how some woman brings her kids to social events so she can talk about them. Just imaging this going from one social event to another. I personally found the book sort of repetative after about chapter 18 of 50. It seems the only way the book is kept alive is by introducing new characters. If you are a fan of romance novels with one of those cheesy endings, then cheese it up with this four hundred page novel. I couldn't get any furhter than chapter 18, I got tired of nothing happening, specifiically action. Like in &quot;One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, which is an awsome book things happened. Not only that it was funny, but realistic enought to keep my attention. In conclusion if you like books were the entire novel revolves around the realtioships between people (soap opera) then this is the book for you other wise keep away."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Seeing how Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen barely makes any sense, I wouldn't even touch this book again, even if you paid me. Extremely long and mundane, Sense and Sensibility is a book that actually requires effort and stamina to go through the entire thing. To me, the three-hundred-and-fifteen-page book translated to absolute gibberish as I did not understand, nor really cared to understand what was going on.Seeing how the there was no purpose to the plot, I was left bored from the first word to the very last. I really did not see the point of writing a story about two well-off, high society women court other men. There was absolutely nothing interesting about that in the story. No one really cares if the ladies must suffer through heartbreak because in actuality, everyone does. Jane Austen could have done a much better job in piecing a more attractive and purposeful novel together.As I read, the more I learned about the characters, the angrier I got. Why does every character have to be a member of a high social status? To me, everyone was snobby, everyone was self-indulged, and everyone was too one-dimensional. The characters were too well-off to even sympathize with. I did not care or feel emotionally attached to any character whatsoever. Each individual was not self-motivated, and they came off as stuck-up characters. I was just waiting for someone to do something, but no, each character has to wallow in his or her own self-pity. People have worse problems to worry about than worrying about the problems the character has. I kept going through the story and saying, \\"So what? Who cares? Fix your own problems.\\" The characters were too detached to make me feel interested.All in all, the story was just bad. It lacked purpose and meaning. Although you have to admit Jane Austen constructs beautifully crafted sentences, sentence style could only take the story so far. If you have time to actually read this book, I suggest you spend your time doing something worthwhile instead of wasting your life on Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"....&quot;thoroughly unpleasant&quot; was how he found Austen's work, &quot;English in the bad, mean, snobbish, sense of the word.&quot;I wouldn't go that far, but those stilted paragraphs, those arid drawing-rooms, those aristocratic concerns and conceits (how to redo the parlor? How to arrange for the right guests to see it?) leave me completely exhausted. The superegoic hatred of impulse; the Dickensian pasteboard moralizing; the conservative exaltation of appropriate manners and self-restraint....The only characters I was able to care about in this novel were the villains--or rather, given Austen's sterilized offsetting of taste versus boorishness, call them negative role models. And even they did nothing more dramatic than offering an occasional cold shoulder to the well-bred and undeserving.But then I wonder: perhaps all this is some fantastic satire? Perhaps the pomposity and the Emily Postian fussiness is a deliberate attempt at humor? If so, I'm sorry to say it went above my head.Pride and Prejudice is next; I hope it's a more human work than this one was."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"when my friend read all of jane austen a few years ago and just couldn't stop raving, i thought it was time to give the old girl a test ride around the block and see what all the fuss was about. on first try i fell right off. it was like reading a foreign language. my mind wouldn't stand still long enough to learn it. now, though, with the continued push to read jane austen ever before me (the new book, \\"the jane austen book club\\" peeked my interest), i thought i'd strap on my helmut and give her one more try. a few years of meditation under my belt would surely slow me down and give me more of a chance to \\"get it\\", i thought.she's still out of reach. i was initially teased, even laughed once or twice as i started \\"sense and sensibility\\" but then....it's just soooo boring. austen's portrayal of elinor and marianne and the crew are about as shallow as it gets. there is no depth here in these characters. my mother even joined me in this reading endeavor. we started a book club of two, just to accomplish this task... strength in numbers and all that. but, alas, we were both so \\" monstrous\\" bored. it was a \\"sedulous\\" task at best. we have now named our book club the \\"anything BUT jane austen book club\\".the reasons for the boredom:1)i'm just not entranced by long, long, long sentences. proust gave it a go and did a much better job.2)i'm also put off by the confusing use and over use of pronouns..who really is \\"he\\" and \\"she\\" and \\"they\\"...i think if i'd have submitted this work in college, it would have come back with many margin notes on grammar, syntax and style.3)i think i got the idea of the social structure and nuances(where there any?) in the first 50 pages.. the rest was just\\" monstrous insipid \\".4)and for the storyline.. when austen lovers run out of austen material do they go on to harlequin romances? seems it would be a logical move.no more austen for this old girl. life's just too short and there are too many really good books out there."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I'm sorry the book put me to sleep, it took over a 150 pages until something interesting happened, stayed interesting for a few chapters and then got boring again.

Well, almost to sleep since I was driving as I was listening to it, afterall.Listening to the book felt like tuning into a radio from another country in a language I didn't understand. It took several chapters for me to really focus on what Ms. Harker was even saying! Her British accent is lovely, to be sure, but goodness it is difficult enough to tune in and comprehend Jane Austen's elaborate style of writing even on a good day. Ms. Harker's inflections were a bit odd. Time and time again I was shocked when a chapter was finished because it would be read something like this:\\"then they went to the other room (voice lilting up)......Chapter 2.\\"As for the story, what can be said about this Jane Austen classic? I had never read Sense and Sensibility before. Having only read Pride and Prejudice, I must admit that I found myself wishing Mr. Darcy would race in and save them all from their trifling worries."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Another winner from Jane Austen, I loved her when I read her in High School, still love her now."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Quickly shipped and item as promised and in good condition."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I tried very hard all through high school and college to be a Jane Austen fan.

Thank you"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"It took me a lot longer to finish up Sense and Sensibility than it really should have. There are several reasons for this and not one of those reasons is that the book is not very good or engaging- in fact, it is monstrous both. The school year started back up for me on Wednesday which took a lot of wind out of my sails and a lot of reading time out of my days. About a week before I decided to participate in the Austen in August reading even over at Roof Beam Reader's site I had purchased a copy of the Masterpiece Theatre/BBC version of Sense & Sensibility. I simultaneously watched the episodes while reading the book. I believe that this helped me to get a visual of what was going on as well as assisted in deciphering the prose of the time that the book was written in. I had seen this version a few times on PBS and I loved it very much so there were no spoilers for me, though it would have been nice to not know that Willoughby was such a scoundrel and that Elinor was going to marry Edward after all.Mmmmm.... Edward Ferrars....I enjoyed this book immensly, and I am almost ashamed to write this, but it is the truth and I'm striving to be more like Elinor in my life, which in one respect is to say more honest and so I must confess: I prefer the movie version better (the Masterpiece version, as I have not seen the Ang Lee version, yet.). I truly believe I prefer the screen version over the print because it was my first involvement with the story of the sisters Dashwood. If I had read the book first, I surely would prefer it.My favorite thing about this story is the fact that I could have easily been Marianne (or to a lesser degree, Elinor). Even in the 1800&#8242;s in England, girls still fancied boys who are jerks and girls still had a tendency to slight the good guys! When it comes to the opposite sex I have made numerous mistakes in my years of dating. I tend to choose the Willoughby over the Colonel Brandon and then rue the wasted time and the heartbreak caused by my own dumb choice. So, I didn't feel as embarassed and I didn't cringe as much regarding my past mistakes in dudes since Marianne was doing the exact same thing I did at her age: impulsively falling in love, flaunting it all over town, ignoring common sense, getting the short end of the gossip stick, you know, just basically acting in love and then getting dumped for the rich (in modern language: popular) girl and mooning over it for months. However, one part made me feel a little old maid-ish and a little pissed off-ish at Marianne:\\" \`A woman of seven and twenty' \\" (Egads, I am 27 years old!) \\"said Marianne, after pausing a moment, \`can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small\\" (very small, I work in public education), \\"I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.'\\" Gulp!I love Marianne because she is me, but my favorite characters were definitely Elinor and Mrs. Jennings. These two women are as opposite as night and day but I love them both for who they are. Elinor is so reserved and calm and cool and collected and everything that I just am not but that I strive to be. I love her for always keeping her cool and never going nuts and silently suffering heartbreak for MONTHS just to spare her sister and her mother from feeling heartbreak for her. If I'm heartbroken, I'm taking out a billboard and begging for sympathy and pity. Now, Mrs. Jennings, she is a hoot and a holler!! This is a sassy, brash little old lady that I pictured as Sophia Petrillo from the Golden Girls!The brashness, the sauciness, the rudeness, the likability of these two ladies is what makes them the bitchin' characters that they are. Neither of these ladies is afraid to lay on the innuendo and offend those around them, especially when it comes to relations! In addition to the talent of genuinely writing two such different characters that both become so love-able and appreciated and necessary to the rest of the story and the other characters, Austen also portrayed my favorite kind of character: the strong female. In an age of weaklings (see Bella Swan in Twilight) I am of the opinion that showing female characters, especially in this time when so much of their worth was dependent on the men in their lives. Austen blows that out of the water, and as the case with Willoughby shows, the MEN sometimes must be dependent on the WOMEN for money and status! Hu-zahhh Ms. Austen, Huzzah! Though each of her female characters are bad-ass women (even the deplorable Fanny- she knows how to turn John Dashwoods head and get EXACTLY what she wants, when she wants it, and how she wants it) they still find classy ways to tell each other to get bent, especially Elinor when dealing with that despicable Lucy Steele. This is what all women in every country and in all times should aim to be like and I am so thankful when I see these types of characters in books. So, thank you Jane for writing these characters into your works, and like Sophia would say, thank you for being a friend!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Such pretense on my part to rate a classic known to the world for nearly two centuries.

There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This novel was the first one written by this particular author and, as such, shows the talent that she possessed of telling rich tales full of in-depth descriptions of her characters. Reading this novel was not a totally enjoyable experience for me, probably due to the fact that the writing of a nineteenth century author seemed a little stilted to this twenty-first century reader.The wording was at times difficult to follow, but the use of words was masterful. In this present day and age of instant gratification, the flowery descriptions and the lingering way of dealing with the subject causes the reader to slow down to savor the experience.The first half or two-thirds of the book could have been made more concise to hold the attention of the reader. Too much time was taken in dealing with mundane things. There was little action in the first portion of the book. In fact, there were times that she could have taken a less circuitous route to tell her tale.Miss Austen did an excellent job of describing the mores of the upper and high class society. She employed the use of humor and satire in her writing. The overly dramatic portrayals of heartbrokenness and disappointments were amazingly humorous. The social niceties were well portrayed - the practice of leaving calling cards, the pairing of \\"acceptable\\" couples, the importance of not marrying beneath one's status.This novel is a must on a reading list of important works and should give the reader a desire to follow by reading Ms. Austen's later works to watch her development as she progressed in her writing career.-----------------------"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have to say I loved this book. Most of the cogent points about this book have been pointed out already, so I'm not going to repeat them, but add some comments additional to what has been stated already.It's not Austen's best book, it's a simpler book than the ones that come after it, but that does at least make it easier to read - each successive book is a quantum leap in terms of style, narrative, dialogue and plotting over the previous, and Austen was changing the way novels would be written forever.Not that this is a bad book. Personally I liked it because it has something that's not so obvious in her later books, with the exception of Persuasion - the rock hard scathing judgment that comes accross in her letters - her obvious contempt for characters like Sir John Middleton, Lady Ferrars is searing in it's acidity.There are some excellent scenes - the scenes with Lucy and Elinor are classics in their own right, and the coup de theatre scenes when Edward bursts in on Elinor and Lucy, or Elinor throwing open the door after waiting for her mother when Marrianne is desperatly ill, instead finds only - Willoughby!Although the habit of the author colouring the narrative with her own opinions does get irratating at times, (a lesson she'd learnt by the time she wrote Pride &amp; Prejudice, which is neutral and unbiased) this still makes for a marvellous read. Marianne's sensibitility is breathtaking, and the revelation of how individual behaviour is fundamental in preserving the very fabric of society is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Did anyone else feel a distinct sense of disappointment at the revelation of the mercenary, materialistic nature of the otherwise handsome and dashing Mr Willoughby's character?

I had been forever avoiding experiencing any other Jane Austen novels for fear they would not live up to the high expectations created by the fabulous &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, however, when hearing of the imminent arrival of the fabulous Emma Thompson's adapted version at local cinemas, I decided to take the chance and read this book. I'm glad I did! This is another Austen gem. Elinor and Marianne are wonderful characters, as are all the others. If you are like I was and are afraid of spoiling your first Austen experience with another, don't be. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is another Austen triumph. Marriage, society and class are again given a unique Austen work over!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Being a fan of Jane Austen but never having read Sense and Sensibility, I approached this novel both nervously and excitedly. Reading any work by Austen is a delight, but I was worried this one wouldn't be as good as some of the others I'd read. However, I slipped into the language and time period effortlessly as I was introduced to the Miss Dashwoods and their plights of love and friendship. This debut novel by Austen is light, witty, and charming, and a complete joy from beginning to end.Both Elinor and Marianne Dashwood have fallen in love, but as the story progresses, we discover that both are going to face unrequited feelings in their relationships. Still, though slightly impoverished, the girls are taken under the wing of several friends who introduce them into London society and further the story with many twists and turns. Elinor becomes entangled in secrets she would rather not know, and Marianne plays into the drama of her love relationship grandly. As both girls come to realize what is really important, the story turns yet again and leads us into unexpected events. This is a truly engaging tale, and a terrific introduction to all of Austen's works. Recommended reading for all lovers of classics."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have read some works by Jane Austen, however, I have never read Sense and Sensibility until now. It is a story about two sisters, one is prudent and the other is outright passionate. You get to see Elinor and her sister Marianne go through a changing process by the end of the book.What is really neat about this book is that there are notes typed in the side margin to help you understand the story and to give you other entertainment facts of the story. This is helpful for those who want to understand the works of famous authors.I received a review copy via Bethany House."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"At last I overcame my inner resistance and read past page 1, which had previously turned me off with its dry accountant prose. Very soon, already in chapter 2, I realized what good use Ms. Austen was able to make of her special style: the chapter narrates how the rich young man, who had made a rash emotional promise of monetary generosity to his 3 half sisters, is talked down by his rational wife, from 1000 Pounds for each of the 3, to precisely nothing for anybody, all step by step. Brilliant.The main theme of the story, the contrast between the two sisters representing sense and sensibility, which might have been called reason and emotion to be clearer, makes me suffer somewhat due to the impossibly complicated communications between the two girls. None of the two can figure out how to shed the stilts that they are constantly walking on. The dialogues are not easily bearable, and then, frankly speaking, both girls are silly chickens in their different ways. Their mother is a silly hen in her manic optimism. The fact that the main personnel of the story is not entirely admirable fades away in the course of the tale. We find ourselves exposed to the horrors of English gentry of the period, and one begins to realize that the silly girls are rather admirably nice people compared to most other people in this story. We meet more monsters than I would have thought possible in the setting.The mother hen has to pick up her nubile 3 daughters and move with them to a cottage in Devon after her husband dies and the house in Sussex, which had been his father's, is going to the girls' older half brother. In reduced circumstances, they all make the best of it. Marriage prospects and related hopes and disappointments are the most prominent subject of thoughts and conversations.Compared to her later colleagues like Dickens and Trollope, Austen, in this book, has the advantage of superior plot design. The later professionals, in the Victorian age, lived by their writing and their constant output for publication in periodicals. S&S;, by comparison, is not driven by piecemeal design, not by the need to package publishable installments, not by ramblings from one subplot to another and back to the main story line. That is an advantage that one can appreciate, though it does normally not diminish my pleasure with the later writers.Austen's station in society is clearly reflected in her novel's world: the lower gentry, people who don't work for a living, but who are not wealthy. Her access to other levels of society must have been restricted by circumstances, hence she was wise to stick to what she knew. Her stories are sometimes called 'romantic', but hers was not the romanticism of the romantic school, which was essentially irrational. She was very rational and had a sharp eye for all kinds of falsities and pretensions. The novel's main effect on me, in the end, was a sense of despair about the lack of sensible life choices for women (and probably men too) in the suffocating closedness of the 'society'."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I am a die hard fan of Coralie Bickford-Smith's clothbound series. They are more then just a book, they are so beautiful they could decorate any bookshelf or be a present for someone special. Not to mention the fantastic stories she designs for! Puts a new, yet old-fashioned face to the classics! Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"One reading is sufficient for most novels, but not Jane Austen's. Her style, wit and engrossing storytelling grow more delicious with every re-reading. I know in general what's going to happen, but there are so many wonderful details and so much rich characterization to rediscover.I loved Sense and Sensibility more than ever this time around.As the introduction points out, Austen's novel was part of an ongoing obsession in the 1790s and Regency period with defining and assessing \\"sensibility.\\" Too little sensibility was repellant; too much, dangerous. Whereas a perfect balance of intelligence, good manners and deep feeling should result in true happiness!The two elegant Dashwood sisters illustrate the point. Nineteen-year-old Elinor is amazingly sensible. When she suffers reversals, she takes rational steps to heal her wounds. Whereas Marianne at seventeen is awash in romantic opinions and sensations, and rather wallows in her misfortunes. Both have to deal with lovers who cause them misery. The plot revolves around how the sisters cope.But Sense and Sensibility is much more than a lesson in proper behavior. It's a feast of social satire full of delectably flawed characters. Nobody but nobody delivers a barbed criticism or witticism more beautifully than Jane Austen. And the Dashwood sisters are captivating young ladies who totally engage our sympathies.Broadview editions are my favorites, with their scholarly introductions and appendices. I particularly enjoyed the detailed drawings of a curricle, post-chaise and town chariot. Now I can picture the vehicles that carry Austen's characters to dinners and balls and on journeys to town and country.Jane Austen began writing Sense and Sensibility when she was twenty-two and published it in 1811, when she was thirty-six. Why she chose to publish it before Pride and Prejudice is one of many interesting questions explored in the introduction."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Love the novel. Happy to have it on my Kindle. I purchased this, however, for the illustrations...where are the illustrations?"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Recently I read Austen's 'juvenalia', and when I started reading this book, I could see a lot of similarities. The beginning of S&S; has a tone of satire. The reader can tell Jane is a young writer, mocking many of society's views which were common at the time.However, as the story progresses, I began to see Jane getting more serious about her subject and caring about her characters. That was when I began to love this book. And it just got better and better toward the end.On a personal note, I found some similarities to my own life in this book. When I was young and in love for the first time, I acted a bit like Marianne, wearing my heart on my sleeve. I think many of us probably did. I loved this book and gave it 4 stars - but you can see how I might be a biased reader.Some of Austen's other books are definitely a little better, but this is also a good book. It's amazing to me that hundreds of years can pass, and a modern reader like me can still identify with these characters."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This is going to be a totally different type of review from me. In fact, it really isn't a review at all. It is more of an \\"ode to Jane Austen\\". I truly do think she ruined my dating life but I totally forgive her for it :)First question you are going to have is why do I have a picture of Jane (played by Susannah Harker) from Pride and Prejudice on a post about Sense and Sensibility?Answer: I listened to the audiobook version of Sense and Sensibility read by her and it was possibly the best audiobook I have ever heard! Yes better than Jim Dale reading Harry Potter (which I also really enjoyed)! If I am going to review anything in this post that is it. If you get a chance to pick up this audiobook version, you should. She is very good at making each character unique and keeping you engaged the whole book. It is unabridged so 14 hours long but well worth it.Disclaimer: Yes, I have read Sense and Sensibility a few different times before listening to it on audio. It is my 2nd favorite Jane Austen novel behind Pride and Prejudice. So the story is very comforting and familiar. I have the characters I love, the ones who annoy me, and the ones I would like to throw to the wolves. However, as with all great books, it always leaves me with the the hope that in the end the nice guy does in fact finish with the girl of his dreams. Austen is one of the best at taking flawed characters that come from a place of good and making them find each other.This book particularly appeals to me because out of all of Jane Austen's characters I am probably the most like Elinor. I am a little more open about my opinions but otherwise she is the closest to me personality wise. I would also like to think that out there is an E. Farris for me, as he is exactly the type of guy that I go for. Smart, Off-Beat humor, Loyal, Kind, and good to his word. So reading their rather understated romance always warms my heart. Plus, I love Brandon and his steadfast beautifully portrayed personality. He is the Bingley of this novel but Marianne takes awhile to realize that.So my rating: 5+My Recommendation: Get thee to the bookstore and read it!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Purchased for my daughter and her school needs (she is home shcooled) and she was very happy with the book, not to mention that the business end was a pleasure and easy to do as well.

As such I've been somewhat (stupidly) hesitant to read other Austen novels - for surely nothing could live up to that book!I finally have read Sense and Sensibility and I am sorry that I did not read it earlier. I must say that S&S; was a very easy and accessible book to read. The plot wasn't overly complex and it did not feel bogged down and dense like some old classic novels can. I think this would be a great book for someone who wants to read classics but who is worried or scared to.The two main characters are easy to love and I was wondering what would happen the whole way through. Without saying anything specific, Austen kept me on my toes and I was very satisfied with the ending.Now I'm off to read more of Austen's books!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"When Mr. Dashwood dies, the family estate passes to his son, John. The widowed Mrs. Dashwood and her three daughters are left homeless and with little money. A kind relative offers to rent them a small cottage on his property.The two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, find both romance and heartbreak in their new home. Elinor is sensible and restrained, so that even when she falls in love with Edward, she keeps her feelings to herself because she knows that marriage is not a possibility. She has no money for a dowry.Marianne, on the other hand, wears her heart on her sleeve. When she falls in love with handsome playboy Mr. Willoughby, she doesn't care who knows about it.Both sisters experience heartbreak before they find love and happiness."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Taking place in Norland, England, in 1811, Jane Austen astounds her wide audience with yet another uplifting and eye-opening novel. Sense and Sensibility explores the life of the Dashwood family, consisting of the new widow Mrs. Dashwood and her two daughters, the composed and affectionate Elinor along with the sensible and spontaneous Marianne. Inheriting all of his father's money, John Dashwood visits his sister Mrs. Dashwood and gives the three devastated ladies a good share of his inherited money. During the visit, John Dashwood's wife, fanny, brings along her sensible older brother, Edward Ferrars, who develops a very close relationship with Elinor Dashwood. Although they are given a hard time by Fanny, Mrs. Dashwood, and the later promiscuous old friend Lucy Steele, Elinor and Edward establish and progress their love throughout the entire novel. As their love grows, Austen compares and contrasts the trait of sensibility, possessed by Marianne, and the trait of sense, possessed by Elinor. She does this through the two sisters' interactions with their significant others.Just like almost all of Jane Austen's preceding novels, Sense and Sensibility dives into the themes of love and judgment. The reader learns how the characters in the novel become blind when they are in love, and the effect this has on their judgment.Although it is a great read, I do not recommend it to just anybody. Readers must stay attentive to the multiple characters that are introduced throughout the novel; readers must also have strong patience because the novel is written with the old English dialect of the early 1800's. This is one of Jane Austen's best novels, in my opinion. In her novel Mansfield Park, she merely spends the whole novel demonstrating the progression of love in a New England town. In Sense and Sensibility, however, not only is the reader able to explore the development of love in a relationship between two people, but also the progression of individual character qualities, such as those of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. In totality, this novel is one of Jane Austen's best works."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Once criticised as being \\"least interesting\\" of Auten's works, I entirely disagree. Sense & Sensibility is one of my favourites, if not favourite Austen novel. Perhaps not as \\"light, and bright, and sparkling\\" as Pride & Prejudice, it is still a wonderful and enjoyable read, and definitely not as dense as Mansfield Park. Personally, I could not put this book down, when usually with Austen I read a chapter or two a day.The dual heroines is one of the most interesting literary techniques here, interlaced with the usual infuriating members of society (John and Fanny, Lucy Steele), silly women (Charlotte Palmer) and men (Robert Ferrars).My only criticism of the plot would be the somewhat rushed ending, but the story goes through regular \\"ups and downs\\" and enough changes of scenery to keep interest.I often prefer the Penguin Classics versions of the Austen novels. They are easy to carry around and have comprehensive footnotes as well as interesting and thought-provoking introductions and appendices. In this version I prefer the original introduction by Tony Tanner, but the introduction by Ros Ballaster is interesting in its discussion of the opposing themes of the novel i.e. first and second attachments, scream and screen, and of course, sense and sensibility.My only criticism of the Penguin Classics version is the cover art, which I don't feel encompasses the true characters of Elinor and Marianne. While I appreciate the use of 19th century art on the Penguin Classics covers, I never feel that they truly embody the character (except for maybe sickly Fanny Price). As a side note, I do like the cover art of theSense and Sensibility (Oxford World's Classics)edition.In ending, if you are an Austen fan, and haven't read this, you must. Furthermore, if you are considering Austen I would recommend either Sense & Sensibility or Pride & Prejudice as first reads. In any case, the Penguin Classics version will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, guided respectively by rational sense and passionate sensibility, navigate love and heartbreak together in their own inimitable styles. The plot is simple and straightforward, with only a couple of surprising twists. This is good, though, serving only to clear the stage of contrivances and to give plenty of room for the entertaining and memorable characters to play out their schemes, hopes, follies, and humanity. It's this latter quality that breathes life and interest into characters who could in less capable hands have been reduced to paper-thin archetypes. In Jane's hands, her characters feel like someone you might still meet in a corner of England that time forgot."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I love the narrator, I love her accent.

But I think it is not uncommon for a foreigner to find some difficulties in getting used to her accent.I like British accent although sometimes I cannot understand them."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Okay, I wrote a review on this novel about 4 days ago, and I don't think it's going to show up on here, so I'll give it another try.I can't help but love Jane Austen. She is my guilty pleasure read, like a Jackie Collins of the early 19th century because her novels are just drenched in drama and scandal. They are not really a thinking man's novel, just fun stories to read. I also enjoy the romance aspects of her novels because they are classy, not like the trash smut you read in today's modern \\"romance\\" stories. I feel almost uncomfortable and embarrassed when I read a modern romance story. Well anyhow, when it comes to drama and scandal, Sense and Sensibility does not disappoint. When you commit to the story, it really takes you in. I really enjoyed the protagonist, Elinor, but I was unhappy with Austen's Marianne character. It seems as if Austen could truly identify with Elinor because she did a great job developing her character as level-headed, proud, and classy. Perhaps she took a little Elinor from herself? Now, in the beginning of the novel you get drawn in by Marianne. She commands a good third of the book with her story and her character starts off well developed. You get a true feeling for her impetuousness. She is emotional, passionate, wears her heart on her sleeve. The novel is so interesting until the end. The end completely disappoints. Now I don't know if Austen became uninspired at the end of the novel or just didn't know how to end it better, but it falls completely flat. Like I mentioned before, you get interested in this Marianne character and you know how she is, but then at the end she decides one day to become like Elinor?! Just like that?! An impetuous person like Marianne would not and could not do a 180 with their mannerisms. Then, Austen does no justice to Marianne by having her marry at the end of the novel. It is just so dubious it doesn't make sense. Austen also wraps up all the scandal and drama in almost 3 pages. How convenient! That was just bogus to me. But the rest of the story is so good I would still recommend this, especially to Austen fans. If I were to make a recommendation to a new Austen reader, I would recommend Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. It is more concise and it is a shorter novel."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This book, like her other books transports me back to that time and place so it feels as though I am a part of that moment in time."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"For the ladies can you imagine a world in which you have no career options except that of being a wife, a world in which everything depends upon how much money you have, and if you're at a loss for lucre, then you'd better marry into some moolah! You don't do anything except go to dances, mooch off richer relatives, and hope you marry somebody before you become a spinster! If you're a man, it's pretty much the same thing, except your career path is more open. You can do a lot if you have money, but like most of the male characters in Sense and Sensibility, why bother?! You got a rich relative to pay your way through life! Just spend your time hunting, whether it be game or a woman, especially a rich woman, if you're a debauched ex-noble who's lost his fortune in disreputable consumerism. All these examples pretty much sum up the world of Jane Austen as portrayed in Sense and Sensibility.Three sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret...Well, let's forget about Margaret, since she's basically a non-character in the book....Well, 2 sisters, Elinor and Marianne are on the prowl for a husband, a well-off husband, since their father has died and left control of his estate to their half-brother, who happens to be married to an uppity and greedy wench of a woman who cuts them out of most of their dead father's money and land. So the sisters and their mother are \\"banished\\" to a charming cottage in the English countryside. Oh, the horror of it, while a lot of England working class and poor were just lucky to find something to eat for dinner in that time period. Elinor is the common sense sister and hopes that Edward loves her, but she can never figure out what his feelings for her are. But she's not going to do anything rash to find out. Just keep a cool head Elinor. Marianne is the exact opposite, youthful, idealistic, passionate, and brash, and falls for the first guy that satisfies her sense of the dashing Byronic hero, even if he might be a cad!I don't know, something about this book rubbed me wrong, even though I thought it was pretty good. All of the characters just seem like parasitic bums, even if they are psuedo-aristocrats. They're lazy, judgemental, and obssessed with appearances, even though they hardly ever have the courage to look under those appearances to see the truth. They really have no activity in their brains. Like animals they are only seeking comfort and security, nothing beyond the most basic of human needs. There is no aspiration to anything. Well, except aquiring money. At some points in the book you wish all of these people had been in France during the Reign of Terror. Then they would have found out their real priorities. I guess, while I could understand the problems of the girls, I didn't sympathize with them. While the spoon they were born with was not silver, at least they had A spoon. It was left to Dickens and Balzac to see how the other half lived. To me, the book's only redeeming value besides Austen's excellent and entertaining style, was to show just how far women have come in the past 200 years, and how lucky they are for being born in the 21st century instead of the 18th!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a pretty slow book. I felt as if I had to wait and wait for something interesting to happen. When something did happen, I found it to be pretty predictable. I think that some parts of this old book have been used in other films. I know I am not all the sudden good at predicting what happens in stories. I think it was just this book. I was confused in the beginning of this book because I spent most of the time trying to get all the Dashwood people straight. After I became familiar with the characters, I started working on the plot. I have to say that the plot was a bit uninteresting at times. When it was interesting, and not predictable for me, I really enjoyed it a lot. There were several surprises in the book. I enjoyed how tricky the plot was. Toward the end of the story I began wondering how the plot was going to wrap itself up. The ending of the book was quite unexpected for me.One of the things that I liked best about this book was that it was so tricky. Once I thought the movie was going to end a certain way, but I was immediately proven wrong. I think this happened at least five times. The bulk of the story may have been a little dry, but with all of the twists in the plot of Sense and Sensibility, I have to say I was entertained. One of the lower parts of this book would have to be the ending. It seemed as if in the space of about three minutes everyone went from melancholy, to perfectly content with their lives.Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this book. Most Austen fans do not praise this as her best book. Most of them overlook disliking the book because it was Austen's first book. I cant be to sure because I have never read any other Austen books. However, after reading Sense and Sensibility, I am definitely going to dig in to another Austen book really soon."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Austen's &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, I read every page with sheer delight.

I expected wonderful stories like Louisa May Alcott's books, but then maybe I am listening with the wrong \\"ear\\". Maybe I was suppose to listen to the sound of the words like a James Joyce novel. I've read a lot of period novels written in that time and place, so it's not a lack of familiarity with the era or the language.I will say that it shows a very real contrast between the use of emotion controlled by intellect vs. total emotional immersion in the subject of romance."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen is remembered fondly for her warmly written romantic comedies. The comedy is subtle and difficult to spot for the untrained reader; in contrast the romance is thickly spready throughout her books, often too easily spotted.Sense and Sensibility was Austen's first published work. It is not her most successful novel. By the time Emma was written, Austen was a more successful author. Emma is funnier than Sense and Sensibility; it also posesses a more realistic romance. However, there are positive traits of her style present in Sense and Sensibility.Sensibility, easily slots into the genre of Romance. It concerns two sisters, unfortunately deprived of their family inheritance, and their search for love. One sister, Elinor, is sensible, while her younger sister, Marianne, is a passionate and silly romantic. Austen, in fact admires both her leading ladies contrasting traits, but it is easier to sympathise with Elinor. She puts up with a lot of torment in the novel but never allows herself to break down, unlike Marianne who almost lets a lost love end her life.Happily, there is a trace of comedy running through the book. As usual, the principal humour comes from the characters (the delightfully droll Mr Palmer), but Austen herself has fun with her narrative and enjoys creating set-ups to confuse both the reader and the characters. There is always an element of mystery in her novels. Who will end up with who? And this heightens the enjoyment of the novel.Sense and Sensibility has a lot to offer it. It is a primitive work from a great writer. It has hampered by the ridiculously happy ending. Marianne and the Colonel should never have matched. There is a gloss of reality (often lacking in the book), however when we find out that Willoughby (the bad guy) actually ends up living a happy life. It is a rarity in Jane Austen's novels that the villian (if you can call it a villian) of the piece finishes the novel in a merry vein.I wish I could tell you it was fantastic or indeed awful but I share Elinor's traits, in that I'm not one for exaggerated emotion. It's good but not great."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Personally, I think that Sense and Senibility was a good book, but lacks the wit that was constantly present in Pride and Predjudice.While there was conflict in Sense and Sensibility (both in the sister's jealousy and the the scorn from their lovers later), Austen didn't allow her characters to really address the conflict directly. (For example, why didn't Willoughby explain himself to Marianne, as opposed to using Elinor as a go-between?)While this may be the subtle temper which reflects Austen's style, it also makes it more difficult for the reader to discern any true sense of feeling.The plot is &quot;okay&quot; - boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy scorns girl. In Sense and Sensibility, it's done twice, in parallel. The only difference between one and the other is how each girl copes with it. But, from reading several of Austen's books, I've found that plot development wasn't the author's strong suit.Jane Austen's real strength lies in character development. Her major characters are well developed and dynamic. An interesting aspect of Sense and Sensibility is how Elinor, the logical and practical sister became more emotional, while the ever-feeling Marianne developed a more practical view of her situation by the end of the book.This isn't one I would recommend for folks that have never read Jane Austen before (read Pride and Predjudice first), but it is a book I would recommend it to anybody who likes Jane Austen's style."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I had to read this book for my college novel course. It hooked me on Jane Austen. I am currently reading Persuasions, which is the last book I have to read to have finished all her books! And then I can go around showing off how cultured and well-read I am. Blah blah blah.Anyway, this book has a really great heroine, Elinor, who is perhaps my favorite heroine because she's so much like me, introspective and cautious, and carefully controlled. Her sister Marianne, who is said to be the \`life of the novel' and \`more likeable', is actually a silly, foolishly romantic girl who is passionate and loving. Sure, you love her, but you don't really like her (at least I didn't) and you certainly don't respect her. Elinor however, earns your respect and admiration for her steady character and sense. If you don't know, \`sensibility' is the opposite of sense, it means emotionality and imprudence etc. (I learned that in college!!!) It isn't a common word nowadays, so I thought I'd let you in on the plot. Elinor is sense, Marianne sensibility, and you should be more like Elinor etc. It's a story with a moral, you see, like Pride and Prejudice (Elizabeth is prejudice and Mr. Darcy pride).The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is really weird; she isn't always after her daughters to marry well. She is looking for romance as much as her girls are, as opposed to Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice, who rejoices even when her daughter marries a good for nothing, simply because she's married. It was a good book, with surprising and unexpected plot twists that are pretty complicated, plus loveable characters and a good romance. It almost had me in tears at the end which is a miracle because I never cry, and almost never am moved to tears by a book or movie.

The illustrations in this edition are nice, but the story is long and tedious reading."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is more than 200 years old. The world was a dramatically different place in the early 1800s. The culture was different, the language was different, the governments were different. The entire state of mankind was completely different.So the question is, does a 200 year old book still pack a punch in 2005? Or has it become an archaic, dusty tome that alienates any reader with its unintelligable prose and mindless story? The answer, I believe, is a little bit of both.Clearly, the pre-Victorian writing style varies greatly from the Hemingway-esque brevity that is encountered so often in modern times. Often, Austen's writing is confused and cluttered. It can seem overly pedantic, trivial, and circumlocutious. There are entire paragraphs that can, and should have been, omitted because they are utterly flippant and redundant. The writing style was, for me, a barrier.The society in which the story unfolds; that is, the cultural background, is also quite distant from our own. If anything, Sense and Sensibility is a study in history. We see what life was like back then. We hear it from a primary source. And, for the most part, the petty pursuits of the luxurious upper-class, the countless balls and parties, and the mindless squabblings of money grubbing lords are fine. The reader accepts it as part of the history.The story itself is where the true beauty of the book is revealed. The story is timeless. It proves, refreshingly, that one does not need a massive war or wrenching poverty to create a good yarn. Yes, Elinor and Marianne live ridiculously priveleged lives (and often complain about their \\"misfortune\\"), but we all can identify with the romantic aspects of the tale. We can identify with the characters, the people, who inhabit Austen's world. And the characters are, quite simply, incredibly colorful and richly created. The characterization is where Austen shines.So the main drawback to this story is its age. If you can get past the age of the book or even enjoy it intellectually, you will uncover a gem of a novel. Austen's subject (unlike her prose) does not alienate us at all. Instead, it reacquaints us with the yearnings and struggles of love and friendship. If you can slog through some of the more clunky passages, there is a lot of insight and beauty in this book, as well as a fairly good story."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. It's a very entertaining book. A few pages into this book, I already had taken sides for and against the characters. They are wonderfully believable. Some I disliked; some I liked. The ones I didn't like were money grubbing types who must have been pretty common in that period. The one I most liked was Elinor Dashwood, the eldest Miss Dashwood. She was very pretty and had good sense. Throughout the book, I found surprises. These were unexpected events that twisted the plot. Jane Austen uses the English language very well. This book is almost contemporary in language and is eminently readable. In fact, Sense and Sensibility is a classic worth owning.I recommend Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility to all readers who want a fascinating cast of characters and a good read."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This is a story of two sisters, marrian and elinor, which, though very similar in some aspects, and share a very similar unfortunate love affair, are total different in their behavior and approach toward matters of the heart. Tough both emotional in both seeking love and addressing it, one lets her emotions take over just about everything else, and the other have better balance between love and logic.I'm not much of a period novel fan, and didn't like the emma tompson movie so much - so i wasn't too keen on reading this book at first, but as i got into the pace of the story, i enjoyed reading it. what i mostly liked about this book is the fact that though it was written a few centuries ago, the emotions describe in it, and the moral this story tells are still very true till today. the way we all need to balance our inner world with consideration and respect for the outer world.I've been helping two friends through a pretty messy break up while i was reading this book, and i kept quoting parts of it for them, trying to explain how the choice between &quot;being a marrianne&quot; and &quot;being an elinor&quot; is their's and how dealing with grief and lose might be effected by their own approach to love and life in general.I recommend this book to anyone who ever suffered from a broken heart and had to deal with a break up. It's inspiring and interesting"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"While a quick review of any NYT book review will make clear the many ways to evaluate the worth of a book, I've found that, with novels, 80% of my assessment can be delivered by answering two simple questions: 1) did I consistently desire to turn the page; i.e., did the narrative flow unremittingly retain my interest and curiosity, and 2) did the ending leave me with both the ethereal wish for the story to continue in perpetuity and lacking that, the more prosaic desire to immediately read it again.I recently read Pride and Prejudice and, having answered both questions with a resounding \\"yes,\\" expected more of the same with Sense and Sensibility. Unfortunately and very unexpectedly, I was disappointed. The book was successful in holding my interest but in a far from fervent way. Rather than caring deeply for the characters and anxiously awaiting the unfolding of their fates, my curiosity was clinical in nature, wondering at the outcome without particularly strong partisanship. Compared to the convincingly developed, full-bodied relationships between Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Wickham in P&amp;P, those of Elinor and Edward and Marianne and Colonel Brandon come off as shallow, cold and flimsy. To be fair, the ill-fated love of Marianne and Willoughby is carefully developed and generates sympathy. However, the lack of substance behind the Elinor/Edward connection and the lack of credibility supporting the Marianne/Colonel Brandon match left the book's ending with a flatness that far from inspired the desire for a continuance.The other missing factor that really set P&amp;P apart was the wry humor of Mr. Bennett. While S&amp;S is not without similar elements, they are primarily limited to comments of the narrator and lose the effect of being embedded within the dialogue of the primary characters.Is summary, this is not a book that you will put down with disinterest before finishing but is also not a work that will leave you exhilarated by the experience. I give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I've read four Jane Austen novels in rapid succession, having been rapidly ensnared by Emma (Modern Library Classics), and avidly seeking more of this fabulous writer whose greatness I was amazed to have only just discovered. (The others were Pride And Prejudice, and PersuasionAs with all the great classics found on Amazon, many readers have already offered excellent reviews. In these cases, I have felt little need to add my own, unless I feel I have something new to offer. In the case of Sense and Sensibility, I do indeed believe the need to offer my view, to do this book what I believe is better justice! Here's why:Many reviewers (which you may read if you browse other editions here) profess what is apparently the party line on Austen's works-- that while they \\"love this book and give it 5 stars\\", they (feel obliged to) then damn it with faint praise by adding \\"EVEN if it is one of her a. earliest, b. \\"not as poslished\\", c. \\"not as complex\\", or d. \\"not as funny, well-written,... etc. etc.\\"I must take issue!1. Even if any or all of the above are so, (which I could waste many lines on disputing, to no useful purpose), why would any of these attributes of supposed inferiority be relevant to enjoying this book for itself? They themselves belie such relevance by noting their own great pleasure in reading THIS Jane Austen book. If indeed JA is a brilliant master novelist (no contest here), any and all her books is worth reading for its own sake, as each of them, and as no doubt JA herself would hope. The only reason to compare the finer distinctions among them would be to recommend which of her books one should read IF one could only read one or two. Indeed, not a one reviewer would I dare say recommend any such thing! Sense and Sensibility, as does each of the other 3 JAs I've read, has its own unique treasures to yield to the reader, and it is for these that each must be appreciated and each and all read.2. Sense and Sensibility is a great analysis and example of the power of FILIAL love to transform a person for the better, and thereby to enable her to gain happiness. In my view, the interest in placing the two \\"opposing\\" virtues of Sense and Sensibility in each of the two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, is not simply to showcase the benefits and pitfalls the key virtue confers to the holder, but, much more illuminatingly, the value of the love between the two to cause the other to grow into a woman who can have BOTH in proper degree. Indeed, the book's ending will prove this!3. In Sense and Sensibility, there are many themes developed extensively which are not a focus of the three others I read, aside from #2. One is demonstrated in the character and actions of Lucy, initially presented as an almost deceptively minor character. (I wont say more, but this alone is a real gem worth reading the book for.) Another is the evolution of the sisters' regard for a number of important characters in the book. Each of these is developed and explained beautifully--the regard for Willoughby, for Mrs. Jennings, for Captain Brandon, Edward. These changes are effected not only by and within each sister, but by and within several other characters...with most edifying effects for the education not only the protagonists, but for me!4. Finally, Sense and Sensibility features key themes also showcased in the other three books, e.g., the power of real love to change one's character--one's pride and or prejudices for example (in that named book!), or the well-known to all (but beautifully illustrated examples of) wisdom, that how one reacts to love and the obstacles it creates or are created in its way, depends on character, and luck...but the love itself rarely is under one's control! And yet, of course, since each book's treatment of this theme is unique and reveals a host of unique vicissitudes it can involve, S and S and each of the others is well-worth the reward of the unique discoveries it offers the reader.I need say no more, and direct the reader to \\"click\\" all four of the above into his/her cart!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen.

I've read Pride and Prejudice &amp;Emma and loved them both. However, I was disappointed with Sense and Sensibility. The story of two sisters altogether different from each other could be an interesting plot ... if it had Austen's usual style. Austen is famous for her keeping her balance between too romantic and too realistic. This time her style is much too romantic and by no means both feet on the ground. The sensible sister Elinor is really a charachter to fall in love with ,but the incredibly romantic sister Marienne has driven me nuts by talking foolishly throughout the book. Still , a good experience and worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen delves into the heart and mind of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. These two sisters, once concious of and obeying the dictates of decor, the other given to the whims of her heart, balance one another perfectly.

This is a wonderful book which every serious reader should have in his or her collection."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen fans are said to be most enthusiastic in their support for her writing, and after reading Sense and Sensibility, I could understand why. She was a clever lady whose shrewd insight into human nature and English society allowed her to make effective use of satire, and her plots have enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested in what is going to happen next. The dull, dirty world Austen inhabited has limited appeal to me so I can't say the book was highly attractive (which is part of the reason I ranked it with a 6.) By way of recommendation, I would encourage a viewing of the movie version to help better understand the book. Emma Thompson directed a film that I found quite pleasureable."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

Was it interesting? Yes, in a way... Do I want to know how it ends? Yes, I think... Do I think the part that exists is good? Well, no not really. It's not Jane's best work. Or maybe it's just not like her other work. It seemed uneven--too rushed in some parts and too slow in others. Overall, there was not much character development - that is, we didn't learn who the characters are based on their dialogue and actions. Instead, we were mostly told what to think of them, either by the narrator or by Charlotte, the heroine. Charlotte has been sent, on only a very short acquaintance, to stay with the Parkers in an up-and-coming, soon-to-be fashionable seaside town called Sanditon for a fortnight or so. We are introduced to a varied, but not particularly interesting or memorable (yet) cast of characters over the first 12 chapters, which are all that exist of this last novel Austen was working on before her untimely death.As for this Hesperus Classics edition, it is very nice. Printed on good paper in a easily readable font, it is better quality than I would have expected for a small, relatively unknown, unfinished novel. Bravo to them, as I have no idea when I would have gotten around to reading this without the incentive of a nice new, pure copy (as opposed to the one I have which another author completed). While I don't understand why there is a rooster on the (presumably final) cover, it is just fine by me and I like the cover flaps very much. You don't often see them on paperbacks, but they are very useful for holding notes, marking ones place, or just generally making the book stronger and more luxurious-looking than a regular old paperback.

I have read many of Austen's stories and have seen the characters portrayed in movies as well.Plus I enjoy reading books set during this time period.I enjoyed the many variations of notes not typically in study / Amplified editions. I was pleased at the easy to read format they used to include the notes as well.(that the comments were labelled with symbols and in the margins near the text being commented on. The information did change how I viewed some of the scenes that I had previously read or seen which was surprising to me.I didnt enjoy the comments that were listed of a personal nature or that were there to be funny! Ranking of the novels characters which was marked by a frowny face or the smiley faced comments were highly distracting to me. But I know that is a personal preference so I didnt take it too highly into account when giving it a rating. (they are two out of seven of the notes listed!) Many readers may enjoy these comments and would in fact find them entertaining and engaging. I could easily see this text being used in a classroom situation with young readers as well as being read by reading groups / Book clubs. The Group discussion questions were what I thought to be well written and thought provoking.So, if you have met the characters of Pride and Predjudice before or are reading this story for the first time this addition would be one I would reccomend.Note: A copy of this book was provided by the publisher for review purposes.

Instead, this version intersperses personal observations, movie trivia, historical background, spiritual insights, and other tidbits of information throughout the text in side boxes.I would also recommend this for younger readers or any other readers who are not familiar with Austen's time period, since it explains some terms and customs of the era that they might not otherwise understand. Any Austen trivia fan will also enjoy it.Some of the comments were rather too obvious and didn't add too much, others were really quite funny. The added info/commentary was really a good mix of just plain good fun and informational. The conversation questions at the end would make this very suitable for book club use, as well.I prefer the side box format to the usual footnote or margin format for \\"amplified\\" versions.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness.

I didn't care for the inspiration notes as they seemed to almost force the story towards God (which isn't a bad thing, but just distracting with an already true classic story).I liked this book overall and it'll hold a spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Of course, Jane Austen is fabulous. Set in England's Regency period, the story revolves around the Dashwood sisters and their love interests. The difference with this edition is the inclusion of notes on the side relating geographic info, historic tidbits, info about the movies based on the book, theological reflections and the opinions of the editors about the story and characters.At first, I was put off by the constant interruption of the side notes. I grew to appreciate mainly the historical and geographical information, but occasionally felt irked by the opinion flavored notes. I think if I were choosing between a notated or un-notated novel, I'd choose the latter. Nevertheless, any Jane Austen book is well worth reading.

Her books make me laugh, sometimes make me cry, but always leave me with a smile.Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood; two girls raised well, but reduced to poverty at the death of their father. They each have met the man they want to marry, and are both convinced that the young men feel the same. Everything seems to be going along smoothly...or does it? Both of their romances collapse, and they are left to deal with them sensibly. However, both stories end surprisingly, giving each girl her happy, although not necessarily expected, ending.The copy of Sense and Sensibility I read was the Insight Edition by Bethany House Publishers...in addition to the original classic story, they have added footnotes throughout the book, explaining details about the culture and history, the films based on the book, Jane Austen herself, etc. I found them to make the book even more interesting, even though I already enjoyed the story for itself. Also, in the back of the book, they have added several \\"questions for conversations,\\" which seem like they would especially help younger readers analyze the story better.If you're looking for a classic romance, this would be a good read for a lazy summer afternoon.(Bethany House Publishers provided me with a copy of Sense and Sensibility - Insight Edition in exchange for this review)"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is the classic tale of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who share a remarkable bond of love despite their differences. Marianne is given to emotionalism; Elinor is refined and self-controlled. Both women indulge in unhealthy extremes of these mindsets throughout the story and yet they find that they are in many ways alike as they walk through life and search for love.Jane Austen is one of my favorite historical authors. Her characters are real and I found that I could identify with Marianne especially. The only thing I found to be questionable was the presence of Margaret. She was rarely present and did not seem to contribute much to the story.The version of this book that I read was very insightful. Throughout the story there were notes in the side margin that explained certain words that may have been unfamiliar to some readers. The notes also mentioned parallels between Jane's life and the lives of her characters. Having seen the 1995 version of the movie, I had some expectations as to what the book would be like. As with most films that are based on books, I found that I enjoyed the book more than the movie simply because the book gives so much more depth to the characters and their situations."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"From BethanyHouse, I received a copy of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition.

Every time I begin, I get so sleepy I have to take a nap. I loved the movie (with Hugh Grant), so I'm just not sure what's up with me.

This book also includes questions at the end for discussion."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"On the 27th January, 1817 Jane Austen began work on a novel that is now known as SANDITON. It was never completed. Her declining health robbed her of what she dearly loved most, writing, and on the 18th of March 1817 after penning 22,000 words she wrote the last lines of chapter twelve and put down her pen. Four months later at age 41 she would succumb to what is generally believed to have been Addison's disease.Set in the emerging seaside village of Sanditon on the Sussex coast we are introduced to a large cast of characters dominated by the two minions of the community: Mr. Parker a local landowner with grand designs of turning a fishing village into a fashionable watering place offering the therapeutic or curative benefits of sea-bathing and his partner Lady Denham, the local great lady who has \\"a shrewd eye & self satisfying air\\" and cares little about the community and only her pocketbook.The story unfolds from the perspective of Charlotte Heywood, a young lady experiencing her first trip away from her family as a guest of Mr. and Mrs. Parker. Sanditon is populated by a comical ensemble of residents and visitors who upon Charlotte's first acquaintance are altogether different than they later appear. Lady Denham's nephew Sir Edward Denham is handsome, amiable and titled but is prone to long inflated speeches in the most pompous and affected style in an attempt to reinforce his own notion that he is a romantic character born to seduce women \\"quite in the line of Lovelaces.\\" (Lovelace refers to the villain Robert Lovelace in Samuel Richardson's 1748 novel CLARISSA who rapes and ruins the young heroine.) He has designs upon Lady Denham's companion Clara Brereton who he shall either woo with affection or carry off. Clara is a poor relation of Lady Denham's who is maneuvering to be her heir and in direct competition with Sir Edward for her favor.Also sharing the spotlight is Mr. Parker and his four siblings, three of whom Charlotte is told are sad invalids, but after their arrival talk a great deal about their maladies but exhibit little consequence of their afflictions. Here we see Austen at her comedic height characterizing the foibles of those who attach illness as an identity and hypochondria as their religion. The one bright light of hope in the novel is Mr. Parker's brother Sidney who we know of only through letters and others descriptions. He may be the only character besides Charlotte who has the potential to set things in balance with his sense of humor and honest opinions. Sadly he is destined to remain the mystery hero of Austen's oeuvre. Add to that a lineup a nest of plot ironies to raise an eyebrow at business speculation and hypochondria, and a sharp jab at the effluvia of novels and poetry and you have a narrative that whizzes along until an abrupt halt just when we are hooked.The uncompleted novel is a great loss to literature but also to the characters who after a bright and comical beginning are left with uncertain futures. What does remain is more than a novelty of Austenalia. SANDITON'S levity despite the author's failing health when it was written is quite remarkable. On first reading I thought it quite energetic and satirical, similar to the burlesque humor of Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY. I then put it aside and did not reflect on it further. My second reading after several years brought an entirely new reaction. Austen has taken a new and fresh direction from her usual three or four families in a country village and sets her novel not about an individuals struggle but an entire community. Money is still the fuel that powers the plot, but her physical descriptions of the landscape and town are entirely new in her cannon foreshadowing what may have been an evolution in her style. SANDITON is a gem that no Austen enthusiast should miss.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Jane Austen's first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, tells a timeless tale of two sisters search for true love and the heartbreaking circumstances they endure along the way. Bethany House's new annotated version of this classic offers readers historical and cultural details about England in the early 1800s, facts about Austen's life, references about films based on the novel, themes of faith, and comments about the novel's characters and plot.Unlike many editions of this novel, Bethany House's version contains a foreword of only two pages and does not give readers a detailed, scholarly analysis of the novel and Austen's life. Instead, this book provides facts and tidbits of information on the pages' margins. I found this edition simple to navigate and many of the notes offered interesting and helpful information to better understand the story. Another unique feature of this version are the scriptural and moral reflections sprinkled throughout the book. The editors often quote verses from Proverbs.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen classics and does not need a detailed introduction about the story and the author's life.Note: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of reviewing it."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Even though it has been two hundred years since the world was first introduced to sisters Marianne and Elinor Dashwood's financial, social and romantic trials, their story remains for me, as fresh and vibrant as any contemporary story you might read of, experience yourself, or hear tell tale of today. I give full credit, of course, to Jane Austen. Her understanding of human nature and how to craft emotions and characters into an engaging story remains unparalleled. Add to that a delightful twelve hour and forty-three minute reading by the accomplished British actress Juliet Stevenson's polished interpretation of memorable personalities and you are primed for unsurpassed entertainment. Here is a brief description from the publisher:\\"When Mrs. Dashwood is forced by an avaricious daughter-in-law to leave the family home in Sussex, she takes her three daughters to live in a modest cottage in Devon. For Elinor, the eldest daughter, the move means a painful separation from the man she loves, but her sister Marianne finds in Devon the romance and excitement which she longs for. The contrasting fortunes and temperaments of the two girls as they struggle to cope in their different ways with the cruel events which fate has in store for them are portrayed by Jane Austen with her usual irony, humor and profound sensibility.\\"It is amazing to think that SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was Jane Austen's first published novel. As a debut author she showed incredible understanding of characterization and plot development. Many of the personalities contained in this novel remain the most memorable for me of her entire canon. The affability of Sir John Middleton, the persistent meddling of Mrs. Jennings, the droll indifference of Mr. Palmer and the malleable weakness of Mr. John Dashwood are played against the narrow greed of the unscrupulous Fanny Dashwood and her officious, spiteful mother Mrs. Ferrars. These secondary characters really make our heroes and villains shine, and withstanding the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, it is amusing to see how Austen plays with our emotions in guessing who the heroes will be and how the morality will play out. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY does have a few plot wholes and loose coincidences that readers will be raising eyebrows over, but it remains a novel wholly entrenched in the passionate joys of youthful love and emotional loss, cruel social snobbery and biting social reproof as relevant today as it was in 1811.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Ultimately, I enjoyed this book, but it took quite a long time to get into it. I found myself rereading many paragraphs, as I really needed full concentration for this one. I will say that the book did keep me guessing throughout. Though I knew that things would turn out well for the heroines, I truly did not know what was going to happen until the very end."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility was Austen's first published novel and the third of hers I read. I must admit, I did not like it very much at first. I found it too somber compared to some of her other works. I liked Elinor well enough, but Marianne annoyed me to no end. The men weren't that great either. Willoughby was doubtless a scoundrel, Colonel Brandon was boring, and Edward was a spineless wimp. That's not to say I did not like the book, far from it. Just in comparison to other Austen novels it didn't hold up.All that changed on my last rereading this year. It was such a surprise to see all the humor in the book! How did I not notice before? Yes, it does deal with some dark subjects but there are more than enough funny moments to go around. Mrs. Jennings stands out in particular, especially the scene where she overhears bits of Colonel Brandon and Elinor's conversation. Brandon is of course, telling Elinor he intends to give Edward the living at Delaford. But Mrs. Jennings, not wishing to \\"eavesdrop\\", can't hear everything and jumps to other conclusions. Another funny scene is a man taking forever to pick out a particular toothpick case in a shop, who turns out to be none other than Robert Ferrars. And I must not forget to mention Elinor! Anyone who imagines her as all prim and proper from the movies should take a closer look at the book- she is full of snark! It made me love her even more.My opinions on the men changed as well. Not Willoughby, of course. But on closer reading one notices that Colonel Brandon, while he may seem \\"stuffy\\" is actually quite the romantic. And Edward really is an honorable man. Yes, you all want him to just dump Lucy for Elinor but he felt he was actually doing the right thing by Lucy in keeping his promise to her. And there was the fact that she could have sued him for breaking the engagement...And he's not really so dull either. I noticed he even teased Marianne about Willoughby at one point. He did have some personality after all!So, all in all, the male characters are not my favorite of Austen's heroes, but I do appreciate them a great deal more. Marianne does still annoy me at the beginning but I feel for her more now, and admire how she realizes the error of her ways in letting her sensibilities take over all the time. The relationship between Elinor and Marianne is really well-written, more the focus than either of the romances. Austen's writing skills were not quite to the level of sophistication that she would achieve with her later works like Persuasion, but still pretty darn good! So, if you already love the book, good for you. If you don't, I recommend rereading and keeping in mind the things I noted in this review. I hope you'll learn to love it as I have."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"SPOILERS FOLLOWJane Austen\\"s \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" tells the story of the Dashwood Sisters, Marianne and Elinor, imbuing the siblings with respective liberal and conservative worldviews. The book is at its absolute strongest delivering illuminating commentary that, in some ways, validates the viewpoints of each sister.The sisters are introduced into society, receiving visits from chiefly the courtly but shy Edward Ferrars, the mysterious Willoughby, and the wise Colonel Brandon. Each of these men reflect on the emotional lives of the sisters, mirroring hopes, potential loves, foolish anticipation and vanity. In the two sisters, Ms. Austen creates a fantastic representation of competing and supportive sisterly, as well as sibling, complexity.A major complaint is that the book feels very creatively stifled, stifled in the lives of the women as well as in the events of true import in the story. In some ways, it begins and ends in the drawing room, and never ventures much to other topics which would be more all-encompassing. It's possible that Ms. Austen is making a sweeping societal statement about the proscribed lives of Englishwomen in her time. However, the storytelling features cast a general slowness over the plotline that precludes much forward momentum."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Believe it or not I had never read this book.

Sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, left with little income following the death of their father, go to live with some distant relations and meet men they wish to engage. However, there are complications, as both seem to be quite unsuitable.I was continually struck by the eloquence with which this book is written and the gracious manner in which the primary characters endeavored to conduct themselves. Did people really speak to each other that way in that era? How interesting that even one described as \`illiterate' can issue such a statement as \\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in sucha way, but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to beimpertinent.\\" The articulacy of the text was almost confusing at first because the poor standards by which most modern authors express themselves is what I am used to reading and speaking. However, that difficulty was soon overcome, and I found _myself_ both speaking and writing with greater vocabulary and altered cadence.I was also surprised that I could find a tale consisting mostly of the conversations between the idle members of British society so suspenseful. I found myself invested in the characters and their eventual happiness so much that I was quite eager to turn the page.Highly recommended.

The notes explain references and changed or obsolete word usage and are easily skipped by anyone who doesn't want them. The texts of the novels are the most accurate scholarship can now produce.

Having lost their father, they had to start life anew, since their half-brother and his wife were not willing to take care of them. So Elinor, Marianne, their mother and younger sister move to Barton Cottage. In their new home, they experience heartache and pain as they mature and grow.Elinor, the elder sister is extremely sensible, even in matters of the heart. When she learns that Edward Ferrars, the man whom she loved, was going to marry Lucy Steele, she takes it in stride. She is sad, but that does not slow her down. Marianne, on-the-other-hand, is very dramatic and emotional. When Mr. Willoughby breaks her heart, she decides she is never going to recover. She starts getting sick often and being melancholy. The story ends well, but both sisters learn to become less rigid in their respective personalities. Elinor realizes that showing emotions is alright and Marianne decides that living life in the past is not useful. Hence, Elinor gains some sensibility and Marianne some sense.Once again, Austen has outdone herself in this novel. Her characters are well-developed. Like in her other novels, Austen's writing paints a charming picture of the life and times of the 19th Century English. The story line is very captivating and Austen goes into great detail describing every aspect. However, it seems that towards the end she wraps everything up very quickly. She mentions Lucy Steele and Willoughby's whereabouts and feelings; she mentions Elinor's and Marianne's respective marriages. She does this without using her usual descriptive language. But other than her ending, this is an excellent novel.Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read Austen before, Sense and Sensibility is the novel to start with!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I have listened to all of Jane Austen's novels in the unabridged audiobook form.

Both Elinor and Marianne love each other and try to understand one another. Elinor tries to protect Marianne by attempting to counsel her to curb her sensibility while Marianne advocates her own romantic outlook to her older sister. What each of them fails to realize, until the novel's end, is that without the presence of the other in times of trouble, they would not have a leg to stand on.Both Elinor and Marianne take each other for granted and it is to the reader's gratification that Elinor and Marianne do find satisfactory, and happy, endings when they each adopt a little of the other's philosophical outlook."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Although it's still witty, the tone of this novel is not as light-hearted compared to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; or &quot;Northanger Abbey.&quot; This gives the story a darker and more realistic feel, certainly more depth.

We feel sympathetic when reading this story. In general, this book is witty, ironic, yet serious, warm, and very human. It's an irresistible and rewarding reading experience.

Elinor is much more sensible than her young sister, and her voice is always the voice of reason. But it's the world that Ms. Austen always brings to her pages that is so captivating. She more than many others can create a little piece of the world that the reader has the privilege of discovering and then learns to love, just like Ms. Austen's characters do.

Don't be hesitant to pick this book up - a year ago I would have laughed if someone had told me that I would be a Jane Austen fan. I'll never regret giving it a chance, so I hope that you will too."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Juliet Stevenson is a great narrator she is able to give each of her characters a distinct voice and her intonations are perfect. She makes the emotions of the characters and the situations come alive."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I love Jane Austen and this version read perfectly. It was fun to have the addition of the illustrations as well. They added to the book for me."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"All together, I thought that this book was very good. In classic Jane Austen style, this was a story that followed two sisters through love, heartbreak, and confusion. The story as a whole is very relatable for women everywhere: the classic paths of love that was meant to be, love that could never be, or unrequited love are all followed by the main characters, Elinor and Marianne. Another great aspect of this book was all of the twists and turns; you never knew who was telling the truth or what would happen next, which made it a very fun read. One of the only flaws of this book was that some sections didn't seem to have anything important in them, which made it boring. But when the story got back on track, it kept you \\"hooked.\\"I recommend that readers that want to read this book should read Pride and Prejudice beforehand. This way you will become familiar with Jane Austen through, in my opinion, her best book.So, if you are looking for a fun, but unexpected love story, Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility would be a very good choice."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Sense and Sensibility is an excellent book. When I started it I really did not know what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. I will say though that this book is hard to get through at times, due to the old language used. But if you stay with the book, it will be worth it. The characters are wonderful, and you will find yourself wanting them to be happy. The Dashwood family gives a &quot;girl power&quot; message that makes it even easier to enjoy. Also, this book is easy to relate to, for everyone has known a Maryanne or Elinor before, maybe you are like one of them. I could identify with Maryanne, because I am involved in everything (and love it all) and I know I share my feelings too much. Although this book will be enjoyed more by young females, anyone would like it, for it also has a lot of humor in it used to display the dramatic situations the Dashwood sisters keep finding themselves in. The book became even more enjoyable when I saw the movie, seeing this amazing book acted out was great. I believe all of Jane Austen's books are worth reading, this one especially!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"Boy meets girl, they hate each other at first sight, then fall in love. Only Jane Austen could take such a cliche and turn it in a beautiful story, romantic but not corny, witty, and evocative. Okay, the dialogue is somewhat difficult to follow, especially for those of us whose first language is not English (the first time I tried to read this book I just couldn't get past the first couple of pages), but once you get used to it, you instantly fall in love with the story and the writer. I have read most of Jane Austen's books, but this one remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"This is the story of the Dashwood sisters: the logical Elinor (sense) and the emotional Marianne (sensibility). I actually listened to this novel on audio, and the narrator was so good it was difficult to stop listening to get anything else done. Austen draws us into the world of Regency England, where women are looking for husbands, preferably rich ones, and men are looking for beauty, preferably accompanied by fortune. But there's more to this story than that. I found myself occasionally laughing aloud as the narrator read; some things that were amusing in 1811 actually still are. Jane Austen pokes fun at her characters, and many of their foibles are recognizable as things we would mock today. One example is the description of conceited young gentleman (many of the ladies refer to him as a \\"cockscomb\\") who is seen in a jewelry story arguing with a clerk over the kind of jewel-encrusted toothpick holder he needs to purchase. This is unquestionably one of the best books I've ever read; I highly recommend the audio narrated by Wanda McCaddon, who also uses the names Nadia May and Donada Peters."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"No one needs my naive commentary on this witty, charming, and rewarding stalwart of the canon; plenty has been written about Austen's novels. I merely wanted to report that the reader, Nadia May, does an excellent job here. I enjoyed all ten CDs!"},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"There are two free electronic versions of this book, both dated March 17, 2006. The other version ofSense and Sensibilitywas clearly a transfer from a free electronic copy -- containing a partially missing introduction, an erroneous index of illustrations (which are not contained in the book), and hard coded page numbers which just waste space on each page which don't make a lot of sense in a Kindle version and just take up space on the screen. Overall, this is a much cleaner transfer."},{"Title":"Sense & Sensibility (Classic Library)","review":"I had the book within 5 minutes of ordering.

Being an avid reader, I thought I'd LOVE to read the books too since books are so much better than anything put to the screen. Boy was I wrong. I just couldn't get through it. It's written in such a form that it's hard to follow and understand what she is talking about. I've truly had to read and re-read sentences and paragraphs to get what in the world she is talking about. Here's an example: \\"She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible.\\" OR: \\"The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation.\\" HUH??? See what I mean? I had to work too hard at understanding much of the book and it was no longer relaxing or fun to read so I gave up.

Changed my life and perspective on everything."},{"Title":"Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band: A Love Story- with Rock 'n' Roll","review":"The first reason I bought this book is because the title refered to the guitarist that left my favorite band (Red Hot Chili Peppers). Me not being the reader type, immediataly became enraptured with the story. I'd hate to tell you how the book made me feel, because so many emotions spilled out of me reading this extraordinary peice of literature. And I'm sure other people will feel other emotions, but in its entirety, it is too unique for two people to get the same feeling of the book. I highly recommend it, just as I would recommend &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, the final album John Frusciante did with the Peppers. Alas, the book is completely musical within itself."},{"Title":"Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band: A Love Story- with Rock 'n' Roll","review":"This book captured me from the first chapter - it lead me into the center of Alex's life - the angst about school, parents/adults, girls, and the meaning of life. Great topical references to cultural icons - the author assumes you have had exposure to the literary and musical greats of our time. And the translator has done a fabulous job with what must have been difficult Italian slang - and gets the English slang just right. This is a quick read, and makes you laugh, makes you think. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band: A Love Story- with Rock 'n' Roll","review":"This book about the thoughts and confusions of 17 year old Alex is written in a wonderful form-how your really insightful and poetic best friend would talk to you. Every aspect of Alex's thoughts made me think of life from a different angle-from his angers toward a messed-up society to his intense feelings toward Aidi-an experience like none he's ever had which makes him feel brand new. I found myself reading chapters over and over again, finding new meaning each time. Though a few parts are a bit slow moving, it is 100% worth it.

I've just finished to read this book in the original italian edition and I'm going to buy a copy in the english translation. I can understand the negative comments of some other english speaking readers: of course a translation of a book written in the slang of ppl around my age, can't render the original sense, like the italian translation of Jim Carrol's &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; is a completely different thing from the original book. Alex, is not really a *pastiche rebel* he is just a confused kid like millions other kids all over the world, and the author rendered it perfectly: before judging this book drastically, one should know the way we talk, the way we spend our days... I don't know, maybe I'm the only teenager reviewing this book in here. In the various characters I've found myself and my friends or schoolmates. I can't honestly say that Brizzi's book has changed my life, but sure it was great to find that the illusions, the dreams, the confusions and the little great things of my generation (disgustingly called &quot;X-generation&quot;), are worth to be mentioned in a first class novel."},{"Title":"Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band: A Love Story- with Rock 'n' Roll","review":"this is a really great book. it helps to understand yourself better, when you\`re 17 and part of the non-conformist population and don\`t really know who you are (like me...). it\`s somehow reassuring that you are not alone and understood. sounds a bit stupid, but at times you need to hear this. furthermore, it\`s diverting. not really funny but it\`s a book you don\`t put away before not having finished."},{"Title":"Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band: A Love Story- with Rock 'n' Roll","review":"Perhaps it is simply because I myself am a teenager, but I found this book to be one of the few &quot;youth oriented&quot; books that truly revealed the very thoughts that I myself have had. It seems as though Brizzi has taken the very emotions that teenagers today feel and put them into words that almost completely accurately describe them. That in itself is a miracle, because it is something I have been trying endlessly (and failing) to do without a feeling of being censored or misunderstood. I believe that any teen who is in touch with their emotions and truly enjoys good reading should read this book. It was fascinating, true-to-life, and captured the necessity that teens have to put music and poetry into all that they do and say. It presents the life of the modern teenager without over-romanticizing it, a mistake that far too many authors for today's youth make. This is a beautiful book and I greatly appreciated the poetry of it all."},{"Title":"Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band: A Love Story- with Rock 'n' Roll","review":"Maybe it is because I'm already 22 and have outgrown a lot of the teen angst which Alex embodies in this book, but I found a lot of this book really painful to read, simply because it explained out a lot of the emotional cues rather than describing them, and favored MTVesque rock references over real description of events. What Mr. Brizzi has tapped into is our generation's identification with pop-culture as a way of legitimizing our emotions, but the passing references to a whole battery of punk songs do no justice either to the punk culture which they purport to represent or to the emotions which he is attempting to describe. I found this book to be much like the kind of journal entries which every teenager ends up writing at some point, tortured with the pain of the world and such and self-involved to the point of boring all outside observers. Now I have had relationships like the one in the book, and I have had similar feelings and experiences, but I couldn't help but only feel pity that the narrator felt the need to tell us all about them. Furthermore, not to continue to rag on this book, which does have a few good parts and inexplicably seems to be a bestseller in Italy, I really hate all of the overt references to Catcher in the Rye and other seminal works which depict similar emotions; this book has nowhere near the depth of Catcher, and where Salinger subtly describes a feeling, Brizzi tells you all about it to the point where you no longer want to hear any more. And so, since I have paid over for your journals of adolescent angst, Mr. Brizzi and have spent the past three days wallowing in this half-described so-called-rock'n'roll relationship, I can only recommend that others stick to their own &quot;I am in love but why doesn't she love me&quot; teenage feelings rather than read yours."},{"Title":"Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band: A Love Story- with Rock 'n' Roll","review":"I've lived in the same city as the one described in the book, i can tell it's the point of view of some uptown snob brat..

Part of the problem is that it reeks of overhyped Gen-Xism, from jacket flaps cramming in multiple comparisons to The Catcher in the Rye, to a meaningless blurb from Pagan Kennedy invoking &quot;stage-diving into a mosh pit,&quot; and blurbs from European reviews telling me how &quot;exciting,&quot; &quot;authentic,&quot; and &quot;ironic&quot; the book is. The rest of the problem is that the writing is not that great, written in a sort of self-aware stream of consciousness style, it resembles nothing so much as the diary of a self-absorbed teenager. Unfortunately this teenager isn't very interesting despite his desire to be an outsider. He's a composite rebel, what with his crop top, mixing The Clash, The Smiths, and The Cure on his internal soundtrack and skipping school to drink and hang out with friends. My, how rebellious! There are a few interesting angles to him, such as his biking and his chaste love affair, but they are not enough to redeem the book. The translation is terribly off-putting, placing all kinds of US slang in the mouths of Italian teenagers and mixing it with other slang which is somewhat puzzling, such as &quot;rot-Aryans&quot; which shows up a lot.

Not one I couldn't put down, but one I knew I had to finished.If you want to another read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those books that \\"smart\\" people like to \\"read.\\" Well if being smart means liking this, count me out!

It was the most painful reading experience of my life.Like many readers I was sucked in by the \\"Modern Library Top 100\\" list of which Ulysses is number 1. After getting about half way through this book, I realized that many of the so called \\"Top 100\\" were probably more important than they were, well, good. Ulysses has several passages of graphic sexual description and discussion of infidelity during a few of the author's more lucid moments which surely made it edgy for 1922. The Modern Library must have overlooked the long and frequent passages of rambling lists and nonsence that makes one seriously question if the author was getting paid by the word and needed to pay his rent. I was not surprised to find out that Ulysses was initially a serialization and Joyce was actually getting paid by the word!You can read some of this online, but I don't recommend reading it in any form.

No other book I know of has more power to inspire or instill creative thought. His symbolism and skill is simply astounding. Anthony Burgess once said that many times he'd think of Ulysses and then think about his own work, &quot;Why bother?&quot; I know what he meant, but the power of the characters and style gives everday writers like myself something to strive for.

On the declaration of its being the greatest book of the 20th century, I had to see what the fuss was all about. And I still wonder, 167 pages or so later. Usually after about a hundred pages I can sort of get the &quot;gist&quot; of a document, and I will admit to not having a degree in literature or Irish studies. From all the praise, I am wondering if I have a defect in my brain. But I will admit, I don't get it. If this is supposed to be some mental time capsule, a masterful expose of stream-of-consciousness, then fine. Must be an acquired taste. Back to the Archie comic books I guess."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is nothing intellectually challenging about this book. Instead, it is a cruel insult to the intelligence of any thinking person who tries to read it. Even the people who don't &quot;get it,&quot; and feel compelled to give this miserable piece of trash 5-star ratings let some of its true character seep through.In the 5-star reviews alone, we see: &quot;my head aches after reading it,&quot; &quot;one will never be able to understand,&quot; &quot;a vast, complex book about nothing,&quot; &quot;when I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptyness,&quot; &quot;meaning that vanishes in the distance of one's ability to comprehend it,&quot; &quot;Ulysses is not Ulysses,&quot; &quot;sometimes the narrative line just seems to dissapear.&quot;Anyone with respect for themselves should skip this &quot;book about nothing&quot; and find a book about _something_ instead."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The only real reason to tackle the massive burden of Ulysses is to become aware of the stark reality that it expresses regarding the \\"spirit of the age\\", essentially a rampant nihilism. Then one can possibly adjust one's outlook on the current world society and proceed accordingly, perhaps avoiding being a lemming going over the cliff.Before entering the cavern of this work, one has to decide the \\"why\\" as above, then the \\"how\\". For me, after much diddling, false starts and self deceptions, this excellent CD set became the obvious answer. I had heard the comments of people far more intelligent than I on how difficult the work was to plow through. Therefore, I would have even more difficulty than they if I chose to continue reading it (a false start at reading the 735 page tome got almost nowhere). Also, I would be displaying a gracious nature in accepting the much-touted idea that \\"Joyce's prose must be HEARD to be truly appreciated\\".The production here is an excellent way to expose oneself in a leisurely manner to the book's wily trap without becoming totally enmeshed. The trap is simply that one thinks the work is \\"going to say something\\", but the fact remains that it really says nothing, albeit in a brilliant way.One can be tired but still listen to part of a CD, repeat passages at will, turn it off, reflect, then continue. It is MUCH harder to read this work than to listen to it. The CD set also contains very valuable and detailed notes about each section as well as overall enlightening critical information, and relevant musical selections are also present throughout.If one is truly serious about attacking this work, I would recommend the sort of \\"Joyce for Dummies\\" approach that I followed: purchase the DVD of the film version of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (although the film doesn't boast a very good screenplay and is unrestored, the performances are excellent), as well as the CD audio book of the same title (abridged, but all the important parts are there). Absorbing these will give you a central clue about Ulysses, mostly in the Stephen Dedalus character that appears in both (hint: Stephen is a boring, cold, emotionless prig). Then purchase the DVD of the 1967 film version of Ulysses (excellent photography in a pristine black and white print). Although set in 1967, it will give you a reasonably OK overview of the \\"story\\" of Ulysses which is set in 1904.Having taken in these, you are almost ready to proceed to the CD set of Ulysses, and you can already rightly claim to have listened to the prose of Joyce, definitely a feather in your cap at certain parties (where you may also want to rhyme off a few memorized lines in the appropriate accent).Avoid the millions of words contained in endless musings about the book, and read only one essay, that of Carl Jung entitled Ulysses in the book The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature. If read carefully and more than once before listening to the Ulysses CD set, you'll find that it does indeed contain the golden key to truly understanding the nature of this massively influential book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As a devout modernist, I put off the pleasure of reading this book for years. I wanted to have the time and leisure to give it proper attention. I had taken a seminar with Anthony Burgess on ULYSSES at CCNY in the early seventies. We did a close reading of the Nighttown chapter and were supposed to read the rest of the novel on our own. I never did. But Burgess' enthusiasm was impressive and though I wasn't entirely convinced, I was certainly intrigued. In earlier years I had read DUBLINERS and PORTRAIT and even some of FINNEGANS WAKE and was especially impressed by Joyce's mastery of language and the poetic quality of his prose.An early retirement offer finally had me reading the \\"GREATEST NOVEL OF THE 20th CENTURY\\" last month in Riverside Park. Some nice cigars added to the mix.The first few chapters were stunning. The powers of description, the playfulness and musicality of language, the wit and intelligence of Stephen and Buck were a delight. I was obviously in the hands of a master. Shakespeare even came to mind.But then something happened. The humanity and poetry seemed to drain out of the thing as we were treated to yet another chapter of theoretical \\"experimentation in narrative technique\\". The idea of writing a novel, each chapter of which is written in a parodistic or borrowed style seems to me a doomed one (and more postmodernist than modernist). Apparently even Ezra Pound objected. I found myself asking, \\"Couldn't Joyce have found his own voice and style to narrate this section?\\" An entire narrative chapter in the question and answer form of a Catholic Catechism seems affected at first. After thirty pages it is deadly and even embarrassing. And then another in the style of a men's sporting magazine, and then another in the style of a women's magazine? What's the point (other than showing off)? And the Freudian/Surrealist kitsch of the endless Nighttown chapter was downright infantile. Talk about dated! This is novel writing from the outside in. First you have an \\"experimental\\" concept and then you fit in some narrative stuff. It's no wonder academics use this book as major fodder. It seems to be written with them in mind.Likewise the useless tie ins with Homer's ODYSSEY. One can't help thinking of them as a desperate attempt to add structure, incident and theme to a book fairly bereft of them. Not to mention adding a bit of literary pedigree to offset the \\"obscenity\\".Which brings me to my main point. The fancy smorgasbord of styles cannot disguise the fact that as a novel, ULYSSES is sorely lacking. Involving narrative, depth and development of characterization , thematic focus, depth of feeling etc. seem totally absent. Basically what we have here is a brief Balzacian \\"realist\\" sketch, padded out and styled-up beyond belief.Now this is really a minority opinion: not only is ULYSSES a failure, but the reason I think it is a failure is that it is a transitional work. Joyce was obviously bored with novelistic narrative but still felt obliged to accommodate. With FINNEGANS WAKE, he hit stride and finally found his m&eacute;tier - a book as a place to play with language and psyche for his own pleasure, without regard for traditional novelistics.A NOTE ON EDITIONS: The huge academic controversy about which edition of ULYSSES is \\"authentic\\" or \\"correct\\" is, as one might expect, much ado about very little. Serious textual issues are minimal. Most of the typos in the 1922 edition were corrected in 1960/1 by the editors of the Modern Library in consultation with Richard Ellmann. That text was also used for the Bodley Head and current Everyman editions. Gabler later went overboard, making some highly questionable decisions. His edition is also difficult to read due to small print, layout, line-numbering etc. Danis Rose's edition went even further and \\"corrected\\" Joyce's compound words etc. - a disgrace.I ended up reading an online version edited by Jorn Barger - a very sensible amalgam of the best work of previous editors. It took some time and expense to print out, but it was definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Who published this? There are no characters in the entire book who would look anything like the characters on this cover! Most of the action takes place in a newspaper office, in a bed room, in a Martello tower, and at a funeral. Most people are dressed in jackets and ties, not torn shirts, and certainly no one smiles as dumb as these jokers. The looks of this book are a disgrace to the author."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is not that difficult a book to understand, contrary to what you may have been led to believe. Compared with Finnegans Wake, for instance, it's a cake walk. The book's most frustrating part comes early on, after Stephen leaves his Uncle Richie's house. From here on out, a dictionary (preferably a comprehensive one) becomes invaluable. In my opinion, a good deal of the confusion surrounding Ulysses has arisen out of the fact that most people, upon encountering a word that they do not understand, choose to merely carry on in confusion, as opposed to looking the word up. You would be shocked at how instantly comprehensible this book becomes once a dictionary is employed. Since this book was written as a sort of mock-heroic counterpoint to the Homeric poems, a knowledge of those literary works is also very useful for any competent appreciation of Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"All I can say after finally finishing Ulysses is that it deserves its reputation - both of them. Yes, it is a masterpiece - and, yes, it is a difficult, at times seemingly impenetratable read. When I finished reading this book and finally closed it, I felt I had accomplished a monumental deed. This is the only book I've ever read - and I've read many (difficult ones, too) - that was an actual physical chore to read. One reviewer mentioned that reading it is comparable to climbing Mt. Everest - many people start it, but few make it to the summit - and, ridicilous as that sounds, it is true, in a way. I'm not going to go into a detailed analysis of this book (that's arguably impossible, anyway), or summarize the plot, or anything like that - there is no plot. Small review forums limited to 1,000 words such as this one is not the place for a detailed dissertation on a book as profound, monumental, and important as Ulysses - doctoral thesises and 100,000 word essays have been written for that purpose by people far more qualified than I. It is not difficult, but impossible to summarize Ulysses: it must read in full. I have done so - it wasn't easy, but I did it. I read Joyce's A Portrait of The Artist As A Young Man first (which I highly reccommend you do also), although I didn't use any annotation or Cliff's Notes, or anything like that. I have no doubt that many of the book's complexities, metaphors, allusions, and ancedotes were lost on me, but I wanted to read the book on my own first. I don't claim total comprehension of his vast and difficult masterpiece; I fully admit that there are many parts of the book that I did not understand. This is no reason to slander the book, as many have ignorantly done. I did enjoy reading the book, however - and felt great joy and a sense of accomplishment upon on reading it - and yes, it IS a masterpiece, and for this reason: this is one of the few, if not the only book(s) ever written that accurately and realistically depicts real life. There is no plot, there is no \\"story\\" - there is certainly no moral. What this book (I believe) attempts to do - and does - is to portray life in a fictional setting - real life. This book takes two normal people, and describes their day. The cross paths at times - intersect, ramble, and collide - and this book, basically, just shows a normal day in the life of two normal people. This may not sound exciting - it isn't. It may sound boring - it often is. Imagine if you wrote down in a book every single event of your day in pain-staking detail (and there are parts in thsi book where Joyce goes into such detail as to border on mundanity, despite its ultra realism.) Still, it is a brilliant and ingenious literary device - surprisignly unattemped before - and carried off marvelously well here. This book addresses the normal, everyday things that other books always cease to mention: defecation, masturbation, rambling thoughts inside a person's head. Like Portrait, this book contains no quotation marks. All dialogue is written as it is personally experienced by the character; I know no other writer besides Joyce who writes - both dialogue and narraration - from INSIDE the character: you actually feel what it's like to walk around inside a person's head, rather than just witnessing his external actions, like every other book in the world. Ulysses, though a long and difficult read (especially if one chooses to study it), is ultimately rewarding, and I reccommend tackling it to anyone who reads with an open mind. It is a masterpiece, and it is, indeed, the true last word on realism."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The $[...] Old Landmark edition (ASIN: B000FCK4BS) has chapter breaks and a TOC but lacks italics and proper linebreaks in the verse."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those novels that in actuality heralded the end of the novel as it was known (and still is for those of us who still enjoy a story for story's sake, and by that I mean all the ingredients).I first attempted to read this during my days in the army since I'd heard so much about it. But it wasn't until college that I was able to read this book and make sense of it (spent a whole semester doing so in a course by a superb professor).But let's get back to the novel. Told a single day, the tale of Leopold Bloom is one that was unprecedented in its time. So much flap followed this book's publication in Europe that it took a ruling from our supreme court here in the states to allow the publication of Ulysses in America. The story, by Joyce's own admission, is modeled after Homer's Odyssey. Joyce himself admitted to, and I paraphrase here, including so many \\"enigmas and puzzles\\" he would keep scholars busy for years and solidify his own immortality. So much for being a humble writer. Of course, one might argue that no writer, by the very act of writing, can exercise humility.Ulysses, since it was first serialized in a mag back in 1922, has always been more about people celebrating Joyce's supposed genius rather than about the book itself. It is, for the most part, a very poorly written book with prose, when the author is busy playing the old \\"look at how clever I am with wordcraft\\" game, is rather dull and empty.Considered the modernist book of the ages, I recommend reading it first in a structured environment like a college classroom; even if you have to audit the class (maybe you can find a Joyce class at your local college). And if you can't do that it's best to hunker down withUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] otherwise you might get lost like I did.With that said, if you are looking for a beautifully written, compelling story I would look elsewhere.

As a student, you have to read it(like Shakespeare of course - but he's slightly better). And every book that you HAVE to read is already suspicious. Why is it a 'must'? Because if you would not be forced, you wouldn't read it?So true because this is a waste of space. How wonderful such space can be used, other longer books like 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Dune' or 'Catch-22' prove. They aim for entertainment, for fun, for joy in reading and all the same, they deliver perfect writing and characterisation. Now what is wrong with entertainment? Nothing! Even the bible wants to entertain - but Joyce is of course above such unnoble things like 'fun' or 'entertainment'. He's into style. And that's what he delivers:Dry, boring and self-satisfied style. He might be a good writer but he should have used 'Ulysses' as a starting point, as a construct in which he could fill a story. There are passages where his style is fantastic - short, journalistic style, the one I always use, the one I like.

The fact that JJ state, in writing, that he had loaded up his novel with so much foreign words, obtuse references and effermeral meanings to keep academics busy for years say it all. The fact that he had to provide a schema to his closest readers also says volumes. And HE CHANGED that schema more than once. So, obviously JJ himself didn't understand what he meant! Nice book for literature students and prof.s to OOO and AAAH about, but the fact is it is boring to the nth degree and simply not up or even close to anything by Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky or any number of other competent writers. Some time in the future it will become one of the least read novels of all time...perhaps then folks will start to take a more realistic view of what JJ really achieved."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"You can't understand this book without a study guide. That fact alone should be enough to scare you away. One reviewer asks why a reader should have to work so hard to understand a novel and it is a good question, in my opinion. I think that a work of art which is not self-explanatory but which demands an additional volume and commentators in order to comprehend it is a failure. I heard one professor suggest that we should all take three years out of our lives to go through this book and to appreciate it fully. Yeah, right. I have never been too keen about anyone who thinks they know what I &quot;should&quot; do with my life. There are far too many other great and rewarding pleasures available to me in my life which are more easily accessible for me to waste my time deciphering what looks like the work of a schizophrenic. The modernist conceit is that Joyce and other non-linear novelists have captured the actual mental processes of man's daily life. Perhaps if you need medication and are plagued by mania, yes. My mental processes are not a mad jumble and I do not see how anyone with a professional occupation could function if this were true. It simply isn't so. There is a famous sex scene in this book where the mental thoughts of the individual coming to climax fills many pages. I asked around and no one I know thinks about anything while climaxing except for a sexual fantasy. Totally unrealistic."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Woolf was right. Joyce was obsessed with being, hm, obscure. I have read every book he wrote (not that many) and studied him at length. It has not helped. I cannot admire anyone who thinks we should have to work so hard to figure out what he was talking about. Normal people can't enjoy Joyce and I think this is a travesty. For all the hard work I had to do to figure out what he was talking about, I did not get one moment's enjoyment. Down with pretentious male modernists who feel we should all spend our lives &quot;working&quot; to unveil the &quot;true meaning&quot; in their words. For all you Joyceans out there who like to mock the &quot;commoners&quot; for not &quot;getting&quot; Joyce, I am working on a PhD in English--and I &quot;get&quot; him just fine, thank you. And I nonetheless refuse to give in to the pressure to like him. Brilliant as he may have been, he was full of himself. In my mind, these two qualities alone (brilliance and arrogance) should not get anyone's novels on the must-read lists."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Wow. I didn't make it too far into this one.

A shaman of the modern age, Joyce imbues his massive tome with word-remedies for the chronically sick and desperate--the very people who inhabit his 'dear dirty Dublin'. With Ulysees, Joyce marked himself as one of the major writers of his age...of any age!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Before I begin, I would just like to say that this is a simple review without any deep analysis of the book or its hidden meaning.Mehehehe. Right, then. What this book is about is.... ahm... eh.... hmmm... one guy's (i.e. Leo Bloom's) journey through the day of June 16th in Dublin, Ireland, accompanied by memorable characters like Stephen Deudalus and Buck Mulligan.\\"Stately plump Buck Mulligan...\\" and so it begins. I won't pretend to understand this book fully. I won't pretend that I caught all the nounces and themes. The fact is that quite a few chapters were incomprehensible to me, although that had not lessened my enjoyment of the book. I would have to say that the most difficult chapter was \\"Circe\\", which I struggled through like a sapper going through a mine field. Most enjoyable chapters, not to mention hilarious ones were \\"Hades\\" and \\"Cyclops\\". For these two chapters alone, this book is worth reading. Hey, I would read anything that would put me back in Dublin. Joyce's mastery of English language is unparalleled and I think he was an absolute genius with words ( a lot of them indecipherable, as it were, but that's okay).In conclusion, I liked the book quite a lot, and would read it again in ten years or so. However, I do feel that this book is not for everyone, especially people who enjoy a quick, easy read. I would recommend at least giving it a try, though.

That's unusual for me because I love reading (the only major book I never finished was Miss MacIntosh, My Darling). My effort paid off, however; it allowed me to enjoy the hilarity of 'Ulysses for Dummies' on the web. For me, Ulysses was 5% brilliantly clever, 50% incomprehensible, and 20% boring. That doesn't add up since I skimmed some of it with glazed eyes. Yes, that 5% made the effort worthwhile, and 'Ulysses for Dummies' was a delicious dessert."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a project, and nobody reads this in a week. Take a year (or 10 years :-)), only this is a must for anyone who reads.The finest example of literature we have."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Incredibly to us, from our &quot;modern&quot; vantage point, &quot;Ulysses&quot;was at one point suppressed in most of the civilized worldfor its supposedly raunchy sex scenes. Today, we can seethat his fiction worked on much higher levels: his portrayalof sex (and other things) is more inventive than Miller's,more subversive than Mappelthorpe's. Joyce's intention is noless than to create an entire mental universe; his novel isa potent artistic answer to the philosophical question, &quot;Do we really exist?&quot;Leopold Bloom, the hero of the story, is a completelyordinary man; but Joyce's combination of words and theproliferation of cross-connections between the current word andthe next illustrate that there is often little connectionbetween *what* we think and the *words* we think. So Joyceis in effect trying to write a novel without words; he wantsto get into the stream of Bloom's thought directly, withoutpreface or interference.Though most would agree that this is a &quot;difficult&quot; novel --perhaps the first book to attempt to break the limits oflanguage -- it is a must-read. Bring the book on a picnic,along with your dictionary and a lot of time. The famousfinal chapter is worth all the work."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce can obviously write, from Nausicca:\\"THE SUMMER EVENING HAD BEGUN TO FOLD THE WORLD IN ITS mysterious embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the storm-tossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\\"So, we must assume that he has primarily written Ulysses for some purpose other than to entertain and to provide the kind of pleasure that would be expected from a typical novel. Ulysses is more along the lines of a textbook (in the form of fictional examples) about the philosophy of writing and language, but was decades ahead of it's time. The impact of writing and language on our perceptions of the world appears to be his true goal, with all other considerations a distant second (excepting perhaps the magnificently created character of Leopold Bloom).Ask yourself why you read. If it is for the pleasure of opening up a book and getting lost in it and enjoying the ride, then go elsewhere. If it is to expand your mind on the ideas of writing, language, and reality and perhaps to expand your own writing then this book will be very much to your liking.The best comparison I could think of was with Nabokov. Multiply Nabokov's wordplay and games by a million, but remove most of the the engaging and interesting aspects and the stunningly refined and smooth writing of every single sentence and what you have is Ulysses. But that's OK, because they seem to have had different goals for their writing, as mentioned above.Finally, to those of you who are attempting to read it for the first time and are wondering if it \\"gets better\\" (ie suddenly makes sense and settles down into a typical book once you get past a certain point), it doesn't, it wasn't meant to."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I received a copy of this for Christmas many years ago, but before that I used to have a copy of theUlysses (Gabler Edition)(which is the complete book the way that Joyce would have preferred were it not for censorious typesetters). Comparing both versions, I sadly report that the Modern Library edition is just a lesser work compared to Joyce's true, uncensored vision. Believe it or not, this edition is the bowlderized one...and it still ended up being confiscated due to the Comstock Act! Strange, but true.As a historical document, the Forward is a wonderful reason to buy this version because it says so darned much about the times in which the obscenity trial took place. Just make sure you can get your hands on the Gabler edition as well to compare notes. You'll see what I mean about the difference between the two. But that's only because I'm a Lit nerd. This may be a passable edition, but it's just not as strong as it could have been due to all the mucking about that was done with the original text during Joyce's lifetime."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" has the reputation of being unreadable - or readable only for literature students and professors - but also of being the most influential work in 20th literature. The latter might be true, because most books written afterwards have somehow used the stream-of-consciousness-technique and the non-linear storytelling. Mostly, the book is really about language and its relation to the modern world. Joyce wanted to use a different approach to language to make it consistent with the increasing complexity of every-day-life in a big city. I think that even modern movie experiments such as David Lynchs \\"Mulholland Drive\\" go back to Joyce' ideas to really dig deep in the complicated psyche of an individual, for which traditional storytelling is not sufficient.But is it really unreadable? The book certainly needs some preparation and some effort from your side, more than most other books. But once you are well prepared, the Ulysses is actually well readable, and at most time even a lot of fun. And often you do not wonder why it was heavily criticized at the time it came out. For example, most of modern literature which uses a lot of profanity and vulgarity looks like children books when compared to the Circe-chapter, a sado-masochistic fantasy of the protagonist. Joyce' language skill makes this chapter breathtaking, a pure adventure.At other times, the book is a pure delight, for example \\"Wandering Rocks\\" or \\"Penelope\\". If you listen to your intuition, even the latter (which is the most legendary chapter of the \\"Ulysses\\") is not difficult to read. But then, there are also parts where Joyce' experiment with language fails: For example the \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" is just bothersome and really unreadable.As I said, the book is only fun if you are well prepared for it. You should definitely read Joyce \\"Dubliners\\" first, which is an easy to read collection of short stories. It introduces some of the characters which return in the \\"Ulysses\\", and this gives you helpful background information. Even more important, read \\"Portrait of the Artist\\", which is a portrait of Steven as a young man. He has a main role in \\"Ulysses\\", and \\"Portrait\\" already introduces a lot of the central ideas of Steven and \\"Ulysses\\" in general.Other books which are comparable in style and intention but easier to read are Virginia Woolfs' \\"Miss Delloway\\" and John Dos Passos' \\"Manhattan Transfer\\", definitely two books which warm you up for the idea of \\"stream of consciousness\\".All in all, Ulysses is an experiment with language which is a lot of fun, but which does not work for all parts of the book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce flaunts and celebrates style in this book. There's a chapter written in the form of a play, a chapter imitating the development of English, a chapter written in question-and-answer form, a chapter without punctuation (the closing monologue, probably the most beautiful, life-affirming thing ever written), and a chapter written in the sentimental style of a girl's novel. There are countless other stylistic tricks, some of which an impatient reader will miss. Yes, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a difficult book to read...but just stick with it, pay close attention, and you'll do fine - and in the end, the rewards of having read it will be worth the struggle. Other more recent novels I recommend are P by Conn, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, so we know already that this book has been deemed 'The Greatest Book Ever Written' which is why, I must confess, I endeavoured upon it. I took no literature class concerning it, nor do I plan to. My only other experience with literature that is vaguely similar to this is 'Gravity's Rainbow' by Thomas Pynchon, which I read about a year ago. And although I found the esotericism in GR interesting and comparably relevant to my personal work, I actually found U to be a slightly more entertaining read. However, if it's 'entertainment' your looking for, don't read this. Go read a Stephen King book, or something. In fact, don't read anything, just go see the new Tomb Raider movie....I didn't give this book 5 stars, because, as it's been mentioned in other reviews, there were too many points in the book that I was wanting more. More wordy experiments, more originality. Too often, some sort of brilliant style will surface and then go away and drone on for another 50 pages until some other new and interesting element occurs again. Some may say that I'm simply saying that the book wasn't 'entertaining' enough, contradicting my argument in the previous P. Well, to those I say, whatever. I can deal with being a hypocrit. I mean, when you really think about it, there are two conflicting elements of human nature at work here, 1. the sort-of Americanization of a culture to need constant entertainment, and 2. the instinctive craving to learn. Which is more powerful in you?I will say that if you just want an interesting snippet of this book to read, I'd read the last chapter. This really made the book worth reading IMO. It's done without hardly any punctuation and it's left to the reader to cipher where sentences begin and end, really the definitive stream of conscious technique, but more than that, it's the most emotionally powerful section of the book, right up to the last few words."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book that can't be ignored if you want to be considered by anyone to be a &quot;serious&quot; reader, but it shouldn't be ignored. The truth is it is endless entertaining and enlightening. Though you need to spend many hours with it, you'll leave with a lot more than a great name to add to the list of authors you've read. You'll never let it go."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Preface by stating difficulty of full appreciation and fair comment on Ulysses on first reading. One proceeds ungrounded in the various contexts exposed to the author's unique and various styles wherein apparently Joyce attempts creation of reality by limiting his writing to the thoughts and communications of his characters without the crutches of traditional literature. Unknown to me why Joyce chose this particular style, though I speculate he must have wanted to illustrate the irrational nature of the thought process, and perhaps to show off the workings of his own mind. Joyce combines this method with what seems a deliberate effort of obscurity rather than clarity, complexity rather than simplicity, often degenerating into incoherence. He flits about continuously over dozens of subjects within the same page, and most often seems unwilling, or perhaps unable, to bring it all together causing frequent head scratchings for the skeptical reader. But in all this is an author so obviously brilliant that you chug on even when hopelessly lost, always expecting the bells to chime and lights to come on. There are many well done scenes, for me--the first chapter of young men bantering, the classroom in chapter 2, poignant expression of husband and wife relations with bloom and molly in the bedroom, and bloom back in bed after a night of carousing; an ending soliloquy that finally puts women in their place, and could that have been done more effectively--all rendered in writing flashing ability equivalent to the all time best. An imperfect book, but as many reviews note, it is a book on so many levels that generalization is impossible. I will appreciate Ulysses for what I believed it was, which is a lighthearted humorous thought provoking exposition in the style of the author of his own significant gifts."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A stylistically sprawling, richly symbolic, discursive fresco, &quot;Ulyssess&quot; remains the one book that has pushed the form of the novel to explorative extremes. Not to be perused at leisure, but to be studied with diligent effort, it will be regarded as a death sentence by the average reader, but for the genuine lover of literature it's a treat. &quot;Ulyssess&quot; is an elephantine, pedantic, sometimes self-indulgent novel. At first reading, one might feel intimidated by it, which is why student guides and annotated editions are so essential. In reality, it's a very touching and candid book and not as bullying as it seems at all, but an encounter with the most familiar and daily incidents, embedded in the intimacies of lived experience. For all his dense allusiveness and linguistic acrobatics, Joyce's message is so simple that it almost seems a commonplace: the human need to love and be loved. At the same time, though it has been proclaimed as possibly the most individual and innovative novel of the century, one will discover that it's neither individual (with its polyphonic multiple registers) nor innovative (with its reliance on mining pop culture, Celtic traditions, literary precedents -- which were already extant). The really innovative novel of this type was &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I often compare Joyce to an epoch: The Ancient Greeks (collectively), Shakespeare, and Joyce. These are the masters that produce works whose breadth is overwhelming. It is a shame, on the one hand, that a mind such as Joyce's only surfaces every few hundred years. However, it is fortunate (especially for Literature majors and graduate students) that the frequency is so minimal. When I first read Ulysses, I had prepared myself with years of literary training and hours upon hours of reading. The first impression was numbing yet inspiring. In the aftermath of having read the work, I find myself reflecting back upon this work more than any other (this is saying quite a bit coming from a student of American literature). Be prepared with numerous secondary sources, including Ellmann's biography, and expect nothing short of extraordinary for this is one work a reader can never overestimate and one can never relive the first encounter with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, OK, it's always easy to say you don't like something (therefore, you are better than that particular work of art) Having recently arrive from Dublin, the Ulyses experience is understood different: now I can see why Life can happen in just one day. I do not know if it's difficult or easy to read, but when you are more than just a reader but also jump inside the book, and write it together with the author, you are brushed away, swept into a new realm, and sigh: he's right, life is worth it.

I'm more of a &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; or &quot;Stones From the River&quot; type.

It is an adventure for the mind. The reader is taken to a journey through the minds of three everyday individuals and discovers hidden thoughts, desires and guilts. It is not an easy journey though, as the reader is confronted with obstacles that challenges one's own intelligence and understanding of the story. The book is written in several different ways which will confuse the reader. I feel that when James Joyce wrote the book, he wanted to go beyond just writing a regular novel. He wanted to show us the true nature of the mind the way it really is in a variety of forms. I must say that is was very hard for me to get through the book at times and so I used the cliffs notes to help me. All the characters are excellent and some of them remind me of people I know. It is a book I will read over and over again with great pleasure. I have read many other books and this is one of my favorites. I found it funny how many people were complaining about how difficult it was and how Joyce was wrong in writing it the way he did. I don't see a problem with it. Ulysses wouldn't be great if it was written in any other form. I'm just a normal teenager who simply became interested in Joyce. If I could get through the book alive, anyone can. So for those of you who are complaining, quit crying and reread the book if you didn't understand it !.

As other people have expressed, adjectives like &quot;dense&quot;, &quot;complicated&quot;, or &quot;inscrutable&quot; do not begin to convey the experience of Ulysses. I read it for a Joyce course at school, with the assistance of Harry Blamires's Bloomsday (oh...*that's* what happened) book. Reading Ulysses is quite a challenge to the late twentieth century attention span, but if you can get through the maternity ward (recapitulation of the history of the english language) and circe/whorehouse (the abandonment of the rational) episodes, I think you're rewarded with the hilarious, exremely erudite yet still accessible catechism of the penultimate chapter, as well as Molly's freeflowing stream (of thought). On a bookmark I received with an order from Amazon, there is a quote by Elizabeth Drew positing that the &quot;test of literature&quot; is whether or not we live more intensely for reading it.

Sure it's difficult. Sometimes I literally had to read the book backwards in search of a missing or forgotten thread. One small section is so fiendishly composed that I had to write it out by hand to untangle it. Other parts are as obscure to me now as they were when I first read them.That being said, when you lock onto Ulysses--when you can hold onto the thread--the words, the pages, everything vanishes. Pure thought, like music or cocaine, insinuates itself into your mind and clings to the pleasure centers.That you may never totally unravel Ulysses is unimportant. The pleasure comes from experiencing not completing it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Wow. I have started this book three times, at about two-year intervals, also reading small parts of it separately at various times, but I finally finished it straight through and I can't believe how great it is, I never expected this, though I've been half-obsessed with Joyce since I bought Finnegans Wake with perfect serendipity in seventh grade because I thought it had &quot;words I don't know.&quot; [Back to Ulysses] I've always loved the beginning, but it really gets a lot better past the halfway point, with Nighttown and the Ithaca chapter especially, and the thing that struck me most was the absolute loveliness of the ending. It's bloody famous and often quoted, but you don't get a sense until you've read the whole thing that where other books leave you begging for more or hoping them to come to an end more quickly, this ending is *perfectly* satisfying.

He has to pass through many dangers, including the cave of the giant one-eyed cyclops and the magical woman who turns men into pigs, before he can return home to his faithful wife and free her from her unwanted suitors.Well, not exactly, as the car rental commercials say. Our hero is Leo Bloom, a Jew in Ireland married to an Irish sexpot named Mollie. The evil cyclops awaiting Leo is a big one-eyed antisemite, and the cave is a bar. The woman who turns men into pigs is a dominatrix. The faithful wife is in bed right now with a man named Blazes Boylan. And our droll hero is avoiding home because he gets a perverse pleasure out of the whole situation.Then there's the language of James Joyce. Buss her, wap in rogue's rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell. isn't whether or not to get the Cliff Notes, the question is which to read first, one chapter at a time, the book or the explanation. If you read the book first, you're giving yourself the chance to get it yourself. If you read the notes first, you'll have a much better idea what you're reading.In a book that sometimes makes you dislike humanity, as when some stupid antisemite (there are many, in fact almost everyone) gives Leo a little dig, the single most beautiful moment comes in the 14th chapter. I'm not referring to Send us, bright one, light one, Horhorn, quickening and wombfruit, or to Hoopsa, boyaboy, hoopsa! The most beautiful writing in the book is when Mrs Purefoy has her baby.Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders....And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe... You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!It makes you think that life might be worth living after all, and that maybe God will one day say the same to you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As an undergraduate, I tried and failed to read James Joyce's Ulysses the conventional way - I think it took me six months to finish chapter 1. Having treated myself to the audiobook, I can say that it's a completely different experience - Jim Norton's and Marcella Riordan's masterful recording really brings the text to life. On a purely practical level, the lengthy stream-of-consciousness bits make a whole lot more sense when they're read with the intonations of natural speech, and the variation in vocal tone makes it much easier to stay engaged in sections that otherwise tend towards the soporific. Most impressive are the 'voices' Jim Norton does for all the different characters - Stephen Dedalus's 'thoughts' are all done in a low-pitched deadpan monotone that perfectly captures his personality, while Buck Mulligan is loud, brash and has a much stronger Irish accent (this difference in volume is large enough to be a potential problem for someone listening through headphones). Norton's skill is particularly noticeable in 'ensemble' scenes such as the library, where he has to switch voice every couple of lines. I've got the Oxford Classics edition of the book (1922 text) and it's almost identical to the recording - very occasionally there's a word or two that's different. This time round I'm actually really enjoying Ulysses - who would've thought."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've read the reviews. I've seen the complaints. &quot;It doesn't mean a thing... I can't understand it... It's just a bunch of drivel...&quot; All are opinions that anyone who has read the book is certainly entitled to. As for all the scholars out there who say that there are hidden meanings in every sentence, well, that's your opinion too. And you're more than welcome to scour &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the rest of your natural life looking for pieces to Joyce's grand puzzle. But I'm going to offer something a little different - those who would scour the novel for such meanings are missing the point in almost the same way as those who toss it aside as incomprehensible.In &quot;Ulysses&quot;, we are given access to the inner-consciousness of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and Molly Bloom. They are normal people living ordinary lives in early 20th century Dublin. They go to work, go to the bathroom, walk the streets, greet people, and think about their lives. They mull over details of their own lives that are so personal to them that they could mean nothing to anyone else. And if you think about it, isn't that what we all do? If someone were to open up your head and read your thoughts, they might say the same thing - &quot;What the heck is this?&quot; But we also consider the things that affect us all; love, death, loss, and hate, among others. Those are the thoughts that would carry weight and meaning for anyone, and the characters in &quot;Ulysses&quot; ponder these things as we all might. We cannont completely become them, and thus we cannot completely understand everything they think of. But they hit upon enough major truths so that there is meaning for anyone. Their adventures through Dublin would have made an interesting story on their own - being able to see inside their minds takes the novel to a completely different level."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Why do people who don't like Ulysses always lambaste those who do? You have every right to like and dislike what you please, and so do I. Why the name calling? I wouldn't call myself an intellectual and I'm certainly no \\"literary luminary,\\" but I love the book. For me, it's not about mythic parallels or stylistic experimentation or esoteric theories of art-it's about the richness, the absolute miracle, of human experience. Whatever else you can say about Joyce's intent, he wanted to show us life. And every time, for example, Bloom wonders whether black reflects or refracts light, I see life-the sort of life (banal, uncertain, driven by the demands of the flesh, often a joy, sometimes thankfully relieved by humor) that I live. Joyce (I think) succeeded in giving us a very simple but profound truth: every moment of life is sacred. Eternity, heaven and hell, God, the whole shebang, are right here around and within us all the time. And we spend 99% of our time distracting ourselves in one way or other.Bring your sense of humor!

But I refer to it and re-read parts of it periodically, even though the years appear to have dampened some of my enthusiasm for this brick of a book.The more I think about Ulysses, the more I decide that most of the value of reading and understanding the book (two very different things, by the way) comes from its ambition and the impact it has had on 20th century literature. This is the work that -- probably to the chagrin of literature students everywhere -- more or less invented the stream of consciousness style of literature, and which literary historians say marked the start of the modern era in English literature. The narrative, a nearly 800-page examination into the events in Leopold Bloom's life on June 16, 1904, is dense but also very compelling, and the language is often crisp and colorful.Unfortunately, the language is even more often a bizarre maze of metaphors, references, and descriptions so inaccessible that some scholars think they may contain some kind of secret code. At one point, the erotic and deflating soliloquy of Molly Bloom (Leopold's wife) takes up something like 25,000 words unmarred by a single punctuation mark -- a section long enough to be published separately as a novella.Without a doubt, a similar book written today by an unknown talent would never find its way the shelves of the neighborhood Books-A-Million without first shedding 300 or 400 pages under the red ink of some unfortunate editor. There's also little doubt that the modern literary cannon is better off for the fact that that didn't happen when Mr. Joyce produced this seminal work. Readers are also better off, but only the ones willing to work at it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I started reading Ulysses with the help of the annotations, but soon left those behind. The horror stories that I had heard of the difficulty of the book were unfounded, and I enjoyed every moment of the text. Having read the Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I was used to Joyce's style, or so I thought. But in Ulysses I discovered that stream of consciousness could be taken to a new and deeper level. Joyce did not mean for us to grasp every allusion, therefore annotations are not really necessary. By reading Ulysses, I also managed to gain a new insight into the Odyssey, and found new undertones withing Homer's work. People had told me that at the age of 16 and 17 it would be impossible to read Ulysses. I disagree. Length does not make a book more difficult to read -- Walden Pond is, at times, harder to understand than Ulysses. When I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptiness, for I had been living in the mind of Leopold Bloom. It was as if part of me had been taken away. In the future, I will definitely reread Ulysses, and I recommend it to anyone who loves literature. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is for people that have not read this novel and are frightened by it.Greatest novel of all time, blah blah blah. Forget the academic wankery that has encased this novel like a black, shiny coffin. Joyce never meant this novel to be read with reverential nods and oh so serious frowns. This is a novel that is bursting with atmosphere and life.In its essence, this novel attempts two major tasks: to inflate one utterly ordinary day in the life of a human being to epic proportions, and to do so by undertaking a different writing-experiment for each chapter.The \\"epic inflation\\" aspect is absolutely fascinating. Mr Leopold Bloom spends an entire day wandering around Dublin for a bit, then comes back home. Absolutely nothing \\"epic\\", in the usual sense, actually occurs here. He encounters a spiritual son in the form of the slightly malnourished, youthful, pseudo-intellectual Stephen Dedalus...but the encounter doesn't really lead anywhere.Rather, it is the point of the novel to inflate the simple things in life to something epic. Taking the Odyssey as its skeleton (and you really should be familiar with the Odyssey before attempting this book), Joyce turns each tiny incident during the day (in pretty much \\"real time\\") into an epic event with its own incredible atmosphere and drama. Even Bloom sitting on the toilet, going to the post-office, or drinking instant chocolate become massive epic events.To some degree this is slightly self-mocking. However, the novel makes you see your own life in a slightly different way. Maybe there are no \\"dull\\" days in our lives; from a certain point of view even the most mundane stuff, like dropping off something at the post office, or drinking Ovaltine, becomes miraculous.Secondly, there is the experimentation. The fact that each chapter is a totally different experiment gives you a real sense of curiosity about the novel. What is coming next? Stream of consciousness wackiness? A play? Random newspaper headlines? The division of the book into different experiments means that, even if you don't like one chapter, you can read on in the hopes that the next chapter will be more to your taste.Think of it as being like a concept album. Even if you don't dig Within You Without You, When You're Sixty-Four is just around the corner.Overall, I liked the atmosphere of the novel. Even if sometimes you don't totally get what's happening, you get a strong sense of Dublin c. 1904, with people lunching on gorgonzola sandwiches and sherry at pubs, people wandering along Sandymount Strand and buying sweets, people going to the turkish bath and buying scented soap.There is also the unmistakeable tang of the Homeric Aegean. Dublin is near the sea, like Troy, and you don't forget it. Whether wandering the sandy beach, eating headless sardines from a tin, or watching drunken soldiers wandering along the street at night, the sea is never far away.Don't be put off this book. Wallow away in something that is truly an epic \\"show about nothing\\". Speaking of which, what is this book comparable to in the modern world?\\"Seinfeld\\", with its excruciating minutiae about life in New York City being raised to the mock-epic level, whether it's George lying about his job or Elaine wondering if a rabbi is gossiping about her.\\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", with its exuberant, youthful experimentation with the very bedrock of music albeit with a playful unpretentiousnessmost oddly, \\"24\\", with real time coverage of events in such a way that every single hour has something epic happening in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is great fun. It takes a bit more work to read than most books, just as it takes a bit more work to play tennis than it does to play catch. You shouldn't feel compelled to put the work in, any more than you should feel compelled to learn an unusually difficult sport. But people who do put the work in and who have a good time doing it shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it either. It's a pleasure to follow the interweaving lines of the Sirens chapter, for instance, and anyone who does it will see that the chapter is alive in a way that almost nothing else is in literature. Joyce is a terrific comic writer and a terrific creator of vivid, complicated characters. But he requires the reader to put in some extra effort to enjoy how good he is, and I can't blame anyone who gives up after a few pages and refuses to go any further. On the other hand, I've noticed that people who don't like Joyce's approach seem to want to attack people who do. This is silly. Again, it's like hating people for playing basketball just because you prefer skateboarding. Both the Joyce lovers and the Joyce haters should lighten up a bit."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A book deserving to be thoroughly studied and a milestone in development of English language currently known, but a common reader like me can afford but a hasty and superficial eagle eye, and most references and connections would have been lost to me without the diagram by Stuart Gilbert quoted in the introduction of Penguin edition.A full and unique mastership of language results in a wonderful balance between fictional and technical , at ease with each employed style besides the contrasts between the different narrative techniques employed in the various chapters, which depicts the wide variety of microcultures composing the fragmented Irish society during British occupation.Many years ago I read a book, whose title The Cardinal, by Henry Morton, about the career of a Catholic American priest with Irish origins. The first half of the book is set in the Boston Irish community, and I have been impressed by how many \\"Irishnesses\\" in the book (which I read in an Italian translation) can be traced back to Joyce's Ulysses (I still remember the pun Rows of Cast Steel = Rose of Castille).An example of how a local tale becomes universal literature, and a mandatory step in understanding English language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I think there is one sentence in Ulysses that sums up Joyce's intention perfectly: \\"Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.\\"This really is a great book, full of humor and insight and what I can only describe as those little sparks of recognition you get when you see your own life in great literature. And I think it even has something akin to a real spiritual revelation we desperately need in the West (see the quote above). But there's no denying that Joyce was a sadist, linguistically speaking. Like all Irish writers I've ever read about, Joyce had mixed feelings about English. It was not his true native language and, while he loved it, he was always knew that it was a kind of shackle on his country. The issue comes up in A Portrait (when young Stephen bristles that he knows the language better than the English priest who's teaching it) and it reappears very early in Ulysses.At breakfast, Haines confounds the old milk woman with his speech in Irish (it's French, for all she knows). In his mind, Stephen associates the old woman with all of Ireland, and Haines' command of the Irish language is emblematic of his status as conqueror (he's conquered the land and assimilated the language, and now he's come to plunder the culture! Haines is in Ireland to collect folk tales). Joyce may not have embraced the Irish cause like many of his contemporaries, but he had his own more subtle form of revolt. He wanted to bind the English speaking world with one of it's own shackles. In Richard Ellman's biography, someone tells Joyce he demands too much of his readers. He flatly replies that his only demand was that his readers spend their whole lives reading him. He wanted to make us all slaves! Just read those two mind-bending sentences near the beginning of the Oxen of the Sun chapter and imagine what sadistic pleasure Joyce must have felt writing them. You can almost hear him shout, \\"take that!\\" And any time you come to a particularly difficult section of the book, just imagine Joyce there beside you saying, \\"Hey, don't look at me. It's YOUR language.\\"I'm sure what throws most people is the third chapter that begins \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible...\\" Up to then, things have been pretty clear, except for the occasional shifts from dialogue to thought, which Joyce does without giving us those helpful little \`he said's and \`he thought's. He doesn't even give us quotation marks (he didn't use them because he thought they were ugly, by the way). We've seen-and \\"seen\\" is the key word...we have not been told by a narrator...it's as if we are there watching it all-we've seen Stephen have breakfast in the tower, walk with Mulligan and Haines to the bathing area, teach his class, and talk with Deasy. But suddenly we find ourselves inside his head along with Kant, Schopenhaur, Shakespeare, Milton, the Bible, the Catholic Mass, early Christian heresies, Irish mythology, on and on. It gets confusing to say the least.Do you have to know as much about all this stuff as Stephen to understand the book? It probably wouldn't hurt, but I certainly don't. The main thing is to understand that STEPHEN understands it all, and yet he is still struggling. His mother has died and he's asking a simple question, \\"what does it all mean?\\" This is the question of the book. What does life mean? How should one live? The answer the book gives is: life begins when you understand that we are all one. Stephen and Bloom, two completely different people, are one. Religion, myth, and all the great symbols that spring up across the globe are so similar because human life is essentially the same everywhere. Joyce told a friend that he chose The Odyssey as a model for his own book because Homer created the most complete character in all of literature: Odysseus is a father, a husband, a lover, a warrior, a politician. In short, he is Bloom: a completely ordinary man. Joyce showed us that ordinary life, \\"intensely regarded\\", is the stuff of myth.It's not always easy (although much of it is, if you read carefully...and compared to Finnegans Wake it's practically Dr. Seuss). But it's well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is one of those big, mad bellwethers of a book that X will tell you is the biggest, best, most important blah blah blah and Y will tell you is a load of badly written tripe. Neither X nor Y tend to notice that the book consciously encourages both responses...but, well, I'll get back to the academic riffing in a minute.I first tried to read Ulysses aged about 14 (I was an annoying little boy that way) and didn't get very far. The first three chapters are set in and around the mind of Stephen Dedalus, one of the most ridiculously clever and over-educated characters ever conceived, as he takes breakfast with some friends, teaches in a school some miles south of Dublin and walks along a beach. Along the way, his mind ruminates on subjects as diverse as 16th century underworld slang, his dead mother, and something he calls &quot;the ineluctable modality of the visible&quot; which I'm still struggling with. But he's a curiously ambiguous character, this Stephen; he fancies himself as a poet and rebel but when, on the beach, he picks his nose, he has a quick look around to see that nobody's watching before he smears the snot on a rock. (Joyce likes to poke fun at pretension this way - although he doesn't suggest that Stephen's ideas or rebel stance are completely hollow, either.)The 14-year-old me didn't get that far. I gave up. It wasn't until I was 19 or so that I got as far as chapter four and encountered a Mr. Bloom, pottering around the kitchen making breakfast, that I started to get a grip. Bloom is one of the most likeable characters in fiction. He's a quiet, rather shy, oddly intelligent advertising salesman married to a voluptuous siren of a wife, Molly. Either you're prepared to go the distance with Bloom, or else cast the book aside with a hollow oath, because he's about to spend the entire day walking around Dublin. Nothing will happen except that a man will be buried, a baby will get born, and Bloom will help Stephen when the latter gets into a drunken fracas with some British soldiers. (Ireland was still part of the Union in 1904, and Dublin was a garrison town. Many non-Irish readers concentrate on Joyce's innovation or wit or technical whatever, but Joyce is extremely historically aware, and Ulysses, like all his other books, is riddled with the traces of English domination. These add to the book, rather than diminish it.)Readers who like those clanky, tinpot contraptions known as &quot;plots&quot; may get a tad frustrated. Leaving aside Joyce's gifts for parody (a _tad_ too indulged, in my opinion), the, if you like, human interest in Ulysses is in the details of the to-ing and fro-ing between the characters. A quite banal conversation turns out to have all sorts of fascinating undercurrents; Bloom, who is Jewish and therefore even more of an outsider than Stephen, is extremely good at detecting the hints and shifts in the tones of the people he meets. He keeps running into two things that cause him particular discomfort: anti-Semitic remarks, and reminders that his wife is about to sleep with another man.Ulysses is about language, but that makes it sound like it's some godawful lumbering doorstop written by an English professor. (John Barth, come on down!) It doesn't feel abstract at all; it's full of sights (the band of old sweat inside Bloom's hat), smells (restaurants, horse urine, flowers) and especially sounds (cats, printing presses, trams). I can't think of any other book which transports you so completely to a different place and time. (It might've helped that I grew up in Dublin and knew most of the places that Joyce is writing about.) Borges described Joyce's prose style, at least in the earlier half of the book, as &quot;strong and delicate&quot; and that's a good description.As the day wears on, the book starts to rumble at the foundations and it lurches with increasing unpredictability from style to style. Joyce is making a point about language; that things are altered by the manner in which we describe them. This can get a bit wearisome after a while, but when it works well - as in the chapter where the doings of a young girl on a beach are narrated in the style of a girl's magazine story - it can be very funny and rather touching. The book closes with a mighty tour de force as Molly Bloom sits up and thinks about her life and her curious husband.Okay, that's the beginner's guide. My personal opinion? It's the best Irish book, a constant wonder, irritation and delight to read, and a stunning effort of imagination and intelligence by the most significant and most lavishly talented Irish writer. 20th and 21st century Irish culture is unthinkable without it. I'm grateful that it's there. What else is to be said?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I picked this up for a group read of Ulysses. I figured it would be convenient to have it on the computer so I could look up all the references I didn't understand, and the price was certainly right. Unfortunately, as I came to realize, this edition of the book is missing pieces of text. I probably wouldn't have noticed this, except that when I googled one of the references that I didn't get, I came up with a preview of a book called Ulysses Annotated, which describes in detail the meaning of all the references. As I read, I noticed that in several places there were references noted that I hadn't seen in the text. Finally, I got annoyed and googled the exact line that preceded an area of missing text, and found that some lines of verse had been omitted from my edition of the book. It's a shame, since I was enjoying the clear formatting and the ease of use that the Kindle edition was giving me, but since it's not really a book that I want to spend money on, I guess I'll be giving Project Gutenberg's version a try."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Stuff you probably want to know:1. It's read by two people: one guy, who does absolutely everything (including Molly) up till the last chapter, then the last chapter, which is read entirely by a woman.2. The guy is supremely talented at reading. It's a dramatic reading, in which he imitates the voices of the others and tries to get into it. I would regard his imitation of the voices of others as supremely believable.3. He has a light British accent (London), but switches to a convincing Irish brogue when reading straight spoken dialogue for most characters. Excellent French and Latin pronunciation. His Italian and Spanish are less successful. The woman is certifiably Irish.4. There are no sound effects (footsteps, keys, etc.), but there are a few songs interlarded, usually at the beginning of each CD.5. If you're a Joyce scholar, you are doubtless using the Gabler edition of 1986, WHICH WASN'T THE EDITION USED FOR THIS. I think they're actually using the 1922 edition! Anyhow, this is a constant irritant for serious Joyce fanatics, as, since you are doubtless using Gabler, there'll be something in almost every paragraph that's just a whit different. It's a constant distraction, alas!6. He reads it a little fast for my taste (especially in Circe).7. Yes, it is totally unabridged.8. There are 22 CD's total.9. You should buy it. I had read Ulysses twice before I got it, and going through it with this CD set really opened up the book to me, in a way I couldn't have gotten with any other type of ancillary aid. It was like reading the book for the first time! Wasn't so incomprehensible after all!I should warn you that one thing you might find thoroughly infuriating is that the title tracks / id tags of the CD tracks are totally in chaos. It's so bizarre, it smacks of sabotage. (For example, the title track of the 1st track of the 2nd (!) CD is: \\"Time for lunch. 1 p.m. After Dignam's funeral . . .\\" While the actual content is the \\"ineluctable modality of the visible\\" passage. It's craaaaazy!Rest assured, this is just the names your computer sees: everything is there, and in the correct order. My point is that if you plan on porting everything over to your iPod, you're gonna have some tedious clerical work ahead of you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"O.k. to start with...for all of you out there who are interested in reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; but are intimidated by all of the rest of you out there who say it's unreadable, take my advice. Read this book. It's absolutely ridiculous to say this book can't be read. I can't say you're going to find it interesting or enjoyable, but you can read it.There are people who would have you believe you have to wage a massive campaign of pre-&quot;Ulysses&quot; study before delving into Joyce's novel. I've heard it's necessary to read biographies of Joyce, read all of his other literature, read about the history of Dublin, read Greek mythology...even study Dublin city maps!!! Don't you believe any of this. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is perfectly approachable having read none of the above. I admit that reading &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; first is helpful, and at least having some passing knowledge of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; won't hurt, but being familiar with these other works will only help you appreciate some of Joyce's nuances. Being unfamiliar with them will not prevent you from digesting &quot;Ulysses.&quot;Now, for the book itself. Is &quot;Ulysses&quot; good? That's become an almost irrelevant question to ask. Do you have to like &quot;Ulysses?&quot; No. Do you have to admit that it is the greatest novel ever written? No. Anyone denying that the book was influential in altering the course of literature would just be foolish. However, I don't think &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the be-all and end-all of 20th Century literature, and the new ground that Joyce broke would have been broken anyway had he not done it first. He was certainly an innovator, but other authors (Faulkner comes to mind) use Joyce's modernist approach to fiction and do it better.For ultimately, Joyce is a lousy storyteller. Notice I did not say he is a lousy writer. One can't deny the absolute mastery of language apparent in &quot;Ulysses.&quot; But Joyce is almost completely unable to connect with his reader. Parts of this novel come close to doing just that, but in between there are vast numbers of pages of dull, dull prose that set out to be as incomprehensible as possible. What was Joyce afraid of? Was he scared that what he actually had to say wasn't either particulary interesting or profound, so he had to bury it underneath layer after layer of obscure allusions and writing styles? I didn't understand every part of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; and I don't believe all of these so-called Joyce experts do either, despite the massive amount of critical study done about it. However, understanding every single part of the novel and understanding the novel are two different things, and I believe I understood &quot;Ulysses.&quot; And what I found is that it's not the beast everyone's made it out to be, but neither is it particulary interesting or profound.In short, I would recommend that everyone read &quot;Ulysses,&quot; if for no other reason than that you can have an opinion on it. I won't be reading it again, so I guess I'll have to just live in ignorance of all the hidden delights Joyce offers his readers. I neither loved it or hated it---there are many books I've enjoyed reading less and many more books I've enjoyed reading much more. Before reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; I was reluctant to state that I didn't like Joyce's writing, feeling that any opinion about Joyce without having read his masterwork would be uneducated. Well, I've read the damn thing now, and I can state with a very educated opinion: &quot;I do not like Joyce's writing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have frequently heard Ulysses proclaimed the best book ever written, but I could never understand why. I purchased this edition of the novel three years ago, and since then it sat on my shelf, a mighty 900 page undertaking that I kept putting off. I was reluctant to read it, for I have often heard how difficult it was to get through. Finally, I have read it, and though I believe it presumptuous to call any one book \\"the best book of all time\\", I certainly believe that Ulysses could claim that title. First off, it is not a difficult read. If you could get through A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, you can get through Ulysses. I heartily recommend this edition because of the brilliant introduction by Declan Kibard. Before I read Ulysses, I could not understand how this could be the best book of all time. According to my understanding, it was a novel detailing, in 900 pages, one day in the life of a Jewish Irishman, Leopold Bloom. A totally unremarkable day at that. After reading Kibard's introduction, I was fiercely eager to begin the novel. In his introduction, totally some 70 pages, Kibard answers the precise question I had: Why would this book be called the best of all time? This book is never boring, and is actually a quite enjoyable read. It is arranged in 18 chapters, and to me, the most astounding aspect of this piece of literature is the fact that every chapter is written in a different style. Joyce wanted to show that \\"originality\\" in terms of style was merely a new arrangement of previous styles, and so shows his brilliance as a writer by changing his technique and method completely in each chapter. It is indeed difficult to believe they were written by the same person. The styles are listed as: Narrative (Young), Catechism (Personal), Monologue (Male), Narrative (Mature), Narcissism, Incubism, Enthymemic, Peristaltic, Dialectic, Labyrinth, Fuga per canonem, Gigantism, Tumescence detumescence, Embryonic development, Hallucination, Narrative (Old), Catechism (Impersonal), Monologue (Female). Some chapters, such as the Cyclops, done in Gigantism, are deliciously satirical and overdone, while others, such as the Lotus-eaters, are sharp and direct. Though Joyce is often called a \\"stream of consciousness writer\\", only a few chapters are the truly chaotic stream of consciousness, such as the Oxen of the Sun, the Proteus, and the Sirens. The culmination of absurdity and abstraction occurs in the massive Circe chapter, a play styled as a hallucination in the brothels of Dublin. This novel is nearly impossible to take in with just one reading, and I will be reading it again shortly. On this note, I would say that I heartily recommend reading Ulysses straight through in its original form, rather than labouring under the weight of the hefty annotated edition. A true masterpiece, one of the best books I've ever read, and yes, quite possibly the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The eBook is missing text. I also have a print edition, but I wanted a copy I could read on my phone when i had the time. The part I noticed is missing is the Ballad of Joking Jesus. It's probably missing other text as well."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I had heard about Ulysses all through my literature-loving youth. When I was 16 or so, I tried to find Ulysses in the St. Cloud Technical High School Library. It was listed in the card catalog, but it was never on the shelves. Finally, I asked the prim-and-proper old biddy librarian where the book was. She fairly shuddered and asked me with a cockeyed combination of excitement and accusation &quot;why&quot; I wanted to read it. I told her I'd heard it was a great book and so please hand it over. Sure enough, it was in a back room and the old battleaxe crept forth with the book, jacketed in a beautiful red. At home I opened it and tried to make sense out of the first page. I dipped around in it and finally threw it hard as I could against the wall of my bedroom. &quot;This is gibberish junk!&quot; I said to myself. Later, I kept hearing more about the book and thought, &quot;well, maybe I'm just dumb,&quot; which really teed me off. One day I found a book called &quot;Re-Joyce&quot; by Anthony Burgess (of Clockwork Orange fame). He was a Joyce fanatic and wrote a book about how to read Ulysses. And so I read Re-Joyce as I read Ulysses and, wonder of wonders, what an experience! That was back in 1965. I still read Ulysses. It's the one book I re-read more than any other. Oh, and when I look back, way back to my high school library, I know now how Joyce would have roared with merriment at that biddy librarian. He would have been honored in his sly way to see his naughty book kept behind that bun-haired spinster's iron petticoats. Don't give up on Ulysses! Get the Burgess book as a guide, or the Gilbert guide. But don't give up. Riches, great riches, await you!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have listened in the past to the taped rendition of Ulysses, and I pushed my way through it for the bragging rights. This new version is just so superb and so amazing in its vitality.While at times Ulysses is still a challenge to grasp, I can guarantee that the whole book is much more comprehensible, and wonderful, to hear it read so well. It suddenly makes sense.As a by-the-way, the Naxos packaging is second only to Apple's iPod in the pleasure I got from handling it and opening it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"You ever hear that old adage about \\"what don't kill you, makes you stronger\\"? Well, struggling through Ulysses is kinda like that. If you haven't taken a bottle of pain relievers mid-point through the book or perhaps just sprained your wrists trying to hold aloft the 768 page tome, you might just start to understand the methods behind Joyce's madness. But understanding doesn't equal enjoyment.Ulysses, one of the most celebrated and challenging books in the English language has been reduced to one of two things: to the general public, a curiosity, a book of importance that no one would really read or: to Lit majors: the equivalent of a double-dog dare among the Lit-Crit crowd; a book professors assign in order to weed out the weak, who more than likely change majors to something less demanding, like quantum physics. Inevitably, in both circles it has become a book to be endured, not enjoyed.What is the book about? Joyce, a master of the written word *does* appear to have a lot to say about everything, including, but not limited to, religion, politics, sex, and literature. But if there is a flaw in the book (and indeed, it could be argued that the flaw lies with the reader, not the author), it's that Joyce seems more preoccupied with how his story is told, losing sight of the actual subjects. Ulysses is really about WRITING, it seems, and in particular, how well Joyce can do it. The skill involved in the writing often attains that genius status, but too often it feels strangely hollow, a series of breathlessly staged feats of writing skill. In other words, he's showboating.Still, despite Joyce's blatant shouts of \\"look at me!\\", many moments of passion do leak through. Particularly impressive is the final 40 pages or so which takes on a confessional tone that at last attempts to engage the reader emotionally, instead of keeping them at a distance.Reading Ulysses is difficult, to be sure. Joyce drops more obscure references than Dennis Miller after three highballs. Joyce assumes you've read The Odyssey, Dante's The Divine Comedy, the Bible, Hamlet, and, of course the dictionary. He also assumes that you have a passing knowledge of about 6 or 7 languages. But, even if you do have prior knowledge of said works and you know Latin, it cannot help make Ulysses as a whole, an engaging, vital work. It is a towering achievement, yes, but much more of a textbook on writing, which just happens to use the characters of Stephen Daedalus and Leopold Bloom as examples of the styles that Joyce writes in.All said and done though, I would recommend this book as it is unique and it is one of those titles that, like childbirth, has to be experienced to be understood.I would also recommend Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as a superior work of art. It's just as inventive, it's moving and passionate, and it says what it has to say before wearing out it's welcome."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Orchises Press edition stands out for three reasons. The first is that it reproduces--with impressive attention to detail--the first edition of Joyce's novel. The second reason is that the large, widemargined pages add the pleasure of reading to the pleasure of reading Ulysses (there is something missing, after all, in the insubstantial, tinytype levity of the paperback editions). Finally, the weight of the paper, the strength of the binding makes this edition one that will last (and you will not, as with the paperback editions, be forced to transcripe all your notes from a book that falls apart after three readings). For those who seek the &quot;authenticity&quot; of a first edition, who admire Joyce or who will be studying the novel for years to come, this is the edition to buy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I first ready Ulysses when I was 20 and on summer break from college. I read it with the annotated version as a guide. It was work but it was fun work. Here are a few things people never talk about with Ulysses:1. It's a very, very funny book2. At it's heart, it's about a young man trying to recover from the death of his mother and a middle aged man trying to cope with his marital crisis and the buried sadness over his dead son and father. Nothing overly obscure or elitist or intellectual there, I don't think.3. The verbal pyrotechnics serve the story. Joyce wanted to describe one day and make it entertaining. All the literary references serve the purpose of adding richness, depth, timelessness and universality to a story about ordinary Dublin citizens wandering around on a warm early summer's day.4. Ultimately, this book is a love story--the least sentimental love story ever written but it's about Stephen's conflicted love for his mother, Molly and Poldy's conflicted love for each other, and Joyce's conflicted love for Ireland. The book is about, as Stephen says, \\"the affirmation of the human spirit\\". He's not being sarcastic when he says that.Ulysses is a novel in brilliant technicolor. I've read nearly all the major literary classics and they are all in black and white by comparison."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I started this book, I must admit it was slow going. I was never a big fan of Joyce. \\"Dubliners\\" was cold and a bit too precious for me. \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" was likewise nothing to crap your pants over. So it was solely with a sense of responsibility to literary tradition that I finally opened my age-old copy of \\"Ulysses\\" to see what all the fuss was about.Immediately I hated it as I've hated few books before. Dense and uncommunicative. Sure it had stream of consciousness and all that - but this really was perfected by Faulkner, etc. - or so I thought.I kept reading - and reading and reading and reading. There came a time about 150 pages into this almost 700 page monster that I seriously considered doing my book physical harm. I thought of throwing it or ripping it or even burning it. However, good sense prevailed and I just kept at it.Then, the epiphany!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" doesn't just mirror Homer's epic but the reader actually reenacts it in the very process of understanding the book. Sure, the text is hard and Joyce doesn't take you by the hand - but it's meant to be that way. In the very difficult process of making meaning out of the text we become an integral part of the text and its meaning. The book is about the experience of literature more than it's about Mr. Bloom or Stephan Dedalus. In effect, you become Ulysses, yourself, and your very difficulties in understanding parallel the hero's difficulties finding his way home.What emerges after such a discovery is still a difficult and - at times - frustrating book. However, it is unquestionably a work of genius. Moreover, it goes far beyond the generation of stream of consciousness. The modes of communication are so varied here that each chapter almost reads like a new book. View points are important as well as the parallel structures they build cumulatively, however, the very mode of communication, itself, is of the story. Moreover, the honesty of the character portrayals is shocking. These are real people to a degree we rarely if ever see portrayed. We see everything Bloom does - from pontificate to use the bathroom.To anyone having difficulty with this book, I advise you keep reading. Promise yourself that you'll finish this book. Then you can hate or love it - whatever you want. Just finish.Now that Joyce actually makes sense, I wonder if I should go back to his early work or on to \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" - that monster of textuality that goes even further than \\"Ulysses.\\" I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet - but I will be. I will be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce is the most talented user of the English language since Shakespeare. His use of language is dazzling in its inventiveness and sophistication, and the sonic qualities of his writing are the equal of any poet. 'Ulysses' is rich, beautiful, moving, and evocative; the cleverness of the novel is associated with a profoundly human and humane sensibility.Often, this 'modernist' novel is contrasted with 'realist' novels, as though Joyce was doing something strange and different, but I don't think that's true - on the contrary, if a realist novel is one that communicates reality, then the stream-of-consciousness passages of 'Ulysses' are the high-water mark of the realist prose tradition, because they do something that no-one else has ever really managed - persuasively communicate his characters' experiences and thoughts from within. And there's more about the reality of Dublin life in 1904 than you would get from a dozen other novels of the period. He's not writing something other than a realist novel - he's doing it bigger and better than anyone else.BUT - it's not an easy read. The density of the prose makes it like reading poetry, and it's hard work just as reading an 800-page poem would be hard work. Furthermore, it's not all equally good; some of Joyce's experiments with language are less successful than others - the surrealist chapter springs to mind as a weak bit. When you're half-way through one of the less successful chapters, and it's both hard work *and* rather boring, it can feel a little bit like banging your head against a brick wall.So - know what you're getting yourself into. This book isn't for everyone, and you're not going to finish it in the course of a a one-week beach holiday in Marbella. But if you think you're up to it - have a go. It may just really annoy you. Or it may be the most rewarding book you'll ever read.Harry"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While I think the Gabler edition of Ulysses is great, if you are looking to buy a new copy of it, please beware! In a class I taught, many students' books contained a considerable misprint in which 15 pages of episode 13 are reprinted in episode 14 (and 15 pages are missing from episode 14). The binding on recent printings is so poorly constructed, that within 4 weeks of class, 3/4 of my class's editions fell apart into a dozen clumps of roughly 50 pages each. We contacted the publisher, but Vintage customer service was indifferent to our problems. My own copy, from 1986, is still in one piece after years of use. If you want this edition (which I still recommend), try an older printing. Vintage's indifference to its own shoddy book production is unprofessional and inexcuasble. I'm posting this review Oct 2005, so I hope this warning will not be necessary at a future date."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am glad that I read \\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce as part of a graduate level course so that I had a professor who could explain all the intricacies and idiosyncracies of Joyce's masterpiece. Had I tried to read this novel on my own, I'm sure I would've given up very early on. Its stream-of-consciousness style not only defies the laws of narratrion, but Joyce expected his readers to be as intelligent as he was, which is just not the average case in today's society. It is easy to see why this novel has been the center of such controversy and praise ever since it was published; it truly stands alone in the pantheon of modern literature. As challenging and frustrating as it can be, it is a rewarding and intriguing read.So how does one sum up a nearly 800 page novel that follows the seemingly mundance events of one day (June 16, 1904) in Dublin, Ireland? \\"Ulysses\\" is the tale primarily of two men, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, whose paths propitiously cross late within the book. Stephen, a young intellectual, is stuck in an unrewarding job as a teacher. Bloom, a half-Jewish worker, is stuck in an unhappy marriage and who finds joy in the smallest and oddest of places. His day's journey through Dublin takes him to a funeral, a bar where he very nearly gets into a fight, a maternity ward, and a house of ill repute before he returns home for the evening. Along the way, readers are introduced to a wide cast of supporting characters who flesh out Bloom's adventures and play symbolic roles based on Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\". Readers are also given a vast insight into the history of the English language as well as questions that concern the very essence of humanity. The novel finishes with the perspective of Bloom's wife, Molly, who sheds some interesting light on Bloom's fears and presentiments.There is truly no other work like \\"Ulysses\\" in the history of the English novel and there will likely never be another quite like it. Joyce's command of the English language was phenomenal and his powers are at full display in chapter after chapter, whether in parodies of various writing styles or mocking the vapid putrescence of romantic literature. Leopold Bloom springs to life and his journey, while challenging and difficult, is definitely worth pursuing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Five stars for Joyce and Ulysses, but boos to Amazon and Kindle, because the Kindle link provided with the ad for the Gabler edition leads to a Kindle version of the older Random House edition, which has many textual differences. Amazon, is the Gabler edition of Ulysses not available on Kindle? If it is not, please stop misleading your customers into thinking that it is. If it is available on Kindle, please replace the present Kindle link with the proper one. Thank you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Of course it's difficult; it was meant to be so. However, Joyce's desire to keep critics writing about him by making Ulysses a dense read is not reason to disparage what he was capable of doing. Another reviewer states that the book has neither plot nor story; this is false and misleading.Ulysses is not for the faint-hearted nor for the prudish. Certainly it remains on college reading lists because of its multiple layers of meanings, which few readers, if any, can grasp at first reading. To understand everything probably requires multiple readings, secondary sources, and/or formal study. Also, reading the entirety of Homer's Odyssey is a great help, just for seeing the parallels Joyce was driving at. But many jokes and innuendoes can be understood immediately, and if you are truly reading the text, you can determine what is going on. But this is never a book that you can comprehend by merely skimming along, waiting for the narrative to clear everything up for you.The effort is worth it, but don't attempt it if your motive is simply to add another title to your \\"List of Important Books That I've Read.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses has got to be the most difficult thing I have ever read. Being as tough as it is to read, I can see why their is a lot of negative reviews about this book. Most people feel for a book to be good it has to be action packed and fastly paced with a bunch of characters that you like.Well Ulysses has really none of those things, unless you can identify with Bloom or Stephen then you'll probably like them. When you pick up Ulysses you need to get some help. I read the guide by Gilbert along with the text and it helped me a lot. Without a guide Ulysses can be even harder than than it normally is.You also should not expect any major or huge events to happen. Nobody dies or anything exciting like that.Lastly you need to get into a mindset that what your going to be reading is extremly hard, but with a little patience it can be extremly rewarding.Now, without further ado, I will review Ulysses. I gave the book five stars, but it is not an unqualified five star review. When reading Ulysses in it's entirety, some parts are classic while other parts just seem unneccesary. For example, the Hades episode is the best in the book and probably the best example of realistic writing in the english language. Most of the other episodes are also great, but a few are just a burden to read. The Oxen of the Sun episode in my opinion is pointless. Joyce seems to like the fact that he can write in middle english, so he does. I'm no expert on middle english, but it's damn hard to read and it disrupts any flow the book had. If you can sort out the slang at the end of Oxen of the Sun then I congragulate you, because it was totally lost on me. The Ithaca episode is another example. It is told with a series of questions and are answered in the most drawn out and scientific way possible. Maybe Joyce could have been best served using a diffrent style. Stephen's Shakespeare rant also seems unnecessary and the episode where Bloom is trying to sell an ad to the newspaper is hard to follow.Ever other episode is expertly written and is a delight to read. The pitfalls of a few episodes are more than made up for with the 14 or so episodes that are expertly written.What Joyce does with language in this book is amazing. He is a true master of the english language and a master of a multitude of diffrent styles. He writes magnificently but sometimes he can't seem to help but show off his skills.And to those who think this book is utterly impossible and if anyone says they finished this book is lying, well I swear to god in heaven that I read this book cover to cover. It was no easy task, it took me a long time, but I did finish it. I don't claim to come close to total comprehension but I did read it all the way through.I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't analytically challenged, has an attention span of at least one hour, and won't be offended if a writer changes styles every chapter. I highly recommend it. If you get through it you can be a literary snob for the rest of your life. Did you finish Ulysses, I did."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I suppose it is pretty hard to add anything to this monstrous string of reviews. But I will comment because (obviously like so many others) I found this book to be very important. The fact that so many reviews exist shows that this book has effected a lot of people (enough to expend their precious energies writing about it). As you can see, not many really ride the middle ground about it. People seem to love it passionately or they hate it passionately. This should be enough to recommend it to anyone. We all should be after books that are going to change us, challenge us, effect our lives and loves. This is a book that has done that for a great many people. If you have not read it, take the time. I do not think that you'll sit in your easy chair and say 'well, it was okay,' and flip on the television.Personally, I found the book to be lively and entertaining. It was also challenging and arduous. Sometimes I couldn't put it down and sometimes I couldn't pick it up. Sometimes I thought it was a stupid book and sometimes I thought it was the best work of fiction that I had read. Ulysses is overall 'real.' It discusses truth, it changes a lot, like life. All the characters can be seen as stable in their lives, yet metaphysically sort of lost and wandering. That is like Ulysses. It is also a lot like you and I. There are jarring events, changes of style, unexpected devices and layers and layers of erudition. There are also normal everyday joes going about life as usual, to which we can all relate. It was not easy, and that is like life, also. Like life, it has a lot to teach you. And you can come back to this book many times and still find it fresh. It probably will seem an entirely new beast when you return.Unlike some of the reviewers, I wouldn't recommend annotations. Trust yourself and trust Joyce in undertaking the work. Perhaps you'll miss things here or there. That is okay. You'll still 'get it,' in the end, if you make it. Part of it is seeing if you can make it, so you sort of fail in your test of yourself if you immediately resort to consulting some sort of 'dictionary of Joyce.' For anyone that sees this book as too daunting, let me just say that I'm not an English major or in a literature related field. I'm a music student, just a plain old undergraduate joe that read this book. I read the book without annotations except for one period where I was stuck and thought I didn't understand. I checked the annotations out from the library and I found that I did understand (at least as well as the annotator) and that I just needed to keep going to figure it out, just like in finding out how a Dickens plot is going to unfold. I would recommend against taking that step. Leave the annotations on the shelf. I'd recommend that you, another plain old non - literature joe or jane, try it. Trust yourself and try it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is no reason in the world for me to write a review for this except to say \\"I READ IT\\".

Joyce's masterpiece is largely unread beacuse it has been branded &quot;difficult&quot;, but people who make this claim are simply not able to take in serious literature. Anyone who thinks that Joyce has a rival as the greatest writer in history needs only to read this book to be convinced. To get the full satisfaction from this book I think the reader needs to have read the works of Homer frist to understand the greatness and true meaning of the greatest book ever. Forget Plexus, Nexus and all that, forget to kill a mocking bird and all other pretenders, this book is the greatest."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce's Ulysses stands as a mountain in the centre of the wasteland of 20th century fiction. It is the landmark that reaches into the pages of every novel written since, it is polymath.But it's a darned difficult read. Each chapter is written not just in a new form, but in a completely new style. It demands a shift in mindset as one progresses through the book. In some cases that shift is required from sentence to sentence, or indeed from word to word.It's not a novel for the casual reader. To get anything out of it, one must be experienced. The annotations do help, but a broad knowledge of international literature, and indeed international language would be a boon when working one's way through the time-honoured pages.Personally, I'd buy it just for the 'Ithaca' chapter. It's pure art (or science, in fact), and in my humble opinion an incredible achievement in anti-narrative that is unsurpassed.Enough sycophancy. Ulysses is glorious, and that is truth."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The last 200+ pages of this book were fantastic, including the night scenes in town. I have not read English poetry and therefore was lost for an earier 200 pages. Joyce's references to Parnell were interesting, as was the singular reference to U.S. Grant. Leopold Bloom is an example, I suppose, of the exception to the single mindedness of these Irish people. Dublin was a lovely city, however, clearly not diverse enough for Joyce. I liked this book for the exposure given me to the English language. Joyce was a master with the pen (as was Paul). Do I read Finnegan's Wake? How can I not?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Only on my 3rd or 4th attempt did i settle down and finally read this book. I actually saw Joseph Strick's 1967 film recently and although only a fraction of the book makes it to the screen, i found it more informative than any 'guide' you care to buy to help you.The range of linguistic styles, the mindboggling clever plotting, the dazzling knowledge,the unbelievably human sexual passages and above all the spectacular humour are for me all the elements that make Ulysses the definitive vision of how words make up a story that can depict the our condition.All I can say is that I got to Ulysses having already worked my way through the later innovators of the century - Pynchon,Beckett, Gaddis,Coover,Burroughs etc etc and it turns out that almost everything they have said can be found in Ulysses, and Joyce is always more touching, more beautiful, and more anything-you-care-to-mention."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't know if I understood Ulysses as a 'classic' except in the sense that it is an exercise for 'erudition'. Nevertheless, with the assistance of a Cliff Notes edition I was able to go through the whole length of the book and actually understand what was going on. In all, it wasn't too bad. I know this is a seminal work and has influenced a lot of writers, as a novel itself it cannot get 5 stars though."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce turn a left turn from Tolstoy's idea of elegantly revealing the stream of consciousness, unto pouring it by the bucket on the reader's head. Unfortunately, thousand of less competent hacks have followed in his footsteps making the latter half of the 20th century the garbage dump of literature."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"whoever gives this book less that six stars out of five is ver likely to be just not mature enough to handle serious literature"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Everyone seems to agree that this is a great novel, except for a few, and I don't have time to read all the reviews, but I would say one thing: you don't have to completely understand Ulysses to appreciate it. Most people who tell you that they understand the book are lying. Joyce was a genius--not in a way that he was a &quot;really good&quot; writer, but in a way that he simply had more brain power than almost all of us. He pushed himself for years and years to write this book, and he is a genius, so why should we be able to understand this book in one or two readings? You might get the gist of it after a few readings, a good professor to guide you through, and a strong literary background. But it doesn't matter if you have your MA in English or not, Joyce's intricacies will, for most of us, remain elusive. Not understanding Ulysses doesn't mean you're stupid it means you are human. I don't know why people are suprised that they don't &quot;get it&quot; when they read it. Most of us will probably never be able to grasp the brilliance of Mozart's music or Einstein's theories either, we have to kind of trust people that know how good they are. After a while we may be able to see why they are so good too. It's curious that people would hold literature to a lower bar than those disciplines. If you're not a rocket scientist, chances are you're probably not going to pick up a book on rocket science and expect to understand it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I informed a co-worker of my intention to read Ulysses, he replied that his grandmother had read it (as it used to be requisite reading) and pronounced it, \\"300,000 words about a man crossing the street\\". That is the sort of dismissal about classical literature that makes me doubly determined to dive in.Much to my dismay, Ulysses turned out to be 300,000 words about a man crossing the street. Yes, the language is beautiful. Yes, the classical allusions are thought-provoking and on-point. Yes, there is a good deal of lewd behavior and avarice to carry the reader along. Unfortunately Ulysses reminded me why no one writes classical literature any more; its unecessary and outdated verbosity went the way of the Dodo long ago.When I finally reached Molly's narrative I felt like I was a drowning man finally coming up for air, and when I completed the last line I felt I could finally breathe deep. It's not that Ulysses is unreadable; only that there is little reason to read it in its entirety. Find someone who has edited out everything but the dirty jokes and famously coined phrases in their context and read their edition instead. You'll save yourself 40+ hours."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was intimidated at the bulk of ULYSSES, I must admit. But i found myself shocked by it's radiating brilliance. The book is a labor to read, one often has to re-read a paragraph or (god forbid) a chapter to allow the work to truly flow and make sense. Joyce uses beautiful detailed writing of the human mind, all of our peculiar little idiosyncracies and actions that define us as human beings.The greatest feat I've had in my young life is reading the last page and closing the book. You sit back and for hours are confounded as to the brilliance and success of Joyce to write the actions of two characters in a day. Each thought, each subconscious connection and little bits of thinking and reacting are somehow branded into the pages of ULYSSES. I dont think i will ever read such a significant work again. It is bold, it is at times monotonous, at times incoherent, but there are some golden pages were you are sucked into the writing, for the words on the page are your thoughts, your fantasies, your raw human nature.It took me a month to read the book, i read it in the midst of depression and suicidal thoughts. I was able to lose myself in ULYSSES, i was able to walk the streets with Dedalus and Bloom. I was able to sit on the beach and watch the dog sniff around for something he had lost in a past life time. It is a masterpiece while being imperfect, which is an awful lot like being a human being."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't want to elaborate on how hard this book can be to read (I think the other 75 reviews have covered that), but I will say that with Joyce you get out of it what you put into it. Those who love this book rave about its groundbreaking techniques &amp; virtuosity of language. Those who hate this book complain that it is nothing but Joyce showing off &amp; taunting his readers with a book that has no unity or point. This book DOES have a point. All the style in it is only used as means to an end. There are characters. There is conflict (there are several, but I believe the basic conflict is each character struggling with the reality their lives as opposed to what they want their lives to be). There is a climax (and what a climax it is). There is a resolution. This is, at heart, a very sad and haunting book. I think the message in this novel is that we are at the mercy of our lives (i.e. circumstances control us, not vice versa), and that the only way we can deal with the fact that we have no control over our lives is by fooling ourselves. It is a study of the contrast between what we think we are and what we really are. It is saying that the only way people deal with their biggest problems is by running away from them (note the way Leopold Bloom constantly avoids confronting or even thinking about his wife's adultery, and note the way Stephen Dedalus reacts when confronted by his mother; I could cite plenty of other examples). This may be the ultimate truth of life, that we can never face the truth about ourselves. Joyce never states this directly; it is left up to the reader to find for himself. I would be doing this book injustice if I didn't mention that it fleshes out 2 of the most three-dimensional, complete characters in all of literature.This isn't a perfect book: the climax takes place about 200 pages before it ends. I also thought the last chapter, which is probably the most-praised chapter in the book, was disappointing. Joyce apparently tried to create a complete picture of a female character in about 50 pages, when it had taken him 700 pages to create 2 complete pictures of male characters. It threw off the pace of the novel to suddenly get inside the head of a completely different person. Ithaca could have easily been the last chapter, as it summed up all the day's events as opposed to going on to something totally different (which is what the last chapter did).Still, the characters, the themes, and the sheer scope of Ulysses make it as close to perfect as any book can be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I loved Don Quixote, still the greatest of novels. (6 stars!) I loved The Brothers Karamazov, the greatest work of the greatest novelist who ever lived.

(4 stars)But for some reason after three tries I can't get past page 20 of Ulysses. I find it boring, mannered and well nigh incomprehensible. If it wasn't for the fact that so many learned people say it is a masterpiece I would say Joyce is a fraud.

All entries in the TOC are in all caps (which always bothers me). But you can jump to any point in the book just fine by following a link.The only other disturbing formatting feature is that there is a blank line between each paragraph in the body text. So with a space = (normal interline spacing + blank line + interline), there's quite a big gap between paragraphs.I think this is required because all the paragraphs are in block indent style (ie, they have 0 left indent on the first line). If you didn't have blank lines between paragraphs, you probably couldn't see the paragraph boundaries easily.Anyhow, there seems to be a LOT (ie, a bit too much) whitespace on each page. I wish they used a normal paragraph indent for the first line, and removed the blank lines between paragraphs."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As for translations of Ulysses, let me tell my Italian friends that Joyce is often hilarious; hope that comes through. (Nel questo libro, Joyce sta scherzando spesso. Spero che suo traduttore non ha tradito, non ha persolo. Alcune delle battute sono stilistica, ma alcuni sono larghi, divertente. Ero un assistente educativo in scuola di specializzazione, e ha contribuito a insegnare in una classe Jocye di Prof Chester Anderson.)I was fortunate to encounter this book after a full, excellent college English major*, so as I read it at leisure during grad school summer, I found it very amusing in the grandest sense. Funny, too. This is a book that benefits from the reader having read most anthology English lit before s/he readsUlysses. Otherwise, one must dive for the footnotes.When one has read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, Ellman's Joyce is also delicious. For example, Joyce received a better grade on his Italian exam than on his English, in official grades when he was qualifying to teach English in Italy (especially Rome and Trieste). He barely qualified in English, but was well qualified in Italian. This gives me pause in an era when we're told that Testing, Testing is the way to improve US Public Ed. This tidbit alone, from Joyce's life, makes one severely doubt it.*Such a major does not even exist now: for example, all of Shakespeare's plays was the standard sophomore English major course, a full year, nineteen plays per semester."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To hold a copy of the original production of ULYSSES is a pleasure. The feel of the pages, the elegance of the typeface, the errors that are inevitable in a work of this magnitude and wit makes one wonder why it has taken so long for a publisher to do what Dover has done. To my mind, it's still the best way visually to read ULYSSES. We forget that when we read our eyes are made to dance with our minds, and to engage our heart in the dance...And Dover's unabridged edition of the original, as it was presented to the world, is a ballet!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The really awful side effect of Kindle is that we are subjected to terrible editions.

I was looking to save a few dollars and read a great classic and instead I have a five-pound doorstop."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can say without reservation that this is the most amazing book I have ever read in my life. It sparkles with emotion and visceral force, thrusting you so deeply into the lives of its main characters that the medium between the reader and the protagonists is completely penetrated and we quite simply become the characters. Asking such questions as \\"well what would have happened if Bloom had decided to do this\\" is meaningless because we know Bloom so well that it is impossible to conceive him doing anything other than as he does it. We are privy to his innermost passions and longings: in the Circe episode we too forlornly cry out to the apparition of his dead son Rudy, his destroyed hope for the honor of his name, his heritage, and his love. In the Wandering Rocks we feel Steven's pain as he is approached by his rag-clad sister begging him for food:\\"She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.\\"While some see the parellels to Homer as unnecessary pretentious obscurity, by recreating the Odyssey in turn-of-the-century-Dublin Joyce shows us that all of the heroic epics and action movies in the world are as shallow and meaningless filth before the only true glorious quest, that presented to us in the living of our lives each day.The Homeric parallel also underlies another of Joyce's major aims in the work, that of preserving what has come before. Stephen, the book's other main character, is an autobiographical University student obsessed with the great works of Western literature. Both his thought-stream and his conversations with other characters are rife with allusions to great literature from the ancient Greeks through St. Augustine (the Catholic Church is also very important), Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Flaubert, and even Oscar Wilde. These many allusions are often seen as a reason not to read the book, but I can affirm that while one does lose something by missing them, the book reads quite well without them and often one can determine the significance of the allusion from the context without knowing its source.Essentially Joyce has taken everything that has come before and combined it into a stunning novel that I feel puts him solidly beside Shakespeare as a true master of the English language. Of course when we say the English language that is up to some debate because, like Shakespeare, Joyce in no way feels bound to correct grammar and is quite willing to sacrifice it whenever he feels it hampers his expression.Yes parts of it are difficult, but not so difficult that one shouldn't attempt the book because of them. I have a dirty suspicion that a lot of the reputed difficulty of this book stems from the exaggerations of those who have read it and want to look smart. You will have to do a little background research, and I strongly advise Reading Joyce's other two books, Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, so that you know the setting and the people. But that said, go for it! It is more than worth the reward of a little patience at the beginning. Also Harry Blamires' New Bloomsday Book and Anthony Burgess's Re Joyce are wonderful supplements to help clear up some of the initial uncertainty.The book took me almost a year to get through, reading several of the episodes more than once, but coming away from it I absolutely confirm that it was COMPLETELY WORTH IT!!! READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Right. Ulysses. The intellectual field of Joycewrit contains more essays, papers, doctoral theses, and professional articles than most libraries contain books. So much has been written about this book that I usually have to step back and laugh when contemplating the enormity. It is like fathoming the universal end when you are a child of ten.With that said, I do believe I have something to contribute to *this* forum. I can tell you what this book is. It is perhaps the best and most complete example of written reality in existence. If the world exists in a grain of sand, then it exists in a day full of sand many times.What I mean is that the book works on any level. At a closely read level one can find absurdly esoteric references to minutiae that only has relevance for June 16, 1904. The esoterica works, though. By making something obscure that is in essence very simple, Joyce makes one think about it in a new way. Look at Chapter 17 remembering that Joyce's goal is to make the simple obscure. Then ask yourself what happens over the course of the chapter. Never has less accomplished more. Ithaca (ch. 17), by the way, was Joyce's favourite chapter.At a broader level Joyce's expressive mechanism becomes clear and truly rises above any intellectualization. Perhaps you should not worry too much about that passage of Italian shouted in the street, or the odd bit of vaudevillian obscurity. Instead look at the scope and breadth of a single day and the myriad thoughts that pass through your mind. Could someone decipher your day from your thoughts with ease? And as in a real day, as in reality, a man's life is not so simple to pick apart as a speech in a novel may lead you to believe. A simple bit of dialogue spoken to a boaster may reveal a great amount:&quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the opposite of that that is really life.-- What? Says Alf.-- Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred.&quot;And that, I am glad to say, is all we get."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce's Ulysses has been called a lot of things, most of them not flattering. I think the reason most people don't like Ulysses is that is is unlike any other novel, and cannot be treated as 'ordinary.'This day in the life of Leopold Bloom holds everything from insights into the nature of existence, opinions ranging from useful to mundane, and observations on, well, everything. Joyce manages to write a book which leads us through the minds of several characters as they live an ordinary, utterly unspectacular day. This technique is certainly unique, and utterly defines the concept of literary realism.To appreciate this book is to take it on its own terms. To gloss over the passages in which Leopold is daydreaming about triffles (as he does, as we all do. And that is the point.) does not hurt the reader in terms of understanding the plot. You don't so much as read this novel, as much as experience it. The reader is intended to be bored when Leopold is bored, excited when he is, and vaguely aware in-between. As one reviewer pointed out, the book is best understood when read aloud. I'm not sure if this is by design or simply because of Joyce's lyrical prose, but it's a good strategy especially in the tough passages.In all respects a classic, even if difficult at times. Influenced nearly everything else after it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Some people like to go for a stroll on the beach. Others like to climb Mount Everest. Reading Ulysses is much more like the latter than the former.I have now read this book four times. I must really be a glutton for punishment.Actually, the rereading is quite rewarding. When I first read the book in my youth, the only edition available was the one with all the printer's errors in it. Those errors made a difficult novel, much more so. So I found that my understanding and appreciation rose substantially when I could read the original version.As I grew older, I realized that I had had more experiences, read more books, and thought more thoughts. That meant that I found new layers of meaning in Ulysses.I plan to keep rereading this book on a regular basis for the rest of my life. I hope you find it this engrossing as well.What initially attracted me to the book was Joyce's ability to capture the inner dialogue that we all have. We alternate between thinking like angels and the basest animals. Joyce not only unveiled and portrayed that quality, he also imbued it with an elegance of expression that certainly exceeds my wit. It is almost as though an intellectual, well-educated literary comedian is invited along to make witnessing the internal dialogue more interesting.Of even greater significance is the reaction that many have to the novel. They simply do not want to plumb into someone else's mind, unless perhaps it is the mind of a saint. But who knows what a saint really thinks?The title, of course, is a dead giveaway (that few will need) that there are a literary analogy and symbolism involved. Those implications are enough to keep several Ph.D.'s busy for a career.Mr. Joyce was a most learned and observant man. What remarkable things must have gone on inside of his mind!If you are interested in extending your own ability to understand what is going on around you, I recommend Ulysses as a way to fill in the backdrop of what is not said when you are with others.If you are more than satisfied with surface reality, then by all means skip this book. You'll wonder what all the fuss is about.Perhaps the only exception to the latter is someone who loves a musical turn of phrasing, something Joyce excels in.Enjoy your journey!If you are like me, you'll find that it makes sense to keep your copy on the night table. You never know when you'll be ready for another trip to 1904."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"All the above reviews involve one person reading Ulysses in private, sometimes with help from notes and critics. This was a wildly new way of writing a book, so perhaps it calls for a wildly new way of reading it? I'm in an amateur group in Seattle that reads it together and does a staged reading of chapter a year of Ulysses. Our performances are free so this isn't a promotion! Many of the difficult things about the book are avoided with this method.....for example, it often seems obvious that voices are changing, and that becomes much clearer when one can hear the voices change. This includes jumps between different types of internal thoughts, or different literary styles. Also, the characters seem more real and easier to like when you can hear their voices. Plus, if something seems incomprehensible, you can't stop and perseverate about it during the actual performance.We spend several months reading together and listening to Joyce's prose and thinking about the different voices we hear in it, and researching the bits we don't understand, including esoteric references and pronunciations and mysteries. Then, on Bloomsday each year, the annual celebration of Joyce, but especially Ulysses, we read that chapter in public. The program includes that chapter's key features, a synopsis of the action, the analogy with the Odyssey, the symbols in Joyce's schema and the three or four most important of the intertwining themes within the chapter, and how that chapter relates to the rest of the book. People can bring along their copy of the book and read along.This is why Bloomsday was invented and is the best way to begin to appreciate Ulysses. Well, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps Joyce meant us to struggle, as one other reviewer suggested, to recreate the travails of Odysseus and Bloom in our own minds as we try to understand this book with no help. BUT maybe he actually meant us to read it very slowly and thoughfully, relishing every turn of phrase, every comic and poignant moment and discussing all of the book's references, analogies and puzzles. Perhaps to overthrow the imperialism of English literature which includes telling us how a book should be read!?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I landed in Dublin a couple of years ago and the immigration officer at the airport asked me the purpose of my visit, I told him, \\"James Joyce pilgrimage.\\" He was bemused. \\"James Joyce?\\" he said. \\"You mean 'Ulysses'? That fella?\\" (This moment gave me my first lesson in genuine Irish pronunciation. The Irish pronounce the title of Joyce's great novel with an emphasis on the first syllable: 'YOO-liseez') I answered his questions affirmatively; he examined my passport, studied my face and said, \\"That's a hard book. Have you read 'Ulysses'?\\" I raised my eyebrows in surprise at the question and asked, \\"Will you kick me out of the country if I say no?\\" The immigration officer, still holding my passport, replied, \\"That's a distinct possibility, sir.\\" \\"Then yes,\\" I said, \\"yes, I've read it many times, yes.\\" He returned the passport and waved me through, saying, \\"Enjoy it anyway.\\"I actually have read this book six or seven times by now. When I first read it I was Stephen's age, and now I'm the same age as Bloom. As I have changed over the years, so has my understanding of the book. I still consider 'Ulysses' the greatest novel of the twentieth century, but I can now better appreciate its weaknesses. The \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" and \\"Eumaeus\\" chapters are tedious (the former, in fact, is a failure), but the book's many high points greatly outweigh its faults. And, by the way, it's a COMIC novel, and don't let the professors tell you different."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce is a genius. Let's all say it together, loud and proud. Maybe he is so much of a genius that he has created in a novel, Ulysses, a work that is so far above anyone's heads that since the majority of the reading public doesn't understand, well then, by God, it must be supernova brilliant. Was it just me? Did my intellectual shortcomings not allow me to truly enjoy this work that makes everyone's top 10 books of the century list? Or was Joyce just playing around? A writer with mastery of the language decided to fool around a little and release a novel that is an exercise in experimentation on what you can do with language but nothing really more. To harbor my fragile intellectual ego, that's the theory I'm going with. Greatest book of all time or not, I just didn't get it.This book is supposed to be about Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus and a day in the life of Dublin in 1904. I really had to read the other reviews or cliff notes to be able to discern what happens on that day despite reading the book thoroughly. I know I sure didn't get it from the book. If cryptic meaning, having to read other books so you understand the book you're reading, and spending months slogging through a book is what your looking for in a read, by all means tackle Ulysses. Should we have to labor so hard to enjoy a book? I don't think so. The unique language and wordplay stand out above the rest of the white noise fray making this book redeemable, like a 783 page poem with no plot, if you can imagine enduring something like that.Maybe Joyce, from an Irish heaven, 70 year later is having the last laugh, as the intellectual world hails his &quot;playing around&quot; as THE modern masterpiece. Maybe it takes an English Literary Doctorate and many years to get enjoyment out of this book. I don't have either though, so the enjoyment wasn't there. Joy is the reason I read.

This is (thus far) the unchallenged, definitive edition, with helpfully numbered chapters and the corresponding Odyssey chapter titles in the table of contents. The introduction and forward, while in no way revelatory, are informative and interesting enough."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the most astonishingly difficult work of fiction that I have ever read. It is also one of the most astonishingly beautiful books I have ever read. Certainly, reading this novel is not for the uninitiated or the faint of heart. But it's also not for those who believe they can understand everything in this book.Certainly a ton has been written on this site about the plot so I'll skip that and just give my suggestions about how to go about reading this behemoth. Find a website that gives you a chapter by chapter summary (wikipedia is not particularly good because the analysis is simply too short). Read the summary of every chapter before you read the chapter and once again after you finish reading the chapter. Also, keep a dictionary handy. James Joyce has the largest vocabulary of any writer I have ever read. I found that this method was sufficient for me to be able to understand a great portion of the book. If I had tried to use an annotated guide, I feel like I would have spent too much time looking at every reference and ultimately given up on the book out of sheer boredom. Literature is meant to be enjoyed and appreciated, so unless you are planning on teaching the book to others, read the book without an annotated guide.For those that are willing to abandon all hope of complete understanding and enter Ulysses, I think the experience is actually quite rewarding. The writing is top-notch, the humor incredibly funny, and the drama incredibly moving. James Joyce said more with this book than I believe has even been said about the human condition in any other book (his only rival being William Shakespeare). It is a work of absolute genius, the kind of book that even the best writers can merely kowtow to in reverence. Its triumph will probably never be equalled and for that reason, it is worth the challenge."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I would not recommend this audio version as a substitute to the text, but as a very valuable augmentation. To get the most out of the Ulysses experience, one must employ all senses. Joyce's masterpiece is filled with the music of his own unique language. Reading the text without hearing it is tantamount to reading an opera. Hearing Ulysses read aloud by Donal Donnelly is like hearing that same opera performed by Caruso. The Sirens episode, in particular, is incomplete until it is given a voice. The text of Ulysses is frequently challenging as it drifts, without warning, between styles, languages, and points of view, but Donnelly navigates through Joyce's maelstrom with a confident hand firmly on the tiller. I can listen to these discs over and over the way I would my favorite music, and each time I hear something I missed before or make sense out of something that I didn't understand earlier. An audio companion to the text of Ulysses is invaluable, and I very highly recommend this particular version."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm reading Ulysses and concurrently listening to audio CD's of a seminar on the novel by Professor James Hefferman produced by The Teaching Company.

All in all, if you're going to embark on reading Ulysses, you want this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce (1934) is a novel about the interaction of social responsibility and personal desires. It focuses primarily on three characters: Stephen Dedalus a self-absorbed scholar attempting to find his artistic voice, Leopold Bloom who tries to meet his social responsibilities in a culture that is not completely accepting of him, and Molly Bloom (Poldy's wife) who struggles with her feminine destiny.The novel parallels the structure of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" that chronicles the 10 year struggle of Odysseus to return from war in Troy to his home in Ithaca. Ulysses, the Latin translation of the Greek name Odysseus, is Leopold (Poldy) Bloom who travels the streets of Dublin one Thursday on June 16, 1904. His goal is to accomplish his daily task of meeting his family's economic needs, forming social alliances with Dubliners (including Stephen), and satisfying his own drives for understanding and fulfillment. Odysseus sought to reunite with his wife and assess her fidelity in his absence, and Bloom looks forward to the end of the day when he returns to his home at 7 Eccles Street, concerned about his wife's unfaithfulness.\\"Ulysses\\" is remarkable in its descriptive detail of the physical and psychological environments of Dublin and its characters. The feelings related to immersion in the living Irish city are so strong that there may be some irrational fear of being unable to return to current life. The entrance into the reality of the lives of Stephen, Molly, and Poldy is uncanny as readers become physically and psychically connected to characters. It is a matter of proximity. You lose your own personality as you accompany these people when they converse, walk the streets, visit stores, drink and philosophize, reveal themselves in stream of consciousness monologues, argue, pursue bacchanalian extremes, and have private battles with loss and melancholy.The reader \`sees' everything that day, the external locations and the inner worlds of the characters, with the \\"ineluctable modality of the visible.\\" This is the direct and complete experience of Joyce's art without the restriction of our own frame of reference, history, obligations, and wants. It is intimidating to realize that your own life is changing, that part of your personal history now contains a new day of your own existence - you have extended your life for a day. Many people throughout the world celebrate a second birthday on June 16 (Bloomsday).After publication of \\"Ulysses,\\" I believe that James Joyce (like a few other artists) spent the rest of his life amazed at his creation. As he lay dying in hospital waiting for his wife to return to his bedside, he had to wonder where his inspiration originated, where he summoned the ability to give the gift of another day of life to us all.The reader can benefit most from \\"Ulysses\\" by preparing to read it. Read (re-read) Homers \\"Odyssey.\\" Pay close attention to the structure, the symbolic content, and the psychology of Odysseus. Odysseus was a flawed hero, externally brave but also self-serving and blind to parts of his own personality (like Bloom). Use \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford to help guide you through the detail of theology, philosophy, psychology, history, rhetoric, and the physical layout of Dublin. This reference work is very good because it allows readers to have their own experiences by providing only supplementary content (facts) that help to understand the myriad allusions presented in the text. I suggest that you enjoy the many beautiful styles of prose presented in the 18 episodes pausing to quickly glance at the definitions in your opened copy of \\"Ulysses Annotated.\\" Then before reading the next episode, go back and read the complete explanatory entries in this reference book. Give yourself a couple of months to enjoy the novel and add this new day to your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Notwithstanding disputes on the editorial choices, the main reason to get this particular edition is the fact that the guide by Don Gifford makes reference to its line numbering. The Gifford book is an indispensable companion to Ulysses. However, the large format, relatively small print and miserable binding are deplorable. Once you get to Molly's monologue, you almost have to detach the pages one after the other. Maybe not so great for the inescapable rereading of this masterwork!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's great fun to observe the rancorous--at times vicious--debate this book has engendered among and between its admirers and detractors. Whatever else might be said of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; it's clear that everyone who has read it (and even those who have not) has an opinion about it. But for those who are leery of beginning a book of this size and complexity without some guarantee that it is as &quot;GREAT&quot; as its admirers proclaim it to be, I offer these words of advice: take it slowly, don't get overly bogged down by the unorthodox style, and make a diligent effort to understand what Joyce is trying to say. It's easy to treat his ramblings as the workings of a drunk or inscrutable genius, and to &quot;force&quot; one's way through the book without getting anything out of it. I read &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the first time last summer, without annotations and with only a brief on-line summary of each chapter as my guide, and I'm sure I missed an awful lot. But I loved &quot;Ulysses&quot; nonetheless. The inventive style, the devious puns, the poetic prose--all of it amounts to a reading experience that will reward the patient and persistent with a tremendous intellectual and aesthetic (if not emotional) payoff. While it is not my favorite book of all time, I agree with those who say it's the most important novel of the twentieth-century. It so completely altered the literary landscape of its day that, 80 years after its publication, its effects are still being felt (but not always acknowledged) in the works of contemporary writers.If you want to read this book only because you've been told it was &quot;great&quot; or to tell others you read it (and thus sound &quot;intelligent&quot;), pick up the Cliffs Notes and save yourself some time. If you honestly want to understand *why* this book is frequently cited as the best of the twentieth century, dig in. I plan to revisit &quot;Ulysses&quot; myself in the not-so-distant future."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book designed to make some people hate it, and make some people love it. That's what we all want to write - the seeds of a good debate.Does one need to understand something to appreciate it? I first approached this book like any other - steam through the pages, and try to remember what the story was all about. I found a book which didn't make sense, a book that was near incomprehensible, and I felt frustrated that I could not see what the fuss was all about.I could not hate a book I could not understand, however, except for the fact that it seriously dented my ego. A book I couldn't understand? Never! How dare it??But certain fragments stayed in my mind, and I returned to it again, six months after my first read through.Picked through the text, fell through the lyricism, and replaced the book back on the shelf, where it resided more as a symbol, a badge of courage than a book.And I returned. Again and again. Snippets, fragments, open the book at random, extract. Replace. Repeat.Bit by bit it began to fall into place, the characters and the ambition of the book began to emerge. Bit by bit I began to like it more. I had to stop judging it on its reputation, difficulty or intellectualism. There are sections I love, sections I find a chore to read, and sections I discover all the time. Bizarrely, previously tedious chapters began to come to life, and I began to appreciate them. Equally so, I began to dislike some I previously liked, and the whole balance is always changing. So, I can say that although I've read all the words at least thrice, I have not finished reading the book. And at my rate of a few pages a month, I never will. I hope I never will.Most will either focus on the ambition or the difficulty of the book. There is no need to justify, I think, just read it. There is no need to judge it against any criteria other than yourself; you are the only yardstick any book needs (unless you're an academic, in which case something else is needed). There is no need to redefine &quot;good&quot; over and over again, and justify it.Multifaceted, multilayered, and most of all, strangely human, this is a book I'm not done with yet, and I don't intend ever to be so.That's why I'm giving it 5 stars. It never has ceased to uncover something new each time. The only other book that I can look at time and time again and discover something new all the time is a very good atlas! Well, that's why I think I'll give it 5 stars today. Tomorrow, maybe 4. It changes all the time.Joyce won, didn't he? Everyone wants to write something which is near immortal, and by writing a book which would prompt endless debate, he achieved that goal."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jim gets a little carried away like Pacino chewing carpets.

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having gotten through \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and \\"Dubliners,\\" I can now say James Joyce has to be the most arrogant, overrated author EVER. For someone with so clearly a gift for language, he lacked one important thing: THE ABILITY TO TELL AN INTERESTING STORY. Without a plot, it's just a bunch of random thoughts thrown at the wall, which is what this giant pile of excrement truly is. Don't buy the hype, I've read dozens and dozens of books deemed 'classic' and I found most to be labeled so for good reason. James Joyce is NOT a great writer, and this proves it. Awful, just awful..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite its lofty status as a revered icon of English literature, one only has to fight through a dozen or so pages to reach the painfully obivious conclusion that Ulysses is, in fact, unreadable gibberish.The book has no plot, no dramatic arc, no message, a (literally) pedestrian structure, and sentences constructed by means of a random walk through the dictionary as well as through Dublin, Ireland. It has no discernable central thought. No one can tell you what the book is about, for it is about nothing. But wait, perhaps there is an underlying theme, albeit one well hidden.Remember the fable of the Emperor's new clothes? Guillible courtiers were induced to beleive that a charlatan tailor had sewn garments for the Emperor that only suitably refined folk could see. In reality, there was nothing there at all. Jame Joyce and generations of literary sycophants have convinced impressionable students that Ulysses is a worthy read.When the uninitiaed find the text incoherent, this failure is chalked up to insufficient literary maturity. It can't be the fault of the book's alcohol-addled author.\\"Press on,\\" the professors say, \\"Ulysses' gloss will be revealed if only one perseveres past the many opaque chapters, thus developing the right sensitivities.\\"However, looking longer at this nonsense only reveals the glaring absense of rational content and the transparent emptiness. The self-indulgent Emperor Joyce has no clothes.The most damming indictment of this over-wrought tome is the fact that it is impossible to find ten people who have actually finished it. Ulysses is one of those books that everyone has heard of, but no one has read. Hence the market for Ulysses crib cards for use at cocktail parties by poseurs with literary pretensions or by guys with dates with English Lit chicks whom they are trying to bed. Perhaps Ulysses has some tactical utility after all, as an example of inverse Chick Lit.One supposes that the stream-of-consciousness descriptions of nose picking, masturbation, and sex broke ground for serious literature when published in the 1920's. Joyce deserves some credit for expanding the gross horizons of writing, but today's target audiences find those subjects ordinary and routine. This taboo-breaking history is hardly sufficient reason to examine Ulysses now. To be timeless literature, a book must speak to fundamental truths about ourselves.But what, if anything, does Ulysses tell us about the human condition? I suggest its plot-free message is one Joyce didn't, or couldn't, intend. That is; to trust one's educated common sense. If, to you, a book walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it was most likely written by a quack.If this stream-of-consciousness genre appeals to you, for a much better read get anything by Hunter S. Thompson. Dr. Gonzo's book will be more coherent, make more sense, and will be better crafted. And, your eyes won't glaze over after ten pages, as they will with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk. Or worse.Last but not least - the story, the time frame and the main characters - boring, boring and then boring again.Your reading time could be used on much more pleasant, interesting books.

I doubt James Joyce would like his books as ebooks. Any more than Shakespeare, Ovid, Milton, Boethius, Sartre, Shelley, Kazantzakis or Tobias would. It's not an appropriate fit.

Find me one person who has both: a) actually finished reading Ulysses, and b) enjoyed every moment, and I'll show you a liar.Ulysses is a failed novel because Joyce was a bad writer (shown by his other works). And all the illerati who insist (as did Time magazine) that it was the best novel of the 20th century are simply trying to cover up their own shortcomings of character by trying to appear as that which they are not: literate and respectable.Art is not something you have to \\"get through.\\" It is not something you have to convince yourself and others that it exists in the form you behold.

I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not being an English Literature major, nor an avid reader, I nevertheless decided to read the entire top 100 novels. I would start with the top novel, Ulysses. In that fashion, of reading the best novel first, I could excite myself, that is to kickstart myself, into reading quality material. Prior to this adventure, I mostly focused on the books I could understand, like calculus or structural engineering. Ulysses is far more complex than those references.To ask: Did I finish the book? I must say yes, times one point five. And I accomplished the feat in under three years. After a severe mental breakdown from trying to choke down the book in two bites, I started over after being half finished. I was sure that I had missed something in the first half, so I wanted to return and see what I missed. I searched hard, taking time to savor every word, often looking up words that I thought I may be misinterpreting, But to no avail. But I persisted.I made it through the chapter about Stephen Dedalus for the second time, and was encouraged that more exciting events were sure to surface.Then, through the second chapter about Bloom, I began to get very worried that I would just give up my quest for fine arts. But survived, realizing that I only had several hundred more pages to wade through, to the climax, and forthcoming literary rewards.So I finally approached the end of the novel, reaching the last chapter, paragraph, or sentence, whatever it may be considered, being that it was devoid of punctuation for nearly 100 pages. Apparently it was the authors form of providing the run-on thoughts of a mixed up middle-aged woman, in the middle of non-fulfilling acts of sleeping, half sleeping, dreaming, or other non-physical event.In conclusion, Don't read the book. Burn it hard. Do not let your children read the book---it will mutilate their brain cells.

The major obscenity, which should never have been permitted by the USA legal system, the marketplace for literature, or the fawning academic community, was the publication of this duplicitous enigma. Many scholars have devoted their careers to explaining its content, but its raison d'tre and current status are still a complete mystery to me.Psychological Profiling: Joyce/BloomFrom \\"stately, plump\\" Buck Mulligan's entrance on the first page to Molly Bloom's memories of her first lover 20+ hours and 600+ pages later, the unifying constancy is: This is not a \\"reader-friendly\\" work. For example, check out Wikipedia's content descriptors for major sections:* (Episode 3, Proteus) \\"Stephen reminisces and ponders ... This chapter is characterized by a stream of consciousness narrative style that changes focus wildly. Stephen's education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode.\\" [NB: When Stephen thinks or talks, it is often in Latin, French, or Italian - with no translation for the reader.]* (Episode 7, Aeolus) \\"This episode ... is characterized by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.\\"* (Episode 12, Cycolops) \\"This chapter is marked by extended tangents made outside the voice of the unnamed narrator: hyperboles of legal jargon, Biblical passages, Irish mythology, etc.\\"* (Episode 14, Oxen of the Sun) \\"This chapter is remarkable for Joyce's wordplay, which seems to recapitulate the entire history of the English language. After a short incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose, Anglo-Saxon alliteration, and moves on through parodies of, among others, Malory, the King James Bible, Bunyan, Defoe, Sterne, Walpole, Gibbon, Dickens, and Carlyle, before concluding in a haze of nearly incomprehensible slang.\\"* (Episode 15, Circe) \\"The plot is frequently interrupted by \`hallucinations' experienced by Stephen and Bloom - fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters.\\"* (Episode 16, Eumaeus) \\"The rambling and labored style of the narrative in this episode reflects the nervous exhaustion and confusion of the two protagonists.)* (Episode 17, Ithaca) \\"The style is that of a scientific inquiry ... The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination.\\"* Episode 18, Penelope) \\"The final episode ... also uses the stream of consciousness technique ... consists of Molly Bloom's Soliloquy: ... she recalls ... wishes ... imagines ... wonders ... senses ... fantasizes ... remembers ...\\"So what's the take-away from this painful experience? For me it was the state of James Joyce's mental health as he wrote Ulysses.ConsubstantialityHere I treat James Joyce and Leopold (Poly) Bloom as one. I will let Stephen Dedalus, a central character, make the argument for me. Early on Stephen makes the argument that Christ and God the Father are one:* \\"... the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father ... Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.\\" (p. 22)* \\"... the son consubstantial with the father. ... He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and Others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and the dead when all the quick shall be dead already.\\" (pp. 179-180)Having made the spiritual argument, Stephen then extrapolates to the relationship between Shakespeare (\\"After God Shakespeare has created most.\\" p. 193) and Hamlet contending that (a) Shakespeare begot Hamlet, and (b) Shakespeare and Hamlet are one.So here I accept the Joyce/Dedalus argument that the Father and Son are one and that Shakespeare and Hamlet are one and conclude that he is telling us that he and Bloom are one.Psychological Profile: Bloom/JoyceGiven the manner in which Ulysses is written, it is difficult to identify passages representing bona fide hallucinations. I do not accept the \\"fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters\\" (Wikipedia, Episode 15) as hallucinations primarily due to their transient nature. Bloom easily discards his hallucinatory behavior when Stephen is in need of protection, guidance, and mentoring. True hallucinations are not easily discarded when reality dictates the need for lucidity. Rather than hallucinations, Bloom's expressed fears and passions appear to be dream content. I suspect James Joyce kept a dream diary and used the material from it many places in Ulysses. I also suspect many of his dreams were in the form of nightmares, perhaps induced by excessive use of absinthe, a highly alcoholic beverage quite popular at the time.Let's use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) to label Bloom's behavior:* Primary Diagnosis: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder characterized by recurrent pornographic sexual images, repeated doubts, the need to have things in a particular order, excessive counting, and word repetition.The entire book is a testimony to Bloom's OCD but two favorite examples come to mind here:* Bloom is asked by an unseen inquisitor what he admires about water. His extensive listing starts with its \\"universality\\" and ends with its \\"stagnant pools in the waning moon\\". (p. 528)* Later, he is asked to describe the content of two drawers which he goes through each evening seeking relaxation before attempting to go to sleep. The detailed listing (pp. 566-568) is apparently revisited each night before going to bed.He even presents a detailed list of men he believes have been his wife's lovers over the years and does so in the order in which she has been involved with them. (p. 575)And by his own declarations of consubstantiality, we have reason to think of Bloom and Joyce as one.In summary, if OCD is your thing, you will enjoy reading Ulysses over and over again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This whoel review began as a comment, and tehn I realizedi had soemthign to say for myself on the topic, so here it is:I took a Course on Joyce at NUI Galway and I am thankful that I did because otherwise I would not appreciate Ulysses. Many of the points made by detractors of Joyce and Ulysses are valid, in fact most of them are. Even Yeats who praised the book confessed that he never finished it. But that is indicative of some peculiar choices by Joyce, for instance, the Third Chapter is intentionally unreadable. Joyce apparently did this to make a point about the mentality of the educated Irishmen, such as himself, who had the tendency to make themselves irrelevant to their countrymen. He did this by filling the entirety of the chapter with verbiage so obtuse and obscure that even educated people would have trouble telling you what's actually happen, which isn't much, they guy just sits there on the beach and feels sorry for himself. If I had not been in a Module whereby the Lecturer explained that this is essentially unreadable I surely would have put down the book forever.There are many points of interest for me in the book, I highly suggest reading the last chapter by itself as its prose is quite enjoyable and really provides of portrait of a time and a place and a people. It's not really necessary to read the book stait through, as my good friend and classmate (though he never took this course) explained it to me: \\"Ulysses is a book which is never intended to be finished, you just pick it up and open it up anywhere and start reading and when you can't take it anymore, you put it back down.\\"In regards to this book, if it can help provide the insight I needed to help me understand Ulysses I would say it is worthwhile, but my experience is that these books never do that, they just tell you what they think it is you should know about the famous book, banking on the name-recognition of the book and the author, knowing full well that most people has never read enough of the book to refute them.It was a strange thing for Joyce to do in his effort to \\"write the greatest book in the English language\\" where the result was really much more (and then again sometimes less) then a book at all. The volumous \\"story\\" - we'll call it that for lack of a better word, really became an entity within itself because he hi-jacked the English language to make statements by the use of the text itself rather than within it, and within the hundreds of pages he hid what was considered pornographic imagery, knowing full well that those who would take exception to it would be hard pressed to actually read it for themselves. The result was so un-approachable that he actually had to tell people that it was a parallel to the Odyssey (despite the name) and provide notes on how to interpret it. If this was any other book this would signal the utter worthlessness of the book, but what Joyce did, and which has never been recreated, is the exception, if you are ready to accept it for what it is, and what it isn't: a good story.The story itself, is rather boring and uninteresting, this was part of Joyce's design though. He was making a statement about Ireland by making this incredibly uneventful and uninteresting story and then contrasting it with the heroic tales of Odysseus. There-by making the Joyce-equivalent all the worse by comparison. Like I said, it makes the story itself boring, but it's interesting if you know that going in, thank goodness Joyce provided the author of the first literary analysis of Ulysses with his notes!Even though I whole-heartily agree with many of these points on their own, I believe that Ulysses is an import book to peruse, if not read. And it should not be dismissed in its entirety. However for an enjoyable work by Joyce I highly suggest something else, such as Dubliners, where the short story form restricts Joyce from getting to ostentatious."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I will admit it took me atleast two times the amount of time to read this as most books but,it was worth the time.

But, how to acomplish yhis ambition, when Romeo and Juliet and Anna Karenina is allready written? Joyce's solution is to redefine what the concept of a Great Love novel is all about. Instead of regarding the reader as someone to ammuse and seduce - someone that has the passive role of observing the story, Joyce combats the reader and makes the readers experience of reading the book as a crusial part of his story.Even the 16th of May 1904 was a long time ago and happend far away as Joyce wrote Ulysses in Trieste, Zurich and Paris from 1914 to 1921, Joyce describes virtually every detail that happened in Dublin that special day, long ago, far away. Even the fact that James Joyce wasn't much of a husband, drinking heavily when he had money, often was out of work and in conflict with his family because of his drinking, spending and unemployment, working on Ulysses - against his doctors strict orders as it would make him blind - when he was in a state of working, his wife hanged on to him all this time. In the same way the book appears difficult to read, and goes on \\"forever\\" in the sense of pages, places and number and level of hidden meanings you can dedicate alife to, Ulysses simply gets too much for many of its readers, making them give in, regarding it to complicated, difficult to understand, simply not worth the effort. In the same manner, the most obvious conclusion to draw from a marriage with James Joyce, might be that it was not worth the effort. As soon as I understood that this probably was exactly the point Joice was trying to make though, it was like I would not and could not let him prove that he was right and unlike my previous attemts to finnish the novel, I succeded. Blessing or curse - I guess this feeling of denying to give in, is excactly what can make a relatationship like this go on.As far as I know, Joyce is the first writer to introduce this projective way of writing - integrate the readers feelings and reactions to what he reads as a vital part of the story. After though, this projective writing is used by several writers - for instance when Bret Easton Ellis writes in a manner that makes the reader of American Psycho feel as bored as his main character Patrick Bateman feels - illustrating that he has more in common with you and me than we care about, or when Jerome David Sallinger in A Perfect day for Bananafish at the last line of the shortstory makes you realize that he has wrapped you arond his little finger all the time, manipulated you to think what he wants you to think, feel what he wants you to feel, leaving you with the predjustises that he wanted you to have , in order not to make you see the fatal conclution.It is obviously other ways to read Ulysses. You find a lot of them in the other customers review. It can be a good advice to put a copy of the so called Ulysses schema in the book when you try to read it, to make it easier to orient in time, space and theme. Make an internet search and you will find it.I hope you will finnish Ulysses with a sense of having read something that made it worth-while:)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If I never read any of his other books, this one alone would make Joyce my favorite author. It isn't a book for everyone, but if you're patient with it, it's a very rewarding read. This book is one of a handful that gets consistently better with each reading. The first go is the hardest, but I encourage you to finish it. Joyce said that he wanted to paint a portrait of Dublin so complete that if it were to disappear, it could be recreated from what was described in his book. I don't know how true that statement is, but I have never read a more complete description of human nature as that presented in this book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great edition for your first time through Ulysses.

No notes there so be warned!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, the way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not nearly as difficult as it is proclaimed to be, this book seems to have taken Nietzsche's advice to heart: A great writerwrites at such an elevated level that most people cannot understand him. This is absolutely true of Ulysses, as the convoluted meditations of the characters and abrupt jumps from reveries and memories to actual events do a marvellous job to perplex the reader.Content: Countless riddles, allusions, metaphors, even intended misspells complicate the reader's life but hardly make this philosphical novel unreadable. Yes, philosphical novel, something you can meditate on after reading. Also, it seems that James Joyce has decided to intertwine modernism, Homer, Irish history, human ethics, and his view on religion and life alltogether, in parts creating a pulp of dense bombast. The modernist techniques are somewhat amusing at first, but after advancing deeply into the book they seem nothing more than ostentatious display by Joyce of his masterful writing ability. There are some faint references to sex and bodily functions, but so subtle as to leave me in mystery of the reason for its ban. Disseminated over a variety of subject, Ulysses does not fail to include relgion and allocate to it a share of the onus. However absurd the concept of religion is, it does serve a purpose in a few of the chapters. Also, Ulysses is famous for its blatant Homeric parallel: each chapter of Ulysses modeled on a Homeric adventure or character. It is truly amazing how the two are combined. To understand the content of this literary behemoth with more insight, one might consult either Pinkmonkey.com (free) or Cliffnotes, both equally helpful.Characters: The characters could have used a lot more dimensionality. Frugal on polishing their facets, James Joyce seems to be using them as puppets to mouth his philosophy and not much more. Usually a protagonist attracts empathy of the reader, but Joyce did a poor job with his characters as they seem very distant in their meditative drivel. In other words, there wasn't a single way I could relate to them. Even Joyce's flaccid attempt at adding flaws to their character by assigning obscenities, made them no more human or real. Perhaps simplifying the embellished bombast would have helped in understanding them.Overall: Despite its many flaws (e.g. length, verbosity, etc...) there is no other book that deserves your attention as much as this particular one. If you will just find perseverance to bear through Joyce's daunting baffling narration, you will be delected to have found it (perseverance) to finished such a marvellous literary accomplishment. Having said that, I favor \\"The Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man\\" by Joyce over Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Certainly, Ulysses must be one of the hardest books to review. The fact that so many has been written about it makes one shy to add one's own humble opinion, while the fact that it has recently (although somewhat controversially) been chosen as the best book of the last century makes one want to give it the benefit of the doubt with respect to every critical remark.And most of all, Ulysses is simply a brilliant book. The reader finds herself immersed in a dull day, which nevertheless reflects all aspects of life in Dublin around 1900. And this realist, evocative aspect of the book is balanced by its success in mirroring large parts of the literary heritage with which every book must come to terms. Loosely based on Homer's Oddysey, and riddled with references to Dante, Shakespeare, and the Bible, it shows both a tremendous respect for man's wish to put his life into words and an ironic distance from every specific attempt to do so. There were indeed many times I found myself thinking that I was reading the perfect book, the &quot;novel to end all novels&quot;.Nonetheless, in the end I concluded - albeit hesitantly - that Ulysses is a flawed gem. There are two aspects of the book that make it so. First, there are the constant allusions to Irish folk music. Indeed, large parts of Ulysses (and not only the Sirens chapter) read as though they should be sung. While this certainly adds a layer of meaning to the book for everyone who knows these tunes, it makes for frustration with everyone who does not. Moreover, with the inclusion of this fickle and all too transitory form of art, Joyce has strongly connected his novel to the early 1900's. While this might have been his intention, it detracts from the novel's universality and its ability to transcend the boundaries of its time. Even now, 75 years after its publication, I often felt like I was gazing at a world which is both completely lost and partly incomprehensible. The second major flaw is the apparent lack of structure between the episodes. While every episode itself is highly structured, and one of the main joys in reading the book is to gradually discover these structures, I could not help but wonder why certain structures were chosen, and how they relate to each other. The prime example of this is the Ithaca episode, in which Joyce has turned some rather mundane events into an elaborate catechism of questions and answers. While hilarious at times, this structure seemed highly arbitrary to me. I am quite sure that many interpretations of this aspect of Ulysses have been given in the secondary literature, but the essence of structure - as in poems - seems to me that it should invite the reader to understand it: the reader should see glimpses of a larger whole in order to start looking for it. Unfortunately, in Ulysses I did not find myself invited, but more often the subject of some incomprehensible joke of the author.I am well aware that both flaws are only so on the basis of some (probably outmoded) theory of literature, and that they can both be turned into major beauties of the book. Nonetheless, I think that Ulysses is the prime example of a book who wishes to be perfect, but which, unfortunately, is not."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Like everyone who've read the book, i saw ulysses very complicated and hard to read. It's a huge book; about 1000 pages and the hardnesses in them makes readers have difficulties while reading. The confusing writing style, too many characters and names of places, conflict between thoughts and speeches, many words/sentences in many different languages, a great cultural background with many colors, unordinary writing skill.. All these and other causes make the book ununderstandable and complex. But, beyond this, you can feel the genius writer among the pages. Joyce, hides himself, his prodigy, all of the people, thoughts and happenings of 16th July's Dublin. The most important impact of the book is, to me, the prodigy you read in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"this is one of the briliant book i have ever read there is a lot of information on it on historical things and its very interesting to read those details its a hard book but it worht it its a smart and funny i suggest that the reader try to engoy the book this book is a peace of art and not fight whith it"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses, while seemingly understood (by literary professionals anyway) as a masterpiece of literature, is a very hard narrative and one that turns off alot of people. I think part of the reason that many readers have difficulty with the novel, though, is that they approach it similarly to other reads. Personally, I think this is a mistake.Ulysses is, in my opinion, the literary equivalent of improvisational jazz. Improvisational jazz is considered by many musical professionals as the purest of music. Jazz performers find it thrilling, joyful, and simply without comparison to other musical forms. Yet, many others consider it boring and difficult to understand. I think at least part of the reason for this is that it lacks the musical structure to which we are all programmed to respond to. Many people have no frame of reference to place it in.In a literary sense, I think Ulysses shares these aspects in many ways. Many passages are difficult to understand, especially if one seeks a familiar literary structure within which to place it. And yet, if one steps out of the box a little and takes the time to appreciate its poetic lyricism, to allow the words to flow without necessarily seeking to place them within that familiar structure, some otherwise difficult passages can be reached at level different from other novels. The normal reader's desire to understand the passage in its purely contextual form is lessened. The end result is that the novel becomes a less daunting read.Ultimately, though, I give it only four stars. Irrespective of a reader's approach, too many brain cells have to fire for too long to get through it (its over 1000 pages long). I don't think most people want to work that hard to read a book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is complex, evocative, and displays an incredible mastery of language. The landscape of Dublin 1904 is still as stunning - in a dark sort of way - as it was when Joyce was composing this great book.Certainly, it is hard to read in places. Chapters fourteen and eighteen are especially trying. There are spots where it seems that Joyce gave too much information, or not enough. But for the most part, Ulysses is very readable, with exquisite prose.This is not a book to shy away from. It is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Of course the novel is brilliant. I don't really need to go into that. What everyone tends to forget is that Ulysses is damn funny. Most people don't really read this book: they spend all their time thinking about how stupid it is (i.e., how they don't understand it) or how magnificent it is (i.e., how they don't understand it). Screw the hype, read the book. You don't need any guides; you're in the hands of a master."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It took me three years to actually read this book, having stopped a few times. I think it's a great book and I would have given it five stars if it did not require such a committment to read it. If you don't mind working, it's required reading. It's a unique book in that no book like this will ever be published again. I suppose that uniqueness (of form, style) is what makes it a great book, but it isn't &quot;entertaining.&quot; It hits you somewhere else."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Truly a monumental acheivement in the history of writing. Ulysses to me is a brilliant example of how our everyday actions gather significance simply because they are ours. This book should be read by readers who wish to appreciate life...not to understand details."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book went to become a bible for 20th century style and stories. It can not be just read 1 time and then laid away. Actually it must be reread 10 times and even then one will never be able to understand everything. People who say this book is easy to read or even suitable for a 17 year old are perfectly wrong. You definitely need a very deep background and you should have acquainted other masters before. Anthony Burgess said that the Ulysses will never be fully understood just like life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Intimidating? Yes. Time consuming? Certainly. Difficult? Without question. Worthwhile? Absulutely. This is the book that changed all books. By the end, you know Mr Leopold Bloom better than you know your best friend. It is funny, challenging, insightful and heartbreaking. Joyce's efforts dwarf the genius of his contemporaries (Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Tolstoy) and make their work read like apprentices imitating the master. If there is the possibility of perfection in a work of literature, Joyce has come closer than anyone else with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is a challenge. But it is also worth the challenge if you want to think about marriage, identity, love, and society in serious ways. If you put the book down half-way you are undoubtedly going to walk away disliking it-the final chapters really tie everything together and the Penelope chapter is vital to understanding the ideosyncratic bits of the text that leave you asking, \\"What?\\"I would not suggest making a go of it without buying \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford. A lot of what he includes is superfluous unless you read the book for school, but it really gives such a greater idea of what Joyce is trying to do with this book, explaining the Odyssey stories for each chapter, stylistic intentions, and illuminating obscure references to Judiasm, Irish nationalism, character histories, food obsessions, etc. Without it the book will probably not have that much meaning for the reader, it's too complex.At first Stephen may seem annoyingly self-involved, Bloom a weak coward, and Molly a tart, but when you consider the themes Joyce is taking on-Irish nationalism, being an outsider, understanding another person in a way that allows you to accept their flaws, etc. their character \\"flaws\\" give way to another interpretation. Especially considering the novel takes place in a single day.The book definitely gets better as you read, so don't get frustrated, the end, while not idealistically upbeat as most novels tend to be, is really fitting and satisfying."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I tried to read Ulysses when I was about 20. I couldn't get into it. The stream of consciousness put me off completely Now I'm over 60 and I greatly enjoyed the book. I could hardly put it down. The writing is beautiful. I just had to go out and get a gorgonzolia sandwitch with a glass of burgundy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I had this book described to me by a friend as both the best and worst book she had ever read. I can truly understand and appreciate her sentiments. Parts of the book are sheer poetry, and the descriptions and language draw the reader into the mystical brilliance of James Joyce's non-narrative. Other parts are maddeningly obscure and leave the reader wondering just what the hell is going on. The surprising part of this is that these obscure moments actually add to the book, rather than detracting from it. If &quot;Ulysses&quot; were not so obscure in so many parts, then the sheer mundaneness of much of the day would make it as boring as its detractors claim it to be, but the obscurity forces the reader to read attentively throughout. This is not a challenge enjoyed by all. This is not a light read, and if you're looking for a summer book by the cottage then stick to John Grisham and no fault to it (the light reads serve their purpose and should not be denigrated). However, if you're looking for a book that will test your imagination &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the perfect book. You probably won't fully understand it (I estimate I fully understood about 2/3 of it) but you will have learned much about yourself and the world of early-20th century Dublin and also of the world we live in today. Also, another reviewer here as written that this is a book to be read aloud. I agree whole-heartedly with that appraisal. It will add to both your understanding and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many people see Ulysses as perhaps a pretentious volume of over-rated nonsense which can only be appreciated by intellectuals and academics. This is not the case. By 'the consummation of all literature' I mean that it employs every style of language, every grand philosophical and theological theme. It unites styles of literature like playscript, monologue, soliloquoy, poetry, melodrama, fantasy, heroic, symbolism and makes use of all literary devices: bathos, puns, litotes, dramatic irony, hyperbole - fusing them not only into a story but into an Odyssey. It is the heroic storyteller's heroic story. It's context - modernism - is transcended and becomes what one would hesitatingly refer to now as Postmodern. By that rather glib statement I mean it uses all these disparate themes and unites them via the central character, Leopold Bloom. Leopold is the Modernist man - the manifold fragmented man who asserts a new identity by unification of his 'hundred thousand flaws'. Virginia Woolf tried to demostrate this in Mrs Dalloway by allowing no chapter breaks in her exploration of the semi-autobiographical heroine and thus totalising the sum of experiences. Where Joyce succeeds over Woolf is that he explores not only the totalisation but the totalisation of all relevant parallel events. Like a theorist of chaos, he explores the detail that affects the major life-forces and struggles. The parallel to Homer's Odyssey is emphasised by making the hero's journey so incredibly anodine on the one hand and so completely heroic on the other. Using the Homeric myth of Cyclops, Joyce explores the prevalence of anti-semitism, the Irish religious conflict, the pettiness of argument and theological truths in but one scene. Joyce's work is a classic, not in the way that Finnegan's Wake is - which explores the actuality of language, the song of words and music , but by taking a life in a day and writing about lives themselves and the world they inhabit. It sounds extremely pretentious to say it is the consummation of all literature, but no other book thus far, in my experience, comes even close nor attempts to tackle so much of what Joyce achieves. It is not only that Joyce sees a world in a grain of sand he sees, more importantly, the grains of sand in the world."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While I have a number of quibles about what Random House/Modern Libary put on their 100 best list, I had no problem at all with what they put first. If I had to pick one book as the best book of the century, it would by Joyce's Ulysses. It's a book I first read about 25 years ago and have returned to it every couple of years since.Ulysses is a rich, complex book that works on many levels. Most people tend to focus on its experimental prose, which Joyce used to both explore his characters and to widen the scope of his novel. But, beneath all of this, Ulysses is a novel of character, a profound look at the human condition. The book experimentation works because it is grounded on the story of Leopold Bloom, who is fundamentally a decent, likeable man. It's also the story of Stephen Daedalus, who, while somewhat of a prig, is a very intersting person, whose thoughts and ideas are exciting to follow.The more I think about it, the more I think that it'll soon be time to read Ulysses yet again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, ULYSSES is a mainstay of college literature. Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe. The appeal of reading the mind wanderings of a pasty, weak pseudo-intellectual grows stale after the first dozen pages. For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse. Confession: the genius mind-maze that is Joyce is sometimes just not worth exploring. One would have better luck escaping the Minotaur than successfully exiting this lingual labyrinth. (Dr. Marcus Smith: I apologize for this heresy against the Modern Epic.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Easily one of the greatest English-language books ever written. It is certainly not &quot;about nothing&quot;--those that say so are talking about its lack of a standard plot. It's about the relationships people build with one another. Look at the relationships depicted: Bloom's love for Molly despite her infidelity, Molly's love for Bloom despite the infidelity she percieves, Molly's purely sexual love for Boylan, Bloom's fatherly love for Stephen, Stephen's constant searching for paternal influence, etc, etc. Joyce examines in minute detail each one of these and allows the reader to come to his own conclusions about the characters and their feelings.It _is_ a difficult book. Stick through it; it's worthwhile. For me, it really started to come together around &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; (chapter 14). After &quot;Ithaca&quot; (ch. 17) I felt like I'd known Bloom all my life. And &quot;Penelope&quot; (ch. 18) is remarkable not for what it reveals about Molly, but for what it reveals about Bloom.If you didn't get anything out of _Ulysses_, you didn't read it carefully enough. I suspect many people pick it up without knowning anything about it, and I further suspect that many people who read it for a university course are only skimming it for essay topics (of which there are plenty). Get something like &quot;The Bloomsday Book&quot; to help you through it, read something about the book before you start to read it, read it carefully, and read it more than once. That's the only way you can get everything out of it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, &quot;Ulysses,&quot; we are told, is a work of genius; yes, it is multi-faceted and pregnant with meaning; true, it may even be a compendium of all Western Culture since Homer. But, let's be honest: It's as fun as reading a telephone directory! One risks opening oneself up to the assaults of the junior college-educated parrot, who gleefully repeats what &quot;wisdom&quot; was imparted to him by his talentless and blustering English instructor. But for those of us not interested in posturing; that is to say, for those of us who actually read Mr. Joyce's work--yes, every last page! (and not at the behest of some school-drudge)--we can risk dispensing with the bombast and dogma to whisper our opinions in a voice sharpened with an edge of honesty. &quot;Ulysses,&quot; such as it is, is a bore. Few unread novels have enjoyed as much success. Such fame rests chiefly, however, on the fact that it is usually not touched . . . which, even if it were, it would reveal itself to be wholly incomprehensible--thus allowing any pseudo-intellectual halfwit to attach any meaning to it that he wishes. The truth, though? &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a satire--and a very tedious one--of Homer's wonderful Odyssey. But Homer's work is actually readable and entertaining! Sad, considering that the ancient Hellene is several thousand years removed from us and yet still has the power to spin a fascinating story. Joyce, however, has created--nothing! He borrows, he steals, he imitates . . . badly. For a true original; for a man of genius and an author who can actually write his own plots; one should look no further than Homer. Joyce? He's a pedant and an over-rated, long-winded bore."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having read Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and also Dubliners, I decided last summer to tackle his novel Ulysses, to which several literary associations have deemed the greatest twentieth century novel. Today's sophisticated younger reader may ponder the accolades professors and scholars have showered upon a novel that rambles for well over 700 pages, but there are significant reasons that I would like to briefly elucidate.First, as many have pointed out this is a book of language, and specifically one that attempts to import all of English lexicon in order to examine where its vocabulary leads us and where we ultimately run up against road blocks. This monumental task had never been accomplished in the English language since the likes of Shakespeare and Chaucer.Second, this is a novel of experimentation. A 19th century staple, the novel was overdue for an update that would capture the complexities and anxieties of the 20th century. For too long, the novel reflected a mathematical plot line divided evenly into clear physical events, which, frankly, failed to detail the organics of human thought and development. Ulysses does the unthinkable: Our thoughts and actions cannot be explained away by chronology;there is a real-time universal presence to them, as some would later read in Faulkner's works.Third, there is an authentic examination of the individual. Reading his biography and Ireland's history, Joyce repeatedly hammers home the colossal battle between individuality and social conformity. In Ulysses, outside forces such as the Catholic church, parents, ignorance, politics, and peers attempt to squelch the voice of the individual by attempting to dictate what happiness and contentment are. It is through allusions to the mythological story of the Odyssey that our most heroic feat today is learning how our voice can Bloom in a world that too often expects us to conform.Fourth, it is an honest, realistic story about life in general. Whether we want to admit it, much of life is spent within ourselves, as Joyce unearths through the three characters' streams of consciousness. We do talk to ourselves; our thoughts are random, not linear; we scrutinize ourselves hoping to make connections among scraps of thoughts that only we and God have access to. No novelist up to this point had created what amounted to a confessional that was unafraid of society's taboos and mores. Where else could a young modern reader, for example, read about a character's sexual acts in unadorned detail?Finally, contrary to what critics have stated--i.e. several novelists of Joyce's age called the work a mess--there is a compelling story. At the time of its publication, virulent anti-semitism consumed not only colonized Ireland but the rest of the world. So enters our modern day Ulysses, Bloom, a baptized Jew who exhibits the attributes of Christ but is condemned by his society for alleged ancestral sins. And then there is poor Stephen, whose triumphant announcement to the world that he is an artist contrasts sharply with his doldrum existence, refusing to pray for his dying mother, rejecting his largely absent father, and holding a teaching position that is less than inspiring.There's Molly, a singer by trade who is blazed into sleeping with a talent agent so that she can further her career and can also help provide for Bloom when money is tight. Molly and Bloom may be jovial in name, but underneath is the tragic loss of their infant son who managed to live only eleven days. To me, this is an unflinching look at real life. And yet, epiphanies still happen, and new friendships such as what Stephen and Bloom display provide us with what really matters most: love and acceptance. Bloom is the father who unconditionally accepts Stephen, and Stephen is the son Bloom has dreamed of since Stephen clearly needs guidance.Many readers have pointed out that the traditional literary community has hailed Ulysses as the seminal novel of the twentieth century, and, therefore, today's reader must adhere to its proclamation. If Joyce were alive, I think he would be appalled simply because freedom of expression was his guiding principle. Joyce's main point is that the path toward freedom is not merely a straight line or even a winding one; rather, it is a confluence of thoughts, feelings, and relationships that eventually crystallize into an overarching personal epiphany. Ulysses certainly is a challenge, but then again so is life. Each day is worth a seven hundred page book--Joyce's merit is that he actually proved it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many scenes stick in one's mind forever, for example when Leopold Bloom releases his bowels or when the coffin falls on the road. I finally came to understand the stream-of-consciousness technique and realized it's not Joyce's stream we're wading in but the carefully reproduced stream of the character's consciousness. I found this particularly effective and fun reading of Stephen Dedalus's morning at school. Other scenes like Molly Bloom's grand finale are simply beautiful and literally breathless, especially if you take punctuation as a breathing signal.And I'm especially glad to read it now that I live in Dublin. I've lived in Ringsend three months, I've visited a friend in Mullingar, and I've shopped at Buckley's butcher shop, all of which are mentioned in Ulysses. I even bought my copy of the book at the Martello tower featured at the start of the novel.But overall, one feels Ulysses is somewhat contrived. Crucify this humble critic if you will, but reproducing the structure of the Odyssey is a clever but artificial way of bringing epic grandeur to what is nothing more than a very ordinary day. Why go through all that trouble? I do agree with the lesson but find it rather long winded. In painting, a still life by Chardin is as realistic as an imperial coronation scene by David, but with much less fuss.And then there are the inside jokes. References to Walt Whitman and to Edgar Allen Poe (which I got only because I remembered Tom Hanks reciting Poe's \\"To Helen\\" in The Ladykillers) and other writers abound. Shouldn't a great work stand on its own, at least where its intended audience is concerned? Ulysses fails utterly in this respect unless we restrict the audience to academics.Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Unfortunately, the first edition of *Ulysses* to be published in Dublin is not the edition of this book which anyone should read first. Danis Rose's decisions to normalize punctuation and spelling, to make intrusions into Joyce's prose on the basis of his own criteria of syntactic and semantic coherence rather than on textual evidence, and to re-insert apostrophes into Penelope (although he prints an alternate version of the chapter in an appendix) are only barely justifiable in terms of his own theory of editing -- and entirely alien to the &quot;normal&quot; practices of scholarly textual critics. This is quite a shame, because some of Rose's work on the manuscript evidence (as it is described in his introduction, quite interesting in itself) might potentially be of great importance to the textual study of *Ulysses*. Without an apparatus criticus, however, no one can tell for sure. Although (as Rose himself points out) there is and can be no absolutely &quot;definitive&quot; *Ulysses*, there are better places to start. Read Hans Walter Gabler's 1984 edition, keeping in mind its limitations (or, if you want a student's edition with good notes in the volume, use the reprint of the 1922 first edition, edited by Jeri Johnson for OUP, taking care to check out some of the more important alternate readings in Gabler's text). For those interested, a forthcoming issue of *James Joyce Quarterly* will include extensive discussion of Rose's edition and its merits."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I think Jonathan Franzen had it about right when he compared Ulysses to a great, Old World Cathedral packed full of iconography. Tourists wander in, snuffle about, pick up the odd snippet that they find aesthetically pleasing without ever coming close to comprehending the depth of the whole thing; then there are the fanatics who consult with the priestly critics who can comprehend its mysteries. On top of this the state certifies the thing as great art (Ulysses is a huge national institution in Ireland - it has spawned a great Joyce industry (even though he lived most of his life as an exile from Ireland) and the 100th anniversary of the day on which Ulysses is set was marked by native Dubliners parading round the streets in stockings and boaters).Ulysses is a hugely difficult book (though not as bad as the impossible Finnegan's Wake), made doubly so by the fact that it is so reader unfriendly. I suspect most people read Ulysses because they have heard it is the ultimate literary challenge, plough through it with some difficulty, skimming large parts, picking up the odd stylistic triumph that keeps them going, then breathe a huge sigh of relief when they have finished it.If you still insist on reading Ulysses, I recommend 'The New Bloomsday Book' by Harry Blamires which offers a page by page readers guide to the book's contents. But really, unless you devote months of scholarship and read a multitude of supplementary texts, you won't fully grasp what is really going on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is in the eyes of most literary critics the greatest novel of the twentieth century, and a major addition to the Western literary Tradition. So much has been said about it in so many ways that I will free to chip in my less than two cents without doing the reviewer's ordinary task of describing the work, and telling the reader what it is all about. Bloomsday is a day on the literary calendar of the world. And Daedalaus, and Leopold Bloom and Molly are with K. and Falstaff, and Sancho and Pickwick in the cast of world - literary creations whose image is part of the collective human consciousness generation to generation as most real human beings are not.Ulysses is not easy to read even if one takes a Gilbert Stuart or some other modern guide , and figures out what each section with its own separate style, technique, theme parallel in the Odyssey is all about. And there are parts and not simply small parts which bore in their incomprehensibility as only Finnegans Wake will exceed. But there are also, and this is all through the work great lyrical passages of course culminating in Molly Blooms yes I said I will yes. There is too I suppose the particular pleasure of trying to figure out all these literary mysteries and these hidden hints in the multi- layered language of the text. Already Joyce here is moving toward the creation of his own language and the portmanteau and pun principles are richly at work. In Oxen of the Sun he writes the history of the English language parodying its styles. And the whole theme of parodying rewriting alluding to the great work, and somehow superseding it are in the frame of the work ( Before Bloom and before Daedalus there was a real Ulysses) Joyce's effort to write in one day the whole of human experience and to make too of the form of catalogue encyclopedia a higher way to art is part also of the transformation of popular forms into the highest art forms. Shakespeare did it on many levels and so must Joyce, as Hamlet Daedalaus reminds it. Ulysses at publication time was revolutionary to many in its putting on the page the lusts and obscenities , the sexual thoughts and even ' experiences' of its characters. It too broke the frame of convention in a whole host of other ways including through the shifting centers of its narrative consciouosness- the way it tells and does not tell its story. The sheer lyric musical beauty of Joyce's prose is poetry at its best .And the epiphanies on oval leaves are revelations of the beauty in language itself its sheer joyful joycean playing. And how can I having read through with dismay so much of the hidden and not so hidden anti- Jewish character of so many in the Tradition not be hearted by the warm feeling which flows toward the good souled Leopold Bloom. If I were to complain about graduate school time reading through the longest longeurs in Joyce I would nonetheless always keep in mind that one wee bit of an Irishladdie allalone went out there and by himself only made a masterpiece all mankind can make its own by reading and rereading before running on to riverun from bend of bay to swerve of shore past Howth Castle and environs"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I run these Donal Donnely disks continually just for the sheer joy of the language.

Tell me, anyone who has purchased this version, it isn't printed out of Lexington, Kentucky, is it?You should not purchase this version, not if you actually want to try and understand this book. If you plan on using outside materials to further guide you, then this book should be ignored, because the lack of chapter annotations will make it rather difficult to follow along."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Launched for the 100th anniversary of Bloomsday, this meticulous 22-CD performance of the novel brings it fully to life in ways that are at times indescribably beautiful. Whatever is difficult in the novel becomes much more accessible as the spoken word. Both the male and female narrations are off the charts. As for the music, it is masterful and never intrusive or pretentious. Yes, even this oral rendition is enhanced by a gloss, whether the one included in the set or a separate rendition (the one I used was James Heffernan's lectures, also on CDs, from the Teaching Company). Put it all together and you have the greatest novel in English in its highest and best expression."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Well, the reviews on here so far have been very mixed, and I'd have to say I more or less agree with all of them. That's right. All of them.First of all, the ones that accuse Ulysses of being a load of gibberish and a sluggish read. They're right. However, Ulysses is not meant to be a pure pleasure read. It's meant to be studied. I read a lot, and before Ulysses, the longest a book had ever taken me was two weeks. Ulysses took me two months. I did it as a part of my AP English project, and tackled it AFTER I had read Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and sections of Richard Ellmann's biography. Even then, I kept Ulysses and Annotated and the Cliffs Notes close by my side.There are many parts of Ulysses that don't make sense. But the parts that do are brilliant. Joyce was a true genius, and if you take the time to studdy his work, you will be blown alway by his mastery of the English language, and his understanding of human nature. I hope to become a writer someday, and reading Ulysses has totally changed my outlook in writing and life.I would be lying if I said I enjoyed Ulysses all the way through. But after you have read it, you will find that your mind is open to a million different poissiblities concerning life, other people, and the use of language.Who knows? Maybe someday I'll write my own Ulysses...something a bit more reader-friendly..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I read a number of reviews pointing out that significant bits of text are missing from this edition, and often the reply is made that the present volume is probably based on the Project Gutenberg edition, and the text is probably missing from the Project Gutenberg edition as well.Well, I looked. In the first section Buck Mulligan chants in a \\"happy foolish voice\\"--I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.So here's to disciples and Calvary.The text is in the P.G. edition, but is missing from the Kindle edition offered here.

While I'm sure the paperback edition is fine, the Kindle version is an absolute mess.It looks like this edition was made using OCR and a scanner. Foremost among its problems is that the word \\"the\\" routinely appears as \\"die\\" or \\"lie\\". This happens about once per page throughout the entire book.The font size changes from paragraph to paragraph. Punctuation is often missing or wrong. Commas sometimes appear as the number \\"3\\" in a subscript or something else fun like that. The letter \\"l\\" is frequently replaced by the number \\"1\\" (these look very different on a Kindle).Line breaks appear where they shouldn't, and spaces are often missing between words.I've seen similar problems with other books on Kindle, though usually only for freebies. Since there are several free versions of this book available, I'd advise avoiding this one."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What to make of Ulysses, that towering work of modernism that has been seen as both the hallmark of the age, and an impediment to later generations of writers trying to get out from beneath Joyce's long shadow?Ultimately, the worth of the novel can't be questioned, even if you do not \`like' the book. Perhaps no novel in the 20th century exerted (and continues to exert) so great an influence over the written arts. Lots of ink has been spilled about the novel. On this, my third reading of it after twenty years, I have this to say:Part of the challenge and thrill of the novel is Joyce's chameleon like ability to thrown on literary guises, while at the same time being intractably, even stubbornly, Joyce. He had few illusions about his genius, and wrote a work from that lofty standpoint. Although loaded with humor, dirty jokes, and common place incidents, Ulysses is an intellectual's novel, meant not to be read but re-read. It is nearly Talmudic in its dimensions. Dig deeper into a passage and you find multiple layers of meaning.Part of the challenge (and frustration for some) of this novel is its incredible restlessness. The first third of the novel features Joyce's famous stream of consciousness technique. Characters are minds in bodies, thinking a stream of thought, occasionally interrupted by some external datum.Here Joyce creates a kind of hyper-naturalism. It is as if he wishes to show readers that the naturalism of the preceding generations was nothing more than a fictive mask. Here is the closest we can get to the workings of the human mind in its social and psychological settings. He bends language get this. He coins new words. He leaves words dangling off and thoughts unfinished. In other words, he tries to reproduce how our halting minds actually think their thoughts.Once Joyce has accomplished this, he appears to repudiate it. We then get a variety of chapters written from certain literary standpoints (often mockingly so). It is as if Joyce is saying: this is literature too, a series of guises that we throw on and off at will. This is the lens through which people see the world. They are more than encapsulated minds. They also structure their worlds.So, Ulysses keeps the reader off kilter, and with a sense of sheer delight on the part of Joyce. We start over and over again, chewing on the same material and spiritual conditions of one day in Dublin over a hundred years ago.In the process much that is profound happens surrounded by a spectacle of mundane happenings. In other words, just another day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Is this the greatest novel of all time, or just a colossal waste of time? My experience is that reading Joyce's ULYSSES will indeed pay the reader great dividends for the time she put into it. However, I don't believe it's a novel that can be understood and appreciated without a great investment of repeated readings and consultation of outside texts. In fact, I don't think there's ever been a novel that requires that the reader consult at least a half dozen texts and repeated readings to not be totally bewildered by what the hell the author is trying to say.Here's why I say this. I read ULYSSES several times while in college. The first reading gave me absolutely nothing! However, because I was an English major, was deeply interested in Irish lit, and had the time, I gave the novel repeated readings and consulted dozens of secondary books and periodicals. Then I began to get somewhere. What before was a jumble of gibberish about Irish towers and bars and streets and a dog on a beach, before born baby boardman had bliss, shamefaced peaches clop clop clop introblio ad nauseam began to reveal the deeper currents underneath. And I feel it was all quite worth my time and trouble.So here's my advice for the new reader. The 1st reading should be accompanied by Cliff Notes (don't laugh) to get a basic idea of each chapter's theme. This will be a great help. Beyond that, the ANNOTATIONS book is a very good resource. Another secondary source on ULYSSES that I found very valuable and interesting was the many great pieces from THE JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY on the novel. I hope that by now someone has digitally compiled all that scholarship so that it's not lost and forgotten in college library basements!Here's what I found out: Joyce's astounding accomplishment with ULYSSES is that he successfully layered multiple literary, religious, psychological, philosophical biological and historical structures in a single work. The 1st chapter alone is worthy of a full semester's attention in order to unravel and reveal the myriad references and their cross-associations. What we have here is modern scripture, and the largest literary puzzle ever. If intricate literary structure interests you, this is the magnum opus. I'm not risking overstatement to declare that ULYSSES could be called The Book of Life, as a key reason why so many scholars have lauded it as the greatest of novels is that it's the most voluminous and eloquent tale of living that's ever been written.But again, to share these scholars' opinion of this novel WILL require MORE work from the reader than she has given to probably anything else she's tried to read and really appreciate. Know this before you begin reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Simon & Brown Edition is a poorly laid out version of the novel. It appears as if a print on demand (POD) publisher hastily assembled the book from Project Gutenburg or some other public domain source. There are inexplicable spaces between lines and paragraphs, the dialogue is bulleted and has no quotation marks, the page numbers are all on the bottom left of the page, etc. Overall an amateurish attempt. I am returning this version today."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also, multiline verses are collapsed into one unbroken line."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The three previous reviews are right on: to my mind (and I confess that I am not unique in this) Ulysses is the greatest novel in world literature. It is unrivalled in style (who could rival it?) or in character. And who is not moved by the pathos and humor of the book, the sorrows and triumphs of L Boom? This lovely edition befits the novel itself. You may want to read and re-read and take notes in \\"corrected\\" editions. This is the one to stare at lovingly, longingly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH THIS GREATEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE please skip to the twelfth episode, called Cyclops. YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings. But his commentary I found surprisingly shallow and at times off the mark. But I grow wordy . . ."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I could go on about Ulysses all day but I won't - I'll simply say that though it is difficult in parts (perhaps skip chapter 3 and come back to it?) and requires a fair amount of reading to appreciate a lot of the references, that should not put anyone off. The truth is that the difficulty is overstated and the down-to-earthness is what really comes through in the end.Give yourself to this book and it will reward you endlessly. I defy anyone not to laugh, cry and be thoroughly moved when they read it in full. It is the funniest, most affirmative piece of art I've ever come across, and deserves its place at the top of the tree in twentieth century literature."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Do not buy this CD to listen to in the car! The selections and interpretation of this abridged audio edition are unimpeachchable. However the reader, gifted with a clear and expressive voice, presents most of the narration sotto voce, which is inaudible on the road even at top volume."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When you're dealing with a book as daunting to the casual reader (assuming there is such a thing as a casual reader of this particular book) as James Joyce's Ulysses, you're going to need every break you can get.For years I was put off by the Modern Library's 1961 edition of Ulysses, and with good reason. When Judge Woolsey decided in the 1930s to institute what Morris Ernst decreed \\"the New Deal in the law of letters,\\" making Ulysses legal to own and distribute in the U.S. (before that it was contraband, smuggled into the country as if it was bootleg scotch by, among other people, Ernest Hemingway), Random House, which had locked up the U.S. rights, decided to act fast, while the book was hot (Joyce even made the cover of Time magazine). So they rushed their now-legal version into print as quickly as possible, using in the process the ugliest, most unreadable typeface known to man.In 1961, they revised the text, getting rid of some obvious errors (if I'm not mistaken they were in such a rush originally that they used Samuel Roth's 1927 pirated edition as copytext!), but for some reason they kept the same repellent font, probably because resetting the whole book in a new font would have been too expensive.When I finally read Ulysses complete, it was in the 1960 Bodley Head edition, which is miles ahead of its American counterpart in elegance and readability. Unfortunately, the text is not nearly as good (Joyce scholar Hugh Kenner's comment on it is particularly apt -- suffice it to say that it's the title of Jacobean playwright John Ford's most famous work).So if you're planning on taking a stab at Ulysses, this is what I would suggest. Forget about the Vintage Paperback edition (as well as Hans Walter Gabler's so-called \\"Corrected Text,\\" for textual reasons too cumbersome to get into here), and go with the Everyman's Library hardcover. It may not be ideal (contrary to what I thought at first, they reprint the Bodley Head edition and not the Modern Library 1961 text), but it's published in a large and reader-friendly font. It's the edition to get if you've never tried Ulysses before (although Dover has recently put out a reproduction of Shakespeare and Co.'s 1922 First Edition that's worth looking into).And if you haven't read Ulysses before, I would suggest that before you do, you: a) read Joyce's earlier and simpler novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, b) try a biography first (Richard Ellmann's is the authoritative one, especially in its 1982 revision, but I'm rather partial to Stan Gebler Davies' shorter biography from the 1970s, which sounds like it was written by a character in Ulysses). Also: c) find and read a good commentary first, such as Edmund Wilson's chapter on Joyce in Axel's Castle, or Hugh Kenner's book, entitled Ulysses or Harry Blamire's The Bloomsday Book. If you're a Joycean newbie, you will need help. Plenty of it.Even then it won't be easy. But Joyce, with the possible exception of Proust, wrote the greatest novel of the last century, and if you're any kind of a serious reader you really owe it to yourself to take a whack at it. Clifton Fadiman once compared reading Ulysses to climbing Mount Everest. Not many people make it to the summit, but the ones who get to the top are afforded a view that's hard to beat. Reading Joyce is less a matter of reading a book than of having a life experience, and a precious one (although some might wonder in which sense of the word) at that. Good luck."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is a mystery and a masterpiece. The first time I read it, it was almost a quest of sorts. I had to find something to pass the time during a particularly tedious job that required me to wait against my will every evening for at least one hour. Bit by bit, I proceeded through the text, and found myself entranced and lost in the language. I was a writer at the time, and the attention to detail fascinated me. It also showed me how much I had to learn about language and lyricism. I have reread the book again and again, some sections more than others, and still love it. Every bit. Profane? Hardly. But it has its moments, even by modern standards. Still, the idea of creating such a thing is a thing to be admired."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I performed a search for the 100 greatest novels and checked Ulysses out at the library.

Sure James Joyce was a writer of some talent as shown by his early short stories and his Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man. But this book?When he wrote it Joyce was in the hands of the European artistic progressives. They had rejected the notion of contest in favor of form. That is hypnotized by that arch braggart Wagner they accepted the delusion that art must continually progress and change form. When he wrote art generally was subject to continual change in style. Picassos went through his various periods, French Art struggled through Impressionism, Cubism and so on.James Joyce moving in those circles felt that he had to reject the form and grammar of his predecessors. That is he had to reject the way of writing which made Dickens, Eliot, Austin and Conrad the giants of literature that they were. What in fact is wrong with the use of grammar and the English Language. It has given us masterpieces such as Shakespeare, Milton and Wordsworth.With Ulysses you can see a novel peeking out from behind the obscure language. Joyce's talent was such that even he could not write something absolutely bad but what a tragedy that such a dud ideology could destroy the work of so potentially gifted a writer.You know its true."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the sorriest excuse for a novel I have ever come across; don't waste your time. I'm all for challenging reads, but not for gibberish which academics persist in labeling erudition. I find absolutely nothing redeeming about this book, but those who enjoy taxing their brains to ridiculous measures; drawing (more than likely inaccurate) conclusions from an incomprehensible conglomeration of words; and imposing meaning where none exists because few things in the text will limit whatever perspective they want to take are welcome to it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm an avid reader, who almost always finishes a book no matter how long or badly written but this one, I decided life was to short.

We also had noted that the book was on top 100 books of the century etc.. All of us decided the only reason this book could be recommended is because Joyce introduced a new form of writing called \\"stream of consisiousness\\". This style of writing basically goes into the character's mind and portray's his/her thoughts. This style at least in this book is very very had to follow, if no narrative is given in between characters thoughts by the author. But to top it all off, the book is boring to say the least, we decided unanimously to stop reading the book and some of us had already read 1/2 the book, myself included by sheer doggedness."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"You shouldn't have to be a literary expert to enjoy a novel. Why anyone would say this is the best novel of the 20th century is beyond me.

This book is extremely difficult to read, to say the least.This book has so much innuendo and hidden meanings that it makes your head spin! What's with all the foreign languages?

It is a work of its time rather than anything of lasting interest.We all know the background, at the turn of the century the art world was a kaleidoscope of new ideas and trends. In art there was C&eacute;zanne, Seurat, and Picasso. In music Scriabin was experimenting with the melding of music and light.Artists were experimenting with form rather than looking at content. Sometimes these experiments worked other times they led to a dead end and were forgotten.Ulysses is an experimental novel, one that uses the form of stream of consciousness. The form is at the expense of its readability and clarity. What happened with Joyce's experiment, it limped through Finegan's Wake which is so impenetrable it barely rates as a puzzle and died. Ulysses as an experimental art form is a dead end, and with good reason.The sorts of things that made and make literature great are the sorts of things that Joyce rejects with his experiments in form. Literature is related to the content rather than the empty vessel of form.This of course is not to say that Joyce was without talent. It is just a shame to see that his talent was wasted as he became immersed with the fashions of the time."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It took a little too long to get the item.

Like all of Joyce's works it is not particularly warm and, for me, wasn't a work to inspire and enflame the spirit.

So I found it wonderful as a written work, with all the fun, strange and brilliant techniques Joyce used; but as a novel, as a story about people's lives, I really didn't have much interest. I was kept at a distance from the characters by Joyce's telling of the story, so that even when the characters were deep in frenzied monologues, I only heard Joyce's writing, and not the characters' actual voices. I suppose this is typical of modernism, but I found it made the entire experience somewhat unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is often much talk about how to best &quot;get&quot; this book.

If you are looking for a model to improve the precision of your own thought and expression, don't look here.

James Joyce just wrote a book for you to enjoy. If you want to make a big hairy deal out of some Irish guy writing a book, you probably have no life, or else a Master's thesis to write. James Joyce just stuffed a bunch of language into a book he thought he might like writing. He was just trying to write something worth reading, like Mark Twain, or William Faulkner would. Get over yourself. Joyce took language a little farther out on a limb. He was just another writer trying to make love to English. Why would any writer not try to love a language as lovely as English?

And Joyce's vocabulary isn't merely extensive, its obscure and often so archaic that most dictionaries weighing fewer than 20 lbs. don't contain the words he uses. Unless you're young, if you don't read a book sentence by sentence, understanding the meaning of most every word, you aren't really reading or absorbing it, and its a waste of time, which is sad, because Ulysses has been such an influential work. But ultimately who cares? I'm coming to the unfortunate conclusion that the work of almost every member of the Lost Generation is failing to stand the test of time. Its one thing to read these icons in your early 20s; its another when you're approaching 50. As you get older, you realize Fitzgerald's and Hemingway's novels are terribly dated; Gertrude Stein's theories about writing are infinitely more interesting than her writing itself; and guys like Dos Passos are irrelevant. Now Joyce. Like Pound, he's interesting in the abstract, I guess.

The point which Monsieur Camus was trying to communicate, I think, is that we should be somewhat happy for the passing of our lives, for it is when we are engaged in the most miseable of chores that we are most aware of time's pasage.I must conclude that Camus never read Joyce, for I am certain that if he had, he would have substituted \\"reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" for \\"waiting in line for theatre tickets.\\" This incoherent, gratuitously allusive, over-long monster of a novel is what English majors have canonized to prove to Engineers that they're smart too (and I write that as a not-too-bright Poli Sci major myself). In the interests of full disclosure, I admit that I have a special hate of this book: a sadist Yallie-Ellmanite English teacher of mine forced me to read it the summer before my senior year of high school.Ulysses has two great strengths. First, it steals the plot of the Odyssey in its entirety--thus, you're not really missing anything by not understanding it. Second, unlike other books in English, it does not discriminate--it it is equally incomprehensible to English and non-English speakers alike--little wonder that the touchy-feelies who dominate ivy league English departments love it so.Lemon soap; masturbate on the beach; stately, plump Buck Whocares?Sadly, though Ulysses is awful, Joyce was not without talent. One can see the glimmer of greatness--great lyrical streches of words, wonderful cadences here and there, etc. This book, however, is the literary equivalent of a Mondrian painting, it is the smug mocking of art(and in certain circles, those who dare to point this out are treated like the boy who observes that the emperor is not wearing clothes).

At the moment I don't find it nessesary to read it any furder.But here are the conclussions I have made.Why this book is interresting:-The stream of consience idea is great, really. I love it.-I also love the idea that he descided to write about some of the things no sensibele writter would have ever written about. Like how Bloom went to the toilet or mastrubated.Why this book is a load of crap:-Way to long (I have nothing against long books and I have read quite a lot of books and I love Homer, Dante, Shakespear, Milton, Orwell, Huxley, Poe, Bulgakov, Plato, Swift, Nietzsche, Dickens, Asimov and many more so I do know a bit about litterature) this book should have ended whit the third chapter.-It lacks a plot. I am not saying that there has to be a overlingly complicated story behind it but it should have some directionlines.-The languege. Joyce seems to want to point out the whole time how good he knows English and that is very irretating.-It has no real meaning. I know that people have looked for one but all they have come up whit where some things like it is an epic of the body (well describing how someone goes to the toilet could hardly be discrived as epic. The also spoke about the complex intriging monologs and the praise of the mind (well the just say a lot of things and never seem to be able to think in a straigt line for longer than 3 min. And finally the the so cold new light that Joyce shines on myths. The mostly bring up Odysseus whit this one. Well people seek for Odysseus in this book because Joyce told them to do so.-Almost anybody could have written this book.I would also like to point out that when it was released all the people who love this book now (writters and proffesors) hatted this book. If it had never ben forbidden it would have just been forgotten like it perhaps should.I would like also to say that I didn't stopt reading tis book because it was to difficult but because it was borring. For after all I have read Paradise lost in the orriginal and I do find it difficulter to read that this one.Perhaps it is just so difficult to read because it is borring has anyone thought about that?(Excuse me for my English.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A blasphemous, vulgar and sexual book about the lives of sots in Ireland written by a Shakespeare-variety wordsmith. At first glance, it sounds too good to be true. The catch...An extremely comprehensive plot summary for each chapter will only take about 25 words. That's right-it takes place over the course of a day and a night, and the action can be completely and all-inclusively summarized in only 450 words. However, there are only two ways to get this summary: 1) five or six years of study, or 2) by reading a Cliffs Notes-type book.This book has been fairly assessed as incomprehensible, numbing, nightmarish, and mind-numbing. The average reader will have a excruciatingly grim time completing this book.Still, I am convinced that anyone who reads every word of this book will love and embrace it. Be warned, the love and embrace do not happen immediately. After reading the first 90 pages, I had the worst headache in my life. I could not read for five more days. I hated the next four hundred pages of the book. Around page 500, I began to embrace this beloved work. It took the last 250 pages to achieve a unity and oneness with the book.I'm one of those people who reads the dictionary for fun. Because of this, I know a lot of words that I've never heard or have never read. Ulysses changed that. I think that he used every word that I have ever learned by reading the dictionary, but have not heard in life. Finding those words in print is worth reading the 700+ pages.As a smattering of the jewels of perspicacity of James Joyce, I have included my four favorite parts of the book. If you like this small morsel of the volume, you will love the rest. Enjoy!1. Moses, Moses, king of the jews, wiped his arse in the Daily News.2. Love loves to love love.3. Q. Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner...? A. Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.4. Q. What in water did Bloom ... admire? A. Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level ... [Insert 30 more things about water] ... the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Those who attack Joyce and this book today are like the people who attack Einstein and his theory of relativity simply because they're to addled to understand the chaos and unity behind the mathematical symbols. In my experience as a teacher of undergraduates and as a published writer of fiction as well, I would like to say in response to comments by a so-called Phd English student, that criticising a monumental work of art that deals with the need for a personalised fiction in the fragmentation of twentieth century alienation, reflects an ignorance that boggles the mind. It is better to remain silent on what one doesn't understand than convince the world of one's lack of, well, insight. My suggestion to those who want to fathom what Joyce is trying to do is to check out what writers like Burgess have to say. And as for comments about male 'post-modernist' stuff, please read Grass's 'The Flounder' on what excess feminism is all about and learn to grow."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There are no notes in this book.

I really appreciated it! Merry Christmas."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A masterpiece? Yes, no doubt about it, yes, it is a masterpiece, yes!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" is endowed with Aristotelian unity of space: it all happens in Dublin, and God knows, it helps if you know your way around that city. Unity of time as well, it all happens in a 24-hour period starting on the morning of Thursday, June 16, 1904, and God knows it helps if you know the headlines of Dublin newspapers for that day. It even has unity of action, whatever there is of that ingredient in this novel. It all revolves around the current adulterous affair of Molly Bloom with the vulgar Blazes Boylan, and the preparation of her next adultery with intensely intellectual Stephen Dedalus, whose father Simon had also been her lover at some point. There seem to be three main characters: Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly, and the young \\"bard\\" Stephen Dedalus, alias Joyce himself. It is amusing that Joyce repeatedly keeps referring to Stephen Dedalus, his alter ego, as a bard, a title reserved these days for William Shakespeare. This seems to signal Joyce's conviction that he belongs to a very exclusive club with the bard of Stratford upon Avon as its only other member.Beyond these three \\"main\\" characters, there are literally hundreds of other characters whose names and even their Dublin addresses are mentioned and oft-repeated. You might think, I wrecked your whole pleasure in reading this book, by giving away these spoilers. You need not worry, as things are not what they seem to be. The true main character of the novel is none of the above, but rather the English language, of which Joyce has a command second to none, with the possible exception of the bard of Stratford upon Avon. I wouldn't be surprised if Joyce's vocabulary had weighed in at twice or maybe even thrice that of the typical educated reader, and not for a minute does he let you forget this fact. Why?Why? Well, the book has a clear anti-British slant, and Joyce is rubbing it in to the Brits, that it takes an Irish genius like himself, to show them what can be done with their language. He also feels free to distort the King's English, and by extremely clever alliterations, homophonies, misspellings and lists he manages to poke quite cruel fun at the tool he wields with such virtuosity. He casts Irish art in the role of \\"cracked lookingglass of a servant.\\"I just mentioned lists, and God knows, there are so many in this book, some of full-page length. The whole novel reads like a veritable prose-poem. Think but of the Joycean line \\"A veil awave upon the waves.\\" In many places Joyce lapses into actual poems, most marvelously that \\"Ballad of the Joking Jesus\\" (supposedly borrowed in an abridged and altered form from his estranged friend Oliver St. John Gogarty, the model for the Buck Mulligan character in \\"Ulysses.\\") the first two lines of which I cannot resist writing down here,I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heardMy mother's a Jew, my father's a bird.In the next two lines he refers negatively to \\"Joseph the Joiner\\" and one cannot miss the sharing of James Joyce's own initials with both those of the Divine Joking Jesus and of His holy mother's sainted husband.Along Leopold Bloom's Dublin wanderings deep issues are addressed: the dynamics of anti-Semitism, the difference between male and female sexuality, the patterns of married life, among others. In the latter context, a whole chapter is devoted to an extremely original, if far from provably correct analysis of William Shakespeare's marriage to Ann Hathaway. What is remarkable is that this analysis manages to shed light also on the problems in the Bloom marriage, with Leopold Bloom taking a different and much more forgiving attitude toward his wife's adultery than the bard.When dealing with sexuality, Joyce, in a serious novel written a mere decade after the Victorian age, does not shy away from the use of four-letter words, the detailed description of masturbation and of passionate intercourse, and quite some space is devoted to bodily functions. Indeed a crucial scene in the penultimate (\\"Ithaca\\") chapter ends with Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus sealing their friendship by the quite homoerotic act of urinating together in the garden.Finally, maybe the most important influence this novel has had on modern literature is at the stylistic level. There can be little doubt that Vladimir Nabokov's exotic, if always so marvelously correct, word-choices owe a big debt to Joyce. The title character of one of Saul Bellow's famous novels shares the name of the minor character Moses Herzog in \\"Ulysses.\\" In \\"Ulysses\\" each chapter is written in a different style, here a romantic novel, there a tabloid newspaper, there a serious newspaper, now a play, then an unpunctuated stream of consciousness and so on. In \\"Herzog,\\" Bellow also mixes a basic narrative with the epistolary style of the letters despondent Herzog dispatches to all kinds of live and dead world leaders. The word \\"snot-green\\" invented by Buck Mulligan to describe the color of the Irish sea in the first chapter of \\"Ulysses\\" has made a comeback in twenty-first century novels, not to speak even of the use of four-letter words and explicit sexual scenes in serious modern fiction. To a certain extent, even the deeply moving poetic style of Tennessee Williams' marvelous plays seems indebted to a certain extent to Joyce.Above all, the stream of consciousness narration, which traces the free flow of the characters' thoughts rather than of their actions, has become a standard in modern fiction. Between the unexpected turns of these thoughts and the beauty of Joyce's use of the English language, one remains glued to \\"Ulysses\\" through its almost eight hundred pages, much as one would if he had spiced the story with all the trappings of a first rate thriller.As a practical piece of advice, use as I did a paperback edition, and tear it into some ten fascicles of seventy-eighty pages each. This way you can enjoy one of the major masterpieces of twentieth century literature without risking a hernia and/or a carpal tunnel syndrome."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The ultimate controversial book, maybe just behind the bible. Nothing can be said about it that hasn't already been discussed, and everything you may have already read about it is absolutely true: confusing read, snobbish pretentiousness, seminal masterwork, culmination of english literature, cult genius, modernist epitome, madman's soliloquy, beautiful narrative, a classic, waste of time, bag of crap. So it's just fair to rate it a well-deserved 3 stars, the just average to a work that can easily be described as sublime and profane, at the same time -- sometimes not even chapter to chapter but paragraph to paragraph.

Naturally."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The basis of Joyce's work is the invigoration of Irish popular speech,the influence of music and song,English not being his native language,explains its unparalled virtuousity,also Joyce's near-blindness,his imagination becomes more auditory than visual as in Homer and Milton.Joyce must be read aloud for full appreciation.His poems are like songs.Also the great use of interior monologue for all 3 main characters.For Joyce the lapsed Catholic,words held magic sway over things: transubtantiaition. Disintegration of experience,integration of form.The theme and structure borrowed from Homer's Odyssey are a metaphor for Joyce's dream of Ireland's journey from a 'priest-ridden' backwater to a country taking its rightful place in the European intellectual and philosophical tradition.Joyce is the most cosmopolitan modern writer. Joyce's poetry is minor if charming,his drama doesn't work,his poetry works best in the comic framework of the prose novel.Style ceases to be a relationship between author and reader,instead becoming a relationship of a magical kind between author and object.Experience is replaced by prose.Joyce was a Flaubertian realist infected by the bacillus of modernism, following The Dubliners,he wrote Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, calling his hero Stephen Dedalus,connecting the contemporary character with the mythical artificer:there are two movements,one outward from Ireland the other downward into myth. Superficially Stephen is dissociating himself,on a deeper level achieving an association with myth.This led onto the systematization of Ulysses,with the mystification that followed in its wake.Too systematized Joyce asked?All Joyce's works have a strong autobiographical element.Ulysses was preceded by the play Exiles.An Irish writer,Richard Rowan believes his wife is playing him false with a former friend/disciple.Rowan finds himself in a tragic position regarding his mother,a pious Catholic.The theme is autobiographical.A onetime friend in 1909 claimed that when Joyce was courting Nora,she had shared her favours with himself.Rowan reveals that he himself longs for his own deception,deliberately making himself a party to it.Rowan identifies with Christ and looks for Judases amongst his friends.Very Joycean.Nora thought he encouraged her to go with other men.This play is the real basis for Ulysses,with the part of Richard Rowan divided between Stephen Dedalus,haunted by his dead mother,and Bloom,haunted by the idea of his wife's infidelity.They are the same person and may be regarded as a man young and old or two aspects of the same man.The subject of the book is the attempt to reconcile them.They pass,they skirt one another all day,but it is only at night that they meet.Each chapter is written in a different style,the names given to these styles is metaphorical,each metaphor sustained by puns.For Joyce all thought arises from the unconscious and returns to it.We need to read Ulysses by a process of free association.The opening chapters of Ulysses are the highest development of Joyce's peculiar genius, for this lay with the habitual,the normal,the everyday,and his interest and observation were sustained by an elaborate system of analogy.But analogy will not permit of growth and development,these have to be foisted artificially onto the book,and as it approaches a crisis,it becomes bogged in tortuous technical devices,like the chapter of the lying -in hospital where the development of the embryo is illustrated by the development of English prose.The problem is it reduces man to dissociated metaphor.Humanity explodes like an atom bomb."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ordered the Ulysses book by James Joyce based on original 1922 version.

Even though I've read the novel many times, I'm not qualified to compare this new edition to its predecessors: I'm a commercial artist, not a literary scholar.

Careful analysis of those influences are the basis of the method he used to create this new edition. Well, too bad he wasn't able to influence the publisher. This edition of Ulysses is printed on very cheap paper -- the kind of dim gray brittle stuff that the cheapest of romance fiction is printed on. Fine for a book that will be read once, but terrible for a &quot;Reader's Edition&quot; of a classic that will be reread and annotated. These pages will be badly discolored in a few years. The typography is mediocre, too: the title page looks like the Bad Example in any design textbook.

For an excellent account of Gabler's edition--of the legal reasons for its extensive modifications of the text, of the dubious textual methods employed, of the subsequent scholarly controversy--read Bruce Arnold's excellent little book _The Scandal of Ulysses_. Joyce's book has now twice in recent years been messed around with by dubiously-motivated editors--more recently, the \\"Reader's Edition\\" that was the subject of a wrangle in court to suppress it--which is an absurd indignity to be visited on one of the touchstones of 20th-century fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce was a great genius, granted, but what he did with his genius is something that doesn't appeal to me. Dangling the snotgreen stuff at the beginning of the book is not what I would call an inviting beginning. Yes, it's a marvel of writing, but I do not like what it is being marvelous about, or at. It's like a beautiful women who farts a lot but doesn't give a damn, because she knows her bosoms are so fetching. Well, fetching bosoms can take a woman only so far, just as fetching writing-- even a genius's writing-- can take a book so far. (IMHO). So yes, I like Joyce's writing's beauty and I like its fetching sensations, but I do not like his artistic manners and I do not like the liberties he takes with my attention-- which he sure knows how to catch, but so what. So can Flaubert (a greater writer, imho), and so can Proust (almost ditto).With all that out of the way I'll not-grudgingly say you probably have to read Ulysses, because, first, it sits like a dead weight in the midst of modern writing, and, second (if you are a writer), so you could steal some of Joyce's marvelous writing technique. But I would not read him more than once.AM"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Probably every avid reader feels compelled at some time in life to read \\"Ulysses\\", especially as it was voted the best work of fiction of the 20th century at the turn of this millenium.The style of writing throughout the book is usually referred to as \\"stream of consciousness\\". This method has been subsequently employed in other works such as \\"To The Lighthouse\\" and \\"The sound and the Fury\\". However, in my opinion, these latter two works used the style much more succesfully than Joyce.If you are currently reading \\"Ulysses\\" at the moment, expect a very patchy book. The second half is , in general, better than the first half, with the two penultimate chapters \\"Cabman's shelter\\" and \\"Ithaca\\" standing out from the rest. After that, the description of birth in \\"Oxen in the sun\\" is also excellent , as is the part dsecribing Paddy Dignam's funeral early in the book. As to the rest of the book, I believe there is little to recommend it.Opinion tends to be polarized about \\"Ulysses\\" . Its severest critics suggest that it is only praised by those who are scared to be criticized for not understanding the book, a sort of \\"emperor's new clothes\\" scenario. There is, however, more than a grain of truth in this opinion. It does seem incredible that a book with so much \\"padding\\" could be so highly thought of. It might have made a very good book of around 200 pages, but one does have the sensation that Joyce is taking his readers for a ride in many parts. ( Of course, his ultimate send up of his readers was \\"Finnegan's Wake\\"! ). Furthermore, the much lauded sense of humour is overblown. At best, this is a mildly amusing book with one or two laugh out loud lines. To label it as \\"very funny\\" is pretentiousness itself. Most of the humour is also of the \\"toilet\\" variety.On the positive side, there are some interesting passages as mentioned above. However, the main interest lies in seeing this new attempt at a style of writing , and to try to fathom out why this book has become the \\"darling\\" of the ( maybe \\"so-called\\" ) intellectuals.

The second time you read it, you will begin to suspect that Joyce is actually writing about the contours of your own mind. The third time you read it, your earlier suspicion will prove true as you successively laugh, gasp, swear, snort, breathe, moan, think, and yearn in anticipation of the occurrences of these events on the page. By the fourth time you read it, you will realize you never stopped reading it - that even the interlude of years between your first and second reading was only a momentary pause to catch the breath of your life outside the Book; and that you made a habit of the yearly 16-June read merely for the sake of ordering that interval of months between the readings - and during those intervals you will find yourself repeating passages in your head that you would never have imagined to be memorizable. Each time you emerge from this book you will find yourself unmistakably changed - your eyes opened to a further deepness of what it is to be human, what it is to be yourself. Joyce will demand everything of you, but he will give you a greater everything in return.If you have tried to read this book before, and didn't make it - well, i understand. The first time, it is admittedly extraordinarily difficult. But turn, if you will, to page 903 of the hardback Knopf Everyman edition, and read the bit of catechism &quot;What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?&quot; that extends through 905. Then go to the beginning, or wherever you left off if you prefer, and start again. If not now, then someday - maybe years from now - but do it. And then do it again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"They list and in the porch of their ears I pour...I mean who writes lines like that?? So here's my explication/review:Ulysses : Political Commentary And SensualityJames Joyce was a famous contributor to the 18th century literary tradition. Nevertheless, Joyce's use of the supernatural is all too often mistaken for social commentary in Ulysses. Below, it will be proven that Ulysses's Surrealist overtones and views on hate are not evidence of Joyce's surrender to love. This claim is buttressed by three points: (1) the Surrealist views of Ulysses's protagonist, Tom Joad, (2) Joyce's triumphant use of satire in the work, and (3) the author's employment of human nature, showing the influence of the the British Modernist school.First, Joyce's male sympathies are evident in Ulysses. To indicate that Ichabod Stephenson is the work's villain, the author makes his dialogue simple. Ishmael Maxwell is a famous character for this very reason; it is also meaningful that scholars--by seeing him as an avatar of Joyce's Minimalist views--have misinterpreted the character King Adams's role in the book.Furthermore, consider that Ulysses was not so much written by Joyce as belched forth in a fit of sublime inspiration. Ulysses's use of incest is in keeping with its Constructivist point-of-view. Captain Stephenson is a far from marginal character; in fact, it is through him that many of Joyce's 18th century influences show through.Last, Ulysses cannot be fully understood without examination of the post Minimalist school of Roman literature. Many teens see the book's closing scene as the most enduring; I, however, do not. Nick Daniel is a witless character for this very reason; this is definitely why One-Eyed Caulfield is such a monumental character.It's easy to forget that Ulysses was the most brilliant work of its time. Perhaps it's time that scholars reevaluated their estimation of the book. Though contemporaries found Joyce's use of dystopic future-vision ponderous, history will vindicate Ulysses. Q. E. D. -- Quite easily done.The End"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"So we all know that Ulysses is amazing, best novel of the 20th century. And the Gabler edition is the most accurate version out there. But let's talk about the quality of the Gabler edition. While I was reading a brand new copy of this book, 20 of the pages completely fell out! I had to be careful not to bend the binding too much while reading it. I would suggest looking for this in hardcover or see if any other publisher has printed a copy of Gabler."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Imaginative literature can't afford to dissociate itself from its readership because the &quot;lay-reader&quot; is the very rationale for its existence! Joyce is not a model to be followed by any writer. Granted that it is the reader's prerogative to choose and pick - it is not up to the author of imaginative literature to be selective about his readers. This extremely gifted man had set out to surpass everything produced in literature up to his time, and if his goal had been tedium to the max, he achieved it. I am the first to give Joyce due credit for the linguistic scope and the skill with which he engineered the plot in Ulysses - but answer me honestly: does any of the characters come to live the way - say - Tolstoy manages to animate his people with a much more primitive technique? I seriously doubt it. Joyce the human being had limitations which got in the way of Joyce the writer which prevented Joyce the artist from living up to the full potential of Joyce the talent. Style is a direct reflection of an artist's temperament - obviously the writer of &quot;Ulysses&quot; could never make up his mind what kind of style it is going to be - the book lacks unity and appears in places unnecessarily oracular due to the style, but not necessarily for the subject matter, which can be looked up in a good reference! And if that wouldn't be bad enough, more than once Joyce went off on a rather revealing tangent: take for instance the masturbation scene in &Ograve;Nausicaa.&Oacute; Superbly written as it is, it gives us the whole deficiency of Joyce in a nutshell. He imitates the presumptuous and pompous phrasing in certain fashion magazines of the period, but just tell me to what end? Is it to poke fun on the cliche beset thought-process of the crippled girl? Well I fail to see the joke, this is just cruel. Satire either attacks a subject that has the capacity to bite back, or it is merely an act of a certain and in Joyces time very fashionable &quot;anti-philistine&quot; snobbery. Or perhaps the only reason for writing this way was that Mr. Joyce wished to flaunt his stylistic versatility? I am not objecting to have readers making an effort to get into a difficult text - not at all. But the reward should offer better things than the gratification of a crossword puzzle. We talk about participation. Participation in the artist's temperament to see things the way they present themselves to the artist. This does not prevent us from disagreeing. (I disagree with many things Tolstoy had to say when he couldnt resist to step on his collapsible soap box. But I also appreciate his artistic genius whenever he spares us the lecture.) To give another example: Compare &Ograve;Oxen of the Sun&Oacute; in Ulysses with the moments when women break their water in Tolstoys novels. Giving birth is not a linguistic exercise. Joyce's choice of style (in fact a display of 60 different styles and modes of speech) is just clever but completely detached from the event. What is to be expected at the very least, is a certain coherence of artistic vision, which I find utterly lacking in Joyce. He can't make up his mind, so he throws at us all the imitative bits and pieces from a (very talented) schoolboy's exercise book. Ulysses is the portfolio of a writer's versatility - it is not a work of art. When I was much younger and naive, I had read every single line of Joyce, including his letters and poems and even Finnegan's Wake (what a waste of time). I can't help it, the man was an amateur for all his life, a typical tinkerer and home improvement guy who probably never really found the kind of subject matter that could have distracted him from his self-consciousness. His short stories wouldn't be barely remembered these days if there wasnt his name under the title. They are imitation pieces, ventriloquistic exercises, and pretty flat and lifeless if held against Chekhov and Kipling, or Flaubert and Kathleen Mansfield. Apparently &quot;Dubliners&quot; and &quot;Portrait&quot; and especially &Ograve;Ulysses&Oacute; were written by an author who went on a quest for his own style. If Finnegan's Wake eventually was the place where the eagle landed, then, I am sorry to say, the game wasn't worth the candles. Joyce had tons of talent to burn, but something went seriously wrong here. I am all for modern art, and consider &quot;post modern&quot; a phony contradiction in terms. But lesser talents accomplished more - DosPassos, O'Neil, Kafka, Proust, Marianne Moore, Auden, Hemingway, Nabokov, they all have their moments, even clowns like Bukowski and Douglas Adams (who is a linguistic genius in his own right.) Borges could put in 3 lines what took a Joyce 30 strenuous pages without ever achieving a comparable impact. In the end, all I ask for, is the readers honesty. Don't just think something is great because a certain establishment says so. Real great artists (like Dickens or Shakespeare) can do without this sort of approval. Don't make it a mission to reach for an icon for no other reason than seeing it hanging high. A failure is a failure even if it is a great man's failure. And Joyce wasn't made of the stuff of greatness. But this is a different story. Approaching Joyce is an experience not unsimilar to &Ograve;The Approach to Al-Mutasim.&Oacute;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can not see why everyone thinks this book is so great.

There are scenes, passages and conversations from Ulysses that are truly brilliant--but that's all one can say about it. The tragedy is that a man of such talent, who would have secured a place in literary history if he had never written another word after &quot;The Dead&quot;, felt obliged to labor his way through this doorstop of a novel, when he could have produced something so much better."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have a BS in English from Ga Tech in the USA.

In high school I purchased the volume because that is what readers did. Purchasing the book, however, is about all the good I got out of it back then. I don't think I even made it into Part II without giving up. So, naturally, a book likeJames Joyce's Ulysses: A Studyprofited my younger self infinitely more so than the novel it purported to study. That is because, without even having read the book, I could speak somewhat intelligently on the novel and also make ridiculously absurd remarks about its place in the \\"modernist project.\\" As you can imagine, I was invited to a lot of parties.Years passed, a Modern Library list of the one hundred greatest books of the twentieth century was issued, and Ulysses remained unread on my bookshelf. During my undergraduate studies, and I use the term \\"studies\\" in its most liberal application, I enrolled in a James Joyce course. I read it and I hated it. Now, in an attempt to read through the Modern Library's list, I have read it again. I am still convinced that it is not a great book.Ulysses is not a great book for many different reasons. First is its notorious and intentional difficulty. Joyce himself once commented on the book that he had \\"put so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.\\" And this is the problem. Joyce has forced so much meaning into the text so as to render it meaningless. Indeed, reading Ulysses is more academic exercise than pleasurable literary experience. Literature, at its core, is an attempt at human communication and what we have here is a failure to communicate. Few average readers are willing or able to invest the time and effort necessary to read and understand a novel whose explicit goal it is to confuse professional scholars.The difficulty of the book extends beyond the themes, symbols, and structure and into the very language employed to tell the story. If only Joyce had adopted - as Biddy the Clip describes Stephen Dedalus' language in the Circe chapter - a \\"marked refinement of phraseology,\\" then perhaps the novel wouldn't be so bad. Instead the book is strewn about with an infuriating amount of useless and obscure language. This opacity has spawned a cottage industry of explanatory texts. But this is a novel, not an excursion into unknown territory. We shouldn't need maps. In the end the language of Ulysses will limit it to a very select readership, namely those interested in convincing others of their sophistication and intellectual powers (you know, people like me). It will never enjoy popular readership. I am reminded here of the quaker librarian's warning from the Scylla and Charybdis chapter where he comments that, \\"the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\\"I offer that the book fails in two more respects. First, it fails in its stylistic ambitions. The book is perhaps best known for its stream-of-consciousness innovations. This narrative technique is an effort to get inside the head of the characters and to replicate the character's thoughts. For the most part, Joyce fails miserably at this. No one thinks like the characters of Ulysses think. Their thoughts are simply too sporadic, befogged, and preposterously plentiful. These passages may very well be streams-of-unconsciousness, but no one ever had a conscious thought pattern as absurd as those found in Ulysses. The interior monologues of Stephen Dedalus are the worst. Most readers, I imagine, skip them entirely. Readers interested in a proper execution of the stream-of-consciousness technique need look no further than William Faulkner or Virginia Woolf.Secondly, the novel fails in its modernism. If the modern novel is meant to serve as a symbolic manifestation of the confusion and aggravation of modern life, then the book is a wild success. Indeed, perhaps the only thing more confusing and aggravating than reading Ulysses is readingFinnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin). If, on the other hand, we understand the project of literary modernism to be an articulation of the era's spiritual disillusionment, despair and alienation then we need look no further than the prose of Ernest Hemingway.There is a way to read Ulysses. Read it slowly. This works in two respects. First, part of the charm of the novel, if there is any, is its language. By reading slow you will be able to digest it all. Secondly, if you are polymath and polyglot enough to understand what is going on, you will not miss anything important. Finally, as my undergraduate professor suggested, it helps to recite the book in your mind with a deep Dublin Irish accent. Doing so makes the book at a least a little more entertaining.So why would I offer suggestions about how to read the book if I feel that it's not worth reading? Well, my limited appreciation of the novel is based on its at times brilliant wordplay, its humor and the beauty of the final chapter.Few books provoke authentic LOLs. Ulysses is one of them. The first glimpse of this humor comes from the Hades chapter when Leopold Bloom - the alienated Jew trapped on an island of rabidly anti-Semitic Irish Catholics - ponders the curious rituals of the Roman faith as he and his peers lay to rest poor Paddy Dignam. Mr. Bloom satirizes the ritual prayers over the dead body with his own intonation of, \\"hoping you're well and not in hell.\\" In terms of the book's funny punnery, none is as enjoyable as that found in the conversation between Alf and Joe during the Cyclops chapter when Alf asks who has been making character assassinating allegations against Bloom. Joe replies, \\"I am the alligator.\\" Stephen Dedalus provides the biggest gut buster when, drunk and conversing, he professes that his understanding of brotherly love is reducible to the maxim that, \\"greater love than this no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.\\" Unfortunately, finding such humorous literary gems in Ulysses is like searching for a needle in a pile of donkey poo.Despite my previous distaste for the majority of the novel's language, there are some very pretty sentences in Ulysses. For instance, the shade of a tree becomes \\"the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves.\\" On a morning trip to the butcher, Leopold Bloom, relisher of the inner organs of beasts and fowls, watches as \\"the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.\\" Finally, instead of entering the carriage, a character pokes his \\"silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seats himself.\\"Finally, Ulysses endeared itself to me a bit more this time because the final episode, the Penelope chapter, is just so wonderful. This chapter documents the thoughts of a woman - Molly Bloom, wife of Leopold - as she falls asleep. Where elsewhere Joyce fails in composing a convincing stream-of-consciousness, here he is resoundingly successful. Molly Bloom's lazy, floating thoughts fall upon memories of her friends, her lovers (premarital and adulterous), her childhood, her dead son, her living daughter, her desire to blow Stephen Dedalus before finally and beautifully coming to rest upon (yes) her husband who has literally just kissed her ass. I realize that the prospect of reading a ponderous forty page run-on sentence may not sound like the most palatable literary endeavor. If there is anything that makes Ulysses worth reading, however, it is this chapter.Should you read Ulysses? I don't know. On one hand, it's the greatest novel ever written. Then again, it's certainly one of the worst. If anything, please do not read it on the Kindle. Get a print version. That way you can look really smart when people see you reading it on the subway."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, this book is staggeringly difficult. Yes, Joyce was a pompous, self-absorbed, pretentious butthead. Yes, he was a cynic who indulged in bitter ironies. But at the same time Joyce was also a senitmentalist and an idealist, and this magnificient novel is a successful exercise in unadulterated nostalgia. It is humble. It is funny. It is sad. It is vexing. And it contains the most sublime sentences and passages written in the English language: \\"On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.\\" The \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" chapter alone is both dazzling and haunting. Shorn of the baggage (and garbage) it has accumulated over the years, Ulysses is, at its heart, a deeply moving probing of nothing less than the human heart."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was excited to see this as a free Kindle download.

While the product description indicates the edition is based on the 1984 Gabler edition, the Kindle edition includes a number of errors not present in that text. The company appears to have done a poor job copy editing the final Kindle text. There are a number of typographical errors. Also, in many cases numbers are rendered as letters and visa versa, particularly in the final episode. As Joyce often did not use conventional punctuation, it will be difficult for you to identify them unless you have previously read the book.If you are reading Ulysses for the first time or for school or study, you should avoid this edition.

One thing is for certain - it is a difficult,long read. It is also, strangely, very hard to put down and it leaves you searching for meaning and just in a state of complete wonder. Amazingly, Joyce is able to convey each character's thoughts and dialect in a way that has never been achieved by anyone else. It feels almost as if each character was composed by a different author - they are so unique and detailed. Though I cannot express much of anything that has not already been said - let me make one recommendation to the reader of Ulysses - read something to help you through it (even cliff notes) and also read the Odyssey again - you will find this very helpful in navigating through this remarkable text."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and now Ulysses. One apparent source of the joy of reading these for me is that all of the characters are good, sympathetic people, even when they do petty things. It is a world full of light and air, humor and optimism. Stephen Dedalus, Buck Mulligan, Leopold and Molly Bloom and all the rest are more-or-less normal humans living normal lives even though somewhat oppressed by poverty, the Church, and the English, and of course themselves. Ulysses has none of the violence, darkness, ugliness, cynicism, villiany, and perversion that is found in so much of modern literature. The most dramatic and upsetting thing that happens is when Stephen gets his hand whacked in school (in Portrait). Even Stephen's alchoholic irresponsible father is painted somewhat empathetically.The events in Ulysses are so prosaic and quotidian that Joyce had to dress up his work with high-fallutin prose and verbal pyrotechnics. Otherwise the work would just be too bland. The reader can skate over most of the obscure rambling parts or go back and endlessly ponder them. I ignore most of the references, and I'm not too taken with the Homeric and Biblical symbolism. The book can be read on many different levels. I admit I loved it--but I would recommend reading Dubliners and Portrait first. I would also recommend visiting Dublin if you can swing it, and especially Howth, which figures prominently in Ulysses. Howth is a charming village and vast, dramatic, wild, high headland with sweeping views of the Irish Sea, Bailey Lighthouse way below, and Dublin city center in the distance--all within the city limits of Dublin. Last stop north on the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, they way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Why haven't you read this book?

It is not always remarkable. But seen through the life of one ordinary man, a single day is an epic, albeit an ordinary one. And what's so wrong with that?Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedelus are perhaps the most intriguing characters in 20th Century art. They are opposites of a sort. Bloom is an everyman, Daedelus wants to be the Ubermensch, but he is far too Gallic. Bloom (the Hungarian Jew - anything but Gallic) triumphs in his epic, this day in Dublin. Stephen, well, he doesn't quite triumph. There are lessons here that one can explore for eons. Why is Bloom successful in his odyssey? Why isn't Stephen? Stephen is trapped in emerging Gallic existentialism, dark, \\"sinister\\" as Buck Mulligan describes it. Bloom is, well...Bloom.

Even now i don't have the words to define this book titled \\"Ulysses\\".But be prepared to have a tough time ahead when you start the book. Honestly, speaking i could not understand many of the pages."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The best introduction to James Joyce is James Joyce. He did everything so well he only had to each thing once. One short story collection: Dubliners. And one great novel: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. On the basis of these two works alone Joyce would be legend. But he did not stop there, he went further than anyone had ever gone with literature and wrote a new kind of novel, Ulysses. And after that another new kind of novel, Finnegans Wake. Ulysses is a work which every reader must face once in his life. Or twice. No other novel so sums up the reason novels are written. Ulysses is an epoch about culture but told lyrically through two characters, the familiar Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. Both will win you over. Dedalus for his scholars apprenticeship at life, and Bloom for his well versed walk through the very reaches of modern life. Irish this is in the very best sense. The language is real but the words are not coming from everyday talk but from the inside, the waking consciousness' dialogue with itself. That is the magic of this book. It is completely original born from nothing but inspiration. It is a great move to have Stephen, the character from his last novel, collide with Bloom, this new novels creation. Joyce has the teachers good will to introduce you to the new work via an old companion, brilliant stroke. The modern world really makes no sense is Stephens Tragedy and Blooms comedy. If you are a young man you will probably share Stephen's sentiments and if you are beyond youth you will share Bloom's. Or both which makes it all the more wonderful. No book is more insightful in leading to an understanding of the western predicament and no book has yet come close. Joyce writes in a sometimes hard to decipher prose but it is all worth it. In the end you will feel you have collided with the one who understood first what it was to be a modern life. Make it easy on yourself and read this after Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young man. For the best readers there is no other way. As for Finnegans Wake, I am still preparing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"My discussions about ULYSSES bring out a similar comment from others--no matter how many times we return to the novel, we find something new. This richly rendered piece proves that virtual reality existed long before computers; it required a rich imagination, a good eye for detail, and a finely tuned ear for the music of voices and everyday sound. We find these things in ULYSSES. It deserves the praise it has earned for these many decades."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you intend to read ULYSSES here are a few suggestions.First off, read or reread Homer's The Odyssey, from which Joyce's seminal work is based. Aside from the Dedalus/Telemachus, Bloom/Odysseus, and Molly/Penelope parallels, each book in Joyce's novel reinvents equivalent parts of the Greek epic. You will gain a much greater appreciation of Joyce's achievement in transposing and reinterpreting a 10 year mythic and epic journey in ancient Greece to a 1 day journey in early 20th century Dublin.Secondly, don't come in expecting to understand everything. Many have tried and quit after reading a few parts, daunted by the strange syntax, the disjointed time frames, the shifts from waking to dream states, and the lack of traditional narrative replaced for the most part by stream of consciousness (internal monologue) to develop the plot. Joyce plays around a lot in ULYSSES, changing narrative styles, dialects, inventing words. You can't breeze through it. It requires a lot of patience to get through ULYSSES..to appreciate what Joyce has accomplished. It's always tricky categorizing a great work, but being that it's a novel about thought processes I guess you can say it's beyond realism..call it super realism. This is literature as a ground breaking art form. Joyce broke rules, but so did Picasso, and ULYSSES is kind of a literary Cubist masterpiece.Finally, after getting through ULYSSES (if you can), read the voluminous critiques on it. Read about the author. Do further exploration. Then read ULYSSES again. Multiple readings certainly enhance the experience, and bear fruit which are hidden or unripe enough to initially enjoy and appreciate."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I recently returned from Dublin where I met many Irish people and native \\"Dubs,\\" as they call themselves. Everyone said the same thing about \\"Ulysses\\", that is \\"I tried to read it but could not get through it.\\"Jim Norton brought \\"Ulysses\\" to life for me. I followed along as he read and began to understand the rythm of the text. \\"Ulysses\\" became exciting instead of imposing.Jim Norton is truly gifted: Great voice and wonderful imagination."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite what the reviewer from MA had to say about this novel, it is readable and it should be approached by anyone who is interested in it. It is not an easy read, but then again, really innovative and engaging works never are. Joyce does something in this novel that few authors have the courage to do--trust the reader's intelligence.Yes, this is a retelling of The Odyssey, but even without that framework, the novel stands by itself. The story picks up about a year after Joyce's novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man leaves off with some of the same characters, notably Stephen Dedalus. But the protagonist of the work, Leopold Bloom, is the real stroke of genius. It might help to read Portrait before approaching Ulysses just to get an introduction to Stephen and his family. Anyone who really wants to get as many allusions as possible should probably use Gifford's annotations, which are available for both texts.As for our friend from MA...well, what can you say about someone who is reviewing the Cliff's Notes version of the text? Is that what Poly Sci majors read in order to try and feel intelligent as English majors?Do not be afraid; you can read this book. If you are afraid of starting a book that is so long by yourself then get some friends or family involved and read the book out loud to each other. It's marvelous."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From the beginning of anyone's Joyce readings, he automatically assumes a powerless position. In Dubliners, we are walking through a labrynth of short stories connected only by theme and setting, paralysis and Dublin. We see the same theme and setting in A Portrait. Ulysses, though, presents Joyce's labrynth at its most complex. Unlike other more traditional novels, the chapters in Ulysses have almost no connections from one to the next. Rather, Joyce presents a series of coincidences and seemingly unrelated events within one day. The navigation of the novel in most places becomes rather belaboured, especially &quot;Oxen of the Sun.&quot; Like the epic it was modeled after (Odyssey), Ulysses includes moments of divine intervention. However, a Ulyssean intervention is made by either Joyce or the reader rather than by a Greek God serving as a deux es machina. The plot of Ulysses is the plot of the modern hero in the greatest epic of all, life. The novel is the most intricate, and probably the most realistic novel ever. I say it is the most realistic even though it has many moments of disillusionment with knowledge that we all go through many moments of disillusion throughout each day of our lives. The characters, just as the readers, are hopeless in the grand scheme of things. Fate, rather than the human hand, controls all of us. If you feel like trampling through a labrynth of deeply insightful and, at times, awfully confusing epiphanies, then Ulysses is for you. The labor involved in the reading makes its brief moments of understanding (the epiphanies) all the more worthwile. After all, you have to go through hell to come out right."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Due to the recent explosion of fame of this novel, many literature lovers have gone out to buy the book (or get it from a library,) to at least see what the hype is all about, if not to actually enjoy it. Unfortunately, many of these literature lovers enjoy not just reading, but the atmosphere of reading--curling up in bed or in a plush recliner after work and shutting off the outside world to live with the characters for a few hours. These readers generally throw Ulysses away before getting past the third chapter because they realize that no such reading atmosphere is possible with such a complex novel. To those interested in reading the novel, I offer two suggestions: first study a little Irish history, particularly about Charles Stewart Parnell, Daniel O'Connell, Arthur Griffin and Sinn Fein, the Fenian movement, etc. even if you just peruse encyclopedia articles. Second, read the Don Gifford notes for the novel along with Ulysses itself. This will constantly interrupt your reading of the novel, but it will help your understanding. If you are completely unwilling to put in this effort, buying this book will be a waste of money. But even if you don't think you would be willing to read a novel that requires so much initial research for basic comprehension, consider this: If Ulysses is really as good as its fans claim, you will want to go back and read it a second time, and then you will be able to enjoy it without constantly referring to notes, history texts or foreign language dictionaries."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition corrected hundreds or thousands of mistakes that were in the 1961 edition. When Ulysses was originally published, it had to be typeset in france because english printers could be prosecuted for \\"pornography\\". These typesetters didn't know english and made a lot of mistakes. Joyce's corrections (he often worked backwards to develop certain themes) were scrawled onto (at least) two sets of galleys and many of them were never included. In addition to that he was going blind and missed a lot of typos which thus came to seem intentional. Ulysses is (IMHO) the greatest book of the 20th century and demands careful and close reading. With the 1961 edition, which I read through several times before this one came out, I was left with many obscurities (such as Bloom having a watch in one chapter and needing to ask someone the time in a later chapter) to ponder which, it turns out, Joyce never intended, as well as struggling through passages than made no sense at all. This is still a very difficult book to read, but there's far less that's inexplicable in this edition. The difference is analogous to hearing cleaned-up CDs (of, say, Robert Johnson) as opposed to tapes made from shellac records with all the pops, scratches, and hisses on them."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is Leopold Bloom - husband of Molly, father of Milly, advertising canvasser, lover of \\"the inner organs of beasts and fowls,\\" Jew, atheist, untutored but curious and sympathetic observer of the world around him. On June 16, 1904, Bloom has breakfast, defecates, attends a funeral, goes sporadically about his work, has lunch, visits the library, has a heated discussion with some Dublin barflies, masturbates discreetly while enjoying the view afforded by a conveniently reclining shop-girl, falls in with some drunken medical students, visits a brothel, and tends to an obnoxious young hipster-intellectual, whom he brings home for a cup of coffee and a chat.That's what \\"happens,\\" but over the course of Bloomsday we are invited into the life and times of the most fully and brilliantly realized character in world literature. As Bloom strolls around Dublin, and the novel records fragments from his endlessly fascinating internal monologue, his life slowly comes into focus: he is of half-Jewish descent; he is married to a voluptuous beauty named Molly who, Bloom knows, will spend the afternoon getting a thorough seeing-to by a well-hung local playboy; he has a daughter, but his only son was still-born, since which time his marriage has been largely dysfunctional; his father committed suicide; he is carrying on a clandestine correspondence with a married woman; but at the core of his uxorious being remains Molly, his mind returning time and again to their courtship and the happy early years of their marriage.We learn much, too, from his interactions with his fellow Dubliners. Throughout the day Bloom endures a steady stream of anti-Semitic bigotry, ranging from the casual to the (comically) violent. Bloom is an outsider, a humane and free-thinking man in a city of parochial bores. He is also, in Joyce's words, \\"a good man,\\" a man who takes it upon himself to collect funds for a recently widowed woman and spontaneously helps a blind man cross the road. Most endearing of all, however, is his boundless curiosity, his wonderful (if often ill-informed) observations of people and things. When he looks at his cat he ponders: \\"Wonder what I look like to her. Height of a tower. No, she can jump me.\\" \\"Good puzzle would be to cross Dublin without passing a pub,\\" he muses later. Or: \\"Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife.\\" Or: \\"Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time? Well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.\\" Or: \\" Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.\\" And so on.Bloom, his mind and his life, - like the city he lives in - comes into focus bit by bit, like tiny pieces of a dazzling mosaic slowly coming together before your eyes. With unnerving prescience, Joyce has created a genuinely modern Everyman (he works in advertising!): deracinated, middle-class, tolerant, suburban, he's a little bit like you and me, making a go of his modest existence with a redeeming dignity.The final chapter belongs to Bloom's wife Molly, who lies in bed next to her husband and reflects - in eight astonishing unpunctuated sentences - upon the events of her day and her past, throwing new light upon what we think we know about Bloom and his marriage. Big-bosomed, generously-bottomed Molly is Woman with a capital \\"W\\". Where Bloom is intellectual, reflective and logical, Molly is impulsive, florid, instinctive, sensual. The faithless Molly is an improbable Penelope, but as she concludes with the ecstatic recollection of her courtship with Bloom atop a hill overlooking Dublin bay, and with her climactic Yes - to her husband, to life - it all makes perfect, glorious sense.Next to Joyce's latter day Ulysses - and his Penelope - the stylistic fireworks of the novel are of secondary interest, a brilliant means to an end rather than a legitimate pretext for anorak-like fixation. You'll get more out of Ulysses the more familiar you are with Homer, with the western literary and intellectual tradition, with the geography of Edwardian Dublin, and with Irish culture and history, but in truth you don't need any of those things. Here is a rich, nourishing, generous feast of a book: all you need is an open mind and a sympathetic interest in the world and the creatures that inhabit it.Finnegan's Wake is strictly for comfortably tenured scholars and tragic seekers of hermetic wisdom. Ulysses is for the rest of us. Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First, please disregard the star rating. I had to choose something, but in this case, it's meaningless.I read Portrait of the Artist in college and found it absolutely wonderful. It influenced me to change my major and, to a degree, my life. I was sure then, as I am now, that Joyce is one of the greatest writers I have ever read. I therefore tried to read Ulysses several times, including just recently, and each time hit a wall after a few dozen pages. My most recent attempt was assisted by an extrinsic aid that summarized the chapters and elucidated some of the obscure references. I was determined to make a go of it; I pictured myself wallowing in a warm bath of self-satisfaction at having completed the book, and being able to mention to others (casually, of course) that I'd read it.I failed.I have read my share of stylistically difficult novels, and consider myself reasonably well educated. I could doubtless plow through the book with gritted teeth, determined not to let it get the better of me, but life's too short. I surely can't say it isn't a great work of literature (particularly since I've made barely a dent in it), but I would venture to say that you should not even try it unless you are prepared either to devote a few months of close study, with reference materials, or to miss eighty percent of what the author was trying to say and do. I can also say that I think it unlikely that you will genuinely enjoy the book unless you derive inherent satisfaction from conquering a difficult task, or are a scholar of literature of this genre.Not a beach book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Plot? There is no plot? Hath life a plot? I think not. Life is a continual process, ebb and flow, rising and falling, like plate tectonics, like the ocean:constant movement, sometimes building to grand, pulsing, God-quaking climaxes before receding back into everyday lifes slowly humming grey. But sometimes not. Don't approach Ulysses looking for a coherent arc of plot, you're going to be disappointed(again, it hasn't one). Approach it more like Lolita, less concerned with the subject matter than with the beauty of its language; each word is a live, crawling jeweled beetle gnawing and burrowing through the dung of a day in the life of ad salesman Leopold Bloom, flittering their wings, busszing and forminng new patters, cresting and swirling into a cone, a tetracylone around an ordinary day in the life of an essentially ordinary Man. It works like a silhouette:each word, like a wort, pimple, hair or other blemish on a face defines its shape, as does ulyesses a life in the context of a single day(cf Finnegans Wake), through long sonorous sentences and chapters brimming like a cistern full of noisy pink coffee, out of which meaning blooms like a bloody Liebestod-singing rose, grabbing you. Even still, there is no meaning-ordering modern life? There is no order.&quot;Der Inhalt ist in den Augen einer Eule&quot;. Using The Odyssey to parallel Blooms avoidance of Molly is but a simple ploy, an act of acceptance and defeat, a concession of escape and resignation-much like those little pimply puke potsmoke fourteen year olds who compare their lives to popular songs. Don't hide. The pure organic beauty-tragic, erotic, hilarious, pathetic, and ulimtately affirmative runs through this novel like a vein of gold ore. Pick it up. Enjoy it at length. Enjoy it many times over-the more you read it the more you get. Don't seek God in Ulysses-Joyce's brilliance could certainly back up his notoriously mammoth arrogance but he was no seer, no mystic, but a human, flawed just like any other-instead, enjoy its beauty, and in it(eventually, but with time you will)recognize yourself, and every other human being on Earth-for am Ende we are all Leopold Bloom(nee Virag)--therein."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I won't review the book in detail, other than to say that I did enjoy it very much, and there were places where I laughed out loud (particularly when Leopold Bloom wonders whether or not Gods and Goddesses have anuses, then decides to resolve the matter by closely inspecting a statue at the National Museum).Also, to first time readers: just ignore episode 3. Many people enjoy Episodes 1-2 just fine, then get to episode 3 and stop dead in their tracks. Just skim through it or even skip it altogether. Ulysses is a book to be re-read, not just read once, so don't concern yourself with Episode 3 the first time through. It will make more sense if/when you reread the novel later. (And you should reread it, because you will be amazed at how easy it becomes once you're familiar with the basic plot).The main reason I'm posting this is to let readers, especially first time readers, know about an essay, \\"Art and Life, Nature and Culture\\" by Cheryl Herr, published in \\"James Joyce's Ulysses: A Casebook.\\" Most articles about Ulysses assume that you agree with the author that Ulysses is a great book, without taking the time to explain WHY it is a great book. Herr's essay explains a few (though definitely not all) of the themes of the novel and why its point is ultimately elusive. Some people get frustrated (I did) thinking that Ulysses is just one big puzzle that can be easily solved if you have the right \\"key,\\" making it seem mechanical, systematic, and just not fun. This essay challenges that assumption, explaining the mysteries of the novel that can never be fully explained, leaving it open to multiple, even infinite, readings.Also, although it's necessary to read \\"A Portrait...\\" before you read Ulysses, if you don't like \\"A Portrait,\\" don't worry. I didn't like that novel very much at all (maybe because I'm not Catholic and couldn't appreciate all the passages about sin and hell, but it just didn't get to me) but I loved Ulysses.

The language is onomatapaeic in so many places and reading it out loud or, in this case, hearing it, is often the missing element you need to receive the picture Joyce is creating.

I am particularly concerned by the number of people who gave the book a poor review after admitting that that hadn't bothered reading past the first few pages. There's an adage in criticism that goes something like \\"Just because it's popular doesn't mean it's good\\" (AMEN to that)...a corallary could be \\"Just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's a 'literary hoax.\\"Yes, as hard as it may be to believe in some circles, ULYSSES is not a hoax. It is, however, difficult, and not, I repeat NOT for everyone. The stream-of-consciousness, the language(s), the style(s), and the fact that Joyce brought in all sorts of obscure references make it just plain difficult sometimes.The travels of Leopold Bloom about Dublin on that fateful day of June 16, 1904, can be, for the right individual, a difficult, fun journey. What brings fans of this work, like myself, back to it again and again, is the fact that each time we read it we discover something we missed (or misunderstood) the last time (or last 10 times) around.With a little work on the reader's part, ULYSSES can be finished. Many of us have actually made it to the end, scratched our head, and started again a few weeks later (after full recovery).Give it a shot, and if it's not for you, don't even bother moving onto FINNEGANS WAKE...you won't make it past the third line!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" is a deeply flawed work of genius that richly deserves both the bouquets and the brickbats that critics have hurled at it over the years. It is by turns a desperate struggle to free writing from the literary straightjacket of convention, and an unctuous exercise in literary hubris. It is one of the most definitive products of the modernist movement then in vogue and shares the inconsistency, contradiction and schizophrenia that plagues that movement, constituting a rejection of bourgeois conformity on the one hand while on the other yielding accessibility only to a literary elite.\\"Ulysses\\" is many things: a literary experiment in variety and anti-style (different chapters are written in entirely different voices and forms); a rejection of Victorian conformity; a protest against method, structure and classicism; an attempt to transcend conscious boundaries; and not least, a gross and orgiastic display of literary exhibitionism.There were few contemporary works that dared to take the modernist movement to such extremes. Faulkner wrote similar stream-of-consciousness works but ultimately anchored his writings to a foundation of literary convention that allowed ordinary readers to understand him. Joyce, while ostensibly writing ABOUT ordinary people, never wrote FOR them. He was the ultimate literary snob who, by this time, had grown so infatuated with obfuscation that he would follow up \\"Ulysses\\" with the utterly impenetrable \\"Finnegan's Wake\\".There is something hypocritical about such an outlook: to extol the typical Irishman in writing that no typical Irishman could ever hope to understand; to reject not just established convention, but any appreciable sense of system at all; to push 'writing' entirely beyond the bounds of 'communication'.What saves \\"Ulysses\\" is that, with this work at least, Joyce does not yet go entirely over to the dark side. He goes right to the edge, but only playfully puts one foot over. Despite its calculated obscurity, its see-how-brilliant-I-am experimentation, its auteur elitism, he doesn't quite abandon content for form. This would be the last work in which he holds on to reality, and his decision to anchor his work in at least SOME recognizable conventions allows us to see where he is trying to go.This is a book that is far more important than it is either enjoyable or even readable. Its status as a \\"masterpiece\\" is problematic and misleading: since this honorific is earned if the work is judged by its incomparable technique and sheer audacity--but is undeserved if judged by its respect for the common man. This is a book written for literary highbrows--at times, one almost suspects that it was written solely for Joyce himself--and no one should feel obliged to wade through a morass of such literary contrivance. Those who do, however, can expect to glean many moments of brilliant revelation out of long stretches of teeth grinding frustration."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is, without a doubt, the greatest novel of the twentieth century. Although many great books have been written before and after its publication, nothing has equaled it, or even come close. It is, without a doubt, a true and lasting work of art.Ulysses is an immensely detailed, perfectly-crafted, often sordid account of the wanderings of certain Dubliners around their city on 16 June 1904, principally, Leopold Bloom, outwardly a Hungarian Jewish proprietor of a small business, but inwardly, a sensuous rags and tatters Hamlet, a man who has lost both his religion and his name; his adulterous wife, Molly; and Stephen Dadelus, a clever but pretentious young teacher, Joyce's alter ego. Joyce labored for years on Ulysses, amassing and checking facts and then, with a genius that has never been matched, drawing them all into various symbolic patterns that mirror the wanderings and ordeals of Homer's Odysseus, Joyce's own hero.In one episode, narrated by an anonymous Dubliner, Bloom enters a pub and politely declines a drink offered to him by a Nationalist, accepting a cigar instead. Despite numerous attempts to change the subject, the Nationalist rages on and on, grumbling about foreigners and strangers. Bloom eventually gets fed up; he defends himself and his race, jabbing his cigar for emphasis as he speaks. Eventually, though, Bloom is accused of true treachery against the Irish race--not standing everyone a drink when he is thought to have successfully backed an outsider in the Gold Cup horse race. The Nationalist explodes and throws a biscuit tin at Bloom as he quickly retreats.In Ulysses, this scene is funny, but it is also so much more. The Nationalist is the one-eyed giant Cyclops from whom Ulysses escaped by jabbing his eye with a burning stake. The tunnel vision and terrorism that are but a small part of the Irish race are fought by Ulysses/Bloom as he jabs his cigar at his tormentor. &quot;But it's no use,&quot; Bloom says. &quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life...Love.&quot;There are ironic devices used in Ulysses other than the Homeric one, including the one used so strikingly by Joyce in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (in which we were introduced to the character of Stephen Dadelus), matching the style of the narrative to the person occupying the foreground. As a Modernist, Joyce wanted this stylistic device to be &quot;visible&quot; rather than &quot;invisible;&quot; he wanted readers to develop an awareness of his technique, to identify, not only with the story but with the way in which he was telling it.Joyce had a message to deliver in Ulysses: he sought to tell the world of the people he had encountered; to describe their conduct and speech, to analyze their motive, to relate the effects the sordid, turbulent, disorderly &quot;world,&quot; replete with Irish whiskey and Irish ecclesiasticism, had upon him, an emotional and egocentric genius whose chief pleasure was self-analysis and whose chief preoccupation was in keeping a notebook filled with every incident he'd ever encountered and every speech heard, all recorded with a Boswellian fidelity.Although Ulysses is not impossible to understand, the book does test anyone's endurance as it is filled with fragments of songs, bits of other languages, lists, obscure references and Joyce's stream-of-consciousness style. Idiosyncrasies abound; from the early Dubliners, Joyce abjured &quot;perverted commas&quot; in favor of French-style punctuation.Reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is one way to prepare for Ulysses. In that book we are introduced to Stephen Dadelus and we also have a chance to get used to Joyce's capacity to externalize his consciousness, to put down in words those things many of us would be ashamed to admit to thinking, even to ourselves.Unlike Odysseus, Joyce never returned home. He wandered around Europe, his eyesight failing, with his fiercely-loyal wife, Nora, at his side. It is Nora Joyce celebrates in the tremendous punctuationless passage that ends Ulysses.Although Stephen Dadelus, in his Parisian tranquility, would have pretended indifference to the praise heaped upon Ulysses, Joyce knew that he had created something special and lasting. &quot;O rocks,&quot; Molly says to Bloom, &quot;tell us in plain words.&quot; That is something Joyce never failed to do."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a brilliant novel. And it will find its salvation not because it is a triumph of form--which it is. Admittedly it packs intellectual poetry into every syllable, carefully constructed. But this means nothing today. Joyce was the only modernist who seemed to know that eventually the modernist form would fade and people would just wonder why The Wasteland is so damn hard to read. This book will find a salvation because it is more classical than any other book in the 20th century canon. And because it is a realist work before it is anything else.Anyone who doubts that Joyce is a realist writer needs to take a glance at Dubliners. It is, more than likely, the realist tint of Ulysses that made upper crust elitists like Woolf dislike it. In his failed poet Stephen, Joyce offers a critique of the aesthete lifestyle. His hero, Bloom, is an impotent Jew suffering in sexual silence for the sake of his wife. The spiritual motivation of the book is a near-illiterate woman. There's little for the oversexed anti-semites of 1930s Paris to appreciate here.Joyce wrote this book for his wife. It is his gift to her; fill in the details, ask yourself why that particular day, and you will see how Ulysses is perhaps the most profound love ode in the English language since &quot;The Divine Comedy.&quot; It abolishes identity, language, politics, ethnicity and class in favor of a simple love poem. Read and be moved, but never say it is without content."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's a pity for so many out there that appreciating this remarkable novel requires a broad and good education. A grounding in the classics certainly helps - Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare, as some reviewers have noted. But, in addition, if you've read widely and can catch the parodies of, say, Gibbon or the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, or of journalism around 1900, you'll enjoy it even more.Even then, 'Ulysses' is set in a time and place which have faded - Dublin in 1904 - and there are a lot of topical allusions to the politics (e.g. Parnell and his fall, Zionist publicity for immigration to Palestine), music (operas and lighter musical libretti) and much else to create a world, a whole set of intersecting lives, perspectives and meaning.Joyce was a true polyglot, so the bits of Italian, French, Latin, and rhyming underworld slang, for instance, can strike people as just showing off - but they make the book much more than a recounting of a banal day in a narrow setting.Precisely for both reasons - the allusions which have by now faded, and the breadth of the intellectual experience the book provides - even the most well-read connoisseur of literature would probably gain something by referring, at least occasionally, to the annotations of a book like Gifford's. But once this is done for a bit of the book, it gets much easier not to lean on the annotations, and 'Ulysses' can be read on its own, coming back to Gifford to see what more can be added to fill in the multiple meanings and subtleties.'Ulysses' has to be read slowly. Joyce took seven years to write it, so why not spend a year or two to absorb it? I'd suggest that the right discipline in approaching the book is to read no more than a page or two a day, and to break off and come back to it as often as needed.But then, exactly as some of the reviewers suggest, if you don't have either the background or the time, maybe you should read something else. After all, a top listing by Modern Library or the opinions of others who've thought 'Ulysses' a classic, or the fact that the book is a staple of English literature departments at universities, shouldn't force anyone to read it. And if people don't force themselves to read something they don't like, maybe they won't find a need to call the book or the author names.Yet, in spite of the difficulties of access which make 'Ulysses' somewhat esoteric, it has a lot of verbal pyrotechnics. If you enjoy the sheer mastery of language, there's little to compare unless you go back to Shakespeare. More than that, in the finest humanist style of the high renaissance (Montaigne, and, again, Shakespeare)the world of 'Ulysses' is in the measure of man. There's all of life to be experienced in reading it: tragedy (the death of Stephen's mother, from which he is still recovering, of Bloom's infant son, vividly remembered, the suicide of Bloom's father, Virag, which comes back in Bloom's reveries); comedy (mockery of \\"high society\\" in a hilarious catalogue of names, of \\"high art\\" in a sketch of a dog's barking as if it were reviewed in appreciation of its poetic qualities; sexuality in its many aspects - a quite touching portrait, through her letters to her father, of Bloom's budding young daughter who has just begun to work, but also a nightmarish and hallucinatory scene with Bloom and Stephen in a brothel.Joyce's vision is kindly and humane. He mocks established religion (the blasphemy is quite amusing if you're not easily shocked),or the 'gods' of \\"nationalism\\" ('patriotism' if you wish), and many other '-isms'. But his low-key message is of loving one another, affirming life for what it is, and doing the best one can, with no easy guides.In the end, reading 'Ulysses' is a unique experience. If this review helps even a few more readers have it, I'll be satisfied. All the others should just relax and just read what they enjoy better!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a fascinating book for those who have the patience and time to explore its intricate chapters and themes. Yet, it should not be forced upon anyone as required reading or for that matter anyone under the age of 21. The richess and complexity of the Circe episode alone earns a 5 star rating. Other episodes such as Cyclops, Ithica, Nausicaa and (of course) Penelope are memorable. There were times (Oxen of the Sun, Scylla and Charrybdis) that I just did not have the energy required to continue, but on the whole, a worthy venture.It particularly helps if you can identify with the eroding dreams of either Leopold Bloom or Stephen Deedalus. That is why it may appeal to those who their 20's just making their way out in life or those who middle aged such as myself, who reflect upon what has gone down and what is yet to come."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"1. When you tried it in college, it was a task, a challenge, an intellectual mountain to climb, a test of your literary mettle. Perhaps if you read it apart from any course, as I did, you felt you failed.2. In the intervening time you've read perhaps hundreds of Modernist and post-modernist novels by Joyce's acknowledged progeny, those whose numbers are legion: from William Faulkner to Beckett to Barth to Perec to Eggers to Coover to Calvino to Kundera, from \\"Wittgenstein's Mistress\\" to \\"Wittgenstein's Nephew,\\" from Jeanette Winterson to Louis Paul Boon and Gilbert Sorrentino to Peter Handke. These you have relished and enjoyed tremendously. Why, then, not tackle their progenitor, the master himself, again?3. A book is no longer in any way a notch in your belt; you read for enjoyment, enlightenment, enrichment, a sense of connectedness, all the right reasons and some that aren't.3. You can start with your old paperback, and if Ulysses again proves too difficult, you can toss it aside, no harm done.4. If the old paperback falls apart and you find you're still reading, you can buy a new copy.5. You're not in such an all-fired hurry any more. You have the sense to adapt to Joyce's demands and slow down your reading speed, recognizing that this is like a prose poem. Take five minutes on one given page, what's the rush? The writing is finely tooled enough to deserve it.5. Your maturity allows you to see beyond the Masterpiece Syndrome and the Scholar's Paradise that Ulysses became to enjoy what a romp it is. This is fun! for God's sake. Joyce is forty different kinds of comedian, veering from irony to black comedy to sly humor to sheer buffoonery.6. Each section being in a different style is itself royally entertaining, and Joyce is masterly in all of them. This is a buffet prepared by a virtuoso chef, and if you hang onto your hat, it's exhilarating as all get out.7. The unexpected effect of all this variety is that the three main characters, Stephen Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom are more vivid and real than they could possibly be otherwise. Various sections familiarize us with their intimate habits, personal effects, private thoughts, and the way others see them; and by regarding them through different stylistic lenses, Joyce effects unusual familiarity and allows these fictional entities to assume the palpability of real people.8. We feel great affection for these characters, and Joyce achieves this while depicting them not as highly exceptional, heroic souls but rather average, idiosyncratic and unremarkable people. Even the highly intelligent, poetic Stephen is a typically self-dramatizing, youthful romantic. And yes, though the novel is rife with comic turns, there is poignancy, great and generous humanity.9. The novel is a sensuous feast, the words chosen always with an ear for sound in the reciprocal service of memorable, ultravivid images. You can dog-ear a dictionary (to many disappointments, considering Joyce's flamboyant taste for arcana and neologisms) or not; your workable vocabulary will suffice for much, if not most, of the glorious language. In this regard Joyce is a wizard, a magician unsurpassed by any poet in memory.10. As another reviewer here noted, you will have the urge, once you've come to the last line, to immediately begin again. Keep your new copy handy. This is such a kaleidoscope, a ride of a book, that you'll want to read it a third time, soon enough."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ah, Ulysses. What can one say that has not already been said? It seems that everyone who has read it, and indeed even those who have not, has an opinion regarding Joyce's seminal work. And now, after finally turning over the last page, I hereby add my own name to the long list of critics who have attempted to analyze this novel, and who, although perhaps unwittingly, have also added to the length of the grin on the face of its author--that eloquent literary trickster, that infuriating kicker-of-the-wheels of language, old double J himself.What immediately strikes you upon reading the first few pages of Ulysses is that, despite the cloud of mystique surrounding it, it is only a novel--a collection of words written by one man. It is not, as some would have you believe, some sort of prophetic vision of mankind, a work of art so highly conceived and perfectly executed that it transcends all space and time. No, it is only, as all books are, a story. And thereby it can be reduced to this: a man wakes up, walks around, and then goes to sleep. If you're looking for anything more than that, then keep looking--because you won't find it here. It is simply the story of one long (and I do mean long) day.But the plot is of little importance in this book. What the author wants you to focus on is style and meaning; and there is plenty of both to go around. In fact, there is too much. When Joyce attempts to reconstruct the evolution of the english language in a mock birth of modern speech and literature, he crosses the line that separates amusing people from annoying ones. In passages throughout the book--too numerous to mention in this limited review space--you often get the urge to say to its author, &quot;Okay, that's enough; we get it already.&quot; But on and on he goes, confusing you, irritating you, making you wish you had never started reading this damn book in the first place. So why keep reading, you ask? Because there are parts of the book, again too numerous to mention, that for sheer beauty and clarity of description rival anything ever written. Joyce's portrait of a grizzled old sailor in a scene towards the end of the book quickly comes to mind as a shining reminder that there are rewards for making the long and sometimes frustrating journey on which he wishes to take you.And that, I suppose, is what Ulysses is all about. You love it at times, you hate it at times, but by the time you reach the end you feel, well, something. And no more should we expect of our authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Symbolically, Ulysses follows Homer's the Odyssey; literally, it follows one-day in the life of a Jewish-born Irishman (an anomaly, to be sure), Leopold Bloom.First, whoever gives this book less than five stars does not respect the English language or English literature.Second, whoever picks-up this book expecting to enter the temple of profundity is in for a big shock: this book is, and was meant to be, very funny.Third, this book actually is profound, which is due to Joyce's genius and broad learning, not due to the book's intention, which was to recreate the novel and rival Shakespeare in word-play (both of which Ulysses does very well).This book treads from the extremely scatological (Joyce humorously describing masturbation as a &quot;honeymoon with the hand&quot;), to the very highest planes of human thought, for instance at the beginning of the Proteus episode: &quot;INELUCTABLE MODALITY OF THE VISIBLE: AT LEAST THAT IF NO more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, maestro di color che sanno. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it, it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.&quot; In these short lines, we have a fairly complex argument about the nature of reality; from the Aristotelian argument of knowing things through their transparency or translucence, &quot;diaphane&quot;, to Dante, maestro di color che sanno, &quot;master of those who know&quot;.But don't take it from me: go read this book; and if your befuddlement becomes too great, do what I did, and pick-up a good Annotation--even Cliffs Notes--but don't say it's crap just because you can't read it like you do John Grisham."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Pretty amazing, but such a bloody ordeal at times that it's hard to justify the time and effort required. How many other great books could you read in the time it takes to get thru Ulysses (assuming a serious effort)? It's a huge chunk of your reading life. Still glad I got thru it and can now enjoy some familiarity with one of the legendary works of western fiction.I do think Joyce went overboard structurally. Some of the episodes struck me as too cryptic and obscure in their form, their structural basis too removed from anyything meaningful for me. Such a large portion of the book is entirely unconventional in form and it's so overwhelming and confusing. Of course, there is some spectacular writing, and a ton of great wit and laughs. And some of the stream of consciousness and interior monologue sections are so remarkable and compelling that you just have to read it.Some advise no reference materials on first reading. I disagree and say get the Gifford encyclopedia and try to use it only when needed and to try to resist looking up every reference, allusion, slang or colloquialism, etc. I also used SparkNotes just for basic episode summaries. A good dictionary is essential. Helps to have read The Odyssey (obviously), Hamlet, Portrait of the Artist, Dubliners, the Bible, and more.Man what a beast..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The typefaces and the size of the book are exquisitely reproduced and the design is impressively pleasurable for reading. The only shame is that the cover has been made with a paperback print that does not coincide with (although one cannot say it does not look good) the idea of reproducing a first edition. Nonetheless, this is the most beautiful edition of Ulysses one can acquire in the mass market today."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Hello from this particular corner of the abstract retail market.What a delight to have Amazon recommend the novel I've made practically a point in life to get around to reading! It provided just the necessary final incentive needed to throw all the \\"wait 'til a good time\\" aside and actually just read it, which of course is ultimately how it needs to be read.\\"Ulysses\\" is famous for being \\"impenetrable\\" and \\"unreadable\\", but is far from either. Just like other formal experiments in writing, like Beat era writing, Thomas Pynchon novels, and more recently novels by such authors as David Foster Wallace (may he rest in peace) and Mark Z. Danielewsky, it's not a matter so much of understanding everything and getting the plot as it is of letting the book take you along on its own terms. In the case of \\"Ulysses\\" specifically, each chapter is it's own new formal experiment, and it is of my humble opinion that you are allowed to like some parts better than others. Those who have a problem with it are those who go into the reading with their own expectations or demands informing their analysis. \\"Ulysses\\" is an experience, and one that I think most people should at least try to have to see if it's for them or not (just like skydiving or eating unfamiliar food in a foreign country).And like most media, the things that make it controversial are quite often beyond the point, and anybody who actually read the text finds that out quickly. This novel is about a lot of things, love, language, intertextuality, Shakespeare, Greek myth, Dublin (it does, after all, fall between the proto-neorealistic writing of \\"Dubliners\\" and the intense brooding of \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\"), humour, and life, and there are other repeated themes, allusions, motifs, and forms to give any critical reader much to play with and brood over, but it certainly is not difficult reading and it definitely isn't smut. Go figure.In conclusion, this was a great way to start actually following Amazon's recommendation system, and I'm very proud of myself for finally getting around to doing something I really wanted to do after putting it off needlessly for so long.--PolarisDiB"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many others have written in more words than I care to think about concerning the tremendous effort that it takes to read Ulysses, the worth of this expenditure of your time, and of their almost universal admiration for it. There are a few detractors to be sure and Joyce would be ecstatic that his artfulness has indeed led to his \\"immortality\\" since he is quoted as saying as much.I wish to add what seems to be left out almost universally in the many reviews and recommendations. Everywhere you are told to accompany Ulysses by annotations, discussion/interpretation books but almost nowhere are you told to accompany Ulysses by the words Joyce wrote himself. One of the protagonists, Stephen Dedalus, as well as his father Simon, are not first introduced to us in Ulysses. They are introduced in great detail in \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\". Simon's fall from prosperity to poverty and the impact it has on Stephen/Joyce is crucial background. Understanding that \\"A Portrait ...\\" is autobiographical in nature, reveals much about both Joyce and the characters. You are better prepared to meet Stephen with his superior intellect, education, and his feeling of separation from his countrymen and his behavior if you first read \\"A Portrait ...\\".Many of the characters in Ulysses are introduced to us first in the collection of short stories \\"Dubliners\\". Easily two dozen characters from the Ulysses, some mentioned only in passing, are much better developed in short stories in Dubliners.The milieu of Ulysses, as well as the many characters (all meanings intended) Bloom and Dedalus interact with in their meanderings, are better taken in with these two wonderful works helping to embolden you to tackle Ulysses. Both of them are wonderfully approachable, easily read, and are extremely entertaining, full of the wit and wisdom of Joyce. You are certainly more intimately involved with the evolution of Joyce as he proceeds towards Ulysses with these arrows in your quiver.The structure and basic timeline of the book are dictated by Homer's Odyssey. It is certainly easier to understand why Stephen is Telemachus, Bloom is Odysseus, and Molly is Penelope if you have actually read the Odyssey!The reviewer goes to Symphony Space on Broadway almost every year for Bloomsday (June 16). Find a similar event near you. Ulysses is a monster \\"play\\". It is meant to be enjoyed with others and is much more accessible when experienced aloud. Take the time to understand why people believe this to be the best novel of the 20th century. It will be my favorite forever I am sure.Lastly, I do not recommend Gabler. It is clearly marked by Amazon and other booksellers as by Joyce and Gabler. Be forewarned that there is much scholarship which seriously detracts from Gabler's additions, subtractions, and modifications as not intended by Joyce. That said, I am absolutely certain that Joyce would have enjoyed the controversy tremendously. Read Ulysses in whatever form you can get it but prepare yourself first with the words and experiences Joyce wanted you to have first."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't think its helpful to read Ulysses as a novel. If you expect a plot, or a tale or character arcs, or realism, or accessible prose, you will be frustrated. Would you read the Bible with those expectations? Or the Odyssey? And those books along with Hamlet are touchstones for Ulysses but also the caliber of the company Joyce's great book keeps. So how is Ulysses a novel? It has characters that we follow and whose psychology is revealed to us. It uses narrative to move along story elements through the eighteen episodes (though clearly not chapters so more evidence of it not being a novel). There is Bloom's letter to Martha, Boylan's date with Molly and Stephen's homeless fate. Ulysses uses the novel to both explode that form and to honor it as an artistic expression. This aspect of the book; its subverted novelistic qualities is what gives Ulysses its forbidding reputation as unreadable or as pointlessly obscure.The pleasure in reading Ulysses is not novelistic, it is humanistic, it is to ruminate on the existence of Western Civilization. It is to experience connections to our mythic past and our primal present. It is to ponder where our flawed, suffering, imaginative, humanity will take us as we move through the century beyond the Joyce's creation. More than that it's a chance to contemplate our own capacity for contradiction, ambiguity, creativity, perversity, cleverness and fantasy.Joyce isn't just showing off his genius. He is displaying the full range of it so that we can participate in it and take of it what we can, if we can and be not afraid of not making sense. There are deeper truths than simple comprehension and Joyce tantalizes us with glimpses of what they could be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Vintage Classics is a great version to get because it includes the Supreme Court ruling from Judge Woolsey lifting the ban on \\"Ulysses\\" which allowed it back into the United States. Besides, it also contains the corrected text.It's true that this book revolutionized and refined stream-of-conciousness and it's almost too easy to get caught up on that fact. Really, though, Joyce is doing nothing more in his writing than what people do every day in their lives. When I first started reading this book I re-read over passages but later realized it was better to go on, to follow the certain thought process the character had, just to help realize how complex and subtle some things really were. The book is dense but mimicks how a person thinks and feels within the context of every day life. With that said, the plot is only there as something running in the background so that there can be various thoughts provoked by the action. What makes it a difficult read (this is what the writer of preface to \\"Finnegans Wake\\" said as well) is the readers wanting to piece things together systematically so that it makes sense. Have you ever been having a discussion or been walking down the street when something random seems to remind you of something else completely unrelated? Often times a path may be traced to how or why something reminded you of something else and the same goes with this book. But I think the hardest part is accepting that everything fits together even though we don't understand it.As others have said, the last chapter is worth reading the book alone. The inward struggle Molly has with herself, along with her reconciliation at the end, is absolutely wonderful. Without the initial 740 (!) pages written in his difficult style I don't think I would have gotten as much out of this final chapter. I have to say, I was literally breathing heavily after I read this and felt as though I were feeling exactly as Molly. It's certainly a lot of pages to wade through but worth every minute and gives perfect reason for enjoying a second reading.This is by far the most enjoyable and rewarding book I've ever read. When I put it down I thought to myself, \\"What the hell just happened?!\\" and I wish every book could do the same."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It seems Ulysses touches on every theme experienced in human life. But it doesn't dwell on any of these subjects (or literary style) for long enough to pass judgement.Bloom is criticized for being a jew, but his critics are drunken commoners who are also simultaneously ridiculed and praised. Stephen mourns for his mother but dislikes and avoids his father. Bloom's wife truly loves her husband but she cheats on him.This novel is purposely vague because there are several ways of looking at any one thing and Joyce demonstrates this truth in the various narrators. Almost every character and line of dialogue is considered and reconsidered through the minds of the characters or other unnamed narrators. Joyce is telling us there is no one truth accesible to everyone, all we can do is appreciate the endlessly interactive and timeless quality of an ordinary day and strive to love our enemies."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"OK. It doesn't take a genius to realize that unless you're name is James Joyce you're not going to fully understand this book. There are too many obscure allusions and not even the very well read will get it all. So here's how I tackled the book. Skip the allusions. Yes, skip them. There's no point trying to figure them out because you won't. Just read the narrative, follow the story, trace the themes, and 'try' to appreciate Joyce's style. Then, if you really like the book that much go back and re-read it, only this time use one of the 'guides' to Ulysses that are out there to figure out the allusions.If you approach the book this way it become much easier to read. You'll still get the story, the structure, and the enough of the style."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jorge Luis Borges once thanked Joyce and Picasso in the introduction of one of his books. It was a joke. Borges obviously felt both names had been evoked so many times as to make the mere mention of either of them seem ponderous. I kind of agree with that assessment.Joyce certainly has received top billing by the academy and if your impression of him is, well, reverent, you are in good company. I read Ulysses first because I wanted to know this huge book which everyone talked about with such admiration and then I read it again in college in a Joyce seminar. I have to say the seminar was enjoyable but not altogether because of the author chosen. I think we students and teacher felt like we were conquering a mountain and were proud of ourselves every step of the way. In memory the actual book does not loom very large in the way other great works do nor do I feel much affection for it. The characters and plot are implanted in my brain but rarely do they move about nor do scenes get replayed in my imagination. Perhaps Joyce's work was so complete that it didn't leave much room for any other imagination to go to work on it so Ulysses never became one of my favorites. I don't suppose I can wholeheartedly recommend the book given my less than enthusiastic feeling about it. In fact I think I learned a lot more from other books by less revered authors. Joyce had talent to spare but I think for me he just loads Ulysses with too many apparently ordinary though symbolic so very literary things and the result is that I am not inspired by his art but rather put off by the excessive weight and meaning the work aquires as one works ones way through. So much has been said about the work that it almost comes to the reader with a feeling of having been pre-interpreted for you. Joyce I think contributes to this reaction because he left little room for &quot;interpretations&quot; of his work, its all layed out for you and there really is no latitude for an individual encounter with it. You either submit to its spell or you don't. Perhaps the net result is that in this case more turns out to be less. It can't be penalized for being too much of a good thing so five stars despite all just said.Some have mentioned that this book benefits from being read out loud. Perhaps that is the Catholic interpretation of this very Catholic author. Ulysses as incantation. That approach does have its advantages with this book. There is available a recording of Joyce himself reading excerpts from Ulysses and Finnegans Wake(Anna Plurabelle). I've heard it and it is like hearing a fairy tale written by the unconscious for adults. His voice is musical and he reads like he is summoning the spirit."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Few booka are as gripping, confounding, and ultimately satisfying as this vast novel. A true MUST READ for anyone serious about English literature or looking to grow a few new brain cells. Easily one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I would simply like to verify what previous reviewers have written about the missing text in the free Kindle edition. All the bits of doggerel and poetry that are in the text seem to be missing. I made it through 16% of the free edition, and just felt like something was not right. Not having a hard copy where I am, I checked out another Kindle edition that costs about $3.00. It in fact feels complete, at least so far. The poetry is in there, which really adds to the text. An example of what is missing: early in the book Stephen Dedalus is talking to his class, and they ask for a riddle. He gives them a riddle, which is missing in the free text. The ANSWER to the riddle is there, but the riddle itself is missing. Now some have argued here that this type of text is not necessarily integral to the book. However, let's be blunt. You are preparing to tackle one of the most challenging books in the English language. Don't you want the whole thing? To do less is to not do justice to your efforts as a reader.Unlike some here, I don't disparage Amazon's efforts to put these free books out there. I have read several on an extended tour outside the country, where my kindle is my constant companion, filled largely with free books. Some have had typos, some have had formatting issues. The common denominator is that they have all been free. BUT, to read Tarzan of the Apes for free, with some typos, is one thing; to tackle Ulysses without the benefit of the full text seems somewhat pointless, particularly when there is a low cost text available on Amazon which appears to be complete. One last note, though. The edition I am mentioning here is the Unabridged and Illustrated. When it first showed up on Amazon it said Unabridged (annotated). There were no annotations, and I have yet to see any illustrations. Still, this is the text you want, not the free version here.Update: Amazon keeps changing the name of this more complete edition.

Also, I'm only three chapters in.If you are unfamiliar with this book and care about these things, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For people who know of Ulysses but have never read it, calling it a \\"blast\\" may seem ludicrous. Maybe it is, but I know there are more than a few of us who found this book to be a thrilling adventure without quite knowing why. On the surface, it appears to be the story of 18 uneventful hours in the lives of two Dubliners. We see them snark, teach, defecate, work (half-heartedly), worry, lust, and drink. Exciting right? Yes.Admittedly, this book can be exciting only to a lover of language and literature. The book is subdivided into 18 sections, each roughly an hour. Each section acts as its own writing experiment, some more obvious than others. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not written in stream-of-consciousness. It employs this technique, as it employs many others. True, the last section of the book consists of a 40-page stream-of-consciousness sentence, but another section presents itself as a play where the stage directions help move the reader into the subconscious desires/fears of the characters. I doubt Joyce was ignorant of Freud. And I can't forget to mention that the layers of symbolism and metaphor are absolutely dazzlying.But if Ulysses was nothing more than a writing experiment, it would be dull even to the most erudite of readers. Its true strength lies in its surprising humanity. By poking at the heads of the two protagonists, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, Joyce offers up one of the most complete portraits of the human experience ever put into words. The sylistic experiments are not simply indulgent, but are woven into the fabric of this portrait.Everthing ties together in a phantasmagoric representation of the mundane, complete with a brilliant and frightening climax that seems to fuse every primal symbol of the universe into a single sentence....But I had help with this one. If I hadn't had the professor I had and a whole month to study the book, I may never have had the literary adventure I did. To anyone who wants to tackle this beast, I recomend picking up the EXCELLENT guide, The New Bloomsday Book: A Guide Through Ulysses, by Harry Blamires. I can't say enough about how accessible and thorough this guide is.

ULYSSES is a masterpiece of 20th Century literature. ULYSSES requires a deep knowledge of Western Civilization. ULYSSES is the expression of modern man's heroic quest for meaning in a world without heroes or meaning. ULYSSES has to be read along with a dozen other books on how to read ULYSSES.Much of this is true.But what is omitted by reviewers, time after time, is the warm humor, born of Joyce's compassion for people, that surfaces on every page. From the obvious riddles told to and by the protagonist, Leopold Bloom, to the scholarly puns and tropes uttered by the narrators, ULYSSES can be seen as one great comic book. Listen closely to the words of the one-eyed Citizen in the &quot;Cyclops&quot; chapter. Pay attention to what the soldier screams just before he decks Stephen Dedalus. The dark humor surrounding Paddy Dignam's funeral is hysterical.No, this doesn't mean ULYSSES is light reading--don't bring it along on your trip to the beach or the ski lodge. The novel makes many demands on the reader, as do many of the other works we consider milestones of literature. This doesn't mean you have to read it in a dusty library and takes notes on every page. The book is filled with lightness and life. The fact that it ends with the word &quot;Yes&quot; is the most obvious expression of ULYSSES' life-affirming attitude.Certainly there are devestating moments that wrench your heart: Stephen's run-in with his pathetic father and Bloom's vision of the ghost of his son immediately come to mind. But for the most part, ULYSSES is a raunchy, rowdy, ride that makes the difficult parts easier to bear."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm 14 years old and I am halfway through the book. I took people's advice and am taking it one chapter at a time, and then discussing it with a friend of mine. I'm not really into books, but I love to push myself. After every chapter I need to research a little, and look words up in the dictionary. I would recommend this book to a dedicated reader who is prepared to work hard and use their head constantly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses does not throw out the welcome mat. Indeed, the book hardly seems to notice you as you trudge its Dublin streets with Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. James Joyce spent seven years in composition (1914-1921), and a really thorough and thoughtful first reading (consulting numerous references meanwhile) can easily take more than a year. The entire book chronicles just one day (June 16, 1904).In Ulysses, Joyce further refines his stream-of-consciousness narrative technique already mastered in the Portrait. Ulysses also is written in Joyce's signature \\"dramatic style\\" (ie, fiction that has no author's comments to help orient you). These two traits - stream-of-consciousness narrative and dramatic style - make Joyce hard to read at least at first for some people. And the occasional savage wordplay of Ulysses (wholly tame by the standard of Finnegans Wake) can quickly disorient - \\"con-trans-magnificand-jew-bang-tantiality\\". Nevertheless, once you've grasped Joyce's style it's a pleasure that's always fresh.As do the Portrait and Wake, Ulysses redefines the concept of \\"reading\\" a book. Joyce develops hyper-realistic atmospheres in each chapter through stream-of-consciousness narrative and/or drastic changes in style. For example, in the \\"Cyclops\\" chapter, the style crescendoes with biblical intensity up to a hilarious apocalyptic finale, followed at once by the \\"Nausicaa\\" chapter, which is written in the sentimental style of a Victorian girl's magazine. (Imagine the bone-jarring bathos of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony instantly followed by the theme song to the children's program Barney.) This goes on non-stop till the final chapter of Molly Bloom falling asleep - a chapter of dark earthiness composed of seven immense sentences. The novel's overall effect is Plato's \\"intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere\\". Big claim but Joyce makes it happen.Mark Twain remarked \\"a great book is a book everyone wants *to have* read and no one wants *to* read\\". Initially unwelcoming, Ulysses is \\"a book to be enjoyed over and over again\\", as Joseph Campbell stated. Helpful references are Joseph Campbell's six audiocassette lectures, Wings of Art, and Stuart Gilbert's book, James Joyce's Ulysses.(Perhaps) the twentieth century's greatest work of English fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As an avid reader, I've often thought, &quot;Which book would I want to take with me to a desert island if I could only pick one book.&quot; Others like the Bible, or Dante's Inferno, or the Odyssey have crossed my mind, but in terms of revealing almost infinite possibilities, Ulysses is my pick, hands down. Recently I've reread some of it, but I read the book in a full in graduate school. For first time readers, my advice is, don't be intimidated! Unlike Finnegan's Wake which is not really &quot;readable&quot; by a normal person (okay, if you happen to be able to understand word puns in 27 different languages -- I don't mean to insult anyone...), I find that with some background preparation, Ulysses is very readable. As background, you should reread the Odyssey since each book is based on a corresponding book of the Odyssey. Then, you should get one or two guides to reading Ulysses (Gilbert has an easy to follow one) and try reading one chapter of Ulysses while keeping open the pages in the commentary (may remind some readers of biblical study). In fact, reading this book is the closest I think a non-rabbinical student will come to an exercise like reading Talmud (which comments on the Bible). The experience is infinitely rewarding and will teach you more about reading than any course you could take. The basic plot of the book is not at all hard to follow and there is an abundance of ribald humor. Lest you think Ulysses is &quot;upscale&quot; think again!Let me be clear: this is THE masterwork of the 20th century. It holds up well as one of the greatest of all time. No serious writer has escaped its influence. When you tackle it, you will understand what a great literary achievement is. After reading it for the first time, I become a Joyce fanatic. I'd also recommend both the Ellman biography of Joyce and the even better (in my opinion) biography of his wife Nora. You'll learn lots about Ulysses by reading both of these books as well. Don't be intimidated -- jump in head first. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great book. Reading it takes more effort than most novels require, but every ounce of effort (snd sweat) is well worth it. If you ar e avoiding this book because of its difficulty, don't. It's attainable. If you are having problems I highly recommend buying a copy of the audio version and reading along with it. This is probably the only book for which I would recommend the audio edition, Ulysses was meant to be read aloud. Other usefull books to have handy are Gilbert's book and Gifford's book. Gilbert is the standard, basic interpretation of Ulysses, and Gifford's Annotated lets you in on all of the obscure references in the novel. Gifford elucidates references to other literature and the more obscure references to Irish &quot;current events&quot; and such. Finally, I would stay away from the Gabler edition of Ulysses. The general consensus is that for every 4 errors Gabler fixed, he introduced 6 more. The 1961 edition (published by Vintage) is more standard."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having tried and read many sections of this one, but never from beginning to end, plus having read innumerable reviews, and browsed thru all kinds of analyses of it, I can only conclude that it is generally way over-rated..Think of all the near-unknown great books by authors who are hardly recognized, who have written mythological, historical \\"Days in the Life\\" Novels..OK, so Molly gets excited at the end, and we witness a shaving scene in the beginning, with everything in between. Even as a fairly knowledgable literacy person, it is about impossible to read this without a reference guide. All in all simply very over-rated..However, PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST is a beautifully done book, truly worthy of its lofty reputation, so my suggestion is to read PORTRAIT , plus the stories first, and if frustrated by this one, simply move to something else! There are literally thousands and thousands to choose from!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Overall, better written than Portrait of an Artist, but nowhere near as entertaining. Basically, consider this as a brilliantly conceived book but with the most wholly unimaginative of plots. It's as intelligent as anything produced since Shakespeare, in other words -- but without all the life-giving drama. What it is is magnificent, in my opinion; but what it contains is insipid. Few people will actually enjoy reading this book, although it does have its moments. But mostly it's an impressive tower that in reality contains nothing much of importance. The most amazing construction possible in the center of which resides a pot of total rot.The narrative mainly follows two protagonists: Stephen Dedalus (from Portrait of the Artist, loosely based on Joyce himself) and \\"Leopold Bloom,\\" presented as Stephen's somewhat more reasonable counterpart, as they meander throughout the course of a single day in Dublin, Ireland, shortly after the first World War, although that fact has almost no bearing on the story.The \\"plot\\" (which is also much beside the point) centers around death: the recent death of Stephen's mother and the not-so-recent death of Bloom's infant son, Rudy. In the end, the two personalities come together in Bloom's home and a kind of a reconciliation is formed -- but again, this is all beside the point.The book appears to be James Joyce's attempt to completely reconstruct what the novelistic form can accomplish, and it reads as such. Terribly thin on plot, but thick on construction, like a house whose rooms are empty. The writing is interesting, particularly to individuals interested in the art of writing -- but the story of the day is quite simply boring as hell.The few good moments include Stephen's theories about what many consider to be Shakespeare's finest play -- Hamlet -- and Bloom's somewhat psycho-sexual encounter with a young girl later on in the evening.Distasteful passages frequently occur, where Joyce appears to take great pains toportray man as a whole as a sick, sadistic, filthy, and secretive animal; again, not really a joy to read through.The real problem here is story, not form. The form is magnificent. It can't be improved upon. But where is the story? What is particularly interesting here? That ultimately Stephen and Bloom forge a kind of friendship? That ultimately provided meaning, but I did not care. Will you?Portrait of the Artist has a developing character changing over time; Ulysses just has a single day, no matter how well written about it is. And so one is drama and the other exercise, and so one worth your time and the other not."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Well, Ernest Hemingway thought that Ulysses was a \\"Goddam wonderful book\\" so who am I to disagree. And I don't. Thie is a very nice edition, well produced and has Odyssean titles to chapters in the Table of Contents, if not on the chapter headings. Yeah, well OK but I do like the definite chapter beginnings. As a reference text to Ulysses this is it - clear line numbers and pagination make for a universal communication device between devotees. I wish that mine was a hardback so I really could have a DEFINITIVE volume."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I read this book twice, and it still stands out in my mind as the most creative use of English in the history of the language. Taking the plot of a classic work is not unique, the way it was executed in this book was. Ulysses doesn't explore any of the great secrets of life. It doesn't seek to take on some great social issue. It is just a great work of art. It is difficult to understand, but with such an ambitious work this is no surprise. Any fan of English literature needs to read this."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I could not finish it. I made several attempts, but I could not. A few times I began in the beginning of it, finished several episodes, and then gave up. Then I began anywhere, once or twice near the end, and read again and again what I just read. One of the most difficult books ever written, Ulysses remains on the list of the books that I must read before I die. It presents a dream that I must dream before I dream no more."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is possibly the greatest fictional work of the 20th century. I have no intention of enlarging on that. This particular edition is of the 1961 text, and contains the judgement of the U.S. obscenity trial.

Robert Gogan has treated the original with all the respect it deserves and by placing the speech in quotes, thoughts in italics and story in normal print, has made the reading a much easier endeavour than my previous attempts.So I finished the book....Now to read it again!Thank you for making Ulysses an achievable task. I am very content!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A couple of months ago I wrote a review (below) of a very specific edition of Ulysses (the Modern Library hardcover version) complaining that the relevant Amazon page contained descriptive material misidentifying which version of the text the book contained (an important matter in this case, as anyone familiar with the Ulysses Wars will recognize!). Now I realize that the problem with Amazon's description of books with multiple editions (like Ulysses) goes far deeper than I initially realized, as my review seems to have been attached by Amazon to all sorts of different versions of Ulysses, rather than just the page for the specific edition I had set out to review. In fact, you really cannot tell from the Amazon page for a book like Ulysses which version is being discussed. So, be warned that Amazon's modus operandi can create sheer confusion for works that are published in multiple (varying) editions!My original review of Modern Library edition:Amazon's current webpage description creates the misleading impression that this (Modern Library hardcover) is the text as \\"corrected' by Gabler in the 1980s. However, the cover of the book seems to be clear that this is in fact the 1961 verson of the text. Gabler's edition has some supporters but also some vehement critics. I would just suggest that those planning to invest in a copy of the book take at least a brief look at accounts of the controversy to decide which edition they might prefer. In any case, let's at least try to be clear about which is which!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is a struggle. I don't know where it's going and can't decide if I want to be there at the finnish."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Been reading my battered Bodley Head 1960 edition for years now.

Delighted!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a good book, and a good edition. It has perhaps overabundant explanatory notes, but that's not really a big deal, and they are helpful at times."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One cannot stress the importance of Ulysses. As a book, it almost defies explanation, such is it's achievement, in that it seems to be a story a story of so very little, yet with the importance of Odyssean epic. It's hard to explain. The thing about Ulysses is that it's sheer inventiveness will capture you. Joyce not only places you in the scene via description, the very words he uses become the description themselves, in the shape and texture of them. The book is also a library of allusions, but they can be taken as they are, or decoded within the book itself. There has never been a book quite like it before or since, and it is absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the twentieth century's malaise. It addresses not only the development of Ireland, but the development of man, and predicts the trends of the next hundred years effectively."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"it is hard to imagine exactly what i think of this except for the fact that maybe precisely once more you forget but forget no forgivance that once around is more for twice but you grow with twice"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I must say, Ulysses is perhaps the most difficult to understand book ever written (aside from Finnegan's wake) yet it is pure genius. I decided to read it as my independent book for a highschool english course. I stumbled through it, with lots of assistance from my teacher and found it to be the most rewarding literary experience. Joyce's characters are so complex and three dimensional that one can hardly believe they are not actual humans. It is the most enlightening experience to feel that you are in someone else's mind. Although this book is very challenging, it is something every person should experience before they die. Make a point to read this book sometime in your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having read Ulysses, as well as dissecting it's labrynthe and numerous metaphorical qualities, far too many to go into in a maximum of a thousand words, I can say with all confidence and utmost rightousness that Joyces masterpiece belongs in the league of reverence given to Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. It is without a doubt the single most awesome display of genius in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Enough! To those unmanned by the maze: you are not stupid by default if you despise every scrabble Joyce scribbled. Many intelligent people, including Virginia Woolf, saw nothing in Ulysses and less in the Wake. To others Ulysses is the liveliest and funniest book ever. To the academics who comb Ulysses--agile horse--for the nits of criticism (thereby insuring Joyce's immoraltality), please leave alone we who would enjoy without inheriting the immense debtorship of things better left undone. To those who would deny that Ulysses is the most important (not necessarily the best) novel ever written, the very fact that so many are compelled to constantly trash it is the ultimate tribute to its place. Finally, let it be known that Joyce swore on Ulysses, on the honor of a gentleman, which admittedly he was not: --There is not one serious word in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The only two things that matter in any type of writing are What Is Written (Substance) and How It Is Written (Style). Ulysses is an amazing book when it comes to style. I can not think of a book that compares; in fact, Ulysses is many books, with each chapter written in a style that is best suited for it. I first read Ulysses when I was in graduate school, and was simply blown away by the sheer breadth and depth of Joyce's writing ability. The book influenced me dramatically: it freed me from the chains of accepted modes of written expression. I love the last chapter: not a SINGLE mark of punctuation. Maybe that's nothing new but back in the beginning of the century it was Totally Radical! But with this said, the story itself is very boring, the philosophic allusions inpenetrable and the supposedly comic elements totally unfunny.But for its stylistic brilliance and Joyce's courage/genius, I give it 10 of 10."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce most of been a prankster.

Can the enterprise of your worries only understand the realization of what is read. I shall only read the fore play of descrimination and watch the whirl of the cars fly by."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Random House, calling on English Professors and other literary professionals, declared James Joyce's Ulysses as the greatest novel of the 20th Century.Who am I to disagree?While I may not have too many initials following my name, I'd like to believe that my opinion about Ulysses is valid in its own right. After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor's degree, and have taught High School English. I've also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren't necessarily all that bad.Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel.The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing.The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation.Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce's primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.For instance, take the \\"word overture.\\" At the beginning of the \\"Siren section,\\" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn't write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different.For myself, I neither like Joyce's style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling's success. It's not that kids don't like to read, it's that they don't like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce's admirers.Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a \\"genius.\\" That's fine--they're entitled to their opinions. But, I'm entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Clearly a great book, and not just my opinion. Having been born in Dublin, lived there for 25+ years, I knew the city well. The speech sounds and vocabulary are so familiar and recall specially my father, who knew 'Buck Mulligan' very well.Apart from this, the writing and the structure are amazing.

What I can offer is the viewpoint of an 'average' reader.My edition was the 1922 text, and it was prefaced by the original publisher with a simple disclaimer: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances.\\" And it certainly is understandable and necessary: the text is rife with punctuation, spelling and word issues - but it is nearly impossible to tell which are deliberate and which came courtesy of the type setter.The structure itself is almost more of a literary experiment than a novel. It switches presentations, from interior monologue to grandiose play to question and answers to stream of consciousness. At least that happens in sections, so the reader has some chance of keeping within the structure presented.I read that Joyce wanted someone to be able to recreate Dublin from the text of this book - that's probably a good way to describe the essence of it. While not every street is named, the character of the city through its inhabitants comes through (often more clearly than what the event does that he is writing about).It was a struggle to get through this book on my own, and I think I would have gotten a lot more out of it if read as part of a class or discussion group, particularly if there were participants with knowledge of Irish history and specifically Joyce's background.

I personally don't think that Joyce can lay claim to writing a true literary masterpiece simply because the language is immensely challenging. I strongly suspect that the accolades come in part precisely because of the fact that Ulysses rises far above the language of the less-intellectual novels that grace today's best-seller lists, and there is only a certain breed of reader that will wrestle with such a monster and live to tell about it. Not to down-play the other reviews here (which I think are all valid), but this veneration of Joyce seems to have a slight odor of literary snobishness. I can think of many more modern classics that are written with such clarity that even the less 'intellectual' can grasp the depth of the work...and isn't that truly the hallmark of a premiere author?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was tempted to write this review after reading the other reviews.

The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever?

I first read -A Portriat of the Artist as a Young Man-, which I thought was quite good. I came in with high hopes for -Ulysses-, but was very let down. I found myself not only getting lost with the pages and pages of thoughts Joyce presents us with, but also with some of the dialogue, when all the characters rample on about someone speaking Irish. I have no doubt that Joyce was a genious, his books are filled with game show like trivia. However, I think for a book to be considered a \\"Classic,\\" or, \\"one that should be read by everyone,\\" then that book should not have to be refered to as a \\"Project,\\" nor should it take people a year to read, as some of the other on-line reviewers have said it took them.

Well, the critics have such overblown &amp; grandiose interpretations of the book's meaning &amp; Joyce's importance that they were alternately making me laugh or become violent.But last night I had an epiphany. It occurred to me that Ulysses is the greatest hoax of the century, ranking with Conan Doyle's Piltdown Man. Surely, Joyce must have realized that Ulysses was the inevitable &amp; fitting conclusion to the Romantic Age. Art, cut loose from the mooring of God, had steadily drifted away from the universal &amp; towards the personal. Ulysses is the culmination of this trend--a novel that could only be read, understood or enjoyed by its author.

I have many people from Dublin in my life. None of them ever bothered to read Ulysses. But by reading Ulysses, I knew much about Dublin by my reading experience. I met some members of a band JJ72 who had went to the same school as James Joyce. This is a great book. People who don't realize that are missing out. They just don't know to read.

I have long questioned Joyce's status as a great writer. Not that he failed to display a knack for the pen - indeed, his _Dubliners_ contains work of substantial depth and real stylistic artistry (particularly &quot;The Dead&quot;). My qualm is with his later works, especially the much-praised _Ulysses_. Here Joyce lapsed into experimentation for the sake of experimentation. The final result was a muddled mess, the underlying meaning of which can only be _constructed_ by general readers of exceptional creativity or professional critics with advanced degrees and an excess of spare time.And even if we give Joyce the benefit of the doubt, even if we believe that he was (like Thomas Wolfe, who had, after all, a very patient editor) writing to capture each and every moment of our lives, we must admit the difficulty of the task. Literature must follow some logical construct; it must sort our daily chaos with art. If we follow Joyce's example by stuffing a day's garbled thoughts into a book, we have created only a mirror - something that apes our futility. True literature, on the other hand, attacks our existence piecemeal. And though such literature may never reveal the meaning of each breath or cry &quot;fiat lux&quot; before God or the Void or whatever lies at the root of the universe, it is a symbol of our unquenchable willingness to kick against the pricks, to grasp at unknowable truth. The artist, in carefully crafting - in reaching for that elusive order and higher truth - breathes new and continual life into those words of William Faulkner:&quot;[Man] is immortal not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice . . . [must] help him endure and prevail.&quot;How can our &quot;puny inexhaustible voice&quot; ring defiantly when, like Joyce, we wallow in our daily morass?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am sure you will not find this worthwhile.

His command of the language is masterful and like the truly great writers, the English language is better for his use of it. His experimentation with stream of consciousness in the opening of the century profoundly shaped the literature that followed. Joyce will be remembered as one of the greatest writers ever to have lived: his writing is true virtuosity in both form and substance. He ranks with Homer, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton and Tolstoy. It may help to read this work with guidance by a teacher or professor. If that's not possible, after reading it in college and more recently, I recommend that you read it chapter for chapter with Homer's Odyssey or with a guidebook like Stuart Gilbert's James Joyce's Ulysses: otherwise, the intricate structure of the work may be lost. Bloom is 20th century man: to understand him is to peer into the inner depths of one's own being. Ulysses is magnificent. I stand in awe of this work. I am humbled by it. A more gifted literary genius may never have walked the planet and may never inhabit it, again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This novel was OK, but I didn't feel like it was speaking to me.

I understood about 30% of it. Was it worth it?Yes:1. The inner-monologue technique really opened up for me on a second reading, and you realise how close to reality Joyce's representation of inner thought is.2. The main character is kind of interesting. A bumbling middle-aged man with lots of curiosity for life and sensitivity to others who is subjected to a range of humiliations throughout the day, from the small (being ignored as he says hello) to the highly disturbing (his wife sleeping with another man in their bed). The interesting part is how Bloom deals with these humiliations. Not angry, and not self-consciously depressed - he just continues on with his day and his thoughts, but you sense that these experiences have changed him in some way.3. There is plenty of interesting commentary on Catholic theology, literary theory, and some of Ireland's history around 1900. If you don't find those subjects interesting, much of this book will bore you.No:1. There is no \\"story\\". No drama, no build up of suspense, no climax, no resolution. The focus is not on a plot, it is directly on the characters, and to a less interesting extent on the language. Entertainment is hard to come by, unless you are satisfied by faintly humourous banter.2. Quite a few of the episodes are very self-indulgent. Joyce was a Modernist, so he was trying to play with forms of representation. One of the episodes is written entirely in the form of a song. Good luck making sense of it.Overall:The book is not worth reading in toto. But parts of it are. If you want to read the best of the novel, just read the Calypso, Hades, Cyclops, Nausicaa and Penelope episodes. That's about 300 pages, and quite worth the effort. You can read summaries of the rest of the novel from one of the many sites on the net.P.S. I leave out the episodes featuring Stephen Dedalus because his character is just a regurgitation of all the philosophers he has read.

Only James Joyce, I believe, could adequately review himself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Modern Library (Random House) has ranked Ulysses by James Joyce to be the #1 fiction of the 20th century.Now the question is does it deserve to be called the best fiction of the century?The answer will depend on your background and tastes. If you enjoy philosophy, heavy symbolic imagery, psychology, analysis of religious corruption, drawing parallels between Greek Myths and everyday life, and learning new english words then you will undoubtedly get the most out of Ulysses.I personally think that Ulysses is a great choice as the best fiction of the century because it covers almost *all aspects* of life from romance to racism. And it is one of the first books that lets you really see how the mind works (i.e. &quot;stream of conciousness&quot; technique). But it is probably this psychological aspect of the novel that turns people off. If one can get past this barrier than it can be seen that Ulysses is truly worthy of its #1 ranking.Homer's Odyssey (from which &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the main character) is considered to be one of the greatest books of western literature of all time. It is only fitting that Ulysses fills this role in the 20th century."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those classic novels that gives classic novels a bad name. Modern readers equate the word \\"classic\\" with \\"boring and hard to read.\\" But most classics have risen to that status because they are timeless, powerful and entertaining - Heart of Darkness, War and Peace, and Red Badge of Courage come to mind (all highly readable, by the way). Then there are the novels that have been made famous because of the academic community's inability to distinguish between obscure genius and obscure pretentious pap. Ulysses falls into the latter category.This work has its moments, no question. I actually enjoyed the final hundred pages. Too bad I had to read 900 pages (hardcover version) of intellectual onanism to get to them. Joyce was a talented writer, but trying so stridently to prove that to his readers is just plain arrogant. His prose makes Faulkner look like Crichton. I was able to follow the narrative less than half of the time. Lest you think that has more to do with my intellect (or lack thereof) than bad writing, you should know that I am a well-read, educated person who makes his living as a professional editor. The point is, if a literate audience can't make (any) sense of your work without referring to a 500 page reference book every two minutes, your novel is a failure.Ulysses is a book for people who think a blank white canvas hanging in an art gallery is genius. Fans of Joyce need to read Tom Wolfe's Painted Word before they can have any credibility defending Joyce's &quot;masterpiece.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a great book, it is masterfully written and there is not a word that cannot be explained. The negative reviews for this book are written by people who lack the patience or education to understand it. There are stacks of books written just for these people; The New Bloomsday Book being the best one. This is not an Oprah's Book Club book, it is Serious Literature, and it is unapologetic about it. It's fine to say that you didn't get it or you don't understand it; but to make these silly \\"Emperor's new clothes\\" remarks is a display of ugly ignorance.Ulysses demands something of its reader. You need a real education--not a job-training college degree, but the experience of having engaged the works of history's greatest writers for your own benefit and on your own terms. You need to have read a great breadth of authors in real depth, and you need to have understood them. You need to know what happened in the Odyssey, you need to know a fair bit of history, and you need to have read a wide variety of authors from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Dickens. You need to be well-read enough that you can understand what's going on without flipping back and forth to Cliff Notes.It blows me away that one of the negative reviews mentioned that someone was made to read this book in high school: I don't think you can possibly be well-read enough for it in high school. If you're not a voracious reader, someone who reads quality classic literature for the fun of it, you are not in Joyce's target audience. There's nothing here to entertain you if you can't keep up; Joyce isn't Mark Twain, giving you an entertaining adventure story to divert you if his larger social points go over your head. He wants to push literature into new directions, and he is very demanding.But if you are capable of approaching this book, the rewards are astounding. This book is incredibly great; the language will floor you, the characters are interesting and engaging (to whoever said that the characters aren't developed, what more could you ask for than Leopold Bloom?), and the book is very funny in parts. If you can read it, you'll be glad you read it.And if you can't read it, don't sweat it. Most people can't. There's nothing wrong with that--plenty of great authors are very approachable to less well-read people, and it's just that Joyce isn't one of them. Joyce wasn't trying to be mean, he was just trying to use ALL of his education to try some things that hadn't been done before. Try Dubliners, which is much more straightforward and readable, or even Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Joyce and his readers are not \\"overeducated\\"--and what a silly, ignorant, impossible concept that is anyway!Just don't take this attitude that Ulysses is for boring intellectuals. With this attitude, you are the one being snotty, not the Ulysses readers. This book is capable of getting some people really excited and engaged; respect it for what it is, don't deride it for what it isn't. This is a great book for people who have read most of the other great books; it may not be the great book for you. There's nothing wrong with that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Is Ulysses the greatest novel of the century?Yes, surpassing all other literary endeavors in scope, depth, and intelligence.Is it unintelligible?No, nor is it undecidable, but only pointedly, significantly ambiguous.Why this quality?So that the reader must work as hard (if not harder)than the author himself did when composing the novel.

Why Joyce would set out to purposefully confuse and mislead critics and readers can only be explained by his overbearing, self-absorbed, pretentious nature. A thorough study of Homer's Odyssey and Joyce's Portrait of the Artist - two foundations upon which Ulysses was constructed - will assist the reader in navigating Joyce's murky waters - but not nearly enough to make the effort enjoyable and worthwhile. Stuart Gilbert's famous study will bring the reader further into Joyce's stream of consciousness - but Gilbert chooses to be pretentious and occasionally obscure as well (no surprise since Gilbert and Joyce were collaborators). Joyce was a first rate literary artist - no mistake. Ulysses stands as a milestone in the art form - in many respects the first true &quot;modern&quot; novel (for better or worse). However, for the clerisy of readers, Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist are the limits for appreciating Joyce. Ulysses steps over the line, leading to Finnegan's Wake, which is completely out-of-bounds. Those who do make the effort necessary to understand Joyce's work in Ulysses will come to realize that, rather than celebrate and memorialize the Dublin he knew - as Homer did for the Hellenic world in The Odyssey (creating a lasting vision of the Greek world as the Greeks saw it) - Joyce lays his world in waste and ruin, leaving the landscape in desolation. Joyce's bottom line message can only be interpreted one of two ways: first, that the Heroic Age is so far removed (keeping in mind that Joyce considered the Irish to be Greek descendants) as to be unrelated (if not in opposition) to modern events; or second, that man is incapable of heroism in any form. An interesting interpretation of Joyce's Ulysses is its relationship to the science of chaos, in its complex formation. However, chaos (or more strictly speaking, non-linear dynamic systems) that exists in reality produces incredible complexity from surprisingly simple, non-linear feedback systems. Joyce constructed his work by merging too many source motifs with the intention of creating complexity. In the end, it is the overwhelming negativism that wins out in Joyce's Ulysses, without redemption. Ulysses is one of the great over-praised works. Over-praised because it is inherently flawed, as most great experiments are bound to be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The novel of the century! &quot;Time&quot; Magazine got it right!

YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings. But his commentary I found surprisingly shallow and at times off the mark. But I grow wordy . . ."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What many consider to be Joyce's masterpiece is, to be frank, by no means his best work. &quot;Ulysses&quot; takes Joyce's use of realism and disjointed language to an extreme that causes most readers to lose interest in the story and the messages contained within. No work in which the style causes the vast majority of the readers (even of the highly educated readers) to become disallusioned and pretty much sick of can be considered a true masterpiece. If one wants to understand Joyce's feelings on Dublin and its people (and consequently his feelings on the Universe in which we exist) should read a work such as &quot;The Dubliners.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Perhaps the worst book I have ever read. It is a blasphemy that it ever was published. Its only function is to keep blinkered academics busy trying to wring another drop of meaning from a text already exhausted from analysis.A brief glance through it is enough to confirm that it is precisely the novel you would write if you wanted to become a celebrated author but hated writing, hated readers, and wanted to punish academics. This monstrosity of hideous prose confirms that Joyce had no style and certainly no class. The novel can rightly be blamed for being the originator of the misguided notion that the squalor-and-filth quotient of a story is directly proportional to its artistic merit.The very least one might ask of a book is that it be readable. With this is mind, Ulysses, ludicrously canonised as the greatest of all novels, is a failure in the most fundamental respect. It is the only book I can think of where the reader deserves more credit for finishing it than the author. In the words of a *real* writer (H. L. Mencken): it is rumble and dumble, it is flap and doodle, it is balder and dash."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From the first \\"Stately,\\" with the first letter taking up the first page, to the last \\"S,\\" capping off SPOILER ALERT the word \\"Yes\\" in Molly's monologue, this is a masterpiece that is worth the price of admission. Joyce's words don't fit a standard narrative, but they are worth the time to puzzle and marvel over. Its fine if you put it aside and dip back in from time-to-time. There's no rush. He took eight years to write this book, and traipsed all over Europe re-imagining the Irish soul -- forged in the smithy of his soul for the thousandth time the uncreated conscious of his race. This is it, just ignore the next book; Joyce peaked here."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I found this book incredibly burdensome and confusing. Could someone please decipher the manuscript so a reader may be able to comprehend the message that Mr. Joyce was espousing. Thank you for the consideration. I understand the general structure but the language is convoluted and abstact. Maybe with a little help i will be able to understand the underlying theory."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can say quite honestly that this is one of the best books I have ever read, though I'm useless at placing books in top-10 charts. Most books I've read have something, Ulysses has more or less everything. I recommend the use of notes of some kind, especially for the &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; chapter, but I think people shouldn't be too frightened to dive straight in, it's really not such a big bad scary monster!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you enjoy Ulysses because you want to be intellectually challenged, then I recommend a more challenging and eye-opening book, called, &quot;Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality.&quot; It's brand new! I believe it will become 21st-Century's bible of human understanding in the context of electronic revolution. There are many exciting stories in the book, and those stories are going to enlighten you for good!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Brilliant book, a web of words encompassing centuries of literature and philosophy and its impasse on the overeducated lower middle class, a perfect allusion to a work of great literature (The Odyssey) that this book has matched well. Perhaps this is the first book to transcend the ability of what it has parodied. To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once. It is vulgar, carnal, and base (for its time, that is) and at once completely holy and pure because it has allowed the world to start over. Joyce is the avant-garde. He is our master philosopher and psychiatrist, who wrote the book that will never be shredded."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When read by those looking for prose, they go away disappointed. When read by those seeking poetry, they can't put it down. I gave up trying to figure out what was going on about four hours into the marathon reading I went to at the Irish Times in DC on Bloomsday 1991. The words, though. The words kept me there for many, many more hours (and just a few pints). Imagery started leaping out at me, I felt as if I was hallucinating. Not for the timid, weak, or close-minded, but worth the effort if you want to give yourself up to a good book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many have said that Ulysses is the greatest novel written in English in the 20th century. Technically speaking, it's certainly unimagineable that any author could have put more into a book in this or any other century. But it's not for all tastes. You should read Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist before attempting Ulysses, as the former are more accessible and will let you know whether you like Joyce. Read the World's Classics edition of Ulysses, the notes are very helpful. Be prepared to work at this book. It takes some getting used to. Having read it, I think the effort was worth it. Joyce is a genius (evident from his earlier works). His writing is almost lyrical at times and every word is chosen deliberately to achieve the overall impression he seeks to make. He was one of the Protean Modernists, though, and in Ulysses he takes Modernism, the novel and literature itself to their outer limits. At times, thoughts and actions, reality and imagination all get mixed up in this book and sometimes the narrative line just seems to disappear - but isn't this the way of the human psyche? Don't expect Dickens or a plot in its normal sense. Do expect, after all the hard work is done, to marvel at the author's abilities and to have a warm feeling for Leopold Bloom, to wonder at his humanity and to do this despite the character's weaker traits."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the greatest thing (in all of arts and sciences)ever created by a man. I have read it all the way through once, and have re-read the individual episodes plenty of times on their own. A whole part of my life was defined by the reading of this book. It is no small undertaking to construct a universe. Ulysses is more than a machine, more than an organism; Ulysses is a universe. If you want to read deeper into things (which of course you do, if you're reading this book), then the most indispensible of the commentaries is Stuart Gilbert's, which was written under Joyce's supervision."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Clearly, Joyce's work is a tour de force, an everyman's epic day hidden in grand literary style. The langauge varies from beautiful to impenetrable, with allusions galore. The themes were shocking in 1922, and portrayed in all of life's gory detail. But is it worth it?The time involved in reading (let alone understanding) this book is enormous, easily on the order of fifty hours. What does this steep admission price buy? Simply put, not enough. Their are a multitude of insights one can draw from Bloom's day, but their are none that aren't easier to gleen from other writings. The language, while beautiful at times, does not justify the investment, in my opinion. For a passionate lover of English langauge and literature, this book may be for you. But for the everyday reader, who reads for simpler pleasures and knowledge, you will probably get little out of this book but the right to say 'Yes, I have read Ulysses, Yes!'"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I decided, after listening to an NPR reading from \\"Dubliners\\" that it was finally time I read \\"Ulysses\\"--a book that was not legally available in the U. S. 60 years ago when I was in college. (I didn't even know anybody who owned a copy or would fess up to it!) James Joyce's prose and imagery are breathtaking, and I begin to understand his influence over those writers lucky enough to read him in their youth.However, at the risk of revealing myself as a crotchety old lady, I confess I gave up about a third of the way through the book. It wasn't that it was so much racier than, say, Saturday Night Live or some of the current GOP rhetoric: I just got exasperated with the eternally adolescent whining of the main characters! Been there, heard that, thank you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This being my first time reading Joyce, I didn't really know what to expect. After reading for a day or two, I found that it was too scattered and hard to follow. I don't think it would be right for me to say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because I think it is worth a try. I might come back to it in a few years, but right now it just isn't exactly my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, I just gave only four stars to a book that is universally known as one of the greatest works of literature of all time. I left off the extra star just because I have to review it from my own perspective. I'm an older guy who never got around to reading Joyce back in my college days, and have always figured I should.I love complex books--books that require some effort on my part to get through and appreciate. Joyce plowed ground for such novels. But there are a lot of good ones by more modern authors such as Thomas Pynchon, David Foster-Wallace, Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Barbara Kingsolver, etc. etc. etc. All of those books have a lot more action--Ulysses spends too much time with thought and reflection, without enough happening. Part of the challenge of reading Joyce is that he constantly refers to facts and customs and ideas from his time and place, so understanding requires some historical research, which is a diversion from the enjoyment of the literature. It's much more fun to read Pynchon (for example) because the challenges are ones that are supposed to be challenging. In short, I think it's great to catch up on historically important literature, but don't let it divert you from the many great works of more contemporary authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Tough to be critical of a classic, but this book will not be finished! There is little context and .frankly, it makes my head hurt just trying to read it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"See my review for &#34;The Age of Innocence&#34; - it completely describes how I feel about this book and how unreadable it is."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can't be sure that my rating reflects the author's work more than it does the publisher's and editor's.Notwithstanding, there's quite a bit of brilliance in the writing style and the techniques the author employs to tell the story. Only what story he is telling, I cannot say. For the entire book I couldn't grasp the flow or meaning of the story. Of course I could read for pages and understand the mood and the speaker. But I have no clue what the book is about.And one wonders how it achieved \\"Classic\\" status."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Hard to read, but I'm really glad I read it. It has influenced so many other works. While discussing this book with another friend, he summed it up well -- \\"It's like eating a really, really good meal... of vegetables.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While this text is undoubtedly one of the most difficult that I have read, the sheer skill at manipulating language that Joyce demonstrates is remarkable. The result is a novel that offers a most intimate study into the human method of thinking.Not for the faint of heart, however, because this is a text that requires dedication, as the games that Joyce plays with language and the thinking of his characters often obfuscates the meaning."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Mr. Joyce should be commended for writing a book which obviously needs careful interpretation to be understood. Simple things are not always best.The most important questions which the novel raises, for this reader, is: To what extent is literary criticism a rigorous discipline? I'm sure one can place interpretaions on the way Joyce uses language, and what he alludes to: but how many other, competing, interpretations can one put upon it and can one credibly say that one interpretation is (in any sense) better than another?And if the answer to the first question is &quot;a great many&quot; and the answer to the second is &quot;no&quot;, then is not literary criticism as much a fiction as that which it surveys?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Man, this was a long book! No, really I mean really long. I swear this was longer than any book I have ever even looked at. You know, all of us have jobs, kids, TV shows and sports - who the hell has time to read something like this. I swear this would take me forever to read, AND that's if I gave up watching Pro-Wrestling. No kidding it's really that long.They say when the millenium comes we may need to stock up on necessities like toilet paper, well if you run out, I would recommend this book - not cause it's bad or anything (I wouldn't know I didn't read it) - but you would definitely not run out of paper for a real long time. I hear that it's supposed to be a classic or something, I guess that's cause it takes about 50 years to read. Take my word for it - IT'S LONG!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Every author who has either used the stream of consciousness style or been labeled anything near &quot;postmodern&quot; is probably just following in the footsteps of this novel and very few have ever come close. Joyce shows here that to get the technique down right you need more than technique, even more than a command of the English language, you need a good viewpoint. And Ulysses has many, from Bloom to his wife Molly to Dedalus, every person is detailed through their thoughts and words with enough dimension to make you wonder if this is a novel or a true account. Is it difficult to read? Yup. Most parts you can at least figure out what's going on but some, like the play section toward the middle, at times makes absolutely no sense (and what is up with that, is it a dream or something), but some parts that you think would be impossible, like the massive sequence at the end with Molly not only is nearly compulsively readable but quite beautiful at the same time. It's weird to say this but at times I wanted the book to be longer. Simply put, one of, if not THE greatest novel ever to come out of the English language (though I'm a Pynchon fan first . . . sorry), one of those few novels that everyone should at least attempt, if only to immerse yourself in the complexity of the language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I first read Ulysses as an Eng.Lit. student in the 1960's, I knew I had to become a creative writer. Ulysses is my vade-mecum. When I am having problems writing a novel, or am dissatisfied with reviews, I turn to Joyce's masterpiece and gain fresh hope and inspiration. This is the book to beat all books - the Book of books. I never work on Bloomsday: I go down to Davy Byrnes public house in the centre of Dublin and order what Leopold had. Ulysses is not a difficult work, but it's very funny and very,very human."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is one of the most well-known books of the 20th century. It is highly praised by some, and it is loathed by others. In this case there can be no middle road. If you like a good, gripping story, then this is not your cup of tea. If you like literature for the sake of fine language, then you are on the right track. Joyce is not out to make the journey through this book easy, in that respect one may get the idea that the story of Ulysses is really the story of the reader's struggle through the book. But there are much riches to be found in it. Perseverance is the key. A reviewer here thinks the GertyMcDowell part to be the best, indeed it is the most readable chapter in the book because it is a parody of cheap 'women's' literature. The other chapters have their own strengths, and it is not unimaginable that each reader will have his or her own favorite chapter (for example, Molly Bloom's incredible soliloquy at the end of the book, or the eerie 'play'-chapter). Go click and buy this work of art, try it, and if you hate it, put it away and return to it in a few years. You may find you savor it then."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I not only read this book, I was taught it. It was the subject of my thesis at Berkeley. However, I would not presume to know a great deal about it. I think I will learn even more the next time I read it.Is it the greatest novel ever? Big question. I haven't read every novel, so I can't say. It's the best novel I have ever read.The novel is much deeper than most people believe. I would think to read it on the surface level only would be pretty boring, except for the lyrical style. But the real brilliance lies in his intertwining several allegorical levels with the action (if it can be called that). Too complicated to go into.Suffice it to say this book is about Everything! and Everyone! The universe contained in one ordinary man in one ordinary city on one ordinary day. We are all warriors and adventurers while at the same time stepped on by cowards and beat up by triviality. We are Leopold Bloom. Didn't you know?Apart from the mind bending, headache inducing allegory, what sets Joyce apart from other twentieth century novelists is the way he makes the English language into music. Joyce truly exhibits the shear beauty of words, creating nothing less than a symphony filled with harmony, dissonance, rythym and syncopation, noise, peace, passion, hopelessness, beauty, and terror that you can hear if you listen and if you let your mind let the words pierce that well disguised wall of cynicism.It's a romantic adventure about the best and the worst in all of us.Helps if you read it with the New Bloomsday Book. Hard to make it through it without it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was inspired to give ULYSSES another try after reading Bartholomew Gill'sDEATH OF A JOYCE SCHOLAR, a detective story whose plot is closely tied to Joyce's great novel. One of Gill's characters gives the advice to let the words flow like music, over you and through you, and not to get hung up in the details. Good advice, I found. If read quickly in this way, ULYSSES is more mesmerizing than it mystifies, and constantly exhilarating despite its occasional tendency to exasperate. I fully expect that a second reading will require a full summer rather than a mere week, and demand the use of a dictionary, a map, and a detailed reader's guide, but a first pass without any of these can still bring enormous pleasure.I did find it almost impossible, however, to read for plot. Although the events in ULYSSES are rather simple and are confined to a single day (Thursday, June 16, 1904), so much is told in flashback or in the imagination that it becomes hard to separate the various strands. I found it helpful to refer to the online Cliff Notes after reading each chapter just to confirm what I thought had happened. And, in real terms, nothing much does. Two men, the young intellectual Stephen Dedalus (Joyce's alter ego fromPORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN) and the fortyish Jewish salesman Leopold Bloom, wake up, leave the house, wander around Dublin for most of the day, crossing paths occasionally, only to come together towards the end of the book and part again before the story ends in the small hours of the following morning. But the plot is only one of several threads that Joyce uses to organize a novel that contains as much of life as he can cram into it; among the other devices that shape the book are parallels with the ODYSSEY, the geography of Dublin, an almost Freudian penetration into the psyche of his characters, an ever-deepening humanity, and a large-scale structural organization akin to the movements and thematic connections within a piece of music.Joyce's language is musical too, and should probably be heard rather than read. His set-pieces -- such as Molly Bloom's famous erotic soliloquy in the Penelope chapter [18] that closes the book, Leopold Bloom's parallel fantasy at the end of Nausicaa [13], the Viceregal procession at the end of Wandering Rocks [10], or the numerous passages of Homeric invocation that punctuate Cyclops [12] -- show his magical ability to weave a spell with words and his exuberant delight in doing so. But there is no single Joycean style; one of the joys of ULYSSES is that each chapter introduces a distinct style of its own. The classical passages in Cyclops [12] are answered by long early-British sections in Oxen of the Sun [14] in which no latinate words are used whatsoever. The intellectual legerdemain of some of the Stephen Dedalus chapters is balanced by the down-to-earth barroom conversations of Leopold Bloom's friends. At different times, Joyce uses the language of magazine stories, the Catholic Church, political rhetoric, or scholastic debate. He includes densely-argued prose, free verse, snippets in six or seven languages (ULYSSES is not merely Irish but cosmopolitan), quotations from opera and street songs, and even two pages of musical notation! Wandering Rocks [10] is composed of brief fragments, like verbal snapshots of Dublin at a particular moment. Ithaca [17] is cast in the form of a catechism that addresses subjective emotional issues with the detailed objectivity of scientific analysis. Circe [15], the longest chapter of all, is a masochistic nightmare written in the form of a play script, or rather a movie scenario years ahead of its time.More than anything else, I found myself reading ULYSSES for the sheer delight of its many styles, and hugely enjoying even those parts that I didn't understand. There are many more treasures to be found in the book, I am sure, but this was more than enough for a start!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The reader of Ulysses is forced to continually reassert his perspective and understanding of point of view when reading the text. The narrative frequently shifts in perspective between Stephen, Bloom, the citizens of Dublin and a faceless narrator operating on levels internal and external. Language is used directly in speech and substantiation, as well as symbolically in mental thought and acquires transcendental meaning in grammatical and spelling reconfiguration.Stephen's typological character is self-defined in Telemachus as that of a servant. As he explains to Haines, \\"I am the servant of two masters... the imperial British state... and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\\" Whether this servitude is literal or self-inflicted, we do not know. We know from Mulligan's remonstrations of Stephen's actions at his dying mother's bedside that Stephen has struggled with the Catholic faith. We know from Haines' knowledge of Gaelic over the milkwoman's that there is a level of intellectual and political dominance in place. We also know this from Haines' self admission, \\"We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\\" This is exactly a point where a reading of Ulysses accompanied by a fair knowledge of the political relationship of England to Ireland and an understanding of the rise of Nationalism during the time in which the novel was placed could add a good deal of understanding to the depths of the characters relations. This will continue to be the case throughout the novel as there are countless allusions to the history of the church and Ireland. There are frequent references by Stephen of historical heroes such as Pyrrhhus, Moses and Parnell who were frustrated while trying to lead a certain people out of bondage. The purpose of these references culminates in the important discussion between Stephen and Bloom toward the end of Ithica about Moses Maimonides and the chanting of the 113th psalm which celebrates the escape of the children of Israel from Egypt. These historic and theological references are important counterpoints to Stephen who in Telemachus declares himself not to be a hero. Though the narrative of the first few chapters can be followed fairly consistently without historic knowledge of this kind, in the later chapters the narrative will cease to make much sense when references are cited and counterpoised to create specific intellectual and sociological meanings in the lives of the characters. Once a fact or idea is raised it will surely resurface at a later time in the thoughts of a character and will be mulled over ad infinitum. It is the discourse of the narrative that gives the best illumination into the classification of characters.Not only does Joyce span the forms of narrative from dialogue to subconscious hallucination, but also he twists the structure of language and words themselves to reassign meaning to language tools whose original purpose was to have a definitive meaning. Consider the final functional unit of the novel. Molly begins her soliloquy with the internal declaration, \\"Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed.\\" The entire soliloquy could be labeled as the indicial knowledge which feeds into the question: will Molly bring Bloom's breakfast to their bed in the morning? However, in the course of this long final narrative the question is eclipsed by the question: will Molly continue to be unfaithful to Bloom? Directly after this is established, it is tempting to speculate about the meaning of the narrative rather than cling to the rules of understanding its structure. Before this point in the narrative we have only had a very short encounter with Molly. The most we have gathered about her character is that of an object of desire. This image is both reinforced and destroyed by her final soliloquy. The answer concerning the original question of breakfast appears to be in the positive as Molly has expressed disappointment in her lover and a remembered passion of her vow to Bloom. This speculation gives a more refined meaning to the narrative as a whole implying a cyclical nature to Dublin life. Molly will bring Bloom his breakfast and he will leave on another journey throughout Dublin leaving her to remain in the bedchamber as an image in the lascivious imagination of the world. This seems to be the consensus of overall criticism of Ulysses. But, as it seems the day of Ulysses was the first day Molly had an affair, this suggests daily life isn't as static as it might first appear and people have the propensity to break from their assigned roles. This is especially true as with Stephen, whose role was to find a father figure or a \\"home\\" in the novel, but Stephen leaves him/it when the discovery is made. Creating final and definitive answers to Ulysses meaning is impossible and we should remain aware of this in conjunction with our methods of reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is the second time I've read &quot;Ulysses&quot;. It is a 'hard read' even for me, a good reader; my consistant criticism against Joyce is that he intentionally works to hide his arguments, his characters, and his thematic material behind a mind-boggling wall of style in &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot;, though his earlier works are quite approachable.Too bad. The book is actually quite deeply human, and funny as hell. Bloom is a decent, bungling 'hero', a human like all of us. He's got his strengths, his weaknesses. I see him wandering flat footed in his black slacks like Charlie Chaplin through the crazy, jangling streets of Dublin. The night-town scene is a burlesque with a keenly penetrating, humanistic mind firmly at the helm. The barroom brawl a riot, especially with the dual narrators; the uneducated clod of low intelligence, and the archaic, mythic intonations of the blabber mouthed rhetoritician.He muses on the wonder of existance; how we, living, dead breaths breath. How man and woman come together, making love and making babies. How, ultimately, we are all connected, umbilically to the past through our connections with the Tribe of Man.&quot;God loves everybody,&quot; says the comic, absurd voice in the barroom scene. It is funny. We grin, chuckle at the absurd voice. But it is true. It is Joyce's central theme.Unfortunately, what he's mostly done is kept a ton of scholars busy writing 'commentaries' for a book that is revelant, all too human, and funny as hell... Perhaps even more hillarious than &quot;Catch-22&quot;... but that's debatable.I give it five stars because I happen, through the graces of a good education, to be able to understand it. It is towering and complex. If you're willing to work, go for it. It will take you some time; took me two solid weeks of work. Still, when you're through, there's a sense of mental satisfaction. You feel like you've solved a great logic puzzle. However, don't just read it for themes; try to recreate the scenes and dialog in your mind. This isn't easy, granted. Joyce's style makes it tough.. but do! The rewards are immeasurable. Once you see these characters as real, solid characters, not as abstractions, the lights begin to shine, and you understand how Joyce sees the mythic/ religious shining through our chaotic, jumble of the modern world."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is five or six times the length of most novels, has an army of minor characters to keep up with, and contains a vocabulary that makes prudent keeping handy a good, unabridged English dictionary. (Never mind the German, Italian, French, Gaelic, Yiddish, etc., or the allusions to classical or Irish mythology.) A damned difficult book, it's true. But it captivated me. ULYSSES is by turns crude and sensitive, lyrical and blunt, funny and sad. During Bloomsday, the people of Joyce's universe eat, ogle women, defecate, bet on horses, worry, work, make love, lift their petticoats and wiggle their behinds, attend funerals, beg, give alms, pray, blaspheme and discuss every subject worth breath from the disposition of Shakespeare's second-best bed to God being a shout in the street to sex in all its manifestations. Yes! O yes! I have never seen anything so rich with the texture and feel and vivid details of life. Add to that Joyce's use of stream of consciousness and interior monologue to draw the reader into the tale with the characters (something no novelist before Joyce, not even Henry James, could pull off) as well as blindingly beautiful stretches of sheer poetry and you are looking at magic. Read this. Truly beautiful things can be as difficult as they are rare."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Definitely buy this Jim Norton version. Do not get the Donal Donnelly version that one reviewer recommends -- I followed his advice and it was a huge mistake, now I am purchasing the Norton version. The Donal version is haltingly slow with disruptive pauses between each word, even in dialogue. It's so bothersome -- the reading is like a 3rd grader would read. This Jim Norton version runs over 27 hours, but the Donal Donnelly version runs over 40 hours -- the extra time? It's spent in awkward pauses that break the flow of the language and the dialogue -- you totally lose the beauty of Joyce. Don't make the costly mistake that I made -- buy the right one the first time. Now that I have this Norton version, I can happily sail through Ulysses and appreciate Joyce's supreme writing. If you really want to get through this novel, the audio is a tremendous help to play along with you as you read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"&quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.&quot; &quot;Ulysses&quot; begins with an easily understood sentence, identifiable actions and objects, and little of the puns, ambiguities (well, except for what word &quot;stately&quot; modifies) and symbols (ok, maybe the cross on the bowl of lather) for which Joyce is read, and, perhaps just as often, not read.I think it's well worth reading; in fact, it's probably my favorite book (so far), one to which I return often. I think the key to enjoying--rather than just finishing--the book is that it can be read on many levels. One can choose to decode every historical, literary, and religious allusion, the staggering play of words, and sometimes barely comprehensible inner dialogue. I recommend decoding these selectively--they do add meaning and humor--but to also read this as a kind of tone poem, in which language itself is celebrated and elaborated, with passages of great humor and sympathy. A non-slavish interpretation of the book, enables one to laugh (out loud, even) at the rich humor, to identify with the struggles of every-person Leopold Bloom, and to savor, Zen-like, the sound soup without total comprehension. In addition to Joyce's mastery and subversion of the language, there are larger issues: A liberal critique of ethnocentrism, nationalism, dogmatism, and vanity. Criticized by some as degrading the human spirit (see Jeffrey Segall's &quot;Joyce in America&quot; for a very good review of critical reactions), it is really a celebration of it, finding dignity and soul in the flaws and triumphs of the &quot;common&quot; person.I can also recommend some books to negotiate the complexities of the book, especially &quot;Ulysses Annotated&quot; (by Don Gifford with Robert J. Seidman), &quot;The Ulysses Guide&quot; (Nicholson), &quot;James Joyce: A to Z&quot; (Fargnoli and Gillespie), and &quot;Ulysses, Portals of Discovery&quot; (McCarthy). (All of these available at Amazon.) While I kept the Gifford and Seidman book handy, and think it enhanced my appreciation of &quot;Ulysses,&quot;it is definitely not necessary to solve every allusion and ambiguity. In fact, appreciation of ambiguity is just one of the book's many facets. Just embrace and enjoy &quot;Ulysses&quot;; it is one of the funniest and wisest books you'll read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, this is clearly the most thought out book I have ever read. You go through it, and you pick out any part and say, why must he be so wordy about two people getting a guinness, but you realize that he is putting all the mythical overload into trivial events, and that while it is absurd, it is true. If you can read this book in a class, that would be best, but at least be sure to have a complete guide so that you can get some of the allusions. You don't need to catch EVERYthing. It is very show-offy, a bit like Joyce is trying to just pack every single piece of information he's ever picked up into this novel (or whatever you'd like to call it, I think it is a novel, though). This can be annoying, but it is amazing. And I think that was his point, to describe his world and everything in it, through the story of a common man, whose heroism so deeply embedded in him is overlooked."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've just now downloaded this version (Ulysses [Annotated]), so I can't say how it compares to the other Kindle versions as far as missing text, or any of the other formatting complaints. I can say, it does not appear to be annotated. And indeed, if you go to the actual publisher's site (digireads.com) they do not list it as being such, nor do they mention annotation anywhere in the product description.I know Amazon probably has millions of product descriptions to sort through and try to make accurate. But I'd rather have a vague description than one with added details that prove purely erroneous.I also think their practice of automatically cross-referencing the reviews for different editions of the same book is incredibly unhelpful. Bottom line: this version does not appear to offer any immediately discernible advantages over the free version; save your $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"At the end of one of \\"Ulysses\\" most unpleasantly challenging chapters, \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" Joyce throws out an offhand comment which might read as a sort of gauntlet to anyone who fancies him or herself as a capable reader: \\"Just you try it on.\\"People have been \\"trying on\\" \\"Ulysses\\" ever since, and if my experience is any indication, the result is an infuriating and intoxicating read, not always both at once however. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's terribly self-conscious and clever, serving no purpose except allowing self-aggrandizing deconstructionists and post-modernists a chance to strut their stuff and feel like they have something over the rest of us.I want to be clear in saying I regard \\"Ulysses\\" as a supreme example of craft and literary brilliance, but I don't think it is the great English-language novel, only maybe the most important. J.D. Wombacher said it very well in one of the earlier reviews: \\"My own view is that Ulysses is an example of a writer not doing his job.\\" If a writer's job is to create a novel in such a way as to let the reader in, this is not only a valid sentiment, but a boldly honest one.You start out thinking this isn't going to be as bad as every says. We watch an awkward young man named Stephen deal with his supersmug semi-friend and an annoying British interloper high atop the city of Dublin, in Martello Tower. Stephen is aware of the fact his \\"pal\\" Buck is really a bit of a user, and patronizing as hell, and in subtle, clever, and often funny ways, Joyce lets the reader see how. Then we watch poor Stephen alternately try to instruct a bunch of Anglo-Irish brats and deal with a supercilious headmaster, who fancies himself an expert on everything from livestock to why the sun will never set on the British empire.Then Stephen goes to the beach, and what follows in the third chapter, \\"Proteus,\\" is something that would make any good editor cry out for a rewrite. Joyce noted that his writing skills by the time he got to \\"Ulysses\\" were of such an advanced degree that he could do anything he wanted to with the English language, but there's ample evidence in the finished work that such absolute power can corrupt absolutely.At least Joyce seems to realize this, too, somewhat. He shifts the focus to another social outcast, a Jewish advertising salesman named Leo Bloom who busies himself with the stream of life around the fair city of Dublin so as to avoid going home, where he knows his fat wife is about to carry on an affair with a callow bounder.The results are some of the most affecting chapters ever written, each one slightly askew from the next, but forming a kind of whole that takes into account the whole history of literature, while advancing that history into unexplored territory with stream-of-consciousness narratives and multiple perspectives. Chapters like \\"Wandering Rocks,\\" \\"Sirens,\\" and especially \\"Cyclops\\" work on so many levels they make the head spin, and Joyce the humorist (he claimed one of his principal goals in writing \\"Ulysses\\" was to make the reader laugh) rivals Twain in his humanistic humorousness. Witness this sardonic exchange in \\"Cyclops,\\" my favorite chapter.\\"Dead?\\" says Alf. \\"He is no more dead than you are!\\"\\"Maybe so,\\" says Joe. \\"They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\\"But do we really need the mindgames of \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" or the play-form phantasmagoria of \\"Circe,\\" which lead us into blind alleys and throw enough red herrings to kill us with mercury poisoning? People say you need to read the Greek legend this all is based on, and I didn't, but I don't think I'm alone in finding this tangent strained. When Stephen finally ditches his false friend, he does so off-stage as it were, and it is never explained what transpired. Critics have their ideas why the connection between Stephen and Bloom, once made, is so vital, but it eluded me, even with all the supplemental reading I did.The end result is a writer writing essentially for himself, and for those who will play his games. That leaves out the rest of us.I'm glad I read this book, and hope God grants me the time to read it again someday. But don't believe the hype. Read \\"Ulysses,\\" but don't sweat what you don't get. Many of those who say they do \\"get\\" it are kidding themselves. Better to be honestly perplexed, and humbled by the experience. Humility has its virtues, and Joyce might have benefited from it more in writing this, creating a real masterpiece for the masses rather than an ivory tower to which only he held the key."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is not a book out there that is more frustrating than James Joyce's Ulysses...unless, of course, it is Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. The problem lies in the fact that this novel is such an amazing piece of art that the reader can feel like Joyce forgot all about him. It is almost impossible to read by oneself with it's seemingly garbled maze of words and phrases and madness. However, this is what makes it such a joy to read. Imagine that an author decided to do away with any and all rules concerning fiction and to write a book that was it's own entity, showing you what it wanted to show you, telling you what it wanted to tell you and acting like its own character. This is what Joyce has accomplished with Ulysses. I was fortunate enough to read this book in a class, four months of nothing but Ulysses, and I have to warn would be readers that I don't think I would have made it through without expert guidance. I would advise anyone wishing to tackle this literary giant to gather some book loving friends, and a guidebook or two for Ulysses, and to take it very slowly. Read a chapter a week and then meet up with you group to discuss and puzzle out what you have just read. I am willing to bet that your weekly conversations will be a greater work of art than any book out there, and I think that Joyce would have liked that, would have enjoyed sparking debates and conversation, its probably the main reason why anyone creates anything; for it to be enjoyed and shared. The story line is simple, you have two main characters, Stephen Dedalus, the brilliant but alienated loner. You have Leopold Bloom, a simple man who is as alienated as Stephen, but not for his mind, for his cultural background and meek manner. The entire book takes place over the course of one day in Dublin, and after the first three chapters the entire book simply follows Bloom around during a day when he knows that his wife is having a romantic meeting with her lover. It is hard to sum up such a giant book in a few sentences like this, but basically Bloom is trying to set his life back on track, trying to reconcile himself with his wife's betrayal, and trying to reach out to Stephen who he feels could use a loving family. Of course, you could read this book and not find any of what I am saying in there, but the beauty of Ulysses is that I would love to hear what it is that you found in this novel as much as I would love sharing what I found."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There's probably not much about Ulysses that hasn't already been said, but having just spent well over a month of my free time struggling through this book I thought I would put my two cents in.In my opinion, Judge John M. Woolsey's synopsis in his 1933 ruling on the work's obscenity charge sums up the book almost perfectly. It is indeed an astonishing achievement and a literary tour de force. It is, as he says, by turns brilliant and dull, intelligible and obscure. And of course it is unprecedented in its exceptionally honest treatment of sexuality.I really can't agree with his contention, however, that every word of the book is purposeful in its contribution to the whole. In some ways, particularly the incredible realism of its characters' interior monologues and its ability to make a particular place and time come alive for the reader, Ulysses is perhaps the most well-written novel I've ever read. In other ways, namely Joyce's frequent inability to resist showing off his erudition and mastery of language, it is one of the worst and often cries out for editing. While there's not a word of Hades, Wandering Rocks or Penelope I would change, some other chapters (e.g., Cyclops, Oxen of the Sun, and Ithaca) become downright tedious despite their conceptual ingenuity and flashes of brilliance. Additionally, the book is sometimes cloyingly self-referential, plausibility too often bows to symbolism, and many of Joyce's allusions are so esoteric or ambiguous that they can only serve to distract the reader. While it has faults (and despite the book's deification in literary circles, I can't see any other way to characterize many of its quirks and stylistic excesses), Ulysses is nonetheless well worth the exceptional effort required to read it due to its penetrating and poignant illumination of human desires, delusions and relationships. As an added plus, at many points it is nothing less than hilarious.Personally I found it very helpful to listen to a recording of the text on audio to get through the book (the version narrated by Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie published by Classics on Cassette is extremely well done), as twice previously I had attempted to read it without such support and couldn't get beyond six or seven chapters. I would also suggest having at hand an unabridged dictionary, a book of scholarly annotations, and especially Harry Brimes' Bloomsday book for those passages where, despite your best efforts, you still can't figure out what the heck is going on (occasionally Brimes can't either).Four stars may seem niggardly for a masterpiece, but I'm comparing it with King Lear and The Brothers Karamazov. If you're an Irish Catholic literary scholar with doctorates in western religion and etymology and an upcoming sabbatical, by all means add half a star."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"On June 16th, 1904, a young James Joyce met his future wife for the first time. Ten years later, in 1914, he began what would become one of the greatest epics of modern language, Ulysses, setting the entirety of the events within that one special day shared by him and his wife, offering it to the world in an alternately joyous and tragic, comical and dense tribute to life and to living.The story cannot be summarised without reciting the book itself, an exercise that goes beyond the scope of this review. Suffice to say that the novel follows Leopold Bloom as he makes his way about Dublin, and Stephen Dedalus as he wanders from place to place. The two eventually meet, and the book finishes. Then again, that description is like saying Moby Dick is about a whale and Gravity's Rainbow is about a rocket. Technically true, but how much detail and texture do you miss with such a soul-less description?Ulysses has since grown beyond itself, garnering a reputation that scares away most readers. Considered an 'ivory tower' book, a 'professor's dream', it should be admitted that there are very difficult sections. Whole chapters - most of which are quite long - can be extremely tedious to read, becoming bogged down in medical or legal terms which serve mostly to confuse and distract the reader. But then there are chapters of amazing insight, clarity, wisdom and skill - thankfully more than there are difficult. The Cyclops chapter is sheer genius, a 120-page play that moves from bizarre to hilarious to sublime and back again. By itself, it is almost worth the price of admission, but there are many more that are just as amazing. The question and answer chapter of Ithaca is sheer genius, and Molly's monologue, right at the end, while texturally dense, flows and runs like a river.The language used ranges from flowery to technical to simplistic to overly complicated to deliberately obscure to beautiful. 'Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide' is beautiful, whereas 'What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?' is difficult. Of course, there is always the famous 'The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit', quite possibly one of the most gorgeous sentences written by man.Another interesting technique Joyce uses is his willingness to deny the luxury of perfect sentence structure or grammar to better convey the mood of the characters, or to greater achieve those wonderful sentences. He merges words, removes words, adds words, mirrors sentences within themselves, juxtaposes letters, words, paragraphs, all in an effort to create passages of absolute delight. Tens of pages will fly by, each one filled with wit, insight, beauty, depth. At times, it is safer to simply let go and trust that Joyce knows what he is doing, that you will be taken where you should go.However. This book can be very difficult, as I said above. Fifty pages of dense, verbose prose with little to no indication of what is happening, who it is happening to, or what sort of reference can be applied so as to make sense of it in the greater scheme of the novel, is common. These parts can be tricky to get through, but I strongly advise you to continue. Happily, the first few chapters are very easy, and very beautiful. It is only around the 210 page mark that Joyce ramps up the difficulty, which culminates in the Wandering Rocks and Siren chapters. But bear with it, and enjoy it for what it is.In the end - and I hope I have made this clear - the novel is a difficult one, requiring a lengthy time commitment, but in the end, the efforts are more than rewarded. Having just turned the last page, closed the book and put it aside, I am itching to take it up again, to follow Bloom and Dedalus once more through their beautiful, wonderful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I bought theUlysses (Gabler Edition)edition of this book recently as we were reading Ulysses as part of an online book club. The advantage of that edition is that it is popular edition and also has line numberings so that as part of a group you can immediately locate a piece of text.Then I discovered that you could get a free Kindle edition, so I downloaded the free Kindle for computer app from Amazon, and got this edition. Later I bought a Kindle.I am somewhat surprised at the one star reviews of a free product, the leading one of which is based on a flawed premise, lack of comparison to an actual published text.This reviewer does not compare the Kindle text with an actual book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, finding inconsistencies and saysUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] is different. Ulysses annotated is not Ulysses the book, it is a reference book about Ulysse, and if you imagine it, it operates like a phrase dictionary and explains the references and allusions in the book, but it is not the book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, not a direct comparison with an actual copy of the book, and comparison with an entirely different book. Really?I have compared this with the Gabler and picked 20 lines at random from the book, and then searched the Kindle edition, and read the surrounding passages. Except for one case in the Gabler edition which has musical notation and lyrics to a song the text was 100% the same.Obviously, there will be inconsistencies between versions of a book that has many editions. That does not mean that just because this edition is free and has minor inconsistencies it is worse than other editions. Nor does it mean that large amounts of text have been deleted because it's free. No, it's based on an actual text. In fact Joyce edited and added bits and pieces to the text over the years much to the chagrin and frustration of his publishers, so you can expect minor variations between editions, yet they may be 95-99% similar.In fact, there are certain advantages to having the Kindle edition. If you have ever read a book and you are trying to remember something about a character, you can type in the characters name, and you will immediately get all the references in the book. If there is a word you do not understand fully, by pressing a button you can immediately get the full meaning of the word. You can check for popular highlights, and it willl tell you how many people have highlighted which passage. For example \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible.\\"There are certain passages that no dictionary will help you with, and that is why you may need a companion book, such as Ulysses annotated, which explains the many allusions, whether to Latin, parallels with the Bible, with the Odyssey which this story loosely parallels, to Latin, British Rule, historical context, local maps, Hamlet, mythical search for the missing father, Shakespeare and the Bible.The further you get into this book the better it gets.At once this book is inpiring yet challenging, sometimes perplexing yet ultimately rewarding. Full of inventive wordplay that sometimes defies instant comprehension. I have read entire pages that turn out to be word salad at first. Every chapter has a different narrative style, such as inner monologue, narcissistic, catechism, stream of consciousness. Sometimes this book is brutal to read, sometimes a joy. I can understand why this book is so influential, and the words nibble at the edge of your consciousness forcing your mind to expand itself. This book has changed the way I think about writing, as I have never seen som many different narrative devices used in a single book before. The final chapter with Molly Bloom in bed, with its runon sentences is simply hilarious.I encourage you to get this edition. Why not? It's free. Free to buy. Free to read. Free to enjoy. The Kindle format gives you advantages over people who have read it in the past, and offers interesting, new, and quicker ways of navigating the text.And you can go get free online chapter summaries of chapters to speed your comprehension.I hope you found this review helpful."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Looking at the sample chapters of the 99c MobileReference edition, I notice an entire missing paragraph (after \\"and chanted:\\").

But if you throw aside your expectations of what makes a book great and just read the words as you would the people, places, sights and sounds that trigger your thoughts during the course of a normal day, then you will be amazed.In Ulysses, James Joyce uses his superhuman vocabulary and literary knowledge to relate a day in the life of a couple Irishmen (Stephen Dedalus and his friend, Leopold Bloom) and the people with whom they interact. Joyce's words are abnormally sophisticated, yet one never gets the feeling he is simply showing off. While his writing style is often referred to as stream-of-consciousness, it is clear that every word is appropriately placed and deeply thought out. As Ulysses meanders along through its day, the objects that enter the periphery of the protagonists triggers emotions and thoughts that lead to: poems, songs, theological and political discussions, laughing, shouting, incoherent noises, etc. The novel ranges from sublime to aggravating, but that is only because it is so true to its form. How many times in a normal day, if we were to stop and ruminate upon what we were just thinking, would we then think, &quot;What was that?&quot; But then it's quickly on to the next interaction destined to spark different emotions, thoughts, ideas, etc...It is impossible to sum this book up. It follows no plot or pattern other than that it is simply 1 day. A few people... 1 day.Reading this book reminded me at times of the Simpsons episode where Homer is seen watching an episode of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. &quot;Brilliant!&quot; Homer remarks, but then quietly to himself, &quot;I have no idea what is going on here.&quot; While I often found myself in Homer's predicament while reading Ulysses, I was always able to appreciate Joyce's writing, even if the individual words were all I understood. For that reason, I plan on reading this book again several years from now to see what life has taught me that might expand my understanding of Joyce's beautiful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Typical straight-from-Project-Gutenberg textfile conversion: no ToC, no italics, no chapter breaks.

Very well produced, even to the extent of reversing the audio in Circe where 'The Voice Of All the Damned' proclaims the mighty: Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rof, Aiulella!Music tracks introduce each section, with songs appropriately chosen for the episode.

When I got to the end, (and not until then) I realized that this book is Joyce's search for God amid everyday life in Dublin. This God(the father) is one who is caring, concerned, shows consideration, and is also a cuckold. One of the greatest moments of my reading career was the question and answer session at the end of part 2, and it is very much worth the journey through the streets of Dublin of June 16, 1904."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Another reviewer complained about &quot;Ulysses, the Corrected Text&quot; as a rewrite by Danis Rose; it is NOT. The Bodley Head (London, 1984) edition of this name was edited by Hans Walter Gabler and has a preface and recommendation by Richard Ellmann, the foremost biographer of James Joyce. This edition is a significant contribution to Joycian publishing and a &quot;must&quot; addition to any complete library of Joyce's works, alongside any of the &quot;original&quot; text works. Joyce's manuscript as sent to the printers was difficult to read (it had many handwritten corrections of corrections and border notes which the original publisher could not decide whether he was supposed to use), and Gabler merely did a highly-regarded job of reconsidering original manuscript materials and other sources. The first- or second-time reader of Ulysses likely would not notice the differences in the text, but Joyce scholars and Ulysses fans regard this as an important reconsideration and an essential work. Most editions of Ulysses use an identical numbering system for sections and paragraphs so that comparisons between editions are easy to make."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How can anybody short of a literary genius review this book?

I just finished it (it's June). Phew!! Yes, it's a hard nut to crack -- you can see why so many people give up in rage and frustration (and unfairly express their resentment at being unable to understand by writing vitriolic reviews). And yes, if you're going to climb Mount Everest (or maybe K2 -- _Finnegans Wake_ appears to be Everest) you need an oxygen mask and a team -- get _The Bloomsday Book_ and _Ulysses Annotated_. But to say it was well worth it would be a giant understatement.I'll try to say in a nutshell what's so great (for me) about it: _Ulysses_ is the incredibly poignant story of one ordinary man's attempts to reconcile himself to his failures as a father, a husband and a human being. At the same time, through its rich description of Dublin (which comes to stand for every human community, everywhere); through a staggeringly complex web of historical, metaphorical and philosophical associations; and through Joyce's use of words, in which the English language _itself_ becomes a character in the novel, _Ulysses_ becomes about much, much more than a day in the life of one man -- it becomes a hugely cosmic-comic and very personal oddyssey through the readers' soul, in which every pretension or fantasy one could possibly have is brought to light and then smashed. Does this sound dismal? It isn't -- it's hilarious; and for those who've made it through, the ending words of Molly Bloom's soliloquy and her final &quot;yes&quot; are the sparkling, intoxicating wine of possibility -- heartbreakingly bittersweet, moving and transcendent."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Let me first start off by saying I love the book.

Just as well: throw my comments about the book away, and decide for yourself (because that is just what I said).

But, after having read it twice, a nagging doubt remains: is it a life-enhancing achievement ? Like the best of Shakespeare or Tolstoy. Does it achieve universality beyond obvious plodder-type references harking back to Homer ? Which are pros and cons ? Among pros, I'd say that most important are exuberant playfulness of language and gorgeously hilarious stampedo of comic banal incidents. Joyce is truly great comic writer. As for his status of the progenitor of experimental prose, I'm more sceptical. The stream of consciousness technique remained confined mostly to English-language literatures; what's more objectionable, it doesn't seem to possess potency of meditative-reflective approach of a Conrad or Proust, nor direct prophetic insight of a Dostoevsky or Lawrence. There is something arid and self-defeating in the very nature of Joyce's endeavor. Among cons two come to mind immediately: a scholastic network of cross-references that serves as the underpinning of the entire structure-something that impresses a naive innocent reader as an erudition beyond, beyond...but, actually is an exercise in a dated and dead world view ( and even this is far from being impeccable-Joyce's reading in philosophy is superficial; he confuses Duns Scotus and Johanes Scotus Erigena ); the other con is the all-pervading banality of virtually everything. As if a double perspective is achieved simultaneously: Joyce's work is as detached as possible, yet, its all-devouring meaninglessness betrays the author's mindset. And this mindset I would call as subjective and life defeating as any imaginable. Conclusion: Joyce's inventiveness and humor produced a great book. At the same time, his aesthetic pseudoreligion and something I could call only a soulless Weltanschauung prevented him to create a summit like &quot;A la recherche&quot;, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; or &quot;The Devils&quot;. A great novel. Among the most influential. Not among the greatest."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Although I enjoy using Anthony Burgess', &quot;Joyce Prick,&quot; as a walking guide through Ulysses, it's not a difficult read. However, the best part about Ulysses is that no matter your view, no one will ever agree with it!Ulysses is best understood, in my opinion, by the male aged 35 to 50. It is the story of Bloom's passage into middle age. His last bit of memory, physical or mental, of his youth. He is passing on to new memories, but allows for one final mental seduction.In the meantime, his wife, Molly, is also passing. She has allowed herself, in her own final touch with youth gone, to be physically seduced.In the end, Molly and Bloom rejoin. Life goes on; youth is dead.I guess that I will always love this book, however, I will always be amazed at how simple it is and how much has been written analyzing it. But then, it is no less than perfect"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes because you never read it since college with the pointyheaded old man but you can read it again it is better every time yes one day in Dublin is infinitely interesting with Joyce yes it has everybody yes tired young Stephen tired old Bloom and plain tired Molly yes it does everything from the newspaper to the bathroom yes it is complicated but better every time you read you must buy it say to yourself yes I will buy it yes I will Yes"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Aside from the other flaws pointed out, it doesn't have any chapter breaks. If Amazon doesn't want a good edition available for free for the Kindle, that's their business, but that this one comes up first on the search page sullies the reputation of the Kindle, of free books available over the Internet, and of Ulysses itself. (I'm not going to say Ulysses isn't a challenging read, but it's an impossible one here.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When one looks at Ulysses by James Joyce without prior knowledge, one comes in with pre-conceptions of what should be expected. They find it difficult and confusing and without purpose. Some say it is an exercise in intellectually masturbatory narrative, some say it is just a terrible work completely without merit. To those I say, look at Picasso, van gogh or any other artist for that matter and you will gain an appreciation for the work. Let me explain myself.Joyce was quoted as saying something to the effect of \\"If Dublin disappeared off the face of the earth, this book would be able to recreate it down to the last detail\\" now while that is a tad hyperbolic, he illustrates the main point of the novel. To paint a picture of dublin. Imagine a landscape painting be it an urban, idyll, or what have you. You don't necessarily approach it with a plot in mind, you simply enjoy the sites as they are. That is what this book is. Joyce's methods of achieving it are what separate this from the other works of any literary genre.It is a painting in the truest sense of the word. Each chapter forms a kaleidoscope of narrative, point of view and immersive yet alienating sensory details. This hodgepodge of narrative styles can infuriate or delight as it paints with immense detail a single day in the life of one Leopold Bloom.To be sure there are chapters that are extremely opaque and less sensory based than others, but this is a way of enhancing the narrative differences of each chapter. Every chapter is a microcosm of narrative which ultimately creates the macrocosm of the work as a whole. Take for example chapter 15: Circe, this is written as a script. Chapter 17: Ithaca a catechism, Chapter 18: penelope is the purest stream of consciousness ever written.And to those detractors who argue that plot is important, keep in mind not all literature has the intention of telling a story.So I leave you with this. This book is difficult, I'm not going to lie, the first read will be infuriating as almost a guarantee, but with a mindset of Painting over story you may perhaps enjoy it as such and find this review at least somewhat helpful"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is specifically for the Naxos AudioBooks production of Ulysses. Nowhere on the Amazon website (although I have now requested this change) does it say that this audiobook is ABRIDGED! The quality of the performances are so far outstanding, but it was disconcerting, to say the least, to be in the middle of Book I and suddenly be transported to Book IV. I purchased the audiobook to help me as I read through the book itself, so to that extent the audiobook abandoned me just when I needed it most, as Book III is rather arduous. It is still worth it to me since the only other audiobook is going for almost $150, and as I'm reading the book in its entirety I will not be limited to the abridged story. However, I was disappointed and wanted to give others a heads up."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"this is such a wonderful book writen by the one of the most talented writers to have ever lived. this review, i think, is directed to the people who are interested in reading it...if you want to read ulysses, don't. instead find out everything you can about it, then read it. no one gets through it the first time grasping what is going on. also, feel free to jump around, the more readable sections include circe(written like a play), ithica (question and answer) and nausica (style overload), and peneolpe is just so beautiful that it's a good place to start also because there's no punctuation it's a good intro in the respect it shows you how you have to work to read the stream of consciouness sections but once you catch on it is a breeze.the stuart gilbert study is fascinating also and a great help...he knew joyce and translated the book into french, was among the first to identify the major structures and had his ideas confirmed by joyce personally.you've got to want to read this book, which i think is great, also i feel like regardless of who you are, by the third read it's fairly clear, by the fourth you've got it like understanding people speaking another language and that being understanding not translating in your head. some sections are still difficult; aeolus is boring no matter how many times you read it and oxen in the sun is so packed with slang the action is difficult but the language is entertaining...etc. but a great example of things buried in the book is there is plenty to suggest that in the forementioned oxen in the sun section that bloom unwittingly gives a condom to a man who most likely uses the very same condom to deflower bloom's own daughter...the book is loaded with the stuff.it helps if you know irish history. don't be afraid to read it out loud, it'll help.and what else?those people who say this is unreadable are people who haven't read it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This work is tantamount to induced consciousness, of course but really worth the effort.

The trick to enjoying this one, if you can use a verb like enjoying to describe it, is to simply let it flow and seep into you. It is like Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon in that, there's so much knowledge stuffed into the narrative you'll never be able to grasp every word... And that's okay. You don't have to. It would probably take you decades anyhow. Just sit back and take your time with this one and somehow, it will become clear to you, the same time it's confusing the hell out of you. A definite challenge between love and hate and both of them will win out by the end. But you will feel rewarded when you're finished, if only to say: &quot;Yeh, I actually got thru the whole thing... Finnegan's Wake, which is really mindboggling, may be more of an experiment but this book is the more satisfying work. Don't let it discourage you.

The issues of missing text are fixed at least in a spot-check of the opening chapter. I just checked with a new download via the PG website of a 1.72 mb file. But, as of today, you have to do it yourself, not via the instant function here. (Amazon's site is not aligned to do this as of this date of writing. I note as I write this Amazon posted a note that the Kindle free [aka Project Gutenberg] text is not available and that they are looking into reported problems as an \\"item under review.\\")I had first downloaded the free file a few weeks ago (pg4300.mobi @ 1.7 mb) to my Touch. I found that in the the Martello scene, for instance, \\"The Ballad of Joking Jesus\\" sung memorably by Malachi was missing. Other ditties, such as \\"I am the boy...invisibility\\") indicated by indentation in standard form (even in the e-book online via Gutenberg-dot-org) were missing as well from the Kindle version of the free text. In other places, if not surprisingly, spacing was off. I assume later chapters may have lacked the graphic designs that the novel relied upon as to punctuation and page presentation. The spacing looks a little better in the updated download. Let's hope these matters have been corrected, thanks to Gutenberg's team of volunteers for a valuable service after so many decades of copyright control beyond reasonable limits exerted by the author's estate against creative uses.One challenge, if not to be blamed on any version of Joyce's text as published originally. The e-books come in parts I (Stephen), II (Bloom) and III (Molly). So, the chapters attributed later on are not included, but they may be on electronic resources that are not the public domain one, as added value. I cannot figure out on a Kindle how to make bookmarks and label them as to chapters--I did this on an Aldiko version on my phone.Finding gratis a public domain (finally!) version despite its drawbacks is wonderful. I cannot fault those who prepared a difficult text for an e-book for free. There are other versions for sale that are nicer, and they merit their own reviews by others, but Amazon heaps all media for many texts in the public domain together, so rating the medium is jumbled with the content itself, no easy solution.Making e-books off of a notoriously unstable ur-text that's long tested the patience of any Joycean editor already isn't easy. So, the bulk of the novel's intact for reference, concordance work, and looking up passages or phrases nearly instantly. It can always be compared to the Gabler or Random House eds., of course. It's great to have my favorite novel even in its rawer form, to look up or dip into on a Kindle."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Enough good things have been said about Ulysses, and most of them are true. You should benefit greatly from reading such a wondrous masterpiece. But if you are serious you should shy away from the Gabler Edition. It is widely considered among Joyce scholars, and even some of Gabler's original advisers, that he took way too many liberties when producing this edition. He made many noted blunders and errors. In essense, Gabler damaged the script with his misguided sense of editing.I have read the Gabler Edition, and really didn't know better at the time. It was still brilliant and I loved it, but I defer to the experts. I now own the Random House edition, and have skipped around to reread parts of it. Supposedly the Penguin and Everyman's Library editions are worthy reprints of the 1960 edit. There is a forthcoming edit from Norton that is anticipated as becoming the new definitive edit, but they have been delayed in getting it out. Be careful about which edition you get. Some are reprints of the original edition, which contains many errors. Go with Penguin, Everyman's or Random House for now.Also, this Vintage edition is horribly made. The book binding frayed and the book fell apart after a year; the pages all fell out (some individually, but mostly in clumps of 10 to 100 pages)and I was desperately and pathetically trying to keep them together and in order (I was only trying to hold on to the book because of my extensive margin notes). After, a while I just gave up and vowed never to buy Vintage again.I plan on rereading Ulysses, but in a different edition than Vintage. I read it along with The New Bloomsday Book by Harry Blamires. It is an extremely helpful and well regarded commentary/guide."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Don't read \\"Ulysses\\" because of what other people say about it or how highly it's usually ranked among great 20th-c. novels; if you don't like it, move on to something else. But if Joyce intrigues you, well, you've got a lifetime to sort it all out. I've read the book several times and it's never the same experience--Joyce is always many steps ahead of me. When I first read \\"Ulysses\\" as an insufferable young man of 19, I kept thinking, \\"Why does he write this way?\\" (Along with, \\"Why am I not 'getting' it?\\") (Because I was only 19, I guess, and I tried to plow through it quickly so I could tell everyone that I \\"read 'Ulysses'!\\". Ouch.) And talk about slow reading! Let your eyes melt into a paragraph or a sentence. Let it sink in! Perhaps the ideal reader of Joyce is the one who memorizes the entire thing. Let me explain: Everything in \\"Ulysses\\" is interrelated. I'll bet there aren't 20 facts in the book that don't relate somehow to other aspects of the book. He'll mention something in chapter 3, and by chapter 10 he'll mention something else about it. \\"Oh, right; chapter 3.\\" You know, sort of like in real life. Joyce could have written the book normally, but I'm glad he didn't. Like asking Bach to make his fugues simpler. What's the point? and who has the right. Joyce is not deliberately obscure; to me, he's one of the least obscure writers ever. Paging Aristotle! To me, he had the most control over his words of any author who ever lived. (Again, it's all interrelated.) So yes, the book is not going to come alive on the first reading. Poor baby. Takes more than that to peel this onion. If you were to look up all of the allusions etc. in this book, you'd have a solid liberal-arts education. But you don't have to, of course. It's just that the more you know, the more you'll get out of this book. Would that I were raised in Dublin. Oh well; we don't fault Homer for being Greek now do we. And I'm taken aback by some of the Woolf-ian critiques here. Like Voltaire on that \\"barbarian\\" Shakespeare. Like Shaw, Wyndham Lewis weren't jealous; they just hated him because he was so darn good. And even Jung was puzzled; what, hadn't he been studying myth his whole life? Maybe the book seemed more radical in the 1920s. But Joyce wasn't trying to be \\"modern\\" or \\"avant-garde.\\" He couldn't care less about that surreal stuff either. So, \\"Ulysses\\" is perhaps the final book of a long tradition, the fullstop of the West. (Scan the Internet for some articles and join some chat-groups if you don't believe me.) Now, wait; what about \\"Finnegans Wake\\"? Arrrrrrrghhhh!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is without question the most difficult book I have ever read. It is also the most interesting, descriptive, imaginative, funny, poignant, life-affirming, and learned book I have ever read. As someone nearing 50 who has read broadly, I consider the experience of reading Joyce's masterpiece an achievement that was well worth the effort. And it was an effort.The Naxos audiobook was essential for me (I have the CD version, which I downloaded to my Ipod; I have seen comments suggesting that the Kindle version has technical glitches). I am not a particular fan of audiobooks, but the Naxos version is very well put together, and Jim Norton - who reads 98% of the book, does a phenomenal job covering the countless voices that enter and exit (and often reenter) the text. Then Marcella Riordan reads the final monologue of Molly Bloom and her delivery is equally impressive. My approach was to follow along with the text while listening to the audiobook, and then refer to Don Gifford's annoted notes (a separate volume) that provides very helpful background to the often obscure references. For difficult chapters I would also relisten/read the chapter, which always provided added value. It sounds like a slog, and I guess it was, but I repeat: I do not regret a minute of it. Very rewarding."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This, as it is for many, is a wonderful and challenging read, forcing you to work at reading at creating and meeting up with the author in this wonderful and truly rich fiction that truly is fiction in all senses - not following but breaking up, re-casting fictional elements as he goes. Fiction is not doing this challenging, and upsetting of fictional expectations so much I find, and when I come across any writer who does I have to read and read them over - for fear of how long it will be until I next meet with something that challenges, that moves things... recently I have enjoyed Ben MarcusNotable American Women: A Noveland also Jayne Joso'sPerfect ArchitectANDSoothing Music for Stray Cats- I strongly recommend both authors and these works - after your 1st or 3rd reading of our wonderful Joyce."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In about October I read Joyce's Portrait of the Artist As a Young man and loved it. This led me to look further into his work. I then went on to read his poetry and some of the sort stories in Dubliners but I really wanted to read another book by him, yet many people told me that Ulysses was impossible to read or full of modernist randomness. I decided to read it ANYWAY.The book starts off quirky and interesting and (yay!) Stephen Dedalus is back. Each chapter is written in the style that is best for the content and that is one of the things that really impressed me. It is not \\"random\\" without a purpose and a lot of this \\"randomness\\" actually makes sense if you can recognize and pay attention to the literary/biblical/mythological allusions. Most of them are quite brilliant and I quote it all the time.( \\"Shakespeare is the happy hunting grounds of all minds that have lost their balance\\" and such).It is totally worth the time it takes to read it!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"An outstanding audiobook, all the more valuable considering the difficulty of the text.

I've listened to several good recordings now: Richard Wright's Native Son, Jack Kerouac's On the Road, Herman Hesse's Siddhartha, George Orwell's Animal Farm. All pale in comparison to Ulysses read by Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As everyone knows this is a very difficult read. I am glad I did it for many reasons, not the least of which is that this book is so talked about and I now can say I at least read it. There were what clearly appeared to be entry errors (I believe this book is one of those where volunteers enter it into the system). This was not a serious problem. But with the language and phrasing and stream of conscience style that Joyce uses, there added to the difficulty of the read in a few spots.I also really wish Kindle would number the pages. I know this changes based upon the size type a reader may set his Kindle at. However, it would really enhance the reading experience. Even if the page broke in the middle of a \\"page\\" due to the size type that the reader selected, it would be most helpful. I think this is a standard complaint regarding the Kindle."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The performance of Donald Donnelly is certainly far better than Jim Norton's one in the Naxos edition of the talking book.

It helps a lot to find a particular passage or just to find the track that you last listened to.Naxos edition also has music that makes the experience of the talking book a better, more complete one. It also has a cdrom with plenty of information on Ulysses.Moreover, many of the female \\"voices\\" are read by Donald Donnelly whilst the female readeris more present in the Naxos edition.I am going to return this item and it is a shame because Donald Donnelly is really good. I can't say the same about Recorded Books lazy, disorganized edition.PS. There is one last thing. Some words read in this edition are different from what is in the book whilst Naxos edition is exactly like the book.The book I have is the Modern Library edition, 1992."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It has taken something like a month, but Ulysses is finally done. I have conquered one of the Literary Behemoths (with Moby Dick and Middlemarch often considered as the other 2 of the Great Big Scary 3).Many aspects of this book are very, very challenging, and in my opinion you may want a little exposure to Joyce (like Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man) before you attempt this book. The other thing I strongly suggest is the new book Ulysses and Us by Declan Kiberd. Kiberd is essentially THE Joycean and spells out important literary concepts for each chapter of Ulysses.There are so many things the book brings up, but my personal favorite discussion has been the balance between art and obscenity within the eyes of the law.I remember touring NYU when I was between junior and senior year of high school. Right there, in the middle of the Art Department main office, was a black and white photograph of a woman sitting on the toilet. I was shocked. She had a faraway look in her eyes, and she was clearly thinking about something else-- the grocery list, all the things she had to do, something overwhelming. I was... confused but mentally intrigued. I had never seen anyone on the toilet before, and it's not something I actively think about other people doing. Ulysses is a lot like that. Almost as soon as Leopold Bloom, the main character, is introduced, we see him on the toilet. It's not particularly gross or graphic, but it's a private moment and there the reader is-- hovering. The book spans the course of one day, June 16th, and we see Leopold do pretty much everything. He eats, farts, has lustful thoughts... sure, some of the lustful thoughts might be creepy out of context, but in the 700 pages of context given, the reader becomes aware that this persistent lust is mostly due to the fact that he and his wife don't get down to the hanky-panky very much since their infant son died ten years ago.Joyce shows every aspect of life in such away that the reader realizes exactly what it it to be a human, full of conflict, obsessive thoughts and bodily needs (that goes back to the eating and farting). Just be prepared, because you have to find that beauty among a load of experimental styles and prose that can get very heavy at times."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is the most abjectly unreadable tome I've ever worked my way through. It's impossibly dull, tedious, and just plain boring. And then it soars. Orgasmic. And then you plod on for page after page after page after page. Glad I read it. Don't think it's one that I'm likely to ever tackle again, though!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This photomechanical reproduction of the 1922 first edition of James Joyce's Ulysses is a recommended pick for any library seeking a replacement for worn, aging paperback copies.

But... There is a certain class of author -- George Meredith was one of the first to express this viewpoint -- who has the opinion &quot;if you can't figure out what this is all about in the first chapter, you are intellectually unworthy to read my book.&quot; That is arrogance of the first order. Joyce, Faulkner (in some cases), and others of the &quot;I'm too deep for you, dummy&quot; school have massive good press from academics. Books like this keep them in tenure, one can devote a whole semester to explaining what is happening on Bloomsday. If you don't have to read this book, you shouldn't bother. Good books don't have to be 'literary', just have to be readable and make sense. There are of course good moments in Ulysses, especially if you have ever been to an Irish pub, but you really have to dig for them."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One of the drawbacks of reading Ulysses is the size of any printed text. This makes for a wonderful reading experience. The text isn't any less complex or shorter. This is a book that has to be absorbed. I'm starting my 4th reading of the book. This time on my Iphone. This is a massive work, but all I can see at any one time is what is on the screen. This book isn't for everyone.

I'll just say one thing to that; if you need to read a piece of research (\\"The New Bloomsday Book\\", etc) in order to appreciate a work of art, visual, literary or otherwise, then the work of art in question has no value whatsoever. I do not need to buy a thick volume on the history, theory and imagery of surrealism to appreciate Dali's paintings, and I sure don't need it to appreciate a work of literature.And of course there is the \\"you didn't like/understand it, you're a fool\\" attitude, very common between so called intellectuals and college poseurs, but, what could anyone do but laugh at that?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I just finished Ulysses (five minutes ago) and was blown away with the psychological insights Joyce was able to display through the characters thought processes' and interactions, both male and female.

Okay, I'll admit I'm used to blatant ignorance, I live in the United States, but when I saw that two of the most juvenile and mindless responses were from teachers, and one taught literature, I was once again blown away. Luckily, I was able to find some tonic by reading some of the other responses. I haven't lost all hope, there are still a few non-programmed thinkers out there.....If you are considering reading this book, I strongly suggest you do and I also suggest that before you start it, approach it with an open mind and you'll be taken on a ride you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To smash your skull against a maddening, beautiful brick.Let me just begin by stating how much I loathe Ulysses. I hate Stephen Dedalus. I hate Leopold Bloom. I hate Molly Bloom. I even hate their cat. They're all fatuous and arrogant and dull and dishonest and insecure and insincere and superficial and greedy, and they all take part in a story that's a boring, tedious, frustrating, incoherent, big fat waste of my time and energy. Anyone who claims otherwise is either a massive liar or a sick masochist who deserves to have a bag slipped over their head and be taken away from society. As such it remains one of the most astoundingly honest and ambitious works in modern literature. There is not a book currently existing which is simultaneously as repelling and compelling. Is there a more divisive stirrer of passionate debate in the field of art? Normally a very relaxed, some may say apathetic and pacifistic, individual, I once heard my English teacher saying that Ulysses was nothing but complete garbage. I calmly stood up and punched him in the throat, and I received polite applause as I was escorted from the classroom. Later on, when I reread a section of Ulysses near the middle, I discovered that he was completely right. But you know what? That's life. And that sense of living pours off Joyce's pages and through his eccentric mouldings of the English language like a waterfall. It's almost too much to bear at times. We eat, we drink, we urinate, we defecate, we sneeze, we fart, we stink and we have sex, and after a few decades we die. No hidden wisdom. No great awakening. No grand nobility. No spiritual nirvana. That's LIFE. And the sooner you come to terms with that, the more depressed you'll be. Wonderfully, wonderfully depressed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To understand something of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; one must firstlook at its publication in a historical perspective. Brought out inprint in a time when the banning of books was common practice in the war against &quot;obscenity,&quot; Mr. Joyce's work was championed by all liberals everywhere--not so much on its artistic merits, but, rather, due to what it symbolized for them: The struggle of the artist against the State. As for the book itself,the writing was almost secondary. In fact, it was not just derided by philistines; many noteworthy authors--among whom number Virginia Woolf and Gertrude Stein--questioned its originality and its effectiveness. (For certainly, most of its now-thought &quot;original techniques&quot; had been used before by other writers to far better effect!) That is to say, &quot;Ulysses&quot; became more important for what it was SUPPOSED to represent than for what it actually was. As time passed and young people of a more liberal turn acceded to positions of social authority, &quot;Ulysses&quot; began to be, almost defiantly, hyped as a modernist masterpiece. This, of course, to tweek the nose of the older generation more than to herald a legitimate work of Art. As a result, whole generations of subsequent Americans have had imposed on them the the ready-made opinion that &quot;Ulysses&quot; holds an unassaible position in the Letters of the World; for, certainly, they fear to have attached to themselves the tag &quot;Vulgarian&quot; if they dare to express their own thoughts on this grossly over-rated book. No, truly, &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a triumph of propoganda that, when taken out of its historical context and judged squarely, falls flat, resuming its true proportions on an artistic level given it by great writers of the time: A dry, pedantic and boring farrago."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you're like me and you like a good brain raping now and then, you'll want to pick up this book.

You have to be pretty well read to approach this novel. Most of the book is inner monologue style, and it is 99% full of obscure references. It helps to have at least some background in the Odyssey and the Bible to understand this novel. I personally do not like a \\"talking heads\\" novel, so I find that I am simply skimming the pages out of boredom. Most of the book's references are very dated so you'll find that most of the text goes \\"over your head.\\" I salute those who \\"get\\" this novel, because you must be quite a worldly individual to not need help with it. For the \\"joe everyman\\" like myself, there's no need to read this book unless it is being assigned to you. I love to read, but this book is honestly making me tiresome of it. You really need alot of patience, a huge dicitonary, a small library of other classic novels, and an understanding of Ireland's history to get through it.

One of the greatest novels I have ever read. James Joyce always hides another story, an image that passes us during the first read, that envokes us to read the novel a second time. And as soon as we pick the book up again, just when we thought we knew the allegory, another story surfaces itself from the pages. Stunning. An example of this two-sided method Joyce uses in his story is the first chapter. We see Stephen Dedalus shaving himself while he talks to his friend Buck Mulligan, but after a second read of the chapter we don't see Stephen Dedalus shaving but as a reciever of communion from Buck Mulligan who is actually a Protestant priest that consecrates the host at the beginning of the chapter. Only a master can put two stories in one chapter."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you want to understand Ulysses, you HAVE to read Portrait first, by JOyce of course. Try to get some portrait commentary so you know where Joyce is coming from, preferably an essay or two on JOyce's aesthetic theory and on the role of Stephen. If you can, read Dubliners too. I listened to an audio book lecture series on Joyce before i began his work ... it spoke of how the book begins in this oddly shaped tower the likeness of which can only be found in Ireland, hence, an American reader would most likely be ignorant as to where the books begins. As you read, consult the ANNOTATED ULYSSES for vocab and sentences that just seem too complex ... like the first sentence of the Bloom section and the ineluctable modality... - most people would not pick up the Jakob Boehme reference in the sentence, and when you do, if you dig Boehme as i have, let's just say it is a pleasant experience. I suggest the Everymna LIbrary series edition, it is a beautiful edition and has some very insightful supplements, including an introduction, the statement by an American judge that has become so renowned, a history of how the book has been printed(and more oft, destroyed) and a helpful chart on the structure of the book. I suggest one reads as much of this book as one can, even if it is just the Stehpen section, else one might die without at least experiencing part of this genius. Knowing a dash about Aquinas and Aristotle and reading some Berkeley will also sharpen one's mind to what's going on here."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce was a great writer. For first readers &quot;Dubliners&quot; and maybe &quot;A Portrait...&quot; are the best books to begin with. The later celebrated and larger books require help in the form of a companion or annotations (Burgess's books -ReJoyce-, and/or other Companions you can buy here at Amazon. In addition his life history is also important) to approach because the scene is a century ago and the references many.

Is it the greatest novel of the twentieth century? Who cares? What it is, certainly, is a work rooted in the depths of writing, a work labored over by a very intelligent man for years on end, and a work which deserves more thought than some are willing to give it credit for. The simple fact that a novel must be digested and thought about does not make it &quot;obscure,&quot; nor is it, &quot;worthless.&quot; It can be enjoyed by all who are willing to think about it. Writers like Carver who can demonstrate beauty in the simplicity of their writing have their place in the corpus of the English language, but so do writers like Joyce, whose complexities weave around themselves and ask us to consider the possibilities of our language in a different sense.

I think it must be the most difficult reading I ever made. Joyce built an entire new language of literature to write this remarkable novel, an original work in all aspects from tale to structure and language. People talk in many codes, from old rude Irish to Latin, Italian and common english. The description of inarticulate sounds like the cat's &quot;Mrkgnao&quot; was quite new to literature. The tale grasps to describe the everyday action of early century Dublin, a single day of the common life of some Irish villagers - every action, every thought and discussion, every joke, memory and dream! The story is about a man that represents the classic hero inside of the common man. Heroic deeds aren't done only in the bloody fields of senseless wars; the common man does great deeds every day without bloodshed. Remember that Ulysses was a a hero that hated war. Joyce believed that modern literature was empty within its meaningless structures and tales; only the profound significance of the classics could inject human soul back to literature. Joyce believed that people were always unconsciously reliving the classics models in their lifes, like a circle that never ends. Finally, the structure is made of many styles in order to create an entire new genre of modern literature. Think of something and you find it in &quot;Ulysses&quot;: popular songs, discussions, theatre, oniric events, medieval tales, monologues, mind narrative... &quot;Ulysses&quot; has what it takes to stand among the greatest works of mankind's literature. Scholars say that Joyce wrote &quot;Ulysses&quot; as the book that would end with all books, the final stone of modern literature in its way to regain the soul of the classics. They may be right! &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a small world written into book. It's an unique piece of work!Carlos Madeira Portugal, 16th of August of 1999"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"One thousand years from now, when the acid will have long since dissolved the remembrance's from our tombstones and even the internet will have been forgotten, Joyce's works will still be read and loved. His works will outlive our language as Homer's have their greek.I sympathize with those of you who are puzzled, angered and allow yourselves to be defeated by the text. It is much easier to read an accessible classic like The Lord of the Rings (the peoples choice for novel of the century) or The Catcher in the Rye, though they are unrewarding and juvenile works in comparison with Ulysses.As to those of you who pretend to be intellectually superior to Ulysses or the Wake, stop kidding yourselves.

A person may imagine that writings of this sort confer a measure of immortality. The measure of immortality gleaned by such articles, however, is rather small. What do people learn about us other than that we have some small part in sorting out a minor detail of the workings of the universe? We are no more than a couple initials followed by a family name that appear above the abstract. In contrast, the degree of immortality gained by an author such as James Joyce in the writing of Ulysses is immeasurably greater. Infused into his character Leopold Bloom are the important details of a day of a life. From his morning ablutions to his final repose, marked by the famous soliloquy of his wayward wife Molly, Leopold reveals to us the broad spectrum of what every rich life might be expected to encompass. From birth to death, from the stirrings of love to betrayals both great and small, Joyce's protagonist experiences them all as his moves through the day--and through reflections on his life from the vantage point afforded by middle age.To help bring this book to life I urge the reader to look up Molly Bloom's soliloquy as performed by Angeline Ball."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition is a great facsimile of the first edition.

The flipside of this theme is that human beings don't treat each other like family; rather, we treat each other like dirt.The unity theme in Joyce inspired Joseph Campbell, the great comparative mythologist.The Gabler edition is superior if only for the preface where the simple theme of love is discussed.This book, as the professor I had told the class I was in, will change you.

This tale of the adventures of advertising salesman Leopold Bloom on June 16, 1904, in Dublin is a remarkable conflation of mythology, symbolism, philosophy, social realism, and humanity. Bloom's relationships with wife Molly and surrogate son Stephan Dedalus reflect the simple decency of the common man. There is no doubt that reading Ulysses places great demands on the intellect of the reader. Joyce's intentions in writing Ulysses, to present a totally realistic view of one day in the life of ordinary Dublin citizens, yet at the same time to weave into this a grand parallel with Homer's Odyssey and on a smaller scale to deal with issues as complicated as those of Irish politics and religion, mean that before they come upon the novel, it is necessary for the reader to have a wide base of knowledge.

In view of the fact that the real Mr. Norris is an eminent Joycean scholar respected in Joycean circles throughout the world, this review can only be a hoax."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To fully appreciate Ulysses, one has to be aware how truly far ahead of its time this novel was. We have been through Faulkner stream-of-consciousness in high school and college English classes, and we can turn on the computer for live webcams all over the world, and we have been treated to the minutae of the Osbournes and other reality TV series. All of these - whether you consider them high art or dubious social experiments - are attempts to understand the human condition and the interaction among individuals in the most mundane of settings: daily life and relationships and the wandering life of the mind. Just as modern dramatists all stand on the shoulders of Shakespeare, so do modern literary writers stand on the shoulders of James Joyce. It is quite a hoot, however, to read what was deemed so &quot;obscene&quot; - we have sure come a long way (or fallen a long way, however you choose to look at it) - but the sheer craft of this book cannot be denied. Literature turned a sharp corner with this work. Yes, some of the passages can become tedious - and the references obscure (but even if you don't look them up, the overall effect is not lost) - it is best to read those long musing rambles almost with soft-focus eyes and let your mind flow with the words as if they were your own interior monologue. Another useful approach is to read them like poetry. Some of the phrases are just delicious and could stand on their own, perhaps like free verse or haiku. On first try, I didn't make it through Ulysses - a couple of years later, I tried again and took the pressure off myself to understand every sentence or to follow the &quot;story.&quot; I just read, and became completely engrossed."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It seems, in this new century of total instant access to everything, that the accepted way of persuading people to read \\"Ulysses\\" is to say that it's a damn fine book but you need to be an experienced reader with a lot of time on your hands and plenty of patience...etc. Let's get a few things clear. This is not the \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\". There is not some algorithm you have to work out in advance in order to enjoy this book. It's a novel. It's a good read. The other stuff, the background stuff, the structural cunning and the wide-ranging allusiveness, is there in case you want to read it again. Basically, this is an unusually intelligent novel, in a basically comic mode, that plays a few games with the ways that we (sometimes lazily) tend to read. The rest is just a bonus. Joyce is just so generous in his joking and his desire to give us more than we normally expect from a book that we can get a bit overwhelmed by the cornucopia of stuff that he lays at our feet.I first read Ulysses when I was about 17 - I was still in what Americans would call high school, I wasn't reading it because I had to, but because I had heard it was supposed to be one of the best books around and it was set in the city around which I had grown up. I found the first three chapters a bit tricky but I kept going, because it seemed to me that the guy knew what he was doing. Then I got to the fourth chapter, and it suddenly became much easier. It seemed to me that this was the kind of thing that most of the writers I liked were trying to do, but most often failed at, because they just weren't this good. Joyce is supremely good at conveying the physical sensations of being alive - what it's like to be hungry, sad, lustful, worrisome, tired, hopeful, nervous. As the book went on, I knew I wanted to trust this guy. In the later sections, Joyce seemed to be expecting what I wanted to happen, and seemed determined to persuade me that how I wanted the book to develop wasn't necessarily the best way for the book to go - and I believed him. Since I hadn't read many \\"great\\" novels, his changes in style seemed to me to be exactly the sort of thing that an adventurous writer should be doing. I thought then, and still think, that he can be a bit garrulous, but he's such a skilful writer that I don't wish he'd made the book any shorter than it is.By the end, Ulysses had come to represent my basic idea of a really great novel. I had no notion that most novels aren't anything like as daring or as enjoyable. The only other novels I've read since which are both as courageous and as entertaining as this one are Pynchon's \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\" and Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\". Which, I know now, will tell you a lot about my taste in fiction.You really don't need to be an expert reader to appreciate \\"Ulysses\\". If anything, it's better if you have either read everything, or next to nothing. The notes are handy, if you want to know all that's going on - and I don't see why that should hurt. But even without them, Joyce - as they used to say of a certain brand of beer - can reach parts that other writers (or for that matter, beers) can't reach. He is a truly wonderful writer, and I'm (foolishly) proud that the greatest of novelists in the English language was an Irishman.People are still writing great novels - Pynchon's last was a lovely late masterpiece, and Don DeLillo is as vigorous as ever. But my personal opinion is that Joyce kicked a flagging Victorian form into new life, and the impact of his scuffed tennis shoe is still raw and smarting. \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is still awaiting the readers it deserves. In the meantime, there's no reason why any curious reader shouldn't get something out of \\"Ulysses\\". It's my favourite novel. It's also the best Irish book so far. Mind you, I can't wait till Mairtin O Cadhain's \\"Cre na Cille\\" gets translated into English..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"&quot;Ulysses&quot; is perhaps the most challenging and rewarding book that I have ever read. Its slow pacing and density frustrated me the first time through, although the book provided enough snippets of briliance that I kept reading. However, after putting it on the shelf for a year, I picked up a copy of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; by Homer and read the two side by side. This made the events in &quot;Ulysses&quot; much more understandable, as Joyce borrowed the structure of his book from &quot;The Odyssey.&quot; It also helped me glimpse the true brilliance of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. By taking one of history's most epic tales and overlaying it onto a single day in the life of an average, unremarkable man, both books furthered my understanding of the common aims and desires of all people. If you buy &quot;Ulysses&quot;, pick up &quot;The Odyssey&quot; as well; this, more than any &quot;Joyce 101&quot; guides, will help you understand thiss fascinating and multilayered book. If you give it time and don't concern yourself with how long it takes to read, this book will grow on you and you will realize how many insights it provides on the human condition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses (1922) breaks traditional conventions of fiction: like Finnegans Wake (1939) it can hardly be appreciated completely unless passages are read aloud; like Homer's Odyssey it chronicles a plot of epic proportions, with details so rich and colourful they virtually epitomize realism and the stream-of-consciousness technique; and like the short stories in Joyce's Dubliners (1914) or Classical Greek drama, it focuses on a very specific, particular situation: a day in the life of a Dublin canvasser, Leopold Bloom.Ulysses gained a favourable reputation among Modernist contemporaries like Ezra Pound. Its inclusion of the vulgar language of Dublin's people was offensive to many, leading to public book-burnings and prohibitions against its publication. By the 1960s, when such concerns over language had dissipated, Ulysses still remained the esoteric interest of a limited number of readers. This is due partly to the text's numerous obscure passages and its reputation for being a &quot;difficult&quot; text. However, a basic knowledge of the Odyssey and an acceptance of the stream-of-consciousness technique -- which had, we should note, been employed in limited measure by writers like Dickens -- allows the patient reader to revel in decoding the text's plot, its puns, and its symbolic levels of meaning. Indeed, many editions of the work feature outlines listing some of the main features of each passage -- the equivalent of the pithy chapter titles that usually accompany the text of more traditional novels.Ulysses chronicles a place and time (Edwardian Dublin) but also a site and an age (the city and the 20th century). It does so with language that reflects the irony and fragmentation associated with the Modern era and its problems, as related in the novel. It took many laborious years to write (arguably, only Finnegans Wake would be more challenging to its author). Nonetheless, both of Joyce's long works have been immense influences on fiction and poetry in this century: they have re-asserted and re-emphasized the non-linear, non-written aspects of language (e.g. the Wake begins by ending its last sentence); they have (in Derrida's estimation) overturned Western society's privileging of speech (logocentrism) over writing (since many of the words and puns can only be understood via reading them on the page); and yet they retain a simple, straightforward backbone of human experience, connectedness, and imagination as their primary themes."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is an episode of the British TV series \\"Black Books\\" (a surreal comedy set in a second hand bookshop) where Manny says to his cruel employer Bernard: \\"I just sold that customer a copy of \\"Ulysses\\", \\"The Guide to Ulysses\\" and \\"A Handbook to the Ulysses Guide\\". Now surely that deserves a star.\\" This episode is even funnier now that I've read \\"Ulysses\\" for myself. Any reader who actually manages to get through \\"Ulysses\\" probably deserves a star as well.I read this book because it was reported to be controversial and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I knew Anthony Burgess (the author of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\") was an expert on James Joyce and I've read other books that are written in strange versions of English (\\"The Night Land\\" by William Hope Hodgson, \\"Riddley Walker\\" by Russell Hoban and the aforementioned \\"A Clockwork Orange\\"). It was interesting to learn that James Joyce was the writer who invented the lingual style known as \\"stream of consciousness\\".Having already read a Penguin Classics edition of \\"A Portrait of the Artist As A Young Man\\", I thought I'd give \\"Ulysses\\" a shot. The copy of \\"Ulysses\\" that I read was a hardcover 1966 edition, published by Bodley Head. At 933 pages, the book posed an additional challenge by having no introduction at the front and no explanatory notes at the back. The plain green cover had no illustration and no blurb. Nevertheless I persevered.So what is \\"Ulysses\\" actually about? The only way a reader can appreciate this book is to have a knowledge of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". That's what \\"Ulysses\\" is - a modern retelling of the Odyssey, taking place in Dublin on June 16 1904. There's no doubt that \\"Ulysses\\" caused a stir when it was first published (1922). People would have been more easily shocked back then. Even when the film adaptation was shown in New Zealand in the more liberated 1960s the audience was segregated by gender.If I have piqued a prospective reader's curiosity, all well and good. Although the book weighs 1 kilogram on the scales, \\"Ulysses\\" is definitely not light reading. As an experimental work, I would say that \\"Ulysses\\" does for literature what \\"Eraserhead\\" does for cinema. That's the best comparison I can think of.

This publisher offers no preface, foreword, notes, or so much as an illustrator's credit for the apt cover; the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort. Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition is the best and most readable edition of Ulysses available. As far as tackling the book goes... well, you get out of it what you put into it, but be prepared to put a lot into it. Simply: Don't read Ulysses because you feel like you have to or you should, read it because you want to and don't be too proud or afraid to seek out help.I was lucky enough to tackle this book in a classroom setting but it is not so utterly incomprehensible as to make that the only way to understand it. There are many guides (Stuart Gilbert's was the one we used but I suspect there are better. I even found sparknotes useful just for a chapter summary after reading.) to help people through the text and its deeper workings.The real question is, why choose this version of Ulysses over another, cheaper version? The text has been thoroughly reworked and many publishing mistakes directly interfering, misinterpreting, or outright disregarding Joyce's plan for his book have been fixed. The editors have nothing but the utmost respect for Joyce and for Ulysses and that care is evident throughout the book as the hands of the editors remain invisible behind Joyce's words.So rant and rave and rant and rave but I nearly gave this 4 stars just because of the product. The book itself, the binding and the cover, are absolutely terrible. My book was brand new and my cover fell off before I was halfway through it. By the end of the course more than half the books in our class were damaged and many of them had pages falling out as well. There's no excuse for any book, let alone the most important book of the 20th century, to fall apart while reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have never heard anything like this before. It is sure fire to increase one's aesthetic sensibility and broaden one's sense of being alive."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce describes the ways that Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus follow, from dawn 'til night, on June 16, 1904. What's special about this day? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Bloom fixes breakfast, goes to the bathroom, does business, attends his friend Paddy Dignam's funeral, goes back to work, strolls on the beach, gets drunk with some friends, follows the party at a brothel, gets Dedalus out of a problem, and then invites him home for more drinks. Then he goes to sleep. Dedalus wakes up in Buck Mulligan's place (a tower), goes to teach at a school, wanders around the beach after visiting some relatives, goes to the library, in the evening he goes to a bar with some friends, and finally he meets Bloom at the brothel.This immeasurable book is a desperate attempt at capturing the present, which is constantly escaping: the present on the inside and the outside of people. It is an absolute witness of what the characters see, hear, fell, smell, and speak to themselves. It is looking for utter simultaneousness, trying to be an absolut record of everything that goes thorugh the bodies and minds of the main characters. Meanings? Symbols? Interpretations? Infinite. This book leaves, among many others, the sensation that it has passed and left us blank; that we didn't retain anything, that we hold nothing of it: exactly the same sensation that the present leaves on us.Every chapter parallels a chapter from Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and each is written in a different style. As a literary work of art, it is incomparable: it uses language, symbols, syntaxis, pronouns, time, everything, in a unique way, in order to depict for us what happens to a person in a normal day.A separate mention is deserved by the final chapter, the monologue of Molly Bloom. 50 pages without a period, a true masterpiece of stream-of-consciousness. A most faithful portrait of what goes through a woman's mind half awaken, half asleep, a summary of her life and her relationship with Leopold. It is necessary to read this passage in one single effort.When reading &quot;Ulysses&quot;, it is useful to keep in mind Marcel Proust's work. Proust seeks to recover the past long gone, while Joyce seeks to capture the present before it becomes past. This is an overwhelming book, irritating and, above all, admirable. It reaches unsuspected levels of creativity, experimentation and literary depth.Some people don't like it: that's their prerrogative. But to say this is a phony or bad book, is to acknowledge one's laziness as reader. They're losing a tour-de-force in literature. Be sure you don't suffer the same fate."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It took me more than 4 weeks to finish this book. Most parts of the book were difficult to understand.

As I went along, I found that I couldn't understand one-tenth of what was going on. Well, I had to finish the book because I wanted to experience what many people say is the greatest novel ever written.One thing I learned from reading this book is that when you are faced with something you don't understand, it is okay to get the hell out. Otherwise, you'd just be wasting 4 weeks of your life.Needless to say, I will never forget the four weeks I spent reading this book. I'd remember it as one of the darkest periods of my life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ULYSSES is one of the most widely discussed, debated, and disputed literary masterpieces of all time, yet surprisingly few of those who discuss it have actually read the book. Reasons range from sloth to intimidation to a flat-out lack of interest. It is important to have some basic knowledge of the premise of ULYSSES prior to reading it; two things are particularly critical to be aware of:1. ULYSSES is an allegory for Homer's ODYSSEY. The whole thing.2. All of the events of the novel span fewer than 24 hours.Trust me, knowing those two things makes ULYSSES make a whole lot more sense.Since ULYSSES is a notoriously difficult read, its readers have come up with various means by which to approach the novel. Different things work for different people, but what follows is my version of a \\"Reader's guide to ULYSSES\\":1. This one is critical: read James Joyce's A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN before ULYSSES. Not only does the former serve as a sort of primer for the latter, but A PORTRAIT introduces Stephen Dedalus, a key character in ULYSSES. Many of the events and circumstances of A PORTRAIT are referred to in ULYSSES, and Joyce will by no means spoon-feed you the connections.Supplemental pre-ULYSSES reading includes Homer's THE ODYSSEY and Joyce's DUBLINERS.2. Remember: this is supposed to be a funny book. If events seem absurd, disgusting, or nonsensical, there's certainly a reason.3. Take... your... time. I spent six weeks reading ULYSSES, and sometimes would spend up to five minutes on one page if I was confused or spacing out. This novel is, frankly, dense enough to sink in a pool of mercury. You aren't going to understand every pun, cultural allusion, or plot point even. Accept it: spend as long as you need, infer whatever you can, try your best, don't get frustrated.4. Do NOT give up! I read this as a 17-year-old; this is NOT an unreadable book! It is a very tough read, but not impossible. If you don't ever abandon ULYSSES, you're bound to finish it. Chapters are long; if you're burning out in the middle of one, just finish the next paragraph, stick your bookmark between the pages, and put ULYSSES on your nightstand for a while.All told, this is one of the greatest and most rewarding novels ever written. Give it a chance, prepare as suits you best, and have a nice read!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is the more complete edition to which I refer in my review of the free Kindle version of Ulysses.

This is not a book for the amateur. Precisely the opposite, this is a book continually referring to other novels, uses language of greater expanse than most others, and is written in styles which make the complexities vastly increased.More puzzle maker than novelist, Joyce's decision to write in paradox, paradigm, pun, parody, contrarian, contradiction and more makes the reading experience as complete as one could ask in the English language. The array of writing styles is mesmerizing: simple novel; over 30 pages of newspaper column; a 180-page play; over 70 pages of questions followed by answers; and one final chapter made up of seemingly 30-40 pages in ONE sentence of rambling autobiographical sexual revelation by Molly Bloom - the protagonist's cavorting wife.The interplay of the styles is extremely brave and enlightening. As they touch upon the same topic, but in different voices and different styles, the reader can further delve into what transpired hundreds of pages before, when the writer intentionally did not reveal it all, and definitely did not reveal it in easily decipherable verse. The interrelation between the texts would allow one to probably read the chapters in different orders and end in the same frame of mind. Nabokov asserted one could do such to his \\"Lolita.\\" And, Nabokov, creator of \\"Pale Fire\\", reminds me so much of Joyce as each toys with and teases the reader with puns, parodies and sometimes outdated jokes.The main characters, Leopold Bloom and Molly Bloom, are known to even those who have not read the novel. Their mutual philandering is the focus of much of the novel. The exploits of each are relatively revealed. But, not in black and white English. The point is taken, and from this came one great pornography trial which culminated with a 1933 United States District Court decision proclaiming, \\". . . the effect of \`Ulysses' on the reader undoubtedly is somewhat emetic, nowhere does it tend to be an aphrodisiac.\\"Such words would not be clearer. \\"An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollification suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.\\" University level English is a prerequisite to understand this alleged smut - or to use Joyce's words: concupiscence delivering induration.And, most of the book, believe it or not, is not about sexual issues. Much touches upon other topics: philosophy, anti-Semitism, socialism . . . . But it is not always condescending; and it is much more than a 700-800-pages of dialectic prose. Because some of those topics are extremely poignant in 2009, those portions of the book apply to today's themes and can be easily (?) read today. Other topics are not for today's discussion. And, that makes reading those portions very difficult for today's reader.In all honesty there were times when I read the novel and asked, \\"what am I missing?\\" I had to stop and reflect, \\"Do others really see something that I cannot?\\" For instance the following passage really lost me: \\"What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Green gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\\" Do I need recite more? This caught my interest as much as a \\"White on White\\" painting at the museum of modern art. \\"I just don't get it.\\"And then, later I read the question-answer portion (second to last chapter), and the efficiency and beauty of the writing is both unique and unparalleled.

And, so well worth the read.Few tips: Read \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" and maybe the \\"Dubliners\\" before this. I would also recommend reading the last two chapters before reading from the beginning. And have a dictionary nearby. You will use it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I started reading Ulysses at the end of my junior year in high school with absolutely no knowledge of how difficult or \`great' it was reputed to be. I just bought a used copy and started reading after an essay about it struck my fancy on the SATs. There will be people who tell you that Ulysses is a work of art that can be appreciated only by someone of great intelligence and a high level of education. There will be people who tell you that the book is comprised of pretentious dribble that no one actually understands; designed to make \`intellectuals' feel good about themselves for pretending to \`get' it. Both are wrong. Ulysses is just a book. There will be people who love it and people who hate it, regardless of their intelligence. If you hate it, it doesn't mean that you're stupid or that you don't \`get' it; it just means that it's not your cup o' tea. So why not give it a chance?Personally, I'm no genius, and I adored Ulysses. I didn't have to read it with a map, a dictionary, and a book of Irish proverbs at my side, either. Yes, to get every possible thing that you can get out of it, you'll need these things, but you don't need them to fall in love with the characters, laugh at their awkward conversations, or marvel at Joyce's use of language. Chances are, if you can make it through the book out of liking it- and not just out of a sense of duty- then you'll want to go back and read it again anyways (well, perhaps after a short break) so you don't need to understand every little detail your first time through.Because of its reputation, Ulysses does tend to attract either the snobs who quote the most difficult parts of the book as the \`greatest,' or the snobs who can't get over the fact that they don't enjoy one of the most famous books of all time and quote the most difficult parts of the book as a reason not to read it. This makes it seem more dense than it really is. If you're patient and willing to pay attention, Ulysses isn't nearly as difficult as it's reputed to be. Just use the \\"Search Inside\\" feature on this site and take a look at the first chapter. The language itself isn't too difficult, it's the fact that the language and technique do take some time to get used to- so by the time you get into the rhythm, a new chapter starts and the style of the prose changes altogether. You just need to read slowly and patiently- and for the love of God don't skip passages. Yes, there are maybe one or two chapters that are pretty tough (Oxen of the Sun, probably, is the most notable) but the vast majority of the book is perfectly easy to understand to the patient reader.If you do opt out of Ulysses, you'll miss out on some of the most awesome, well-developed, and loveable characters in all of literature. Because Joyce chronicles the stream of consiousness of the main characters in a few of the chapters, we not only get to see what they think, but how they think it. It's hard to explain but very cool. The brilliant, modest, and socially awkward Leopold Bloom takes the role of the 'hero' or 'Odysseus' of the story. There is no possible way for me to describe how deep, hilarious, tragic, and downright likeable he is. Sadly, no one in the book really enjoys his presence, and a cloud of awkward silence seems to follow him wherever he goes. Pretentious, moody, and selfish, Stephen Dedalus takes the role of Telemachus. He's angsty, introverted, sarcastic and incredibly funny. The more minor characters are just as important, notably Buck Mulligan, Stephen's obnoxious, smug, life-of-the-party type roommate (think of your typical frat-boy) is very funny (if incredibly annoying to Stephen,) as is Molly, Leopold's (somewhat understandably) unfaithful wife, whose inner thoughts make up the entirety of the book's completely unpunctuated final chapter. The jingoistic anti-Semite \\"The Citizen\\" and Stephen's clueless, annoying boss are also both amazing.The book doesn't follow The Odyssey religiously, but I did find myself thankful that I had read the Greek epic before approaching Ulysses. This edition doesn't have the names of the chapters, (I don't know if any edition does) and I would suggest finding out what they are and writing them in. They give a good idea of the general theme of each chapter, and the contrast between the ancient heroes (Odysseus and Telemachus) and the modern day heroes (Leopold and Stephen) is a huge point of interest. It's also good to have a decent knowledge of the history of Ireland. I did find myself wishing that I knew more about Shakespeare (Stephen's obsessed with Shakespeare and prattles on about him constantly), other famous authors and philosophers, different languages, and Irish culture and history, but the book taught me more than it stumped me.I am only eighteen, and even though I could talk about Ulysses all day, I know that I don't yet have the ability to even scratch the surface of its' complexity and depth. I certainly plan on reading and re-reading it as I become more educated, but the reason that I want to is because it is, in essence, a good, funny, dramatic, and thoroughly entertaining read unto itself. Please, try not to pass up on it just because of its reputation."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you haven't read Ulysses yet, and feel daunted by the wildly different, extremely strident reviews of it, read on and I'll try to explain why this novel is worth your while.First, a brief summary. Ulysses attempts to capture what life was like in Dublin, Ireland, at the start of the twentieth century. It doesn't do this like a history book, solely in terms of political events and noteworthy individuals; rather, it attempts to convey the nature of the day-to-day lives of ordinary people by following its protagonist, an inoffensive fellow named Leopold Bloom, around the city. (It occasionally switches to following a young man named Stephen Dedalus, whom Bloom meets eventually, but Bloom is the main character.) It describes the things that transpire in the world around Bloom, as well as the thoughts that go on inside his head.Ulysses contains many disparate literary styles, but none are gratuitous; all are used in the service of the novel's themes. Joyce wanted to show how poetry, history, heroism, romanticism, and indeed all of human civilization, can be found slumbering in each individual, no matter how mundane his life might be. This comes to the fore in chapter 14, in which Bloom goes to a maternity ward to convey his best wishes to a woman in labour. When he arrives, he meets a bunch of drunk medical students who make callous remarks that make him uncomfortable; after some time, the nurse comes in and announces that the woman successfully gave birth, which relieves Bloom's anxiety. In addition to these simple events, the chapter tells the entire history of England. That is, the first paragraph is written in monosyllabic Druidic calls, the second approximates the style of ancient Latin historians, the third glides into early Anglo-Saxon poetry (\\"before born babe bliss had\\"), then it switches to Chaucer and medieval prose, and so on, the style of each paragraph moving a little bit forward in history, until it collapses into a mix of modern slang in the end.Thus, in numerous prose styles, the chapter recreates the birth and life of the English language itself, without warning the reader that it's doing this. In essence, it shows the history of a whole civilization in an original way. But the important part is, it never stops making sense; the plot and the dialogue keep progressing along with the style. Thus, the birth of a child is shown alongside the birth of the whole English language, indicating that civilization is born anew with every new human being. An ordinary birth is made to look like the culmination of all of English history, thanks entirely to this method of describing it. You don't have to have read Chaucer and Shakespeare and Gibbon to appreciate this chapter; Joyce read them for you, so all you have to do is watch the language change.This happens all the time throughout the book. For instance, chapter 13 finds Bloom wandering around on a beach, where some teenage girls are hanging out and talking. Without further ado, the book inserts itself into the mind of one of these girls. Her thoughts aren't anything amazing: basically, she just wants to fall in love with a handsome man, be loved in return, and be happy. However, in describing these thoughts, Joyce adopts the style of a dime-store romantic novel of the sort that are marketed to teenage girls: it's rife with sentimental, flowery prose like \\"the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.\\" The thing is, this style accurately reflects what folks go through during their teenage years: it's got the same heightened emotion, the same vague yearning, the same feeling one gets when falling in love for the first time, that this has never before happened to anyone else and will never happen again, the same romanticism and idealism. Thus, it's remarkably easy to sympathize with the girl, again solely due to Joyce's technique.That's probably the biggest reason to read Ulysses: all these styles and epic analogies are founded on a powerful emotional centre. Some folks like to say that this book is a \\"celebration of life,\\" or something to that effect. Well, in my opinion, it's a book about loneliness more than anything else. A large part of the book consists of Bloom's internal monologues, creating the impression that he's constantly hounded by unwelcome thoughts. When he's not running into hostile nationalists or petty gossips, he thinks about his adulterous wife. Then, in chapter 14, he meets Stephen Dedalus, decides to follow him out of the maternity ward and into the red light district, and then brings him home. Bloom, whose own son died eleven days after being born, feels fatherly affection toward Stephen; yet, Bloom and Stephen have nothing to say to each other. They engage in some small talk, but Stephen clearly doesn't take Bloom seriously, and Bloom doesn't really know how to approach Stephen. Then, Stephen, who is the closest thing to a friend that Bloom has met all day, leaves. Bloom goes upstairs and goes to sleep next to his wife; the final chapter is told from his wife's point of view, and it becomes abundantly obvious that her perception of her own husband is often wrong, and always strangely detached, as if he's not close to her at all despite living under the same roof. The style is breathtaking, rhythmic stream-of-consciousness, highlighting the sadness of this emotional distance between the characters.So, don't feel threatened by the style. Ulysses is very readable; true, each chapter has its own style, but most of the styles are perfectly accessible, and make the plot more engaging. All the \\"difficult\\" parts don't happen until the second half, giving you time to get accustomed to Joyce's idiosyncrasies (he doesn't tell you when he's moving from objective description to internal monologue, but after a while, you can usually tell). Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I bought this to supplement the 1961 Random House edition (balance of textual corrections and respect for the original, matches most annotations), Modern Library edition (most portable, attractive package as all ML editions, typography a tad hard on my 40-something eyes) and '80s \\"Gabler edition\\" (hotly contested, worth keeping as a collector's item as it's been largely withdrawn).The original Shakespeare & Co. printings are out of my league, although I've seen several. Until I hit the lottery, this is the closest I'll own. A quick Google will find you first edition, first printing copies selling for up to 100k. I doubt my stimulus check is that big.This is a textual facsimile - a photo reproduction of the original, 1000-copy first edition - copy #784, to be exact. It also reproduces the cover typography and the Shakespeare and Co. title page, with an added, Orchises title page to keep the record clear. It contains the original colophon. It doesn't contain the forward, letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf or Judge Woolsey opinion you're probably used to seeing in American editions.In a physical sense, it's hard to say how this is a facsimile, other than Orchises has reproduced the full size of the original. Of course, the paper and binding material are different.Most S. & Co. editions came unbound in blue-green wrappers, and could be bound as desired. This is why you see original printings in such disparate bindings. Orchises has reproduced the color of the original wrappers, although their binding looks a little more green than the original wrappers (maybe the color has shifted on those?). In any case, it's a solid cloth binding, comparable to, say, a better-than-average library binding. Bound size given as 9.6 x 7.5 x 1.7 inches, I measure it a hair taller. I daresay it will hold up to extended use.In addition to giving the slight tingle of pleasure that comes from knowing you're reading the text as originally sold at 12, Rue de l'Odeon, this edition is much more comfortable on my eyes than the others. I like the typeface used by original printer Maurice Darantiere for readability, but haven't gotten a definitive answer as to what it is - does anyone know? Somehow, it just feels right.Orchises says the paper is 50-pound, ph-balanced (aka acid-free) paper, and that seems about right. It's really good paper, with a slight, almost visually undetectable textured finish that feels good to the fingers. Excellent paper-to-ink contrast. I can, and will, read this all day.For the average reader, there's no earthly reason to spend this amount on a novel, and the ML edition will be both more convenient and, with its front material, more informative. For someone who rereads Ulysses for pleasure, it's a joy. The 1922 text has been analyzed to death, and is not without errors (2,000? 3,000? 5,000? the number gets larger each time it's mentioned). It was perhaps inevitable in a book with no clear reference manuscript - even the extant manuscripts were to some degree created by Joyce after the fact for sale. Part of one manuscript was burned by the angry husband of a typist, who found its content objectionable. An appreciable percentage of the text was written as corrections on the original proofs.Hence the charming apology from Sylvia Beach reproduced in this facsimile: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances. S.B.\\"But each effort to correct the errors added more errors, as well as layers of contention. See the well-documented battle over the Gabler edition. Or the disastrous 1998 \\"Reader's edition\\" by Danis Rose. The original is as good as any for reading, and if you care enough to buy a facsimile, you will have other editions for comparison anyway.For scholarly use, this isn't the best edition, since most standard annotations match the Random House or Modern Library editions. Unless you're beyond Ulysses 101 and want to compare editions.This is one of three first-edition facsimiles that have been published. I can't speak to the others, but I can recommend this one. Kudos to Orchises, and I hope they keep it in print. Or not, so my copy will become a minor-league collector's item.Ulysses has become an obsession and and a world in and of itself for its partisans, of whom I am one. The Ulysses obsession is much like the Higher Criticism surrounding the Sherlock Holmes canon. Many people find it bizarre, and I can hardly disagree. If, like me, you've got the bug, I don't have to explain it to you. This is an edition for you.If you don't, I paraphrase Louis Armstrong: \\"If you have to ask, you'll never know.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Let's not mince words: Ulysses is one of the highest achievements of literary modernism. But it is also a book that must be read again and again (and again) if it is to be understood and enjoyed. Why buy a pulpy and cheaply made edition that falls to pieces on the second read? The Orchises edition, as a physical artefact, is not only aesthetically worthy of the text it presents (including the generous white space framing the text itself)--it also has the durability and weight you'd normally expect from a Bible.Other reviewers have detailed how this book is a faithful facsimile of the 1922 editions. The only other thing I would add is that this is the edition whose colour scheme Joyce himself oversaw: The white text and blue background of the cover symbolise the pentelic marble of Greece and the greenblue of the Mediterranean respectively (which are also the colours of the Greek flag).I thoroughly recommend this beautiful book for anyone who is serious about Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"June 16th, 1904 in Dublin - a city under British rule and starting to try and shrug off the weight of the colonial oppression. On this day Joyce sets his &quot;heroes&quot; (heroes that only Joyce could create), Leopold Bloom (Ulysses) and Stephen Dedalus (Telemachus), on their own odysseys through Dublin's streets. Along the way we get a catalog of minor disappointments and victories, major literary experiments and a reading experience to truly last a lifeline.Stephen Dedalus, the hero from Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, is the young student, the educated, literary and artistic individual somewhat based on Joyce himself. Leopold Bloom is the older, cynical 20th century everyman, in search of a son (where Stephen is, to some extents, missing a father). They make their individual journeys around Dublin that day, finally coming together in a chance meeting and then becoming friends.If you are after a riveting story, you won't find it here - the previous paragraph somes it up! What we get is to walk in these (and other people's) shoes for a day. We experience their small successes - an idle flirtation perhaps; we are with them as they realize some minor disappointment. Joyce termed these experiences ephiphanies and, to some extent, that's what Ulysses is - many, many iter-related and multi-layered ephiphanies.We also feel part of Dublin the city and Ireland the country. It's difficult looking back now after 80 years of home rule, with its successes and failures, what it must have looked like then unsure of what the future would bring. Joyce gives us a divided picture - we see the &quot;citizen&quot;, the nationalistic and stubborn individual who desires freedom at any cost; we see those who are staunchly royalist and who support (flirt with in the case of some of the women) the British soldiers. Joyce's picture is no one-dimensioned protestant-Catholic division either. This element of the book has great interest in it's own right.Ulysses has parallels from Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. The correspondence from chapter to chapter is highly selective. Some chapters use purely literary techniques to make a parallel (in particular &quot;The Sirens&quot;) where others have more pointed comparisons. You do not need to be familiar with The Odyssey to get something out of this book. Familiarity with Joyce's earlier works - Dubliners and Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man - is very useful, as is an understanding of Shakespeare's Hamlet. References to all of these abound.What you will probably also need is a guide. I used Harry Blamires's &quot;The New Bloomsday Book&quot; and I would seriously recommend using it or something similar on a first reading. Joyce's writing in this book is wonderful but it can be very very difficult. Having someone hold your hand on the journey helps you get much more out of it.The style of writing changes throughout the book; Joyce was experimenting with literary techniques to help tell the tale and give us insight into his character. Some of these are very successful - some are rather inpenetrable. In particular the &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; chapter is very hard-going in parts!However, unlike some other literary works, Ulysses is always fun. You might find you get the most out of some of it if you read it aloud (or imagine yourself doing so) because much of the work is highly poetical. For the final chapter - the only one told from a female perspective - the heavy stream of consciousness deserves to be read in a gallop, letting the words flow over you.Joyce wrote this seminal work over a period of seven years and, at times, it felt it would take me that long to finish it. It's certainly not something to embark upon if you won't be able to devote considerable time to it. With so many great books to be read, you may wonder why you should devote this amount of time and energy on a single book. In this case the answer is because it is a unique, wonderful and life-enhancing experience."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Easily the most exciting book ever written. I'd give it 6 stars (or 10) if i could. Yes, i needed the Cliff notes to help me through it, and yes, i was on disability at the time, recovering from 4 knee surgeries, and it took more than 6 weeks, but it was all worth it. It's an amazing thing, a polyglotting amalgamation of languages (i counted more than 30, and am sure i missed a lot more), internal and external dialogue, brilliantly rendered characters and even dirty jokes.Perhaps i was ignorant beforehand, but i'd always thought that &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; referred to only the WRITER'S mental wanderings, the way beats like William Burroughs (e.g., Naked Lunch) and Allen Ginsburg (Howl, America, etc.) would later do it, or Marcel Proust (a\` la recherche du temps perdu--let's face it, the translations just don't cut it) during Joyce's time. But Joyce, progenitor of the beats and contemporary of Proust, did it for DIFFERENT PEOPLES' CONSCIOUSNESSES, moving from spoken word to internal thought states of several of his vividly drawn characters, and back again. It's almost impossible to convey the wonder of discovering this beauty, the way Joyce represented such a quantum leap in literature from Dostoyevsky, Dickens and Kafka before him, as Einstein did from 19th century physics.And to those who say &quot;anyone who says they've [sic] read this book is a liar,&quot; i promise you i read EVERY WORD, from &quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan&quot; to &quot;Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. Ominous, revengeful zodiacal host!

Academic infighting notwithstanding, I think the Gabler edition is as close to a &quot;correct&quot; Ulysses as we're going to get. The work he has put into studying each word is really astounding, and he's cleaned up a lot of sentences that never made sense earlier (I'm sure plenty of graduate students wrote long papers on how brilliant those nonsensical fragments were), and restored several sections that make it a much richer read - the telegram to Stephen, especially, opened up a lot of things for me.The book itself can get infuriating if one doesn't read it with a guide. Reading it beside the Bloomsday book allowed me to enjoy it the first time I went through it; if I hadn't done that, I doubt I would have enjoyed it much at all. It occasionally seems like he is just throwing in a different gimmick each chapter just to make it opaque - Oxen of the Sun, especially, just annoyed the hell out of me.But there are moments in this book that are unequalled by any other writer in English, and everyone should at least read it once - no matter how many people have ripped Joyce off, no one can get his style just right. Honestly, it is difficult to love this book as much as one might love Portrait, or even Dubliners, but there are moments of great compassion and insight here - you just have to cut through some of his tricks first. And the tricks usually aren't without purpose - most of them do need to be there. I find myself flipping through the book and reading some of the chapters again and again - the first two, Hades, Nausicaa, Circe, and Penelope, especially - and they're rewarding no matter how many times I read them. Beat through the whole book. And get this edition. It's worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've always laughed at X-Files fans, but I'm beginning to suspect a conspiracy. For years now, all I've ever heard is 'Ulysses' is unreadable, obtuse, unwieldly. It is anything but, being outrageously funny, unstoppably readable, dementedly inventive. Why would 'they' want us not to read it? Although it has saturated modern culture, Joyce's frightening lessons have been ignored or emasculated - film, literature, art, music are as timid and cliched today as they ever were, as if 'Ulysses' had never existed. 'Ulysses' demands that we think for ourselves, it bursts with inchoate possibilities we must take up for ourselves. Of course we shouldn't read it. But you really must get this edition (Oxford World Classics, edited by Jeri Johnson). go to 'Ulysses' bald, as I have done so many times, and you will probably throw it down after three pages, frustrated, annoyed, anchorless in a river of unfamiliar words, ideas, style. Johnson's annotation here is scrupulous. For each chapter, she registers the Homeric paralells, she discusses the various schema (each chapter has its own colour, art (eg literature, medicine), body organ etc.), she offers a brief critical precis of what is going on. Her notes, explaining historical literary, popular etc. allusions, are indispensible. With the exception of the (mercifully few) Stephen Daedalus chapters, as dense and (generally) dull as their hero, the book is a joyous breeze (well, almost). This in itself is a betrayal of Joyce - we are supposed to be jolted, confused, lost, such is the nature of modern life Joyce wanted us to taste. But he provided all his friends with clues, and we're just as good as them, right? There's no point talking about the discrete ingenuity of each episode, the depth of character, the unheard-of realism in describing their emotional and intellectual lives, the satire, the comedy, the seething anger at authoritarianism, communal idiocy and intellectual myopia, the parodies and pastiches of all literature and other cultural products. Like all great post-modern works (and like Godard, Picasso, Stravinsky, Joyce is a fertile POST-modernist, not a strangulated modernist), it will be impossible to read previous literature in the same way before, while it makes almost everything that came after it seem diluted and half-hearted. Leopold Bloom has been called a bourgeois everyman, but if only he was. His kindness, his (however unmethodical) voracious curiosity, his self-awareness, his humour, are as unusual in 1904 Dublin, as they are in our racist, money-mad, mean-minded, self-obsessed, greasy-tilled society today (I mean Ireland of course). My favourite episode is 'Sirens', the ultimate fusion of everything that is 'Ulysses' - character, language, humour, style, parody, satire, anger, emotion. Life. Now for the Wake!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What a read! Stephen Dedalus's pretentious aestheticism reminded me a lot of Thomas Mann's Death of Venice's character Gustav Aschenbach, without of course the cynical hatred of the rotten Europe, more the wide-eyed lover of the growing Dublin. Leopold Bloom on the other hand seems to be a man to my own naive (or ignorant) tastes. The poetic consumer of words versus the materialist producer of words, a unity of humanity seen through two (or maybe including Molly three) eyes. The allusions to Aristotle and Blake needed a regular flicking through literary notes and for the Proteus chapter even a German dictionary! This was no bad thing though for if anything Ulysses is an education. Like all good things it required work, but with some good notes of history and literature its a must read, as beautiful as the Lithy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is so bizarre it made my eyes itch. (But then I picked up Finnegan's Wake and it was so weird that my head fell off my shoulders and rolled into the waistpaper basket). It's worth reading though, because you'll never look at regular novels again the same way."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For the first couple of hundred pages, I found myself throwing it at the wall in frustration pretty regularly. Not merely because of the difficulty (I like long, 'difficult' books generally) but because it's a book that you've got to totally submerge yourself within. Once you get comfortable with the bizarre minutia of daily life in Dublin circa 1904, and with the way that Joyce will change register, tone, syntax and structure, often within the same sentence, it becomes a little more manageable. A little. Each section is deeply challenging, deeply strange. Just when you begin to get the tempo of one, it ends, and you sort of have to teach yourself how to read the next one all over again. It often wasn't clear to me where the mythic and mundane end and begin in this book, because they bleed into each other in different ways both structurally and thematically on almost each page. There are moments of real stylistic brilliance throughout the book (the incredible 'wandering rocks' section, the hallucinatory mythological hodge-podge of the 'cyclops' part), and there were even some parts where I was genuinely emotionally moved (the funeral scene, the final, love-affirming pages of Molly's monologue). That being said, Joyce is also an insufferable intellectual show-off. And while this might be his 'biggest' work, for my money, 'Dubliners' is still his best, because he's at his best when he makes you interested in his characters instead of being merely interested in his own intellect. It definitely helps a bit if you've read 'Portrait of the Artist' first, but you certainly don't have to. And don't bother with a reader's guide. It might help you get some of the references (and god, how this book references things), but it won't help you to actually read it. Enter at your own peril."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Stephen Dedalus, Molly Bloom, Milly, Leopold Bloom, Buck Mulligan, and Paddy Dignam, except that Paddy Dignam is dead, (as is poor Rudy), inhabit this tapestry of a book. Dead dog, body bloated, exists just beyond the sands, outside of the Martello tower, Stephen's digs. A dead father, a dead mother populate the story along with sights, smells, but most of all noise-- songs and chants. There are ditties, rhymes, advertisements, sayings remembered, refrains, art songs, Baroque and classical music filling the pages of this book.There is a great send-up on newspapers and the misinformation embodied in them. Parallels exist with Stephen mourning his mother and Bloom his father. The hectic flush indicates a finished man, a drunkard. Paddy Dignam is dead. Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam considers his last night, boozing.Molly Bloom is from Gibraltar. Eating liver, Leopold Bloom recalls when Molly laughed at another singer, Ben Dollard, who needed a suit. Poor Mrs. Purefoy has been in labor for three days. Tap, tap, tap sounds the cane of a blind man. Leopold Bloom helps him across the street. Cornelius, Corny, Kelleher is the manager of the funeral establishment. A new character emerges, the citizen. Bloom wants to meet Martin Cunningham about the insurance of Dignam. For an advertisement there must be repetition. That is the secret according to Bloom.Gerty MacDowell is lady-like, pretty. Words used by Cissy Caffrey embarass her. Another of her companions is Edy Boardman. Gerty wishes that her father had avoided the demon drink. Bloom admires Gerty's beauty and has sympathy for her lameness.Stephen, a stand-in for the author, uses a self-description of bullock befriending bard. Stephen is seeking a career in literature, and hopes to avoid a career in the church or in journalism. Bloom was warned by his father not to go with drunken goys. Bloom warns Stephen, taking a fatherly interest in his well-being, away from Mulligan.The most densely written and exciting book of the twentieth century remains exactly that. Its artistry has never been exceeded except, perhaps, in Joyce's FINNEGAN'S WAKE."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I only just finished reading Ulysses myself for the first time and believe I may provide at least some small aid for other prospecitve readers. Obviously the book is complex. I would characterize it as the most difficult book I have ever read, whoever, I would not take this as an offence to the genius of the book. I have read (and performed) Hamlet, Homer, Dante, and a host of other &quot;classics,&quot; but even if you have not you can still appreciate this work. I would be lying if I said I understood all of the esoteric references even to the literature I have read, but lets be honest how many of us can say we havn't been stumped by a book, or movie, or story, or whatever even with references relativly close to our times and places. I know people who would have no clue if I made a reference to somthing like &quot;Fight Club&quot; even though it is both a best selling book and huge motion picture success (Lord of the Rings for that fact). Don't worry if somthing goes over your head. This is not a casual novel (no Koontz or King here). This is a thematic character study. I recently heard an interesting interview with Quentin Terrantino in which he said somthing to the effect of &quot;people don't talk about 'the plot' they talk about their everyday s**t,&quot; and actually that is a pretty fair description of what the framework for Ulysses is. It is one day in the lives of predominantly two people. We are all dynamic individuals, try to immagine a day in your own life and the stresses and desires you face. What memories creep into your concious. What little games do you play at work, with friends, your lover? I bet your not the same person in all those places are you? Don't sweat it if you don't understand a word here and there just take your time and be carefull with the text. The perspectives will shift and the stream of conciousness will kick in and you have to roll with the punches.It will probably help most people to have some reference books available during a reading of Ulysses, but I personnally felt I became too distracted with every little newance (that's probably spelled incorrectly) so I just went with it. There is a reason all the ivory tower types love this book and that is because you can literally spend years deciphering all the layers. The book, like all pieces of art, is a product of its time so be prepared for that as well. It helps to have some knowledge of turn of the twentieth century Irish/English relations, world views, even literary styles of the era. I had a duece of a time getting through the collected works of Poe because so much of it was in German, French, or Latin (you know people in America used to learn Latin in school, how lame ;) ). I have rambled for way to long so I will close with a point. Many people don't understand modern classical music because they don't understand its place in history. Many people don't understand Jazz or Punk or Hip Hop because they don't understand their places in history. Ultimatly Ulysses will be like many other works of art in this regard. Take your time with it and relax with it (you are not being graded on how many of the top 100 of whatever you have read you know). You may not really like it after having read it and thats OK, but don't be a close minded neigh-sayer just because its not your style. I don't really like Russian novels, but I see their quality, just as I see the genius of Pollack, Whorhal, and Basquiatt (probably missed at least one of those names) but would rather hang a Munch or Picasso. To each his own just don't be pretentious."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In 2000, the Modern Library came up with a list of the one hundred greatest English language novels of the 20th century. Topping their list at number one was Ulysses, by Irish novelist James Joyce. After completion of this novel, I can conclude that they have made a wise decision.Ulysses follows the lives of two Dubliners, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, on a single day in Ireland. Leopold Bloom is a lonely middle-aged Jewish man who has a wife, Molly and a daughter, Milly. He also had a son that died as a child. Stephen Dedalus is a young school teacher who has seperated himself from his old drunken father. During the day, Stephen and Bloom make their seperate ways through the hectic streets and taverns of Dublin. Along the way the encounter various characters (such as the Citizen and the Anonymous Narrator) that act as symbols for Dublin society and the world in general. By the end of the novel, the theme has been understood. Like that of Homer's Odyssey (hence the name of the title), Leopold (Ulysses) has gained a son in Stephen (Telemachus), and Stephen has gained a father in him.Ulysses is undoubtedly Joyce's masterwork. He takes command of the English language, as well as nearly a dozen others, throughout the course of the novel. Various literary styles are exhibited to fit the theme of each chapter. For example, to show the busy workplace of a newspaper office, Joyce begins each section with a headline that sums it up. A complete five act drama is even included in a single chapter of this novel. Joyce's methods of characterization are also very obscure, yet brilliant. Characters are not characterized by their actions or by dialouge, but by their thoughts and fantasies. This allows the reader to see each character's hidden emotions and fears. These inner monolouges may be triggered by the smallest occurrence, then escalade into the meanings of life and death.I would only recommend Ulysses to an experienced reader with a lot of spare time. This novel is 783 pages long and takes roughly thirty to forty hours to read. Joyce's various writing styles, although genious, are very difficult to read. So, if you think that you can get past these obstacles, should you read Ulysses? There is a simple answer that you will only understand after completion of the novel: Yes."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The lovely, talented Erica Jong confessed to having skipped large parts of this momentous work, yet told people it was her favorite book. Hemingway did it a similar injustice--Ulysses deserves to be read, reread, and studied as infinitum. Joyce devoted eight years of hard work to it, and nothing like its stream-of-consciousness narrative has been seen since. Scholars take note--Faulkner never read this book!Space prevents me from gushing the way I would like to, but look for the passage in which Stephen Dedalus and Poldy Bloom are getting blasted in Dublin as a baby is being born above them, and Joyce's language begins with the Angleish of Beowulf and travels through time, touching downe with Chaucer and Sir Thomas Browne, among others. In truth, it's hard to believe that a single living human being actually sat down and created this out of nothing; to my poetic heart, it has always seemed as sacred and immutable as the sea or its stars..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've always wanted to read this novel, so this is my attempt at 58 to do so before my time runs out.

This copy is a good size, fits in a bag easily, and is easy to carry. Some editions of U have a table of contents with the Greek parallels noted--did Joyce do this at some point? Anyhow, there is no table of contents (which it typical for most editions). This makes it difficult to study, esp. to link it with annotations. I find myself going from text to text trying to find my place in U and the annotations (I use Don Gifford's text). If you aren't willing to put in the time to study the text, I would suggest a text with a table of contents, if you know U and/or like the game of the book, I would highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you've ever wanted to join the intrepid few to have done \\"Ulysses\\" from cover to cover - but have found the task too forbidding - then this is probably the easiest and most palatable way of accomplishing your wish. The two narrators bring the work to life in a way that the printed work can only hint at; with the aid of their command of a dizzying variety of languages, accents, and dialects, you grasp (fairly often at least) what the flat-looking verbiage of the text only intermittently suggests.There are, however, inherent problems with a spoken-word reading of this work. The flitting from thought to thought that characterizes much of the text is slowed down and made too deliberate. The stream of consciousness is slowed to a trickle. Eighteen hours is stretched out to forty two in this reading and the sensation of a flurry of impressions that an ideal inner reading might capture (in Heaven?) is missing. In practice, however, only somebody utterly familiar with all the recondite allusions of the text could possibly read it so rapidly and you will probably get through the work more quickly by hearing this version than by reading it silently.I thought the \\"Circe\\" episode was the most compromised in this reading. It seems to go on for ever with the narrator having to announce the identity of the speaker every couple of sentences and the sense of whirling delirium goes missing because it drags so much. I don't know if this problem can be solved but I wonder if an ensemble of voices in this episode might more closely capture its atmosphere. Another gripe is that Donal Donnelly has a tuneless singing voice and the many musical snatches lose their point as a result. Joyce was highly musical but you'd never know it from this audiobook.But I moan too much. \\"Ulysses\\" is highly problematic - I would say self-contradictory - and I can't imagine any version in any medium could possibly elucidate it completely. This version comes relatively close to giving it point and for that I'm grateful. I've finally \\"done\\" Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Since there is virtually no info about this book on this page, here is a brief description. This is a facsimile of the Shakespeare and Company 1922 edition of James Joyce's Ulysses. It is hardcover, and bound in cream-colored cloth. The book was published by Ann Arbor Media Group in 2005. The only other facsimile of the first edition (at least, that I found here at Amazon) costs considerably more. Basically, this is a cheaper option if you want the facsimile. The book is attractive and the text is nice and clear."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It is said that \\"Ulysses\\" is one of those books no one has ever read. Certainly, simply sitting down and trying to read it cold turkey is much too daunting for anyone who is not a literary scholar (and even some of those, too).The way I did it was to listen to these wonderful CDs while following along word-for-word in the Gabler Edition, published by Vintage, which is the version used by Irish actors Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie. (Purists may cavil that this is not the approved edition, but it's one that matches the audiobook.) The reading is very clear and understandable to non-Irish listeners, and journeys through Gaelic, Latin, French, and even a bit of cat language, if I heard right.Yes, indeed -- one chapter every day or two, followed by an analysis by a professor from one of those CD/DVD college lecture series, and I not only finished the thing but understood it rather well, enjoyed it immensely, gave it as a birthday present to a friend, and now plan to take a second run-through.I must caution that the book and the audio should be used together, or the reader will get lost in the stream-of-consciousness writing that seems almost schizophrenic. In other words, it's not to be listened to in the gym while jogging on the treadmill (I found that out pretty quickly)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jim Norton, the actor reading this rendition, is fabulous in all his characters.

If reading this tome while flying, don't be surprised if an attendant comments on your \\"light reading\\". A summer novel for the beach, it ain't. Start preparation with a visit or revisit to Homer's ODYSSEY which forms the circuitous modern adventures of Leopold Bloom in this one-day Dublin \\"odyssey\\" paralleling Homer's hero Odysseus. There are many excellent critical treatments of ULYSSES, which are recommended as guides once the ODYSSEY episodes have been (re)familiarized. These critical guides are not in the nature of the high school/college crib sheets CLIFF'S NOTES, which are to be avoided as the plague, but are scholarly treatments linking the classical approaches with those of Joyce's Bloom. One is advised to read one chapter of Joyce first, consider what was read and how it connects to characters and actions in Homer. If foggy, or puzzling, the treatment of this chapter in the critical treatment should be visited. Then the Joyce chapter should be reread and contemplated. So, on to the next chapter. Sounds challenging and time consuming? Yes , but what a reward awaits those who persevere. Understanding and the layered richness of Joyce will unfold. And then, you are off on the ride of your life.

Although I have spent a great deal of time thinking about the different passages, there are still many that are incomprehensible. I have only scratched the surface of this magnificent work. The book, based on the Odyssey, follows a day in the life of the ordinary/extraordinary Leopold Bloom as he wanders through Dublin. There are many historical and literary descriptions and allusions that make that day come alive. Many of the supporting characters, especially Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom, are fully realized. The final stream of consciousness passage ends with what I think is a triumphant line.If you want to tackle this book, take your time and think."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce (1882-1941) was a tormented Roman Catholic who forsook his faith, picked up his pen and wrote the great novel \\"Ulysses\\" based on the epic poem \\"The Odyssey\\" by Homer. It is impossible to explain Ulysses or give it an adequate review in the short space alloted this reviewer. Howwver, I would offer the following thoughts for those brave souls eager to enter the labyrinthal complexities of a genius's mind:Joyce tells the story of one day in the life of the people of Dublin, Ireland on June 16, 1904 (the day he first met his wife Nora Baracle). As he does so in eighteen chapters linked with similar episodes in \\"The Odyssey.\\" During the day (about 900 pages) we follow the two chief characters on their peregrinations and adventures. Those characters are:Stephen Dedalus-Named for the Greek mytholgical figure Dedalus who builds wings to fly in the sky; his son Icarus flies too close to the sun and perishes while Dedalus lands in Sicily. Stephen was the chief character in Joyce's \\"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" He is tormented by his failure to pray at his dying mother's bedside; tormented by the Roman Catholic Church's burden of guilt laid upon his soul. Stephen is an aspiring author. He is ambivalent in his feelings toward his native Ireland. As the novel begins he is living in the English built castleThe Martello Tower along with his friend Buck Mulligan and an Englishman named Haines. Stephen is a teacher who is supervised by the horrible Deasy a West Englishman who in an Orange Protestant. Deasy is a false Nestor to the callow Stephen. Stephen is an intellectual with biographical correspondence to the author James Joyce.Leopold Bloom-A 38 year old advertising man who is married to the sensuous Molly. Bloom is a middlebrow who roams the streets of Dublin plying his advertising career engaging in arguments, dreaming about a sexy young thing on the beach and saving Stephen from trouble in the famous Nighttime section of the book. Leopold does not practice his Judaism. His father was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant. The novel ends with Bloom returning home to his unfaithful wife Molly just as Odysseus returned home to his faithful wife Penelope in the Homeric epic. Bloomsday is celebrated worldwide on Feb. 2 each year (the date of Joyce's birth in 1882).c. Molly Bloom-Her nearly fifty pages of stream of consciousness prose was until recently the longest sentence in the English language. She is a coarse, bawdy, serially cheating wife to Bloom.I do not claim to understand everything going on in Ulysses. Joyce said it would take the professors and critics centuries to explore its rich minefield of literary allusions, jokes, and analysis of the human condition. Ulysses has been banned and blasted by literary critics as the same time it has been praised. You may find out yourself by giving it a close reading with a good commentary handy. Joyce plums the depths of the human mind. He is a great Irish genius whose work demands study."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I recieved a copy of this book printed in the sixties!

Some people love it, some people hate it.I found that once you get into the flow of reading it, Joyce has a way of representing thought that feels more like you're thinking than reading something. That's what they mean by stream-of-consciousness. Sure, it's old. Sure, it's dense. You probably won't understand every single sentence or word in this epic, but try it. You might like it. It's a fun - yes, fun - book. Joyce jokes around. He is witty, unique, and yes, nonsensical.I loved this book. Not everyone will, but drop your fears and read it. Its difficulty is overhyped. You'll never finish it if you don't start it. It's definitely one of the more rewarding books I've read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's a daunting and difficult prospect, contemplating the reading of ULYSSES. Much like Proust's IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, this is a book more quoted than read. It comes freighted with the most serious of professorial endorsements and a reputation for \`difficulty' hardly belied by its length.Does it justify its reputation as difficult? Yes. Does that hamper one's enjoyment reading it? Hardly at all. Jonathan Franzen's intervention in a debate about the differences between obtuse and clear writing is hardly helpful when considering ULYSSES. There should be a place for the products of literature, as for any art form, which requires the active participation of a reader, without succumbing to the charge of \`elitism'. Most great writers teach their readers how to read. The same applies to Joyce and ULYSSES (does the same apply to FINNEGAN'S WAKE? I don't know. I'm too scared to read it ...).My advice to any would-be reader - don't be intimidated by this book's reputation. Don't worry if at points, you find yourself confused or lost. Yes, there's a chapter in which Joyce recapitulates the evolution of written English to mirror embryonic development in humans. And yes, the chapter commonly known as \`Circe' is a bit long-winded. Despite that, the novel is a joy to read and to spend time with. Joyce's concerns in writing one day in the life of Leopold Bloom are life-fulfilling. There is tremendous joy, wit, fun and compassion in his portrayal of this most (un?)usual of heroes. It may help to avail yourself of the many resources available on the web. I found a lengthy pr&eacute;cis of each chapter particularly helpful at the start of my journey; and found that, about half-way through the book, I didn't need it any more. It is true that Joyce relied on allusions and references that are now all-but-lost to any modern reader. Again, don't worry. Any annotated edition will carry you through; and/or you'll find that the need to know each reference declines the further you journey along with Bloom.Have courage and you'll be rewarded. The book is life-affirming and very down-to-earth in its concerns. Joyce borrows the structure of Homer's epic in order to lampoon its myth-making and to play with its martial obsessions. Bloom is no hero. And that's the point."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can't watch The Producers now without thinking of James Joyce.

It is a beautiful story that compounds an epic journey into the sights and sounds of one day. This edition is a good place to begin reading Ulysses because it is a reprint of the first text as it appeared in 1922. While this text has many errors, many noted by the author himself, it is still one of the best representations we have of Joyce's intentions. The editor Jeri Johnson also contributes commentary that is invaluable to those people like me who are first starting to read Joyce.

Ulysses is like no other novel I have ever read. There is no plot to speak of, but you come out loving Mr.Bloom at the end of it. It's very hard to read at first, but helper books such as Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated and Stuart Gilbert's book point out what techniques Joyce is using. I think Ulysses is like a cult classic - you either get hooked on to it, or you get turned off by the abstruseness. So don't give up easy, and you will enjoy it once you start realizing the intricacies of of Joyce's Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses, James Joyce's seminal work,has had a profound effect on millions of readers. Ulysses is both crude and sensitive, lyrical and blunt, funny and sad. It shows the reader a glimpse of one man's struggle to define himself amidst the chaos of modern experience. Ulysses is, perhaps, the most important contribution that has been made to fictional literature of the 20th century.Also recommended: REDEFINING THE SELF: SELECTED ESSAYS ON SWIFT, POE, PINTER, AND JOYCE by John Condon Murray"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Simply put, this is the ultimate novel.

Well, a great pioneering work such as this would probably have to take chances or it wouldn't be the work that it is. But suffice to say, when it all comes together properly it can blow you away. My favorite sections, \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" and \\"Penelope,\\" seem to me to be unequalled in their raw intellectual and psychic power. Like the epic upon which it is based, \\"Ulysses\\" spends an inordinate amount of time and emotional energy on the nature of the marital relationship. The great tension of \\"The Odyssey,\\" the question of whether Odysseus can get home in time to keep his wife faithful, is turned on its head in \\"Ulysses,\\" where the wanderer makes a conscious decision to stay away from his unfaithful wife but is doomed to continue to wonder resignedly how he can resolve their sad situation. Don't be afraid to consult Cliff's Notes your first time through, but don't try to catch every nuance either, or you'll go crazy.

I think the people who gave it one star should forgive the book it's difficulty and direct their hostility away from it's five-star constituency. Personally, I find the difficulty of the work to be one of its many rewards. But its difficulty really starts to fade after a couple hundred pages as you get used to Joyce's protean style, and settle into Leopold Bloom's head. For those who deride the book's fans as pseudo-intellectual sycophants, I just want to say that most of the pleasures I derived from the book were not intellectual at all. I found it a very moving and uplifting story of the heroism inherent in the simple affirmation of going through an ordinary day. That Joyce implements the whole cultural arsenal of Western Civilization to conduct such a simple story is the evidence of his genius, and if that is too intellectual, I still feel richer for wading in the depths of his book. For it really contains all, or at least it seems to--the epic scope of the book dwarfs the reader coming into it. I certainly wouldn't read this book in order to feel intellectually superior to anyone. I imagine those who enjoy it rather feel humbled from the process. At any rate, I loved it. It is a treasure, the most amazing and titanic example of literature moving forward ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am on the last 100 pages of - what is in all liklihood - the hardest book I have ever read. How I feel about the book is still in question. Some parts I have found very poetic, lyrical, truthful, and yes! even slightly titillating; but, I must say, the vast majority of the book I think is not so much as boring as it is protracted and useless. However, with all due credit to Joyce, it's always honest. Very honest! I found Joyce's other work &quot;Portrait of the Artist...&quot; far more readable and inspiring. So, I don't thinks it's being unfair to Joyce when one says that Ulysses is extremely over-rated. Furthermore the novel seems to have a sort of literary snob appeal for those pseudo intellectuals (and/or Joyce-devotees) who feign some sort of intellectual epiphany from the experience of reading it. For them, yet perhaps another way to separate themselves from the &quot;unappreciative, uninitiated, unenlightened reading masses.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ulises, es un libro maravillosamente disenado, esta bien de que el autor sea tildado de pedante por haber puesto en el libro cada cosa que se le viniera a la cabeza y hacerlo un poco duro de seguir, pero el libro tiene su valor y no en vano ha siso alabado desde que salio. su complicada estructura se presta a analisis de diferentes esferas de la mente humana. se puede ver como una asociacion de ideas y se necesita de una gran memoria o de una libreta para poder encontrar las referencias o leitmotiv del libro que estan donde menos las pienses. cada capitulo de ulises representa un estilo de narracion y cada uno es una pequena obra en si independiente de las demas. que no encontremos el significado inmediato no significa que sea malo, sino que el autor no estaba pensando en dar a su obra un significado,ese surge mientras lees la obra. los capitulos parecen no tener secuencia logica y los personajes parece que hablan disparates pero si miras bien y lees con calma puedes ver que hay un hilo conductor de la historia, linda parodia de un clasico. cada capitulo es una referencia a la odisea, aunque en algunos de ellos no esta claro a que se refiere hasta el final. es una obra para gente que quiera aprender que las mejores obras estan escritas para satisfacer no a un publico sino a uno mismo y cuando el escribia quien mas disfrutaba era JOYCE LUIS MENDEZ"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses begins where A Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man left off. Stephen Dedalus has left Ireland only to return to his dying mother. Just because you've read and understood Portrait, don't expect Ulysses to come quite as easily. It's rough going in spots but well worth the effort of getting through. In the process you will be taken through 783 pages that encompass less than a twenty-four hour period in the life of Stephen, the Blooms and Dublin. And what a day it is. Everything you might imagine happens, and much more than you ever could imagine also occurs. From the uneasy start of Stehpen's day to his boring job as a teacher he plods through his mind as he tries to plod through his life. In the course of the day a man dies, a woman gives birth, Stephen finds himself at the library discussing his theories of Shakespeare, Hamlet, and that paternity may very well be legal fiction. Also during this same day Leopold Bloom is going about his routine business in Dublin and finally fatherless Stephen meetssonless Bloom. They venture off into the night world where the present and past hallucinate in a theatre of the mind living nightmare that culminates with Bloom taking Stephen under his wing. And while all this was going on, Mrs. Bloom, Molly has had her own sort of day. The Blooms have an odd relationship yet manage to maintain a bond through their thoughts that neither of them does well in putting into words to one another. Whatever they do, they do with full thought and awareness of the other. What makes this book so terrific is the wide ranges in style that Joyce uses. Each episode is like a novel in itself. There is no boredom or tediousness to get through, the main thing that makes it difficult are the constant allusions and references that Joyce makes that may have you wondering at times just what is going on. There are a number of good books to refer to while reading Ulysses and they can make it easier, but even without them, it's worth plunging forward and reading it all. The novel covers everypart of human existance from the banal to the sublime. You will not be in doubt as to what these people are feeling or thinking, their stream of inner consciousness takes up most of the book. And what's great about that is in finding out what these people are about you can learn something about yourself that you were not previously aware of."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I want you to decide for yourself. Ulysses, to some the masterpiece of all 20th century works, a glorious, sun-ravaged inspiring that is open to all nooks and encompasses all passion. Others call it ludicrious, pompous and dull; overlong; a frustrating exercise in pieceing together symbols. I want you to look over some of the other reviews and see for yourself the division between the pros and the cons; the academic justifications and the confused, ennerverated whining. The fans overpraise with unspeakable delight: believing themselves in the know--a fan of another person's excellence, a seer of all there is to know. You can scan the pages and glean all sorts of terminology, from the label of 'modernism' to the execution of 'stream-of-consciousness' (two indescribible approaches that cannot be so singularly defined as to explain just what, exactly, is going on). There are references to other experts' reviews, and the almost outraged frustration with which it is bespoken tells the person who couldn't get into it that somebody else out there has written about all the things you didn't like in the book and therefore it must be brilliance. The haters are less uniform in their scorn, although most of them summarize 'it didn't make any sense' in one form or another. There are rat-tat-tats of 'boring(s)' and machine gun slogans writing off this unquestionably influencial opus as something not even worthy of remembering.Me? I fall less in the middle and more to the side of scorn. It is a techically dazzlingly display--a rip-roar of English-Latin-Gallic with the cantor on fire and the rhythm in flames. Boom-boom-boom goes the glory of this lover of language who plays and who plays and who plays--trickling insight with the tickle of a feather and bringing the house down with a terse yet finely tuned phrase . . .The biggest problem is the story--a legitimate babble of voices talking over one another with a transformative center that can't keep anyone focused on what any of the characters is actually saying (the characters notice this too). The dialogue goes on for pages--twenty--fifty page stretches!--where no one seems to have the interest or attention span enough to keep things settled for a moment to even decide if any of them know what they're talking about. The topics shift abruptly--aloofly, it would seem--and the range of all of their interests is predictably limited. I can respect (and even admire) the effort to invoke this mindless clamor of Babel, and appreciate the consistancy that can redeem by none of them ever learning anything, but the end result is a story that no one can follow unless they had written it themselves.Ulysses is a book Joyce wrote for himself. No doubt it was joy--an endless experimentation from a frustrated (and rather pompous) author who finally felt justified at the publication of his previous two books. Ulysses, to me, reads as more of a show-off work. A man with great genius who wanted to prove to everyone just how great he could be. The problem is that he was boasting to himself. Here is a book about me me me! All passing to 'naturalism' or the 'realistic aspect' related in numerous grinding scences, are valid, certainly, but merely another label that cannot begin to describe the monster Joyce created here.In the end, an endlessly unpleasurable read that causes one to stop and think often, some of that time about setting the book aside and reading something better--"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I would have to say that I have easily read close to 1,000 books in my lifetime. I would also easily have to say that I have never read a book that was as incomprehensible as Ulysses. I really do not believe that one has to have cliffnotes or any type of 'helpers' to read and understand a book. Yet, I firmly believe that Ulysses should be accompanied by several texts explaining page by page what you just read. It was so disjointed and difficult to comprehend that I was beginning to question my sanity in even attempting to sift through it and find a plot. I would not recommend it to anyone and I feel sorry for English majors who are forced to read it.

Ulysses is the most beautiful book I have ever encountered and I would urge everyone to become familiar with it and add to their familiarity for as long as they live. That being said, the magnum opus of scholarly works this book has (and will continue to have) added is such that much of it constitutes a forever living and growing part of Ulysses itself. As such, some consistency in pagination is crucial as there is a long established convention of referring to specific lines, words etc ... that is employed by any and every Joyce scholar on the planet. Past reprints and revisions of Ulysses have either maintained the original pagination or indicated in marginalia a mapping to the original. Why Penguin would completely obliterate this (and by extension make the cannon of Joyce scholarship almost unusable) is beyond me. If you want to read Ulysses and have no opportunity to benefit from the insight of others (including those that Joyce worked with on this) then get this book and try to enjoy it in a bubble. Otherwise, it would behoove you to get a printing that respects this book and the reader for what they are."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Perhaps the British were right to repress the Irish: give them a little freedom, and this is what they do. Every redblooded fellow, of course, has appreciated an analogous phenomenon in Catholic coeds, but here, we had hoped, the subject might be literature, and more than rampant effusiveness might be expected.Don't get me wrong; I don't despise length or density. My favorite book as a kid was _Moby Dick_. I have read _Anatomy of Melancholy_ cover to cover (once: phew). My favorite novel now is _Magic Mountain_. And every several years I reread Boswell. Neither do I mind a little murk: my favorite McCarthy is _Sutree_ in preference to the one about the pretty ponies. I don't mind a degree of exigetical tussle in my reading either. I have been a English teacher for thirty years, so I have ruined more literature by careful analysis than any other cowpoke in the saloon, I reckon.Some here - preening with professorial preciosity, I think - have opined that those who do not appreciate this work, crippled by an unsophisticated need for plot, cling and suckle, eyes closed, to silly old books telling tales suited to their larval sensibilities. Well, plot or not, dull is dull, I say. Plot may be many things - a string for beads, and armature for papier-mache, a rational basis for irrational digression - or it may be absent; but the notion that playing around with plot is so terribly nouveau, and therefore so incumbent on those who would be literarily hip, is preposterous. Think of Sterne, Rabelais, Melville.Some fool even asserted that it is brilliant for a book to be tedious, for life is so, and thus a book as militantly tedious as this is true to life in a way that an interesting book could never be. What desperate rationalization is this?The first time - age 19 - that I tried to read this book, I failed to finish it. I made the attempt because it is a book \\"one\\" reads. I was \\"one\\" back then, had not yet become myself. In the end, such motivation did not sustain me. I slipped beneath the waves, drowning in a welter of Anglo-Saxon phonemes.The second time, I was a teacher, and was thinking of teaching it. I had just finished reading Will and Ariel Durant's _Story of Civilization_, so my reading muscles were unusually fit, and so I prevailed.This book is clever, sure, but that is just not enough. I love games with words, but such delightful shenanigans work best in shorter forms - in poems - or as divertissements or instruments of nuance in longer works, in the service of some literary enterprise worthy unto itself, such as telling a story.

I own several editions of ULYSSES includingother first edition facsimile editions but this one is by far the most comfortable and readable. While it isn't as visually impressive as the Easton Press edition of the 1922 Paris text, which retained the design and Mattise illustrations of the 1935 Limited Editions Club version, it is rather more practical. The binding is incredible. This book will open flat and stay open on any page, making it an absolute pleasure to read effortlessly. The page size is the same as the first edition and retains the wonderful generous margin size. This edition is remarkable for the understated elegance of its appearance. The cover is bound in beautiful blue buckram that reproduces the look of the original paper wraps of the Shakespeare and Company edition. It contains the original title page/colophon as well as the charming message from Sylvia Beech. Signiture numbers are also present. All of the wonderful and odd typos (including a few upside down letters, a result of the original typesetting process) are present and the feeling is like going back in time and experiencing the greatest novel ever written just as those first readers in 1922 did. When I first took the book out of the box my initial reaction was that it was overpriced but once I started reading it, the magnificent, exceptional quality of the book became quickly apparent. I started reading and finished it in three days, the quickest I've ever gotten through ULYSSES. Reading this edition is such a pleasure that I really didn't want to put it down. The price of the book may seem a little high but I assure you, if you love ULYSSES then you are certain to treasure this spectacular edition. I will never need to buy another reading copy of ULYSSES again. The book is so strong and sturdy that it shows virtually NO sign of wear after the first reading. The binding is strong and tight and superior to just about anything else I have seen in this price range. I am so grateful to Orchisis Press for producing this incredible edition. I love it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you loved what you heard from Norton and Riordan but want to know more about the literary bones and puzzles in Joyce's Ulysses, I highly recommend the course \\"Joyce's Ulysses\\" taught by James A.W.

The Heffernan lectures will greatly increase your understanding of the work."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Unfortunate that the reviewers listed seem to be reviewing the book rather than this particular edition. The reviews apply to Ulysses rather than the 1922 edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce's Ulysses closely parallels the events of Homer's The Odyssey, but this journey is far more surreal than Homer could have ever dreamt. The story is set in one day, and mostly follows the principal character Leopold Bloom going through the day.Ulysses does not follow typical conventions of literature, and therein lies its beauty and its freedom. The text is littered with puns and seemingly nonsensical and comical language, one of the highlights being the section written as a play in which all manner of chaos takes place. This text may at first appear to be senseless but perseverence will reward those who would spend time examining its language, which is often made up of multiple words, each constituent part of which relates to a wider topic. This is, in a sense, a scholalry text, as it is so much more than a story, and you need to have the willingness to at least attempt to understand the broader referential context, much of which I am also working on. If that seems like too much hard work, then I doubt Ulysses would provide much enjoyment to you, although that's not to say it can't be read without additional knowledge. It does help to know some of the things going on in Joyce's mind and the history/culture of his beloved Ireland.The version being reviewed here is by Orchises Press, which is a fantastic reproduction of the very first edition of Ulysses printed by Shakespeare and Company. The binding is quite tight and the print quality superb. There is also plenty of space for literary scholars to scribble notes. As it is a sturdy edition, this is built to last. There is no introduction to the text or any essays, and some may prefer this. For first time readers, it can be better to read the text without any preconceptions, just like people who would have read it when it was first published. The cloth cover on this edition, as others have commented, appears a little greener than the original, but most surviving originals have aged to appear exactly like this anyway. As it so closely resembles a vintage copy, it is a very exciting prospect to read Ulysses in the same way its principal adoptors did in the early 1920s. As it is not a vintage copy, you do not need to worry about being ever so careful. Of course, it is still expensive and it is best to treat it with care, but if you had a 1922 copy, you would probably keep it in a cabinet, trying not to disturb its delicate state. For owners of the original who would love to read their vintage copy, but too afraid to, this may be a great solution. Ordering this from the UK from Amazon, it took about three weeks to arrive here from the US, and it was a really terrific moment when it arrived, removing the clingfilm and starting reading it. It is, as a side note, quite a shame that UK readers do not favour hardback editions of books. It is quite difficult to buy new editions of classic books on hardback, unless of course, you turn to the second hand market. It is just a shame that the UK does not seem to appreciate premeire hardback editions of classic texts. oh well...In many ways the Orchises Press version suits both collectors and serious readers. Of course, it is more expensive than the paperback version, and recommended only to real enthusiasts. For me, this is a definitive edition because literary essays, introductions and annotations mean very little to me, as I like to derive my own impressions by reading and do my own research on specific things. As an MA Comparative Literature student interested in Joyce, I feel this edition can be used for serious research without the supplementary scholarly material because it leaves you free to have just the text and your impressions.If this edition proves too dear, I believe the Modern Library (or was it Everyman's Luibrary) have an edition currently in print and should be available to order from most retail bookstores. I saw a copy in my local Borders for 13.99, and if you are considering getting a decent hardback edition, perhaps you could go for that edition, as the Modern Library has an excellent range of titles and deserves to be supported.To conclude, Joyce had an extraordinary imagination and wonderful command of the English language. He is a master of the English language and this is one of his most captivating work. Personally I prefer Finnegans Wake because if you persevere with it, past the first 100 pages, you find some side-splittingly humourous puns. In any case, I will leave my fondness for Finnegans Wake for another review. For now, grab a copy of Ulysses and enter the bizarre world of Joyce where the ordinary mundane things become surreal adventures, and language becomes so unfamiliar that it begins to start making sense again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How should one read Ulysses at the beginning of the 21st century? The Modern English Library rated James Joyce's magnum opus the greatest English-language novel of the 20th century. Was their judgment correct? Perhaps (though a Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man does not fall far behind). However, Joyce's novel, which traces the misadventures of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and then Molly Bloom, is of course an echo of the Odyssey. It is also an affirmation of the Hebraic and Hellenic cultures in the West. But that is not really how it should be read. Ulysses is perhaps even more difficult to comprehend now than it was when it was first published in Paris through the Shakespeare Book Co., because Joyce alludes to modernist Irish literature, art, and architecture with breathtaking speed (though it is still far more cogent than Finnegan's Wake). However, you must read Ulysses, it is a rich cathedral of European artistry, from Joyce's command over the vernacular to his groundbreaking \`stream-of-consciousness' form. The first section of the novel deals with Stephen, and it can be regarded as a kind of carry-over from a Portrait of the Artist (though a bit more accomplished in form), while the middle section deals with Bloom, one of the strongest characters in the history of Western literature, and certainly one of Joyce's greatest achievements. Bloom is the thrust of the novel. He is the middlebrow that bridges Stephen (the intellectual) with Molly (the tramp), and his observations are the most lucid and revealing about the state of civilization at that time and place. But Ulysses is always funny, and moving and beautiful at the same time. The closing of section one ought to illustrate the strange majesty of Joyce's prose: \\"He [Stephen] turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship\\" (51). This curious novel, which unfolds over the course of a single day, will undoubtedly continue to astound and perplex readers and scholars eternally. The way to work your way through Ulysses if it is your first time, is to be mindful of the details; Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated is an excellent resource for a listing and explications of the more arcane allusions in Ulysses. Hugh Kenner's critical book is also a first-rate work of criticism for those who want further explication of the \`meaning' and significance of the work as a whole. For those who are truly courageous, you can begin to look into the Post-Modernist interpretations of Ulysses from fellows like Derrida and DeMan, but you should be wary of them, as they are often more complex than Joyce was to begin with."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ullysses is an Alice in Wonderland of writing styles.

Ulysses is James Joyce's Bible. What does one gain from reading this novel? Joyce has such a command of our language that it becomes putty in the hands of an artist. Each chapter has its own technique. Joyce wears a different mask for each section so that the reader sees the history of the English language unfold before him. Joyce remains the super-artist however, peering down from his overworld of the ulimate artist. Reading Ulysses will make all modern fiction seem to be the ineluctable flotsam in the path of the Joycean mothership. So who is Ulysses the character? What is Ulysses? Odysseus? Odysseus is the beloved Greek figure who appears in the form of Leopold Bloom. Ulysses was the despised, bloodthirsty, Roman rabblerowser who ended up in one of Dante's jivin' circles. Bloom is not Ulysses. Ulysses is something else. Everything else. A three in one of Bloom, Stephen, Molly; Father, son, mother(holy ghost); Scientist, artist, lover; the meeting place of lust and compassion: Word known to man: Love.

It is the Bible of Modernism. or something like that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"An independent discovery of self and matter rarely comes in such obtuse and atmospheric prose as Ulysses does. The most spinalcrushingly dense text this side of the Marquis De Sade and Rabelais, Joyce evolves the subconscious greatness of Bloom by using thousands of references from 20th Century Industrial Europe and weaving them into million mile high levels of plot and thought. Joyce carries subtlety and grace with each poetic sentence and each step of character development; you don't just read, you experience, you live within this world. Immerse yourself in the essence that is Ulysses, whether your teacher assigns it to you or not"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the story of one day in the life of Leopold Bloom, an Irish jew. The novel follows his travels and ends with his meeting of Stephen Dedaulus. By reading the novel, the reader is able to see Bloom's character fleshed out before his eyes, as well as to tap into the personalities of the numerous other characters on the busy Dublin street. Symbolically, the novel parallels Homer's Odyssey, depicting the great &quot;journey&quot; that Bloom travels in one day.Although Ulysses is difficult to read, it is not impossible to complete. However, before even attempting to read this novel, it is best to have previously read several other pieces of literature to aid in the comprehension of the story. You should first already be familiar with Joyce's writings; read both Dubliners to get a feel of Joyce's style, and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young to fully understand the maturation of Stephan Dedaulus' character. Next, read the Odyssey, preferrable a verse translation. I'd recommend Robert Fagles version. Finally, it is also helpful to have read Hamlet, be familiar with both the Old and New Testament of The Bible, and know a little about early 19th century Irish history.Even if you are a literary scholar, you will probably still find some parts--probably even whole chapters--confusing or even incomprehensible. One unique characteristic of Ulysses is its style. Contrary to popular belief, the book is not completely written in the stream of consciousness style. Instead, each of the novel's chapters has a characteristic style, ranging from straigt narration to an almost 200 page long play. This can be a bit aggravating for the reader. Another confusion of the chapters is there exact parrallel to the Odyssey. Each chapter does have a parrallel chapter in the Odyssey but while some similiarities can easily be distinguished in the plot, other parrallels are only apparent in symbolism and style. Because of these difficulties it is best to read the CliffsNotes on this book while reading the novel.Overall, I can tell you that Ulysses is quite interesting in some parts and very very dull in others. If you are a fan of literature, I would recomend reading it sometime. Truefully, Ulysses was good but not as great as it thought it would be. My favorite parts of the book were simply the ones that helped to reveal Bloom's character. I got annoyed by the fact that too many other characters appeared and were characterized but actually had very little to do with the story's plot. The plot itself is a bit weak and Joyce is a bit too over-indulgent and is purposefully confusing in describing some of the action of the story (its 783 pages!). Also, in order to understand all of the novel's symbols you would have to read several literary references and this would take forever. I also think that Joyce sort of went a bit too far with literary styles. Some were good but others not so much. I liked the narrative and stream of consciousness chapters, but personally thought that the play chapter failed to convey its message and was meandering. And why wasn't there a chapter in epic format (as was the Odyssey) or other form of poem (Stephen was supposed to be a poet). Finally, I do not believe that Ulysses was universal enough to be considered a masterpiece. One of the great aspects of world literature is that it is supposed to let reader from other countries understand what it is like to live in the country in which the novel takes place. Joyce did try to achieve this goal, but he presented many viewpoints about Irish politics and facts about political figures (Parnell) with even trying to allow the non-Irish reader to understand these people or concepts.Dispite its problems, I would recommend reading Ulysses but if there is any other book you would like to read, read it first because Ulysess does seem to drag on forever. Don't expect to understand all of Ulysses or be excited about unraveling its symbolism. In order to understand most of the symbolism you have to read the CliffsNotes and this kind of ruins the fun of self discovery. The book is not as contreversial as I thought it would be--really the only parts that would warrant censorship are contained in the last chapter (Molly's monologue) but these are rather provactive. Overall, the plot of Ulysses does not neccesarily always make the best story nor could I actually call it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; but the book is interesting if you are a fan of Joyce and have the time to spend on it. It took me just short of three weeks to finish it. If you are just reading the book for fun (not for a class) I'd recommend reading it over summer or a holiday because it is definately not a light or short read by any means."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For someone to revolutionize an artform is unique. But James Joyce did it with every book that he wrote. It is too bad he only wrote four but i guess between Ulysses and Finaganns Wake, a reader could spend his life decifereing them. On to Ulysses: this book is incredible. It is like a puzzle that is too large and complex to ever be finished, but at the odd moment that two pieces fit together, it is a revelation that sparks the mind and soul. Probibly the greatest peice of art that i have ever absorbed but to readers beware; it is more an art than a typical novel. Poetry, prose and passage all in one with spiritual interpretation to be discovered and shakspeare to be dissected. if you love the english language than read this book with an open mind and a hopeful heart. The book that shows the diversity of our language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This particular edition in its kindle gratis version is a shame.It has lost many paragraphs of the original text. It is made in such a crazy disorder that I needed another expensive edition to try to understand this book.This is the perfect example on why any serious reader will end by hating the e-books.It is free, yes, but that is no excuse for such a lousy work.Ulysses"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Brilliant book, a web of words encompassing centuries of literature and philosophy and its impasse on the overeducated lower middle class, a perfect allusion to a work of great literature (The Odyssey) that this book has matched well. Perhaps this is the first book to transcend the ability of what it has parodied. To those who have denied recommending it to someone of sixteen or seventeen, I had been upon this earth for a decade and a half when I came upon it, and just reread it one year later. Granted, you need a Latin dictionary and a good book of annotations to thoroughly understand it, but this book has made me realize just what a waste my public rural high school education was--Ulysses is literary heaven and hell and propagator of autodidacticism and eschews all principles of what has ever been said to create this century's magnum opus. I am exactly one-hundred years younger than James Joyce (and Stephen Daedalus), and on the sixteenth of June in 2004 I plan to! take the route of Leopold Bloom to vicariously relive it. One thing to be forewarned about: it is highly addictive. I have developed Ulysses codependency, as will anyone who gets through it. My head aches after reading it, for it is the best kind of masterpiece, the kind that attacks physically and intellectually at once. It is vulgar, carnal, and base (for its time, that is) and at once completely holy and pure because it has allowed the world to start over. Joyce is the avant-garde. He is our master philosopher and psychiatrist, who wrote the book that will never be shredded."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I know I'm itching for a whole ton of &quot;unhelpful&quot; votes here, but here goes anyway . . .I have given &quot;Ulysses&quot; five stars because, quite simply, its reputation as one of the most, if not THE most difficult works in literature, precedes itself. There has to be a reason the Modern Library or whatever organization it was voted this the Number One novel of the twentieth century.I shall read this book someday, I swear to God and all the folks at amazon.com&quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed . . .&quot;So the book begins, Joyce's version of an epic voyage, the epic voyage of Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus. And an epic voyage for the reader, who is left pondering the opening sentence: &quot;This is gonna take a while.&quot; That or, &quot;This is English? What the hell?&quot;I'm going to read &quot;Ulysses,&quot; however, by God. I want to be a well-read individual. I want to be able to display this book on my shelf with other reading trophies (&quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Mason and Dixon&quot; among them- some people hunt deer; I hunt literature). Most of all, I want to know what you blokes are talking about.Good reading, all."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"this book, more than any other work in history, literay or otherwise, stands out as the absolute pinnacle of human expression. what joyce did, obsessively and quite possibly a little madly, changed the scope of literature and art forever. any one who truly &quot;gets&quot; him is forced to marvel at his genius and revel in his audacity. p-h-d's are not required; education is not required: if you can read and you have a mind capable of being challenged and an imagination capable of expanding, you are ready to be dazzled by the most vivid, accessible display of pure genius ever produced by the species. any criticism is feeble when faced with the reality of the work. if this book is ever equaled, that day will be marked as one of the most significant in all of human history. it's all here."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle.

It's just as hard to follow IMHO, with the auditory version as it was to read it. I think with most texts you could use the audio as an alternate version, but you really need the readers guide to follow long or you'll be just as lost."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"After page 50 I decided I wasn't enjoying it and moved on to another book.

Enjoy it on your e-reader. Probably adults will be more inclined to enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses can be a tough read, but is very rewarding for those who plough through it. James Joyce writes, in this book in particular, in what I would call the literary equivalent of the impressionist style of painting. By this I mean he sometimes he uses words as if they're broad brush strokes meant to give you an impression of the events taking place as opposed to describing them in a literal sense. Once you get the hang of his writing style the book really takes off, describing, in a surreal way, the world that the main character lives in. There were some portions of the book where I was lost and didn't know what was going on, but I persevered and this ended up being a good read.If you're ready for a challenge, pick this up. If you're just looking for some casual reading you might want to find something more straightforward."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Read it a long time ago, bult now I love having at hand, wherever I go, it takes a lifetime to really appreciate this classic"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"... The critics rave about Ulysses. Many readers who've slogged all the way through proclaim it to be the greatest book of the 20th Century. Put me in the camp of those who thinks it's a pile of gibberish.It's the only book I've ever read that still had me scratching my head after three chapters. Is it a novel? A series of unrelated short stories? A poem? Apparently, only intellectuals can tell.I was taught that writing is the process of communicating with readers. This book fails miserably at that. I honestly can't summarize the plot. I didn't understand it. Maybe I'm stupid, but I think the fact that Joyce repeatedly breaks into long stretches of French and Latin and his own made-up words--none of which I understand--has something to do with it.I give the book two stars because of Joyce's obvious mastery of vocabulary, and because maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too ignorant to comprehend the genius. But I doubt it. To me, reading enjoyment shouldn't be this hard. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The book is simply wonderful, and there is nothing I can say that is more eloquent or unusual than the other many reviews before me.The only thing I would like to mention, is my thoughts on the end. That one, long, run-on sentence. To my mind at least, it felt like he understood perfectly the way a woman can think.Of course I'm generalizing, but I read a review written by a man who'd read the first 50 pages, then skipped to the end to find that flow of thought, and thought it was perfectly weird.I felt sorry when I read that, because the way the thoughts swirl in and out and round about and seem to build with 'fervorency'(is that a word? did I spell it right?), is exactly the way my thoughts wander on occasion, and I marvelled at the way Joyce seemed to be privy to that sort of, what I consider to be, 'female' thought.It was beautiful. I enjoyed it more than I can say. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A couple things: First off, everyone's heard of Ulysses, and everyone has their own notions of what they expect from a book, what they expect from Ulysses in particular, and how they feel about experimental literature in general (though by today's standards Ulysses appears vastly less experimental than, say, Finnegan's Wake). So basically, if you don't think you'll like Ulysses, you probably won't. And no, it's not a casual read. If you're willing to do some homework, though, which in my case included some Homer, Shakespeare, Freud, and Irish history (though I could go on), it just might be worth your time (lots of time) to slog through all 900+ pages of the thing. But that's just my two cents.The real reason I'm writing this review is to steer people away from the 'reader's edition' of Ulysses--that's the reason for the two stars. This is not the novel as Joyce intended--it is an adaptation by Danis Rose, and reflects what he (Rose) thought was 'accurate.' Though the changes he makes are minor--and, in all fairness, may correct oversights made by Joyce--I am offended by the idea that an editor has the ability to take an important and influential work and make changes as he sees fit. The fact that this edition was ever put to print debases the role of the artist (any artist), and reflects the increasing trend toward commercialization and dumbing-down of art in favor of turning a profit.So--is Ulysses the greatest artistic achievement in any medium, ever? I don't know, and whether I think so is irrelevant anyway. But if you want to find out for yourself, please, PLEASE, at least read Joyce's words, not Rose's."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted book -- the physical object, that is, and not just the text. (Because if you're willing to pay this much for a copy of &quot;Ulysses&quot; you obviously take that for granted.) The volume is larger in size than typical hardcover books today, meaning that the type is a decent readable size and the margins are generous (for the note jotting fiends among us). Great care has clearly been taken in the choice of paper and the sewn binding, which allows the book to lay flat during reading and insures years of re-reading. Although there is no dustjacket the cover is made of very durable material; various cover protectors can be found to stand in or, for the really paranoid, a slipcase can be made or found. It should be added that the text is presented as originally published, so there are no notes or glosses to help the first-time or casual reader; neither are the episodes keyed to any of the line numberings found in other editions. However, those wishing to refer to notes would be best off buying one of the helpful readers' companions by Gifford or Blamires anyway. In relation to other available editions, this one occupies a vast middle ground between the throwaway mass-market paperbacks on the one hand and the out-of-reach collectors' editions on the other. The book's durability and elegant though understated presentation should prove most attractive to those readers who intend to read the text again and again, whether for pleasure or for study. In short, this volume is a keeper."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How can this book be compared to others when it is so different? It has very little exciting plot. From what I have read of Joyce he has little imagination for pulling the reader to the edge of his or her seat, and keeping the reader up for hours past his or her bed time waiting to see what happens next. He does, however, have great knowledge of english language among other things, and uses it well. I LOVED reading this book, but not because of how much better it is than all other books (because it isn't), but because I couldnt wait to see what all of the fuss was about! You should definately get it for the same reason. By the way, Random House, the company that rated it number one has sole publishing rights to Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There are a few things you need to understand Joyce. A willingness to set aside race hatred is one. The ability to follow a poet even though he uses a number of different writing styles and narrative techniques. The capacity to explore religious ideas which may not rigidly conform to your own fundamentalist views. And most of all a heart which can feel compassion for all humanity, not just your own myopic tribe, sect, or church. If you have just one of these qualities you will find an unforgettable, life-altering adventure in between the covers of this book. If there is any book out there that has the power to restore one's love for the human race it is Ulyssess."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It is a mistake to try to read this book along side the Gilbert &quot;skeleton key.&quot; It would be like simultaneously looking at a painting and reading a book on the details of the painting and why we should like the painting.It is not the easiest book to get through. It is not Mike Mulligan and the Steam Shovel or any of the Lord of the Rings books. This is heavy stuff because this book pushes the written word to where it becomes art. The uncreated conscience of someone's race, perhaps.I have read it a few times. I have read certain favorite chapters (like Lestrygonians) at least a dozen. I pick it up from time to time and it is a joy. Aeolus read aloud by someone who knows what they're doing is quite funny.Read the first chapter. Read the Burgess book. Relax. This isn't a book to be consumed like a can of Busch. It is meant to be sipped and appreciated.I can't think of what other book could top the century's greatest works. Some other people prefer Busch. Nothing against Busch, but this book is like none other."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a question that has come up many times. First of all, let me make it clear that I haven't finished Ulysses. I'm in the middle of it, but I feel that I can give a fair review with the amount of it I have read, and I want to review it with it fresh on my mind. Ulysses is not the best novel ever made. Since there is nothing else like it, you can't compare it to anything. It isn't revolutionary, and it doesn't teach the reader any valuable lessons in life, like the Lord of the Rings, Catcher in the Rye, or to Kill a Mockingbird. However, it is insanely enjoyable. The monologues of thought and conversations, as well as descriptions, are beautiful. I can't recommend Ulysses to anyone, however, because I'm sure alot of people hate it. It's difficult to understand (at parts), and contains many cultural references (to Ireland), which confuses the reader even more. Something similar to Cliff's Notes might help. If you have read books challenging on the philosophical level before, I can't imagine a better choice for your next novel than Ulysses. (unless, of course, you haven't read the Lord of the Rings or the Catcher in the Rye :oP)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I will admit that I dont understand every little word of ulysses but the lyricsm of the novel of enough to warrant five stars. The way the novel goes back and forth between joyce reality and the stream of thoughts are simply increable. Increable in both how he conviced it and who effect it is. There are also just prse of pure emtion that anyone can instanitly understand . As for the charaters, all are intresting and distinct. Each word has to be read very carefully to understand what is happening but the end resut is both and intresting and intensen novel.Any one who truly enjoys ulysses should also check out Berlin Alexanderplatz by Alfred Doblin, which is also a large urban story useing the stream of concessness"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Strange as it may seem, many people do read and re-read this novel simply because they love it!It would be impossible to summarize a work such as this in a few lines, but what I love most about this work is its humanity. Joyce is not satirizing Homer: in invoking \\"The Odyssey\\", he is not so much deflating the heroic as elevating the everyday. The mundane day-to-day events which constitute life for the vast majority of us are given a heroic dimension - and, indeed, why should they not? A good, decent man like Bloom is as worthy of praise as was Ulysses.This is one of the great affirmative novels in a century where literature has, by and large, been dominated by darkness."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm sorry to say I didn't know what was going on about 85 percent of the time while reading this book.

A book like Ulysses has only one level, and it's way to deep to enjoy. The &quot;story&quot; gets lost in the chaff. I have never used Cliff Notes in my life, but was forced to buy them about halfway through this book and was surprised to find some &quot;obvious&quot; things I missed.
