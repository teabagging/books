While subsidiarity, or localisation, is an important concept that should be considered and implented in any alternative to capitalism, this book misses the point that capitalism is the problem.This book operates on the outmoded and illusionary idea that Adam Smith's capitalism, local capitalism, can be achieved and will provide an opporunity for fairness and equality. Capitalism can never be this way, as it is by nature expansive and anti-local.This book leaves out the perspectives of many concerned social actors such as Indigenous people and women. It provides the view of a very narrow selection of the anti-globalisation movement.This book is dangerous and subversive in that it appears to offer a viable alternative to the exploitation of the current economic world order, and so activists will work toward this reform of capitalism, and in the end prolong suffering and exploitation.The only way is to end capitalism and explore alternatives that are noncapitalist(and perhaps anti-globalisation as well) in nature.SMASH CAPITALISM!"},{"Title":"Alternatives to Economic Globalization","review":"This book is excellent for all those who think we can do better-that small farmers needn't be driven from the land, our water needn't be polluted, people need not go hungry while others are overfed genetically engineered chemically altered junk food, etc. It has great thinkers presenting clear, well thought out ideas about what's wrong and what we can do about it.

What lies between the covers is a very fascinating tale, almost an inversion of the Pied Piper saga, in a time when faith in near-science and pseudo meterology was not only believed, but (at least for a bit) sanctioned by the powers that be. This story provides a cautionary tale for those self-styled business folk who unfortunately believe a man's word is his bond, and a handshake forms an unbreakable contract.Author Jenkins recreates the time and the mood of Southern California in the early 1900's and recreates an atmosphere of a blossoming community pinning its hopes on a sophisticated businessman with a simple proposition: Hatfield will fill a resevoir to its 15 BILLION gallon capacity for $10,000, or San Diego owes him nothing. Surely a sucker's bet, since annual rainfall for the area is less than a foot, Hatfield is given tacit approval to proceed with his venture.The results far exceeded the imaginations of all parties involved, and the aftermath surely challenges one's belief in pseudo science and the unpredictability of the atmosphere.The book's release date of July 2005 (a mere month or so prior to Hurricane Katrina) is almost eerie in its timing, in describing a cataclysm seemingly unimaginable for a town with a bright future and numerous prospects.I'd highly recommend this book to fans of the turn of the last century, to municipal engineers and officials, to weather spotters and emergency planners, or even to just plain folk who like an enjoyable tale that still has a few surprises and twists to keep things interesting.

Who should not read this book- anyone who might want to learn something from Hegel."},{"Title":"Hegel in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"It would be ridiculous to recommend this book to anyone, it's about the worst introduction to Hegel one can imagine. The author clearly has no understanding of Hegel and lacks entirely any sympathy for the subject he is writing about. The result is a mucky hodgepodge of all the banal stereotypes and biases that have existed on Hegel in Anglo-American literature. It would be like a German writing a book on Thomas Jefferson and focusing on the fact that he was a slave-owning plantation owner. After encountering this book I questioned the quality of all the books in this \\"...in 90 Minutes\\" series, and have since stayed away from them. The Wikipedia entry on Hegel is far superior to this book as a general introduction, and its free."},{"Title":"Hegel in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"This work is an amusing cutting down to size of the philosophical system - builder whose castles in the air are more immense if not more illuminating than any other. The irrevent and very funny Strathern here takes solemn old George Frederich Wilhelm to task for not understanding that Hume had already made the philosophical enterprise impossible. He amusingly chronicles the plodding polymath Hegel's conquest of the kingdom of philosophy as he also fumbles forward and upward in his pursuit of academic place. A tragic note is the story of the orphaned Hegel's relationship with his devoted sister who essentially goes mad in the course of a life in which her brother makes a new connection, with his wife. As for Hegel's elaboration of Kant, and provision of thesis- antithesis- synthesis, the famed dialectic method that Marx would turn the world upside down with, Strathern is thin on illustrating and demonstrating it. For devouted Hegelians of which there are still probably two or three in the Western world this book is probably an insult. For most of us, those who do not think that the History came to its climax with the nineteenth - century Prussian nation- state, for those who do not think that Philosophy and Mind came to their ultimate revelation in the writings of Hegel this small work is a sensible and sane brief evaluation .One more point. Hegel understood that America was the country to watch in the coming century- he aslo understand that Mankind to be understood has to be understood historically- he probably understood a lot else which I, and possibly even Strahern don't. Perhaps Strahern might have done a bit better had he more emphasized what there is of real value in Hegel."},{"Title":"Hegel in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"I speak here not to the quality of this individual book, but the Strathern's \\"In 90 Minutes\\" series on intellectuals from history.My Credentials:Mixed. I'm not a college professor, but I use the Strathern series to accompany my reading of Copleston's nine-volume History of Philosophy, so I have a general grounding in the figures covered before I approach Strathern. I have read about twenty of his works.Review:To put it affectionately, Strathern is soaked in personality. His writing is definitely his own, and has a universal flavor that carries from his writings on Plato to Derrida. The man is witty and sarcastic, and always, always, always psychoanalyzes his subjects. This often leads to him to conclude more than is necessary or possible from the lives of famous philosophers.Strathern shows a definite bias against metaphysics. His writings on the Scholastics and German Idealists are almost painfully unfair.The set up of each work is simple: open with a biography of the philosopher's early life (usually creating a psychological theme to carry one throughout the book) and then continue writing until the time when the philosopher begins pubilcation. Here, Strathern interludes to descripe the philosopher's basic theories. The biography then continues until death, and is followed with a collection of quotes.I would not recommend Strathern as an introduction, but as a tolerable and accessible aside. His biographies are extensive and insightful, and much of his series can be found at your (or at least my) local library."},{"Title":"Hegel in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"What a disgrace this is. A ridiculous, biased and totally ineffective overview of one of the most important and influential German thinkers ever. What begins as vaguely humorous remarks about Hegel's philosophy and writing/speaking style, mutates into opinionated babbling that only serves to obscure what the reader actually came here for - to learn more about the development of Hegel and his philosophy. The few facts that do manage to filter through Strathern's annoyingly infantile prejudice, can be gleaned elsewhere online for free in about 15 minutes.Strathern clearly can't handle Hegel's insistence on spirit and divine ordinance. So, the author's personal dismissal of Hegel's value as a philosopher neuters this work from the outset, rendering it pointless. Strathern is trying to get you to do what he's already done - reject Hegel. This is totally unacceptable. It is one of the most bigoted and blinkered things I've ever come across. A massively wasted opportunity that casts serious doubt on anything this man has written, not to mention the entire series of these shortcut books.The reason I've bothered to write this is to re-divert the earnest student's attention to other avenues of investigation and learning in their study of Hegel. AVOID THIS at all costs. You will learn nothing of any meaning.

The title is somewhat misleading in that this is a global survey rather than one merely of Europe. It is also a general history of power relationships in the modern world, in their diplomatic, political, and military aspects, rather than a narrow history of diplomacy.At its core, this book tells a tragic saga, the self-immolation of Europe in two devastating world wars and the decline of European power from world dominance to near irrelevance. It also covers the rise of the USA and Russia to the status of twin super powers and, at its end, foresees the emergence of China as a mighty third pole. The bulk of the book covers the period from the Franco-Prussian war to the end of WWII and treats it, as it should, as a single arc of history. The author's command of the material is magisterial, and his tone of ironic detachment lends itself well to this convoluted story of human folly and brutality.This is a long book (695 pages) but goes quickly for anyone interested in the subject. The only other work I can think of to compare it with (in that both are popular yet supremely authoritative) is Tony Judt's marvelous \\"Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945.\\" In many ways, Ren&eacute; Albrecht-Carri&eacute;'s work provides an excellent background to understanding the postwar period and is a wonderful corrective for anyone foolish enough to believe that we live in a \`post-historical' time."},{"Title":"A diplomatic history of Europe since the Congress of Vienna (Harper's historical series)","review":"This book is easy to read and informative.

In \\"Excerpts From The Ring Cycle,\\" Tim Barela's third collection from his \\"Leonard and Larry\\" strips, he proves that he has the wit and natural humor that can carry strong stories and the positive gay images in his characters. Unlike the usual m4m stereotypes, we see our heroes tackling the day to day life of real men.But more that in any other of the four Leonard and Larry books, \\"Ring Cycle\\" goes into flights of fancy that make me wish some adventurous animator would get on board and take a stab at shining some of these stories to the silver screen. I want to see the ghosts of Brahms and Tchaikovsky haunt cowboy soap opera star Merle, and watch the saga of classical musical stalker Fiona Birkenstock as she pursues violinist Robert Mendez in a relentless effort to make him her boyfriend.And the finale could be just like in the book, as poor Larry suffers through the mental morass of being in the hospital the night his ex-wife AND lesbian-friend-impregnated-by-his-son are both on the verge of giving birth.

His intense research of newspaper accounts, letters, journals and papers of prominent loyalists of the period, has resulted in a work which is considered today a classic. The files of the Loyalist newspaper &quot;Rivington's Gazette&quot; proved to be invaluable regarding the plight and activities of the Loyalists. Van Tyne looks at the origin and evolution of the Loyalists movement, anti-loyalist legislation by the revolutionary government, and treatment of Loyalists including confiscation of property and restriction of civil liberties. He also addresses the British governbment's attitude and policies toward the Loyalists, their support and compensation during the war along with the British army involvement in the raising, support and joint operations with Loyalists units in the Colonies. Three appendices address Loyalists declarations, test laws by different states to restrict activities and principle laws enacted against Loyalists by each state.

After reading this book (and I know I'm going to draw fire on this one), it's clear to me that the American Democrats are the political descendants of the Revolutionary War Patriots, and the Republicans of the Tories/Loyalists. I'll tell you why below.This book is about those Americans before and during the Revolutionary War who did not want to divorce themselves from the King of England. These were of course mostly the rich and powerful - those who had most to lose by a change in the status quo.What happened to them is the gripping tale that is the focus of this book. The author paints in vivid and minute details as he tells the stories of countless colonial Americans who refused to become \\"patriots\\": where they went to keep safe, how they were punished if caught, what happened to them after the war, how obsequious they were to the British in charge - and how these British despised them as much as they did any other American.One very interesting point made: the masses turned neither Patriot nor Loyalist. Reminds me of Americans to this day, most of whom are neither Republican nor Democrat - or at least not strongly enough to take action one way or the other. Like their Loyalist fathers before them, rich and powerful Americans today flock to the Republican Party. They hate change. Why shouldn't they? One sometimes suspects that many would gladly chuck democracy, if that's what it would take to keep their power."},{"Title":"Michael in Hell","review":"MICHAEL IN HELLDennis LathamYS Gazelle BooksTrade paper, $16.00An author has to be either pretty sure of himself to provide the caveat \\"WARNING: This novel will cause sleep loss\\" on the back cover of his work. Latham does so, but it may have been a bit of an exaggeration. In fact, some reviewers would even go so far as to call it bombast and nothing more. But I can see how Latham might have thought this only fair warning to those who might read his novel, MICHAEL IN HELL, because there is much to leave the reader sleepless. However, it becomes very apparent to me when the first of several murders takes place that the author and I have very different definitions of what constitutes making such a caveat necessary when it comes to over the top violence for literature's sake. MICHAEL IN HELL, while most certainly is an emotive and well written character study/social sci-fi piece of dark literature, does not dig deep enough into the actual clinical detail of a man who kills child molesters and serial killers as an act of retribution in an morally nihilistic world.Tucker, the anti-hero murderer, is a man without the ability to find peace or love because of the demons that drive him. He becomes the mouthpiece for the entire bleak society around him, a sort of silent arm of God in a world that cannot make justice for lost innocence.But there are a couple of points about the narrative that caused me pause during my read. The first and foremost, and the most easily forgotten, is the fact that Latham chose to set the novel in the year 2005. Now this book was first copy righted in 2000, and was again released by YS Gazelle Books in 2007. So why wouldn't the author take the time to update this \`future' setting? Luckily, and strangely, it has no bearing on the story, so as I said, can be easily forgotten as the book unfolds.And it does unfold.With MICHAEL IN HELL, Latham isn't simply trying to titillate the \\"SAW\\" and \\"HOSTEL\\" Beavis and Butthead sub-core audience that seems to have sprung up in the last ten years or so with body count mentality. He is telling a story, using the violence as a springboard. His backroom murders become mini-Shakespearean dramas, acts for two people set against a tableau of heavily influenced by classical literature and blood and death. These bloody events are only fractals of a larger benighted jewel as Latham explores the darker side of a culture given over to its excesses: Prisons run by governments and television stations; combatants sent to death for the pleasure of the orgiastic group that bets on how far the head will rolls; street violence that traps and disables the common man's ability to find peace.Latham's greatest fear is the fear of a nihilistic society run by avaricious, ethically bereft fear mongers. And that is the true seed of this tale, his terror of what could be. What's more amazing is that Latham, who originally wrote the first version of this story for Isaac Asimov back in 1973, actually foresaw some of the most reprehensible government coordinated actions of the last ten years in his novel, years before they occurred.MICHAEL IN HELL is worth reading. It is well written; it is more than the sum of its parts; and most importantly, it does what good literature should do: It warns the reader about the dangers of a society that no longer values life.Come to think of it, Latham might have known exactly what he was doing when he placed his warning on the book's cover.--Nickolas Cook"},{"Title":"Michael in Hell","review":"In Michael In Hell, Dennis Latham takes us on a ride into a future of darkness and terror, laced with enough reality to make it believeable.

Perry Mason, although watered down in the Raymond Burr television version,is a robust man that will go to extreme measures to prove the innocense of his client. He often does this by showing the dishonesty and coercive tactics of the police, a fact still prevalent today.Gardner knew the law well and this book, as every book of his I've had the pleasure to read, has two or three wonderful episodes in which Mason uses his legal genius to further his cause. As a reader I had no idea of who actually committed the crime until the next to last page. Gardner intertwines all the facts masterfully and lets Perry Mason use his command for logic to show us the answers. Great book, and extremely entertaining. Don't let the age of Gardners books dissaude you from reading them. Like fine wine and law books; they get better with age"},{"Title":"THE CASE OF THE SUBSTITUTE FACE","review":"So, you've heard about Perry Mason and would like to read one of his books? If you were to read one and only one of the dozens of books Erle Stanley Gardner wrote, &quot;The Case of the Substitute Face&quot; should be it. This book, written in 1938, shows Gardner at the top of his form, after he had fully developed his formula, but before it truly became a formula.Gardner himself was a top lawyer. &quot;The Case of the Chinese Shopkeepers&quot; could have been one of Gardner's books if he hadn't done it himself. When Gardner heard the DA was going to subpoena one of his clients, a chinese shopkeeper in Oxnard CA, Gardner put another chinese man, who didn't speak English, in his client's store. The court officer then brought the wrong witness to court and, after much confusion, the case was dismissed."},{"Title":"THE CASE OF THE SUBSTITUTE FACE","review":"Perry Mason often uses unorthodox (even illegal sometimes) methods to find out what really happened. His attitude is described metaphorically as &quot;skating on thin ice&quot;. In this novel, Mason did not only skate but made several somersaults on thin ice. I just applauded that. But Mason's spectacular stunt is not limited to this novel. The distinctive feature of this novel will be the importance of &quot;corpus delicti&quot;, the proof that the victim is really dead and that the death is caused by another people's criminal act. If you want to know what I mean, just read the book."},{"Title":"THE CASE OF THE SUBSTITUTE FACE","review":"Background: The stylistic heritage of the Perry Mason mysteries is the American pulp magazines of the 1920s. In the early Mason mysteries, Perry - a good-looking, broad-shouldered, two-fisted, man of action - is constantly stiff-arming sultry beauties on his way to an explosive encounter that precipitates the book's climactic action sequence. In the opening chapters of these stories, Gardner subjects the reader to assertive passages that Mason is a crusader for justice, a man so action-oriented he is constitutionally incapable of sitting in his office and waiting for a case to come to him or to develop on its own once it has - he has to be out on the street, in the midst of the action, making things happen, always on the offensive, never standing pat or accepting being put on the defensive. These narrative passages - nave, embarrassingly crude \\"character\\" development - pop up throughout the early books, stopping the narrative dead in its tracks, and putting on full display a non-writer's worst characteristic: telling the reader a character's traits instead of showing them through action, dialogue, and use of other of the writer's tools.Rating \\"Ground Rules\\": These flaws, and others so staggeringly obvious that enumerating them is akin to using cannons to take out a flea, occur throughout the Gardner books, and can easily be used (with justification) to trash his work. But for this reader they are a \\"given\\", part of the literary terrain, and are not relevant to my assessment of the Gardner books. In other words, my assessments of the Perry Mason mysteries turn a blind eye to Erle Stanley Gardner's wooden, style-less writing, inept descriptive passages, unrealistic dialogue, and weak characterizations. As I've just noted, as examples of literary style all of Gardner's books, including the Perry Mason series, are all pretty bad. Nonetheless, the Mason stories are a lot of fun, offering intriguing puzzles, nifty legal gymnastics, courtroom pyrotechnics, and lots of action and close calls for Perry and crew. Basically, you have to turn off the literary sensibilities and enjoy the \\"guilty\\" pleasure of a fun read of bad writing. So, my 1-5 star ratings (A, B, C, D, and F) are relative to other books in the Gardner canon, not to other mysteries, and certainly not to literature or general fiction.\\"The Case of the Substitute Face\\": AThis solid Perry Mason mystery is an entertaining read with plenty of twists and turns and mysterious events - more sheer detection than any half-a-dozen mysteries by less inventive writers, of which, it might be noted, there were plenty populating the book racks in 1938 when this story was first published. But as good as this particular case is, the book itself is ultimately more memorable for the insights it provides into the relationship between Perry Mason and his superhumanly faithful secretary, Della Street.Perry and Della are returning to Los Angeles by cruise ship from a Hawaiian vacation, when Perry is approached by a woman who would like to engage his help in determining whether her closed-mouth husband is a lottery winner, as he claims, or an embezzler on the run. Before Mason can get an investigation off the ground, her husband disappears during some rough weather, leaving behind witnesses who swear that his wife shot him and then tossed the body over the railing. On his way to solving this tricky case, Perry manages to pull off a couple of bluffs and double-bluffs to get information from evasive witnesses, and then stages some courtroom drama that turns the tables on the prosecution and the murderer.In the course of bringing a murderer to justice, however, Perry proposes marriage to Della - who turns him down. Her reasons for rejecting the man she obviously loves will have readers with feminist leanings reaching for their picket signs and, in all honesty, there is simply no defending the bald chauvinism of Gardner's attitude. But the attitude strikes me as not truly felt; it seems more like an expedient solution to a problem that was developing in successive books in the Perry Mason series - namely, the burgeoning relationship between Perry and Della. At this point in the series the relationship seemed to be acquiring a life of its own, and consequently demanding more attention and time than Gardner wanted to devote to it. He knew his strengths well enough to realize that it was in his best interests to push the relationship to the far background and focus on the story, the mystery, and the legal twists that constitute the Perry Mason stories at their best.In this book, as in its immediate predecessors, he is groping not to establish a relationship between them, but to define it in such a way that it no longer needs to be written about. A relationship that is no longer dynamic, no longer subject to change or development, so that he can concentrate his writing on the mystery, the law, the action, and the story. In this book, with the rejected marriage proposal, he achieves that objective."},{"Title":"THE CASE OF THE SUBSTITUTE FACE","review":"If the writing style characteristic of the thirties and forties is something that you enjoy, then Gardner's mysteries are a must-read. In this early novel, mistaken identity plays a large role. We have a switched photograph, a bandaged man, a woman in thick glasses, and a family traveling under false pretenses. Perry Mason is initially involved to protect a young innocent from scandal, but he gets in deeper and deeper until it's finally all about murder."},{"Title":"THE CASE OF THE SUBSTITUTE FACE","review":"One of my favorite Perry Mason mysteries. Good murder plot with a touch of romance thrown in! Perry and Della hugs are always a bonus."},{"Title":"THE CASE OF THE SUBSTITUTE FACE","review":"This is a fun read. It's very dated, but what would you expect of a Perry Mason book? For those who grew up with Raymond Burr as Mason on tv, Perry's and Della's personalities and descriptions (and relationship!) may come as a bit of a shock. The fact that much of this book takes place on a ship is an interesting twist, although there are courtroom shenanigans as well. All in all, it was enjoyable and I plan to read more Perry Mason books -- just not right away."},{"Title":"THE CASE OF THE SUBSTITUTE FACE","review":"I generally find Perry Mason mysteries to be \\"fair mysteries\\", in that most of the time Gardner gives the reader all the clues at the same time Perry Mason gets them, allowing the reader a fair chance to solve the mystery without the appearance of an 11th hour revelation which turns the story on end.I'm a bit on the fence regarding that in \\"The Case of the Substitute Face\\". In this book, the reader is provided enough clues to at least get a general sense of what actually happened concerning the murder and its motives, but there is an important fact which is not revealed until the final moments of the courtroom section.Nonetheless, this mystery concerning a wife accused of murdering her husband during a severe storm on a cruise ship will keep you entertained from start to finish. Perry and Della are in an unusual environment during the first part of the book, placed in social situations on the cruise. Afterward, joined by Paul Drake and operatives, they spend the rest of the book in San Francisco, although Gardner doesn't really make particular good use of that locale to influence his plot ... the scene could just as easily have been his normal Los Angeles area environs.Those who haven't read a lot of Perry Mason mysteries may not realize that there is often a good bit of humor in them. In this mystery the humor is mostly limited to a short section where Mason repeatedly shows up the poor San Francisco Assistant District Attorney, but what is there is satisfying and may provide a laugh out loud moment or two for some readers.As mentioned by others, these mysteries, the earliest of which are now approaching 80 years of age, hold up remarkably well. Only a reliance on pay phones instead of cell phone communication might tip that this mystery wasn't written for our time. (Well, you might also add in that prices and sums of money might in some cases seem lower ... in this book $25,000 carries much more weight than it would today! LOL)As I've mentioned in previous reviews, there is a very good reason why Perry Mason mysteries were best sellers for decades. If you are a mystery fan and haven't yet indulged, you won't be disappointed.Recommended."},{"Title":"THE CASE OF THE SUBSTITUTE FACE","review":"PM 2 in 1 Howling Dog & Substitute FaceThese \\"2 in 1\\" Perry Mason novels were published in the mid-1970s. They had two novels combined in one paperback at a bargain price. Erle Stanley Gardner was \\"the World's Greatest Author\\" in his time, his novels outsold the combined totals of his rivals. Gardner wrote the \\"Perry Mason\\" novels from 1933 to 1970, and other works. Gardner, and others, formed \\"The Court of Last Resort\\" in the 1940s to investigate the wrongfully convicted. The background of the stories tells of the era. Gardner never put dates in his novels, but the monetary figures date these stories.Gardner's stories warned of the dangers of invalid eyewitness identification, drawing the wrong conclusions from circumstantial evidence (guilt by inference), or prematurely accusing a suspect before all the evidence was gathered and evaluated. Some stories made the point that while ballistics can identify the gun that fired a bullet it cannot tell when it was fired (before or after the crime). \\"Perry Mason\\" advised his clients to never lie to the police, it was better to say nothing except call for a lawyer. There is a famous true crime that has the above elements. Sacco & Vanzetti were convicted of robbery and murder in spite of their alibis and the lack of guilty evidence. Most believe they were innocent and were convicted as part of the political repression of the 1920s.\\"The Howling Dog\\"(1934) begins when a client complains about a howling dog. Then the client runs off with the dog's owner! Later the dog's owner and his dog are found dead. There was a visitor before, now she is Perry's client. Perry plays a fast trick to argue for his client. She is found not guilty. We learn about the howling dog. Justice was served, not the letter of the law. [Note the use of mistaken identification and the \\"Miranda warning\\".\\"The Substitute Face\\" (1938) takes place on a cruise ship. Another passenger tells of a substituted photograph. People hear a shot, a man went overboard, and now his wife is a suspect. Perry's client is arrested, Della is a material witness. Perry uses a ruse so the DA will search for two other passengers. The testimony of one clears up the mystery. Perry's client will be freed. Can circumstantial evidence defy reality? Is eyewitness evidence fallible?"},{"Title":"THE CASE OF THE SUBSTITUTE FACE","review":"This is the 29th Perry Mason novel I've read (the 12th in the series). Forgive me for giving this one less than a rave review. Usually Perry Mason sees what no one else can see--a sort of mid-20th Century Sherlock Holmes. In this case the only surprise about the solution is that it takes Mr. Mason so long to happen upon it. The most interesting feature of this story is Perry Mason's marriage proposal to Della Street. (Holmes' own Doctor Watson got married in the &quot;Sign of Four,&quot; but his wife was killed off in &quot;The Empty House.&quot; I guess his wife &quot;got in the way&quot; one too many times. Could Della suffer a similar fate?)"},{"Title":"Sword of the Heart","review":"Maureen Kurr won the Romance Writers of America's Golden Heart Award in 1985 for her first novel, NORTHWARD THE HEART. After that she wrote three more historical romances (see list below). Each is a rich historical romance that, while moving at a bit slower pace than you might be used to, with perhaps more introspection than you'd see in a modern novel, they are still ones you may want to read though you'll have to find them used.SWORD OF THE HEART is set in 14th century France, and tells the story of beautiful Alix Beaucamp and Philip de Saines, both from noble families in Brittany. Philip is a knight, who after witnessing one horrible night of death at the hands of his fellow knights, laid down his sword and turned away from fighting forever. Now, after a scandal in the French court that says he cuckolded his good friend, he returns home to find his estate falling down from neglect after the Plague (the \\"Great Pestilence\\"). All think him a coward and a subject of scorn, including his own family. But Alix knows better and loves him. When her father betroths her to Philip's brother Justin, a man she cannot stand, she and Philip desperately seek as way to make Philip a man both families will accept.One of the things I liked about this story was the hero's constancy. Philip never stopped loving Alix, nor she him. Her trust in him as a swordless knight never faltered and though he had to overcome many obstacles to gain their families' approval of their marriage, he did so with unwavering diligence. It's a good one for a rainy weekend.Maureen Kurr's novels:NORTHWARD THE HEART (1985) - Golden Heart WinnerSWORD OF THE HEART (1987)FOR HONOR'S SAKE (1987)DECEPTIVE HEART (1988)"},{"Title":"Savage World (Phoenix Force)","review":"I WANTED TO BUY THIS BOOK BECAUSE I NEED TO FINSH THE SERIES AND ALL THE OTHER BOOKS HAVE A GOOD STORY LINE AND PENTY OF ACTION IN THEM AND ITS A SPIN OFF FROM THE EXECUTIONER SERIES WHICH ARE ALSO GOOD BOOKS TO READ"},{"Title":"Forty something forever: A consumer's guide to chelation therapy and other heart-savers","review":"\\"Forty Something Forever\\" by Harold &amp;Arline Brecher, is, with the exception of its title, one of the best investigative reports and consumer guides ever written in the field of medicine.What is most impressive is the fact that all statements are backed up by substantial medical authorities and references, including names, addresses, and phone numbers of many doctors and organizations all across the USA.After reading the book I rejected the risk of a second bypass surgery and decided to try chelation therapy in the Big Island of Hawaii where I live. I chose the medical supervision of Doctor Clif Arrington, recommended by the book for this region and voted one of the island's two best doctors.Not only did my personal experience more than confirm all I had read in the book, but I was exposed to other patients, and, after hearing one astounding story after another, I undertook the task of interviewing several for the good doctor's website. ...I recommend that you get copies of this book to give to those suffering from any of the conditions best treated by chelation therapy.Aldo Vidali - Aldo@uneco.org"},{"Title":"Forty something forever: A consumer's guide to chelation therapy and other heart-savers","review":"I believe this book saved my husband Jon's life. I found the book on Valentine's Day, 1997, while searching for a gift for Jon, who had been very ill. By the next day, I had consulted the ACAM site, www.acam.org, to do a search for a local doctor who would do chelation. A few days later, the doctor did a full-body Doppler test which showed that my husband had 80% blockage of his carotid arteries. (A second Doppler test done by a different doctor on a different machine a week later, gave the same results.) Doc also took a hair sample. Lab analysis showed that Jon's hair (and therefore his body) was loaded with toxic metals, from a lifetime of working in a machine shop. He got chelated after checking out the safety of the alternatives (grim). Chelation was cheap, safe, and 7 weeks later, my husband's blockages were gone. He is hale and hearty today.Guess what, chelation will also work beautifully and quickly AFTER someone has had a stroke, too.

It is &quot;must&quot; reading for anyone interested in the problems that now exist between Israel, the Palestinians, and Israel's neighbors."},{"Title":"Personal history","review":"Vincent Sheean pioneered the foreign correspondent memoir with \\"Personal History.\\" It is a forgotten book, but one that any foreign correspondent, would-be foreign correspondent or plain history buff ought to read. Sheean had a Zelig-like quality of finding himself in international hot spots throughout the 1920s. But it wasn't simply by chance. He repeatedly risked death to visit with rebel leaders and to better size up what they were doing. In doing this, he was following the fundamental craft of a journalist: pursuing the truth.I thought I knew history pretty well, but I hadn't heard of several of the important events that Sheean covered. Nonetheless, he brought them alive with his harrowing tales of dodging bullets and bombs and his personal style of reporting. Sheean even foreshadows some enduring lessons, especially from the Arab-Jewish conflict that he covered in 1929 in Palestine."},{"Title":"Personal history","review":"PERSONAL HISTORY starts with Sheean's student years at the University of Chicago followed by his first job for a New York Newspaper. As soon as he can scrape up enough money for the boat fare, he leaves for Europe. Just two years out of college, he lands a job as foreign correspondent for the European edition of the Chicago Tribune with offices in Paris. Through the years the newspapers change and his salary increases but he remains a journalist and author.The most exciting parts of PERSONAL HISTORY are those sections dealing with his visits to the Rif where his life is often in danger as he visits various Moroccan Bedouin tribes, even as they are being bombarded by the Spanish. One short entry from his diary gives a feel of his life in the Rif.&quot;Sept. 4th. Just after lunch, at 2:30, Mahdani appeared. I followed him to a deserted place in the dunes where I changed into Arab clothes. He walked to Zaina's, I followed, hiding my face in a hood. . . . . we started across the frontier . . . . Crossing very difficult -- many searchlights, much firing. None of us killed. Sleep in a Ditch.&quot;Other diary entries speak of near starvation, heat exhaustion, freezing cold, blistering heat, and the constant threat of death from unfriendly bands of Arabs, from the Spanish, and from the elements. The flip side of the coin is that as the only western journalist in the Rif, Sheean's reports created a journalistic sensation.The longest segment of the book centers around Sheean's experiences in China and Moscow during the latter part of the successful revolution in Russia and shortly after Sun Yat-sen's defeat.In Moscow, he becomes friends with Rayna Prohm, an American woman who had helped to prepare the way for Madame Sun Yat-sen's escape from China, and who is a confidante of Borodin and Madame Sun Yat-sen, among others. Mrs. Prohme is described as enthusiastic, brilliant, dedicated and charming. Although unstated, it is obvious that Sheean was deeply in love with Rayna Prohme to whom he dedicated PERSONAL HISTORY. The most tragic moment comes when Mrs. Prohme, only in her early thirties, contracts encephalitis and dies.Her funeral was held on a cold, dreary Moscow day. The funeral procession, in which there were Chinese, Russian, and American Delegations marched for over three hours to the crematorium. Madame Sun Yat-sen, whose money from China had been cut off, and who had no warm clothes, walked for the entire three hours shivering from the cold. She was offered a ride in a warm automobile, but refused, wishing to show her love and admiration for Mrs. Prohme. It is obvious from Sheean's descriptions of his emotions and his feelings of loss, that Rayna Prohme's death was, at that time, the biggest loss in his life.The book concludes with a short section describing Sheean's experiences in the Holy Land at a time of violent clashes between the Arab and Jewish communities. It is at this point that Sheean loses his objectivity and forgets that a good journalist approaches his subject without bias. He engages in revisionist analysis of four or five thousand years of history and becomes an advocate of one side based on this unorthodox revisionism.Each segment of PERSONAL HISTORY stands on its own. I would particularly recommend reading the two sections entitled &quot;The Rif,&quot; and &quot;The Rif Again&quot; as one stand-alone episode, and &quot;Revolution&quot; as another. Sheean's writing in these segments is particularly interesting. His loss of focus and objectivity in the &quot;Holy Land&quot; section should not be seen as cause not to read the other, excellent portions of the book."},{"Title":"Specimen Tank","review":"Specimen Tank is a potboiler in the grandest tradition: reading it is a curiously ambiguous act of masochism.

The author, by petulantly throwing the ladder away after we have scaled to the heights, leaves us stripped at the pinnacle, wondering if this novel has clarified our vision of ourselves or clouded it?

This book is the first volume of a collection of papers from a person of the former category, and gives an interesting and helpful overview of his work. Game theory could properly be characterized as mathematical economics, since there is usually no attempt to empirically verify its conclusions, but its use does give a perspective on what might be possible when groups of individuals come together and seek to maximize their gain.The author is clearly aware of the skepticism by some regarding the applicability of game theory to economics. In the first article of the book, entitled \`What is Game Theory Trying to Accomplish,\\" the author outlines his apology for game theory, with his main premise being that game theory offers insights, or \`solution concepts' into social processes and that its use should be judged by how well it performs in applications. He is definitely (and correctly) against philosophical speculation regarding game theory, realizing that such activities complicate matters rather than offer clarification.Four of these \`solution concepts' are discussed in this article, giving the reader not only a look at the author's viewpoints, but also a historical/conceptual overview of game theory. One of these solution concepts, the famous \`Nash equilibrium' is without doubt the most extensively used in applications, such as in evolutionary biology and bandwidth allocations in telecommunications networks, to name a few. Another solution concept, called the \`core' is also discussed in some detail. It represents when outcomes can \`dominate' other outcomes, i.e. when there is a coalition that can achieve an outcome by its own efforts, with each member preferring that outcome to another. The core of the game is the set of all undominated outcomes, and encapsulates the notion of unrestricted competition that leads to stability. Studies of the core led to the \`von Neumann-Morgenstern stable set, also discussed in this article, and which is a collection of outcomes that are not dominated by any element of this collection. The stable sets represent social organization and are globally stable, unlike the core outcomes or Nash equilibria. The author views the N-M stable sets as being \\"moderately successful\\" due in part to the difficulties in calculating them. The last solution concept discussed is the \`Shapley value', which is viewed by the author as a measure of the power of a particular game or coalition, and one that is the most successful of all concepts in cooperative games. Extensive references are given for readers interested in applications of these solution concepts.One of the papers in the book, entitled \\"Irrationality in Game Theory,\\" the author takes a somewhat radical position if compared with the usual assumptions that are made in game theory. The author considers the content of the article is being part of the \`current frontier' in game theory research, and it calls into question the rationality assumption. This implies that the players do not necessarily engage in utility maximization. When approaching this paper one is naturally curious as to what can actually be accomplished in game theory when the rationality hypothesis is dropped. The author wants to study what would happen if one considered environments where players may be both rational and irrational. His study involves the use of an \`information system', which consists of a strategic form n-person game, a (finite) collection of \`information states' assigned to each player, an assignment of a pure strategy to each information state, and for each information state of a particular player an assignment of a probability distribution on the information states of the other players. The information system represents the uncertainties of the players. One speaks of the \`surmise' of a player as his (probabilistic) estimate of the information states of the other players, and her \`belief' as a surmise on the pure strategies that the other players choose. A player is called \`rational' at a given information state if the strategy she chooses maximizes her payoff according to her belief at that state.In the article, the author studies information systems where some players are irrational at some states. The payoff in this study is to resolve certain paradoxes in backward-induction, such as the repeated prisoner's dilemma. A player who is not rational would be expected to introduce behavior in the game that would not exist if the players were all rational. The usual results in game theory would not be expected to occur. Such an expectation is discussed in this article in the context of \`crazy perturbations.' The author briefly reviews the literature, which in general involves finding the Nash equilibria for a repeated game where one of the players has a non-zero probability of playing irrationally. This \\"crazy\\" behavior on the part of an irrational player has the effect of changing the behavior of the rational players. It is found that the rational players wind up mimicking the irrational player to a degree that is optimal for them. The rational players act irrational in order to force other players to act in certain ways. These developments are very interesting and further work on irrational players will no doubt have many more surprises. One would like to know for example what the upper bound would be on the number of irrational players before game theory analysis would become useless. In addition, it would be interesting to find out to what degree a rational player has to act irrational in order to maximize her utility."},{"Title":"Miracle of Love (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"This is book 3 of the 4 part Christ Mind series. Book one taught us how to love unconditionally, book two taught us a recipe for spiritual healing, and book three continues the journey with how to stay connected to love in the face of difficult people and circumstances that challenge us.This book focuses heavily on the idea that almost all fear, anger, and hurt stem from your feeling unloved or unappreciated, and is a cry for love and understanding. Unfortunately, when you respond in a hurt or angry way, the other person feels invalidated by you, which leads to a downward spiral of attack and mutual non-validation. He goes on to say that other people's judgments, criticisms, complaints, and attacks say a great deal about their OWN consciousness, and very little about the one they are judging. Understanding this is the core to staying connected to love in the face of these conflicts and challenges.Ferrini writes, \\"Each of you must find a way to stand up lovingly for yourself without putting other people down. Your regard for yourself is essential. It is precisely that self-regard that must extend to include the other person. Extending your love in the face of someone else's fear is the most difficult thing you will ever have to do. Yet it is essential that you learn this.\\"We take some major steps on the path to wholeness when we can be responsible for our own behavior and have compassion for others who are exhibiting bad behavior. Ferrini carefully leads the reader through a thorough understanding of how to make the necessary mind shifts for this to occur. I cannot recommend this series of books high enough. They are more valuable than words can express."},{"Title":"Miracle of Love (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"This is a must read for recovering religionists! If the God you have been told about all your life doesn't fit your belief system you just found one of the &quot;right&quot; books to read. It's shocking, God is truly loving and forgiving! This work is definately inspired by the teachings of Jesus in today's language. Sin and guilt no more, thanks! I urge you to get the whole series, it will change your perception forever."},{"Title":"Miracle of Love (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"Paul Ferrini's gift is the conveyance of love and all that it has to give to us. Negating the ego and its fear based mode of being along with all its destructive aspects. Submitting ourselves to the all encompassing power of love and the resulting peace it brings is described in such a poetic and eloquent manner that no arguments to the contrary could ever be won. We all have the choice between love and fear. This book and the many others that Paul Ferrini has written describe the world that will emerge from the chaos and insanity we see today. Just wonderful."},{"Title":"Miracle of Love (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"One of the most important books I've read besides A Course in Miracles. The other books by the same author are good too. I'll probably reread it a few more times!"},{"Title":"Miracle of Love (Reflections of the Christ Mind)","review":"I like most of Ferrini's books but I was appalled when I read how he feels that there is no such thing as evil and we must love these people. Love mass murderers, rapists, child molesters, Adolph Hitler, Kim Jong, Chavez and other heartless, cruel dictators? I don't think so. This section was about one third of the way through the book. I was so disgusted, I stopped reading it and threw it in the trash where it belonged. If there is no distinction between good and evil, what is the point of a civilized, moral society or even believing in Jesus Christ and God? Warped view. Don't know if I want to even read any more of his books. What a disappointment. This is what is wrong w churches and many christians. Political correctness."},{"Title":"Jubela","review":"Rhinos are dying by the thousands every day due to illegal poaching in Africa and Indonesia. This book focuses on an African rhino. Rest assured that it is a very true story: the likelihood of a calf being orphaned due to poaching, and the way that older rhino females will \\"adopt\\" those orphans, describes actual rhino behavior. The most striking things about this particular book are the magnificent illustrations as well as the writing, which you could actually believe is the way a young baby rhino calf processes its world. The language is descriptive and earthy, simple and easy to grasp (good for young readers), and rich with texture and feeling. And as one of the editorial reviews notably points out, there is no anthropomorphizing here. Both author and illustrator play it straight and true.Kids really need to know about this topic, and this haunting, hopeful book will help them realize what is going on in the world regarding humans and animals such as rhinos. Be prepared for questions such as, \\"Why did they kill the baby's mommy?\\" Such issues are not addressed here; Kessler is operating on a more visceral, non-polemical level. That is not to say the book lacks depth regarding the destruction of rhinos at human hands. Just be ready with the answers regarding poaching -- the \\"why\\" answers -- when you share this with children. If you need information, e-mail me or go to \\"Google\\" and just type in \\"rhinoceros\\" or \\"poaching.\\" You'll find out all you need to know."},{"Title":"Jubela","review":"Jubela will please young readers. The book begins with baby rhino Jubela playing in cooling mud and being lovingly cared for by his mother: \\"Just before sunlight surrendered to darkness, mother scraped the dry mud from baby's body with her great horn. Baby sighed with pleasure.\\" When poachers take his mother's life, Jubela is alone and confused and hungry until an old mother rhino adopts him and teaches him how to survive. An author's note explains that Jubela is based on a true story that occurred in Swaziland. The illustrations, by JoEllen McAllister Stammen, are colorful and soft-edged and enhance this compassionate tale."},{"Title":"Jubela","review":"This story not only gives an overview of African animals, it also tells a touching story of a rhino whose mother has been killed by poachers and is left to fend for himself. The pastel double-page spreads beautifully depict the story's mood. An excellent choice for public and personal libraries."},{"Title":"Stranger in the Nest: Do Parents Really Shape Their Child's Personality, Intelligence, or Character?","review":"David Cohen presents an outstanding look at what makes us who we are. This book has a strong academic foundation, presented in an intelligent and humorous style making it a pleasure to read. Cohen's last book, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; has become a classic reference for the clinician interested in depression. Stranger in the nest seems destined to become an indispensable volume in the ongoing debate about nature versus nurture and the role of parents in a child's development. Many diverse issues are discussed and many difficult questions are articulated. This is a very satisfying contribution to a field where important questions abound and research continues."},{"Title":"Stranger in the Nest: Do Parents Really Shape Their Child's Personality, Intelligence, or Character?","review":"In Stranger in the Nest, David Cohen skeptically examines the role of parents in shaping their childrens' lives. The book is loaded with examples from dozens of studies of twins, adoptions, and family life. Cohen concludes that children are shaped by their genetic endowment more than their parents' style of rearing.Although he does an excellent job of highlighting the confounds, difficulties, and overgeneralizations from many areas of psychological research, his contribution to the field is neither novel nor particularly readable. Cohen points out that correlations between parental behavior and child behavior are confounded by their relatedness, and in so doing illustrates the fundamental problems with research in this area. He returns again and again to relatedness, or genetics, as the answer to why children resemble their parents.In this regard, Cohen was beaten to the punch by Judith Rich Harris' book, The Nurture Assumption. The Nurture Assumption is a much better book than Stranger in the Nest, in part because it covers both the child's peer environment, his home environment, and his genetic endowment all at the same time and in greater depth than Cohen does. Cohen's book is also defective in that it presents no organizing hypothesis or overarching framework: it is a series of detached anecdotes and synopses of various studies, interspersed too liberally with rhetorical questions.I agree with Cohen's thesis that genetics matters more to childhood outcomes that we usually acknowledge, and often more than parental nurturance. I found the author's style too dense and punchy, skipping from point to point and not analyzing each major aspect of parenting in sufficient depth.Those interested in this book would find essentially the same argument and a lot more from Judith Rich Harris, and a more enjoyable and better organized book, to boot."},{"Title":"Stranger in the Nest: Do Parents Really Shape Their Child's Personality, Intelligence, or Character?","review":"As a teacher, I was struck by Cohen's ability to communicate highly technical research findings in a clear, vivid, and highly readable manner to an educated lay readership (the intended audience). As a scientist, I was deeply impressed by the rigor and intellectual honesty with which you approached the central issues at have. And as a parent, I was grateful for the opportunity to understand more fully the limits of my own influence over the personalities and characters of my two children.The central theme of the manuscript obviously runs counter the most of the conventional wisdom about child rearing and its effects. But when one considers the heavy and unfair burden of responsibility that many parents have felt when their children have suffered from such maladies as autism, drug addiction, and sociopathy, it is high time that this conventional wisdom-with its almost complete absence of scientific foundation-must be challenged by responsible scientists.This is a profoundly compassionate book. . . . I will recommend it enthusiastically to friends and colleagues who themselves have experienced similar family problems. In writing this book, which I know has been a labor of love, Cohen has performed a great service, both intellectually and morally."},{"Title":"Stranger in the Nest: Do Parents Really Shape Their Child's Personality, Intelligence, or Character?","review":"Today the result of our obsession with NOT being responsible.....has reached ghastly proportions.....three year olds being drugged to the gills because parents are keen to note abnormalities they might have been able to accept.......kids being drugged before any symptoms show....people dying from misuse of these drugs...etc...etc....I mean what did we expect?Psychotherapy has failed because the talking cure doesn't help most people and it is too expensive and everyone is so screwed up most people couldn't get a good shrink if they waited (or saved up) for twenty years.And now we know most problems aren't \\"psychological\\" anyway (except in the results!!) but \\"genetic\\".This begs the question, and encourages the misuse of the unethical pharmaceutical technology, as well as an approach to childrearing that is too sophisticated for most parents. Too many built in contradictions. Too much unreality. I mean if a child is failing in school what parent is going to love the kid MORE because of \\"bad genes\\"....when logic dictates the parent will feel MORE helpless, and MORE at a loss re: any interventions....and communicate this to the child. Even while collecting prescriptions for any ominous-sounding drugs!The \\"science\\" of gene mapping has gotten way out of hand, and this is only one result.How about lets clean up the environment of the deadly toxins that cause genetic mutations and strange phenotypic outcomes....and quit assuming that in this toxic soup of a planet, more chemicals piled on top of already overpolluted and toxic kids will produce outcomes more in line with our narcissistic daydreams of personal success and personal happiness.Dr. Cohen seems like a nice guy but he had no idea what the implications of his beliefs were...any more than any other ivory-tower type who confuses \\"artifacts\\" with \\"results\\".....and pretends to be objective when it is ALWAYS easy to be \\"objective\\" when describing the phenomenon of a degraded human spirit...due to things that are understandable and controllable...compared the dissolving mystery of the human genome....and then the silent question \\"What now?\\"In the absence of environmental solutions the dissolving mystery of the human genome will just be one more problem.....now that we know why we are the genetic creatures we are, who can help us with our massive and growing social psychological and spiritual disconnect from a world we can only now dream about....?Dr. Cohen has written a very compassionate-seeming book....but mostly it just reiterates the \\"Puritan Ethic\\"...which states that if you get what you need instead of someone else getting it, it it because you were more virtuous and therefore one should not have strive to make it possible for more (or most) of us to get what they need. Pride of accomplishment....a feeling of being the \\"best\\" in some things...etc....are only things achieved on one's own.....and I say EVERYONE wants what the luckiest have. Most people are also too humble to admit it.But some people who should know better actually know better. If massive environmental assaults are hurting the land and water and air and other species.....why should we humans be exempt? And why does ignoring a global assault on the well-being of all life....protect ANYONE...least of all those who have played the genetic crap shoot and won?Maybe people feel \\"honored\\" when other people use esoteric and little-understood concepts to \\"explain\\" human behavior, and maybe that's why they latch onto them.Bad reason though.Maybe we can learn enough so that the kids would not be born that way to begin with...... except for the occasional Ethan Hawke character in \\"Gattica\\"....who had enough basic intelligence and character to succeed in spite of all predictions. But I'm referring mostly to those who could never ever be anyone's role model on any level.And make no mistake....these people are very much blaming themselves.It's not a pretty picture.And there is NO drug to help these ones. A more humane society would go a LONG way to help..... As well as DOING something with genetics-education that amounts to more than continuing with the same old thing....rewarding our gifted children and shaming the rest of them.We HAVE got to do better than this!"},{"Title":"Stranger in the Nest: Do Parents Really Shape Their Child's Personality, Intelligence, or Character?","review":"The distinctive point in this book is that the &quot;somewhat chancy interactive effects of nature and nurture are surprisingly perverse.&quot; This is a crucial point for the so-called 'nature-nurture' debate.

Each of the five parables is introduced as a story Jesus told; like the parables in Scripture, all or most of them suggest the salvation story.

The children love to flip to the title page to pick a color of story they want you to read.

This true story was written when the author was in her 70s. She depicts the life of a student of anthropolgy early in the 20th century, and the indiginous people on the west coast whose history she and her famous husband were trying to preserve. More fascinating, however, is the love story which creeps into the narrative almost without the reader realizing it. It is an intimate story of two people who, according to the culture at the time, should never have been together, but who found a simple and profound joy in being together.

None were tougher and more determined than Harrington.Everything in turn-of-the-century California was changing at a breathtaking pace. What was happening to the Indians, the bulldozers were doing the same to this rural State.Into this maelstrom walked in Laird, a pampered middle class girl with her Sunday hat.

And, it's neither on a best seller list nor by a well known author.This is the real thing. The American Indian West as it was documented by the greatest linguist-ethnographer, John Peabody Harrington, a genius who was so obsessed with recording data that he ignored traditional routes of academic prestige. Today he would probably be labeled a manic-depressive.Carobeth Laird, writes an intensely personal reminiscence of the seven-year period (1915 to 1922) when she was married to Harrington. The couple traveled the West as field ethnographers during the formative years of American anthropology. This was the beginning of the time when the Indian family consisted of a father, mother, some children, maybe grandparents, and, an anthropologist. A scholar in her own right, Laird wrote this fascinating book in 1975 when she was days away from age 80. That in itself is noteworthy.Harrington's notes were meticulous and copious.

The reproductions I've seen in the past reduce the size of the art like watching a 70mm film on a regular TV set.Nothing is being produced like this anymore. McCay's talent is beyond amazing, it would take a normal artist months to produce one page like he was doing every week. The book is exhausting and I can only read a dozen pages at a time.

Did not expect the amount of artwork and extras in this book! Windsor McCay was a revolutionary artist before his time!! Wish he were around today....PHENOMENAL!!!"},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"This book is the one. I was made aware of Winsor McKay's Little Nemo in the late 1970's, and have been a fan ever since. I've been amazed at how far ahead of the curve McKay was, and how much of an influence he was on so much art so much after his demise.The adventures of Little Nemo were wonderful- by that I mean full of wonder. The colors were bold- way bolder for his day than anyone else. The panels blew off the limitations of convention as McKay left the restrictions of flat panels behind, letting the story demand its own, unique and innovative visual perspectives. Uh-oh- I'm sounding like an academic here, and I'm not. I'm a Little Nemo enthusiast and I'll let the experts explain in laborious detail what I cannot.What I can explain is that Nemo was a startling experiment in his time, and if you want a definitive book that will allow you access to his adventures in Slumberland, then this is the one. If you want a more comprehensive overview, I guess Canemaker is your man. Canemaker's is a great book, too, and has the biographical details. This book has enough text for you to understand the strip in the context of its time, but lets the art speak for itself. This is the best book I've ever seen for the sheer joy of Little Nemo.This is the only book that reproduces the comics in full size, and the editor swears that he has taken all the necessary pains to get the colors right. I will take his word for it, as I have only seen Nemo in other books and in preserved strips of the day, and who knows what the original colors were? Mr. Maresca has sworn that he took the time to get the colors right, and they are fantastic. And seeing it in its original size is a revelation. Nemo was magical, the Harry Potter of his day.I have collected Nemo books and emphemera, and this is the one that is the most...exciting. Another bonus for me is that it has strips that I've never seen before. And the strips are reproduced in sequence when sequence is important, so a story can play out over several weekly installments. This is a big, oversized delight, and if you can't enjoy Nemo, you can't enjoy Shrek or The Incredibles.

He worked modestly anddutifully all his life, drawing, drawing, drawing, riding the Eltrain from Sheepshead Bay to Manhattan every day, laboring in ashabby office, always wearing his hat, even indoors, even whileworking.He was silently working wonders. Practically plotless as a dreamitself, Little Nemo is today regarded as the most beautiful work ofgraphic art ever to appear in a newspaper.The mechanics of it were simple. It would begin with a fancifulframe, exquisitely drawn. Then McCay would go to town, building thefancy to impossible heights, ever-more-marvelous reaches of visualimagery, until at last the whole thing collapses and, in a tinyframe at the lower right-hand corner, Little Nemo wakes up andrealizes it was all a dream.It was visually astounding. It still is. Yet people wrapped fish inMcCay's masterpieces; they lit stoves with his pages. Little Nemowas never much appreciated at the time it appeared, though todayoriginal printed pages go for $30,000 or more.Now, thanks to an extraordinary new book, it is possible toappreciate what McCay had in mind, what he wrought. A selection ofthe best of his work, actual size, has come out at last. Nemo hasn'tlooked this glorious in a hundred years.Peter Maresca, a former Apple computer designer who idolizes McCay,has published at his own expense a huge handsome book, Little Nemoin Slumberland: So Many Splendid Sundays!, which costs $120.Done to honor McCay on the centenary of Little Nemo's firstappearance in print, the mega-volume measures 21 inches by 16 inchesand weighs more than 8 pounds. It was printed in Malaysia, on paperlaboriously sought out from Japan. It is so big it had to behand-bound. It exceeded the capacity of commercial bindery machines.It reproduces faithfully, and in their original size, McCay'sastounding visions in color and reproduces them \\"down to the lastpixel,\\" the publisher says.\\"This shows you the insanity of my mind,\\" Maresca said. \\"I wanted toget the exact look of the newsprint. I didn't want pristine whiteborders, and I didn't want the yellowed Scotch-taped effect. So wetook five background pages and blended them to get the right visualtexture, the grays and greens that real newsprint has, and then wehad to blow it up twice to get the exact grain. I wanted a veryauthentic background.\\"Even after a century, the splendor of McCay's work has the power totake your breath away. His huge, columned, sapphire-domed,night-clad cityscapes, his fantastic beasts, sparkling ice-caves,outsized butterflies, tremendous fireworks, dizzying perspectives,his giants, his gems, his multicolored mushrooms and airships andskyscrapers and elephants -- all these were outpoured weekly in atremendous, wide-irised, full-spectrum rush of perfect draftsmanshipthat still exceeds the special effects in most movies today.\\"He anticipates the wide screen,\\" Maresca said. \\"He loved thetheater. He captures a lot of the exploding technology of his time.He was working when the Wright brothers invented the airplane, whenthe New York subway system was being built.\\"Nowadays Nemo is revered by illustrators like Maurice Sendak, whosemagic island in Where the Wild Things Are owes a debt to McCay'sSlumberland. He also influenced Bill Watterson, whose Calvin andHobbes also has a small boy who dreams wild dreams.At the time, though, it was just one more comic strip in a host ofhigh-quality offerings being put out daily by furiously warring NewYork newspapers. It was never syndicated. It played only in NewYork.\\"It never was all that popular,\\" said Mickey Finn cartoonist MorrisWeiss, 90, of West Palm Beach, who met McCay in New York in 1934,the year before the artist died. \\"It never really took off. It wastoo whimsical.\\"Weiss was scarcely 20, McCay was nearly 68 when the two met. McCaydied shortly afterward, in July 1935.\\"He was a slight man, very quiet. He always wore his hat whileworking,\\" Weiss remembered. \\"He didn't have a big, palatial office.\\"He was very nice to me. He gave me an original of one of hispolitical cartoons. If you look at it, it's incredibly detailed. Youlook at something like that up close and you think: 'Wow, theeffort! The work!' But if you're a cartoonist, that's what you do.It isn't work. You are completely into it, and you do it.\\"McCay was born Sept. 27, 1867, in Spring Lake, Mich. He was the sonof an indulgent merchant-father who early recognized his talent.\\"I never saw a tramway or an electric light before the age of 15,\\"McCay said later. \\"But I loved to draw.\\"An art professor named John Goodeson taught McCay the power ofperspective. His lessons would result in some of the most dazzlingdrawings in newspaper history. Using perspective, McCay was able tosuggest limitless distance in the space of a few inches.The young man went to Detroit and became a quick-sketch artist in alocal \\"Dime Museum,\\" a sort of vaudeville fun-house. He enjoyed theapplause and for the rest of his life would seek fame and publicapproval that always seemed to elude him by a hair's breadth.At one point McCay was doing three separate comic strips a week aswell as appearing in a nightly vaudeville show, where the audiencewould challenge him to draw anything in a few seconds. He would. Hewas a slave to his pencil.He went to Chicago in 1889, Cincinnati in 1891 and New York in 1903.There he would work at a pace so prodigious, turning out drawings soprolifically, that their sheer volume is still staggering. They wereall done from scratch: No celluloid overlays, no Adobe Photoshop.Just ink.He began with strips titled The Jungle Imps, Mr. Goodenough,Sister's Little Sister's Beau and The Phurious Phinish of PhoolishPhilip's Phunny Phrolics. McCay finally arrived with Little SammySneeze, a running gag strip that built up to a huge climax in whicha child would sneeze and blow everything and everyone away.He struck a vein in 1904 with Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend, whichpresages Little Nemo and which purists still consider his cleverestwork. Every strip begins with an ordinary situation, which graduallygets warped, magnified, pushed and shoved out of all recognition. Inthe last frame, the hapless dreamer awakens and swears never to eatWelsh rarebit (a toasted cheese sandwich) again.The crazy dream, followed by the rude awakening, became the patternfor Little Nemo In Slumberland, McCay's masterpiece, which debutedon Oct. 15, 1905.The first strip began with Nemo flying through the air in asnowstorm, meeting strange winged animals including a kangaroo. Thevery second episode was one of McCay's masterpieces, reproduced inthe new book: A forest of multicolored mushrooms whose tall stalksbreak at last and whose caps fall in a soft avalanche. The thirdepisode had Nemo surrounded by storks on impossibly tall, glassylegs that gradually become entangled chaotically.On it went, getting more and more magnificent. The modest littledraftsman from Michigan produced Nemo every week for just over sevenyears, ending on Dec. 29, 1912.As time went by, Nemo gradually took on social issues, going to Marsin a huge, beautiful airship where he finds that a rich mogul hasbought up all the air and charges people to breathe it.\\"You have to buy your words,\\" said Maresca of that particular story.\\"The culture is completely overcrowded and polluted on Mars. On airvending machines you have signs like 'CUSS WORDS WILL NOT BE SOLD TOMINORS.' People are shipped off to work in tin cans. I find it notunlike the times we are living in now.\\"The air-monopolizing Mars-mogul was a subversive comment on theexcesses of the Gilded Age, when huge amounts of wealth seemedconcentrated in the hands of a very few people. One of them,publisher William Randolph Hearst, was to become McCay's employer.He clipped the cartoonist's wings gently, directing him to dopolitical cartoons on subjects that Hearst decreed. Nemo wasresurrected in paler and paler versions as late as 1924 to 27, butthe brilliant fire of the early strips looked more and more likeembers.McCay meekly obeyed all his bosses. The last part of his career wasa falling-off. He showed up for work each day, put in his hours,drew industriously. But apart from a foray into animated film (hisGertie the Dinosaur was one of the first cartoon movies), he neveragain produced anything as fantastic as Little Nemo.The first 5,000-copy press run of So Many Splendid Sundays isalready practically sold out, with orders coming in rapidly fromeverywhere, France in particular.\\"I'm having to ration them out,\\" Maresca said. \\"I'm trying to befair. If demand warrants, I will try to do a second printing latethis winter.\\"\\"This heartbreakingly beautiful book... \\" \\"This stunning volume... \\"\\"This beautifully done book... \\" &ugrave; cartoonists Art Spiegelman, GarryTrudeau and Patrick McDonnell have raved over the new, giganticreprint.There is a sense of justice at work here. At long last, thanks tomodern computer technology and Maresca's own personal collection ofMcCay pages, it is possible to time-travel back to those splendidSundays when you could buy a masterpiece for a few cents."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"I had read about the size of this book, but I was truly surprised by just how large it was in my hands. It's essentially the size of entire front page of a paper like the New York Times (length-wise and width-wise). It really has to be seen (or held) to be believed. Aside from being difficult to carry on the subway and having difficulty figuring out where to put it on my shelf, the size is much appreciated.As for the inside, the images have been reproduced and cleaned-up with such loving care, it is truly amazing. While there is little information on the life of Winsor McCay, other books out there have thoroughly discussed it (the Canemaker McCay book with Sendak introduction is worth getting for those interested). Around 100 of Maresca's favourites have been chosen to represent Nemo, some of them being the most complex of McCay's Little Nemo series.My only regret is that there is not more. The editor has indicated that he will not release another volume, but I wish he would reconsider. A few years back, Fantagraphics released six books of all of Little Nemo's exploits, but those books, while nicely done, reproduce Nemo in smaller format, and they have long since gone out of print (as will this book soon I'm sure). Further, as Maresca chose 100 of the best pages, what little continuity exists in Little Nemo is somewhat lost. Granted, each Sunday's adventure was often independent of the previous Sunday's, but not always.Regardless, Maresca has done an incredible job and should be commended for helping preserve some of the most incredible work by an underappreciated American artist. Surprisingly, Maresca could not get a publisher to take on this project, such that it was self-published. Hopefully this edition will do well, and there will be more to come either from Maresca or a publisher who realizes that a full-sized complete reproduction of McCay's work would be a worthwhile and profitable task to undertake."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"These are the best reprints of Little Nemo I have ever seen. The paper is off-white, the colors are bright - there is no need to buy the original sheets from hundred years ago any longer. But don't expect lesser known pages, they have all been reprinted by Remco and Fantagraphics before. We should all thank Peter Maresca for this labour of love. And McCay deserves it: between 1905 and 1910 he invented the grammar of the comic strip. His panels are not crowded with figures as in later years, the lay out is imaginative, and some early pages are really scary and subversive.By the way, there's more underway: a German collector is preparing a large Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend book for all those people who think that the Checker reprints are a bit to small."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"Very good - and impressive - edition of Little Nemo in Slumberland. Beware however of the fact that the edition is not complete. It covers a subset (120) of the pages produced by Mc Cay between 1905 and 1910, and therefore does not sport the complete story of Little Nemo over this period. So if you want to buy the book as an art book, do not hesitate. It's gorgeous. If you want to buy the book to read the story of Little Nemo or to offer to a children, than you'd better look at other, older - and probably less visually appalling - editions of this classic."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"Let's be honest: this book's not cheap. Is it worth the price tag? Without question or hesitation: yes. If you're even contemplating buying this book, I probably don't have to tell you how great the Little Nemo strip was. What you'll want to know is that this book will make you feel like you've never really seen Little Nemo until now. It is a magnificent, absolutely stunning book.First of all, this book is huge. McCay's work is reproduced at its original size, which reveals his superb draftsmanship in all its glory. If you remember Little Nemo as lovely but kind of cramped, you're not going to believe how open and expansive the strips look here.Secondly, the color reproduction is superb. I'll take the editor's word that a great deal of effort was expended to match McCay's original coloring directions. What I will say is that the colors here are vibrant without being garish. It's really unbelievable that such sophisticated color work comes from a strip that's a hundred years old. I don't think most newspapers today could pull this off.You really have to see the book to appreciate how incredible it is. This really sets a standard against which the other collections I've seen fall far short. If you can swing the price, you won't be sorry. You might, however, have a hard time finding a place to store it!"},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"I had never heard of Winsor McCay before my husband brought this book home. I was stunned by McCay's work, by the detail and beauty of the drawings, by the clever and imaginative (and funny) stories, by the whole visual impact. I can't even imagine opening up your Sunday paper to THIS every Sunday. Thank you Peter Maresca for giving us this great gift. I only wish my son were six so we could share Little Nemo's adventures together. How he would have loved this."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"This is the most beautiful book I have ever seen. Having purchased the complete Little Nemo book series in the 1980's I really looked forward to finally being able to see this lovely comic in its original format. When the book arrived today I realised that it was even better than I had hoped for, extremely high quality and of impressive size.The only drawback is that it does only contain a selection of the story, but I can always read the missing pages in the cheaper old edition. A big applaud for the publisher who dared produce this wonderfull piece of art."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"I was one of the lucky few to get my hands on this astounding book before it sold out and I must say-lucky me. For those of you who savor outstanding draughtsmanship and deeply appreciate the graphic art form of the comic page, your ship has come in. This tome is about as faithful a rendition of Winsor's Little Nemo as any 21st century cartoon connoisseur will ever see. Page after inventive page, the LNIS-SMSS reader is rewarded with drawings that recall the dreams of earliest childhood. A second edition is very likely, buy it, and transport yourself to slumberland. The grandeur, narrative and art of this book's oversize pages are a true joy to experience. The only shame is that with only 5000 copies, few will be able to treat themselves."},{"Title":"Little Nemo in Slumberland","review":"If you don't yet own this book then don't pay extra for the out-of-print 1st or 2nd printings. The new 3rd printing adds 9 additional Sunday pages making it the best version to own. If you have not seen the Nemo pages reproduced at their full size and wonder if it is really worth the price the answer is YES! The artwork looks amazing at its original size each page is a beauty. Having also owned smaller versions of the Nemo pages it is much more enjoyable looking and reading them at the larger size. This is easily one of the best comic strip collections ever printed. The second volume of Sunday pages is also highly recommended."},{"Title":"Playboy Lingerie, June 2007 Issue","review":"Playboy Lingerie, June 2006 is ninety-four pages long and ninety-five percent of the models are not wearing lingerie.

I'm a sucker for lingerie - and the gorgeous babe on the cover, Louise Glover from London - sealed it for me!Ms. Glover - who is also Playboy's Model of the Year (MOY) - is featured across the first EIGHT pages of this issue -- with the last image being a two-page spread of Louise lying on her back -- with her string bikini (finally) working its way down her thighs. (Hey, this is Playboy, remember?)The best news is that Louise's outstanding pair - which look a little pushed up on the cover - are nearly as flawless and firm in the remainder of her photos even though they are totally unsupported! (Damn her!)The rest of the magazine (past Louise) features SEVENTEEN other girls, all blondes and brunettes, evenly divided. And this pub appears to alternate back-and-forth between them. (I thought the blondes in this issue were particularly hot!)Focusing more intimately, I couldn't help but notice that over half-of-the-girls were totally clean-shaven (a sign of the times?) - with the rest sporting a line of tuft just an inch-or-two wide (about the size of an extra large band-aid). Unfortunately, this bodily affection was scattered throughout the magazine in a little more random fashion, so seeing all-of-one or the other will require a little digging!I should also mention that there are two pages towards the back of the book - with the kind of info, stats, or quotes that you'd expect to see as captions in a normal monthly issue. Each woman is highlighted - in the same order as she appears in the magazine - so it's very easy to match up the words with the babe who said it!For those wanting a reality check - each girl's cup sizes (B,C,D, etc.) and measurements (in inches) -- are also listed in this section.My favorite models were (in order of appearance), Amanda Duncan (once engaged at 17), Sasha Gardner (sky diver), Sarah Smith (Vancouver), Erica Campbell (a former MOY), Sofy Somosy (London), and Jennifer Hurt (4' 11\\").In terms of art direction, this issue is supposed to be about Lingerie! And even though each girl sported some kind of sexy undie (at least at the start), the book's layout didn't appear to be devoted primarily to this topic. It was more like each girl just happened to be wearing some - so Playboy used it as a theme (which was just fine by me!).For explicitness, this edition is about on par with the regular monthly magazine and Playboy DVD's. (No surprises there!) The style of some of the pictorials, however, wasn't as glamorous as those in the regular mag. But their relative simplicity - actually helped to convey each model's \\"girl-next-door\\" cuteness better - so I actually found this assemblage to be more satisfying overall.As an (almost) final note, on the last page, there's a tantalizing rear-view of a girl -- wearing a sexy string bikini - under the title of \\"parting shot\\" (cute!).To conclude, when one compares the number of pictorials found here (18) - to the monthly mag (3) - this Playboy Lingerie issue is a Great Value!(Ladies, Playboy needn't be just for guys! And buying through Amazon - is a lot more discreet than acquiring this publication at the newsstand! Also, if you're interested in seeing more interaction amongst the women - be sure to check out Playboy's Special Edition of \`Girls with Girls' - which I found to be exquisite! Enjoy.)"},{"Title":"Playboy Lingerie, June 2007 Issue","review":"Firstly must say I usually like Playboy monthly product but these SE's are FANTASTIC!

Golden is increasingly forgotten today, but his writing was often a warm trip down memory lane. Golden wrote about and generally embraced humanity, the USA, the family, Jewish immigrants in New York City, Christianity, North Carolina, church matters, economics, etc. Golden had heart for the little guy, wrote candidly about sex, and one was of those rare southern publishers that opposed segregation in the 1950's. Ironically, or perhaps not, his newspaper was popular among Christian clergy. This book is now dated, but its warm and insightful look at humanity still applies."},{"Title":"Writing on Drugs","review":"Overall, I found &quot;Writing on Drugs&quot; interesting, in that it not only covered how various writers have written about, and on, various drugs, but also how the use of drugs -- legal or otherwise -- have shaped our society. However, the book was poorly organized, with the author jumping from topic to topic without any transition or explanation. The editors didn't help much -- the layout of the book is such that the reader cannot easily discern when one chapter has ended and the next has begun. Finally, Ms. Plant failed to give specific sources for her information. Yes, there is a list of references, but within the text, one cannot tell where she got her information. This is especially disconcerting when she goes on about the CIA involvement in drugs. I don't necessarily dispute the accuracy, but when someone makes such damning statements in public, she'd better be able to back them up, or risk losing credibility.In the final analysis, I'd recommend waiting for the paperback."},{"Title":"Writing on Drugs","review":"Sadie Plant--and I enjoy the inevitability of her name--has delved into the world of drugs, but she has seemingly fallen prey to the same lack of focus and inability to grasp any essential truths that haunted the writers of whom she (sometimes) writes. As she eloquently puts it, &quot;Writing on drugs has evolved and mutated like a contagion, each writer reading the others' work, repeating their adventures, amd also their mistakes, endlessly rehearsing the same refrain.&quot; Indeed. And Ms. Plant has continued this somewhat dubious trend.This really is a book without boundaries--and it could use some. Does &quot;Writing on Drugs&quot; refer to writing under the influence of them or simply writing about them after use? (Or just writing about them, period?) Is it actually about writers? If so, why are we treated to insights like the fact that Hitler received injections of speed daily or that Coca-Cola was developed from a wine first produced by John Pemberton? Is it actually about literature? If so, why then so much on Freud who, as far as I know, never thought of himself as a &quot;literary&quot; figure, nor spent time writing about literary figures? And then we have three or four closing chapters that have absolutely nothing to do with writers, writing, or literature. They are interesting in many ways but beg the question, Just what is the focus of this manuscript anyway?If ever there was a book in search of a ham-fisted editor, this would be it. Ms. Plant has been given leeway to fairly much make any connections she pleases about drug use and how it has infilitrated our modern society and consciousness, and in many ways I applaud her efforts and her skill as a writer/researcher. But, please, if that is her aim--to tie together as many strands as possible--let's not market the book to the public under the title of &quot;Writing on Drugs,&quot; unless that title is to suggest that &quot;on&quot; means &quot;about&quot; and that anything but the bong and the Hendrix T-shirt can be tossed in. I mean, the marketers clearly call this an &quot;exhilarating literary exploration.&quot;That said, I think the book pursues its many subjects with a gleeful brio and a fine-tuned sense of inquiry. I learned quite a bit from these pages. There were some literary insights from writers as diverse as Artaud, Coleridge, Nin, Stevenson, Michaux, Cocteau, and Paz. (Unfortunately, they are countered by continual references to Lewis Carroll and that Master of Junk, William Burroughs, which seem almost beneath Ms. Plant's abilities. And, please, why so much discussion of DeQuincey, a footnote in literature at the very best?) There are chapters on the structure of the human brain, which makes it so susceptible to drug ingestion; the economics of the drugs from the eighteen century to the present day; a history of opium that for once and for all made some sense to me of why we had the First and Second Opium Wars, something no textbook ever did.This book gave me the sense of two people peaking on LSD, both brains awhir, both trying to express to the other the mulititude of impressions, feelings, colors, and sensations coursing through their neurons, and neither really ever having a chance because communication in such extreme circumstances is a suspect business at best. If Sadie wants the reader to understand drugs and their place in literature (or society) better, perhaps she needs to drop the metaphor and method of dope and write instead in a more sober, focused fashion."},{"Title":"Writing on Drugs","review":"a moving , eloquently written story about the plants that shape humankind. This work reads like a journalistic overview of the subject as opposed to a penetrating scientific discourse, which is refreshing.It's more of a readable, easily digestible (pardon the pun) work for a general audience. Other works on the topic are more detailed but few are as accessible and enjoyable.Well done."},{"Title":"Writing on Drugs","review":"This is a coauthored review by one who recommends this book and one who does not. Both Rendi and I have read this book and whereas I found this book to be little more than annoying, Rendi enjoyed it. We realize that some readers may appreciate this book for the same reasons that Rendi enjoyed it and other readers may regret purchasing this book for the same reasons that I did. I had thought of a good way to explain why I did not appreciate this book and as it turns out this also a good explanation of why Rendi enjoyed it.Imagine two people have bought tickets to a college lecture entitled \\"Writing on Drugs\\" which, as the title suggests, was supposed to be about historic (non-medical) literature concerning and/or inspired by psychoactive drugs and the influence of this literature and the drugs themselves on Western culture and world economics in the last few hundred years.One person had been trying to collect information on the historic literature on drugs and was in need of some sort of professional chronology of this literature. Armed with a note pad and pen, ready to take notes, this person was hoping to get some good information; authors, titles, publishing dates, and so on. The other person, being much less detail-oriented, was simply hoping to enjoy a good talk on this subject.In the actual lecture, the speaker seemed quite knowledgeable about the topic but unable or unwilling to present her knowledge with any sense of order, consistency or focus. Rather, she rambled on and meandered off track for most of the talk spending only a small portion of the time actually discussing literature pertaining to drugs. It seemed as if she had the potential to give a good, orderly talk on the topic but showed up too high to do so. The person took few notes because little note-worthy information was given and half way through he put down his pen and pad in disgust. The other person sat back and enjoyed the meandering off-topic ramble for what it was - interesting.This book is parallel to this hypothetical lecture by the seemingly stoned hypothetical lecturer. Depending on what you would hope to get from a book entitled \\"Writing on Drugs\\", you may or may not like this book.I, for one, was hoping for dates, authors and book titles; not necessarily in a tight chronological order, but I hoped that I could at least gain some sort of orderly (even if only partial) list after taking notes and arranging them to my suiting. But Plant often gives authors without book titles and book titles without dates or even any indication of what era the works of literature were written or published in. Inexcusably, quotes are given without sources in the main text or even in notes. How can one quote a book without giving an author or book title?Plant is also frustratingly inconsistent. As one would expect, she discusses DeQuincey, Coleridge, Ellis, Ludlow and others. But she gives only scant mentions of Huxley and other important authors, little more than tenuously relevant quotes from William S. Burroughs, and neglects to mention the likes of Hunter S. Thompson's semi-fictional \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" and Tom Wolfe's \\"Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\\". If she considers Freud's professional works on cocaine to be within the scope of this book, why not crucial works of Richard E. Schultes, R. Gordon Wasson and the like? Leary, Metzner and Alpert's ground-breaking book \\"The Psychedelic Experience\\" is mentioned, but what about the important works of Huston Smith, Stan Groff, Jonathan Ott and many others? If she can astutely mention the obscure historical fact that the occultist Aleister Crowley administered mescaline to the audience of his theatrical ritual \\"Rites of Eleusis\\" then why not his seminal essays on hashish? What about Terence McKenna's \\"Food of the Gods\\"? Why not Ram Das' \\"Be Here Now\\"? If Plant misses or declines to mention so many books that I only chanced upon by browsing through mainstream book stores, then how many more books has she missed or declined to mention? I shudder to think, especially because I paid good money for her \\"Writing on Drugs\\". Perhaps she should have titled it \\"Random and Incomplete Discussions of Writings on Drugs and Other Loosely Related Topics\\".There is also a lack of focus in this book. Plant discusses some of what Sigmund Freud wrote concerning cocaine and how his use of cocaine deeply effected his formulation of his thinking on psychology, which in was a huge influence of psychology as a whole. But then she goes on to discuss psychology in general and for too long. Interesting, but off-topic. She also discusses the neurological mechanics of how some drugs work in the brain, the economics of the opium trade in the colonial era, the evolution of drug prohibition, and other topics related to drugs but only loosely related to literature or else not related at all. Again, perhaps this book should have been publicized as a work on drugs and civilization and other loosely related topics, not as a book concerning literature on drugs.Indeed, I jokingly voiced the question of whether the book title indicates that its subject is about literate pertaining to drugs or that it is a book written by an author while on drugs. It reads like a book on the literature of drugs written by an author while on drugs. Unlike a lecturer who perhaps got too stoned just before their talk and who blew a single chance at giving a good speaking engagement, an author cannot give the same excuse. A book takes considerable time to write and the author has the chance to rework, rewrite, revise and edit their manuscript while sober. Unless an author has a problem ever being sober, I can see no excuse why a non-fiction book should be sent to press in such a form. Many musicians have particular nights where they put on a bad concert because of they were too drunk that or high, but the same excuse can not be used to explain a bad album created over months of different recording sessions.I would give this book 2 out of 5 stars. But to be fair, Rendi will now give his opinion...Unlike Justin, I enjoyed this book. Justin is more detail oriented - he reads exclusively non-fiction literature and he reads to learn - so I can understand how such a reader would be frustrated by Sadie Plant's presentation. I, on the other hand, read for enjoyment and found this book to be very interesting. I also have learned a lot that I did not expect to get out of a book on drug literature. In his \\"Food of the Gods\\" Terence McKenna discusses, among other things, the role of the opium trade on the economics and politics of the colonial era but in this book Plant goes into much more gratifying detail of this underplayed aspect of history.Plant also goes into some detail about a number of other interesting subtopics related to drugs in history. I had heard that speed was used by the Third Reich and had wondered if Hitler was a speed freak. But I did not know that soldiers and leaders on both sides of the war used so much speed, making rash, aggressive and paranoid decisions with the lives of so many mortals. Many of us know that Coca-Cola originally contained cocaine but Plant gives us a good bit of the history of Coca-Cola, cocaine and the gradual withdrawal of cocaine from their formula just before there were legal restrictions on the drug. She also talks about the widespread use of opium, cannabis and other drugs in cough syrup, \\"medicine\\" to quiet teething babies, and so on.I would imagine there are other books that go into more detail on this, but I found Plant's chapters the hidden politics of cocaine and heroin to be fascinating. I had read hints about the sordid webs of secret underhanded dealings involving U.S. government agencies, foreign drug cartels and corrupt governments, the United Nations, the Taliban, Vietnam, Laos, the Iran-Contra scandal, and so on but in this book Plant goes into enough detail to clarify but not bore a reader such as myself. I, for one, did not know that the Taliban got much of it's money from heroin derived from the poppy fields in Afghanistan - though I should have suspected. After reading this book I wonder if, like Vietnam, the invasion of Afghanistan had a lot to do with taking over poppy fields for the lucrative heroin black market than for the idealistic reasons the American public swallows hook, line and sinker.If I were to attend that hypothetical lecture, I would have relaxed, sat back and listened with interest while Justin sat there feeling a bit cheated out of his money. Justin is right when he says that only a portion of this book pertains to literature about drugs but I thought it was a good read anyway. I recommend it. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.Since Justin gives it 2 stars and I give it 4, we will average this to 3 stars."},{"Title":"Writing on Drugs","review":"As an anthro. involved in drug research and who himself has nascent plans to write about the uncanny relationship between the drug experience, the writing process, and literature, I really wanted to love this book. I respect the author's endeavor to the task of exploring the subject, but, unfortunately, the violent aggregation of all the book's shortcomings have prevented me from finishing it in its entirety.Like others have rightfully said, references are disturbingly non-existent, the writing is stilted and confusing most of the time, and the content desultory of the highest order. This is not to say that the book lacks any value; in fact, one can fruitfully excavate valuable gems of information once the trauma of reading her prose subsides.Overall, it is clear that the author intended to write the book in an experimental mode that reflects the activity stated in the title: writing on drugs. \\"A+\\" for trying; \\"F\\" for failing to execute this elegantly."},{"Title":"Writing on Drugs","review":"Disjointed, disconnected, and shrouded in mystery all seem to be themes which surround drugs, whether one is speaking of their history, their effects, or their economics and regulation. Sadie Plant attempts to connect and demystify many of the areas of this subject in her book Writing on Drugs. Throughout the book, Plant tries to tie the various areas that fall under the subject of psychoactive drugs together with an underlying theme of the effect which psychoactive drug use has on authoring literature, but she fails to consistently connect this theme to all of the areas which she covers. The result is that the quality of the book is greatly diminished, and starkly contrasts with her very apparent writing, researching, and connective abilities. The book does provide useful insight into its subject, and should be enjoyable to readers interested in psychoactive drugs, modern sociocultural history, or literary creativity. Through its various historical perspectives, it has provided me with a better understanding of psychoactive drugs and their wide-ranging effects, and in spite of the confusion which sometimes results from its inconsistent theme, I recommend this book to those readers with a little time and a desire for an information-packed introduction to psychoactive drugs."},{"Title":"Writing on Drugs","review":"i read a lot of books, and hate most of them. this one was actually really good.multi-faceted, doesnt try too hard, just uncovered some rich material between the overlaps of the things. very well done."},{"Title":"Five Seconds to Air: Broadcast Journalism Behind the Scenes","review":"I've been a fraternity brother of Bob's for many years and enjoyed following his career in TV journalism, although I haven't talked to him since 1972.It was a fun read for me since I know him.You always wonder how someone gets from point A to point B and C and this book helps answer those questions.I admire Bob for coming back to his roots in Tulsa after all these years.

If you like oral history, then you'll love Studs Terkel. Famous for his classic book \\"Working\\", he seeks out common \\"unfamous\\" Americans and simply asks them to talk about what they think about Race and race relations, in this book. Written in 1990, the book is a little dated, but still holds largely true. There are around 100 interviews in this book. He interviews about an equal amount of Blacks and Whites with some other ethnicities mixed in, and like in all of his books, he interviews about the same number of old and young, men and women, and middle-class and poor. (No mention of anyone's sexuality though.)Some highlighted stories are from a white former Ku Klux Klan member and a black former civil rights leader are interviewed some two decades later. The Ku Klux Klan member has become a hard-core anti-racist radical who is President of his union which is more than 80% Black. The former civil rights leader has become a conservative republican (though he still believes in limited Affirmative Action). Many of the other stories are interesting because when you put the white point of view and the black point of view right next to each other, there are clearly some huge gaps in understanding each other, and usually the faults and ignorance seem to lie on the white point of view (though some of the interviewed are trying to change their understandings or admit they've changed). There is a lot of frustration on both sides, but at no point do you get an opinion exactly the same as another individual.I have a belief that you should have 10% theory and 90% action, and lately I've been reading a lot of theory. Books like these are a good antidote to too much theory in your life. I love oral history, because it's straight to the point and doesn't require any detective work by the reader to find out what the author is talking about. Something like the subject of Race, being so linked to how people in the United States relate to each other, you need some straight-forward answers. People too often dance around the issue of race and in order to build a social change movement that brings real improvement in all people's lives; we can't squirt around race anymore than class or gender or sexuality or anything else. Most often, the real battle is the battle for the hearts and minds of people, and to understand what that is exactly. Oral history is important.In conclusion, Studs Terkel is my favorite non-fiction writer of all time, because his work involves the words of thousands of ordinary people."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"rst a few parahprases from the interviews in this book which was published in 1993:\\"Professor Douglas Massey points out that relatively stable jobs such as in factories, steel mills and auto plants have dissapeared in black communities. These jobs have largely dissapeared for this generation. Blacks cannot move to where decent jobs might be because of their difficulty in entering the housing market. A person working in the service economy, say at Macdonalds, full time at minimum wage, can't stay above the poverty line.Alex Berteau, a partner in a law firm, says that it's tough for him to talk to young successful whites who say that they have nothing to do with the injustices done to African Americans in the past. Berteau says, no, it's not them, it's their fathers, who profited while paying black people subsistence wages so their children to go to Harvard. This young individual says \\"Don't lay it on my doorstep\\" yet he is getting all the fruits of it. Berteau, says that this youngster has a college degree but the black man who slaved so his father could get everything cheap is illiterate and can barely speak English. To get rid of Affirmative Action, is to ignore history, he says.Maggie Holmes, retired domestic worker, refers to a painting at the Chicago art musem in the mid-80's of Chicago's black progressive mayor Harold Washington in a bra and panties and apparently an exhibit consisting of an American flag on the floor which people were invited to walk on. To judge by her comments, it appears the white population ridiculed the anger of blacks at the first, but raised an uproar at the second. She also says that the American flag is just an old rag that dosen't mean anything to her, because white people burned things and wrapped themselves around that flag when Dr. King was marching.Mike Wrobleski, former police captain in Chicago is interviewed. He got a lot of viscious harrassment from his fellow officers during the 80's because he would not tolerate racist posters and other expressions, many about Mayor Washington, in police stations under his watch. He got one letter which contained a picture of a naked black man and a white woman with her mouth open that said \\"You nigger-lover. This is what my wife is doing when I'm not at home.\\" Terkel notes that this lout actually meant to say \\"your wife\\" instead of \\"my wife\\" and Wrobleski comments that there is probably some deep Freudian stuff in that case, the fear of the alleged sexual prowess of black men on which he based his racism.Fred Hampton, is only refered to once in this book, in the very last interview. Terkel says in a footnote that in 1990 the Chicago city council voted to have a Fred Hampton day but after that sixteen white alderman objected on the grounds that they thought they had voted to honor Dan Hampton the Chicago Bears football player.Most of these interviews take place with people from Chicago, Terkel's hometown, which has always been pretty volatie racially. Marquette Park is refered to several times early in the book. This was where Dr. King tried to have a march in 1966 but instead got assaulted with rocks several times by rampaging white mobs, whose hatred terrified him. He said that it had surpassed anything he had seen in the South.Then there are a few like C.P. Ellis and Ann Atwater from Durham North Carolina. Ellis was a poor white klansman who battled the black activist Atwater in the racial strife of Durham in the 60's. Ellis started to lose his enthusisasm for the KKK when he realized that the big politicians and economic elite of Durham who provided funds and expressions of racial solidarity to him and his chapter of the KKK during the nightime were embarassed to associate with a poor white like him during the daytime. He realized that poor whites had a heck of a lot in common with poor blacks. He became close to Atwater and speaks about her in his interviews (one in 1978, the other in 1989) with great emotion. He became a multi-racial union organizer. C.P. Ellis is an example of what Dr. Kenneth Clark of Brown Vs. Board of education fame refers to, in his interiview, about poor whites trying to get feelings of self-worth in this society by stomping on poor blacks below them in the class system.Will Campbell, a White Southern preacher says in his interview regarding the origins of the term \\"redneck. It was from a Edwin Markham poem which refered to the poor white farmer taking a break from his slavery, putting his hands on his hoe and looking on the ground. All the while the scorching sun beats down on the back of his neck. Thus he gets a redneck. Unfortunately, says the reverand, we've equated that with racism."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"I first encountered Studs Terkel's fascinating oral histories through his book \\"Working.\\" In \\"Race,\\" he creates a richly textured study of one of America's great obsessions--and taboos--in the early 1990s. His interviewees represent a wide range of perspectives, including both \\"experts\\" and ordinary people of many socioeconomic backgrounds, and their testimonies are remarkably candid. Although they encompass several ethnic groups, the focus of the book is race relations between blacks and whites, as the subtitle indicates.For the most part, the book is centered on Chicago, a city with a troubled history regarding race. Infamously, the violent response to a 1966 civil rights march in Marquette Park prompted Martin Luther King to remark, \\"I have seen many demonstrations in the South, but I have never seen anything so hostile and so hateful as I've seen here today.\\" Chicago is also a pertinent site for such a study because of the devastating impact the decline of manufacturing has had upon the city's black population. Terkel's interviewees discuss the effects of this decline upon the economic status of many of Chicago's black residents and the resultant disintegration of the family, in addition to the interracial tension caused by the loss of jobs (a tension that often manifests as a debate over affirmative action). Many interviewees, both black and white, seem to agree that overt racial prejudice became more socially acceptable during the Reagan years, reversing a trend that began with the civil rights movement. Many also discuss the popularity of Louis Farrakhan, with varied feelings.Another frequently recurring theme is that of interracial dating and marriage. Some support interracial relationships or are themselves in one, while others confess to feelings of resentment when they see an interracial couple. Interviewees of both races talk about the deep-seated insecurities (especially male insecurities) that often surround the issue.Although aspects of the book are grim, showing how blacks and whites have actually grown farther apart due to a widening economic gap and diverging cultural (particularly linguistic) courses, there are some rays of hope. One especially memorable section is the story of C.P. Ellis and Ann Atwater of Durham, North Carolina. A former Ku Klux Klansman, Ellis eventually comes to feel that, as a poor white, he has more in common with poor blacks than with white members of the elite who exploit them both. Although he knows he will be stigmatized for his change of heart, he reaches out to Atwater, a black activist, and the two become not only colleagues but close friends.What makes this book unique is the sheer variety of voices it contains, each offering a completely different perspective. Despite the unfortunate reluctance of many Americans to discuss race, Terkel succeeds in drawing out the people he talks to. Their observations remain very relevant over a decade later."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"Studs Terkel may be the greatest American chronicler of oral history. I recall an introduction to his writing by reading his book &quot;Working&quot; while in college twenty five years ago. I love his ability to tell history by and through the words of those who have lived it.&quot;Race&quot; is the most difficult topic he has ever chosen. Gunnar Myrdal was correct when he called it the American dilemma. Terkel examines it from not just one perspective or two (or even three). Instead, he has brought together dozens of varying perspectives on the most dividing issue in the Nation. The greatness of this work does not come from the well known names, although there are many: from Louis Farrakhan, Dr. Kenneth Clark, the Mother of Emmett Till and Clarence Page. Also included are those who are unknown (but nonetheless speak to and for legions of other Americans of all races and persuasions).It is nothing if not thought provoking. The participants come to life in the writing of this excellent work. It will make the reader rethink some of his/her closely held notions, and see a different perspective. Whether any ideas change or not, reading &quot;Race&quot; and thinking about its content it is an exercise in which we should all engage."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"It was depressing how many of the issues remain the same so many years later. Terkel's format remains wonderful; to clearly hear the voices of so many people gives weight to their thoughts."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"This was a fascinating, wonderful book.

A very good read! I highly recommend it. John Reynolds"},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"I was glued to the book because it was able to give me an understanding of my feelings when it comes to the subject matter in this book. It took me quite a while to get through it because some of the stories caused me to take a step back and anaylize my feelings a bit more. I began to experience anger, sadness,depression, and a great appreciation for the author. There were times where I struggled to pick it back up and continue reading because of the candor brought out through his interviews. Other times, I could hardly believe what the people were saying, and other times, I was heart broken, and sad. Nevertheless, it was a facinating, thought provoking read. When I finally finished the book, I found myself saying that the book should be required reading in high school, and college curriculum. If you haven't heard of Studs Terkel, then I urge you to find out who he is, and read his books. You'd be cheating yourself if you didn't."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"As I have done on other occasions when I am reviewing more than one work by an author I am using some of the same comments, where they are pertinent, here as I did in earlier reviews. In this series the first Studs Terkel book reviewed was that of his \\"The Good War\\": an Oral History of World War II\\".Strangely, as I found out about the recent death of long time pro-working class journalist and general truth-teller \\"Studs\\" Terkel I was just beginning to read his \\"The Good War\\", about the lives and experiences of, mainly, ordinary people during World War II in America and elsewhere, for review in this space. As with other authors once I get started I tend to like to review several works that are relevant to see where their work goes. In the present case the review of Race: How Blacks And Whites Feel About Each is a forthright look at the state of American racial tensions a couple of decades ago although the issues raised and the fears expressed are not far from the surface of today's racial landscape.Moreover, the times of Obama notwithstanding, although the \\"code\\" words for the race question have changed many of the attitudes that are articulated here are hardly \\"shocking\\" to one who has had his ear to the ground down at the base of society. The most common attitude expressed by whites here- that of course they are not racially prejudiced, have nothing against blacks, even has black friends, in short, have no racial problems is belied by the refusal to live, go to school with or work with blacks. Perhaps a little surprising, at least to me, was the feeling expressed by many blacks that they did not want to live with whites, did not trust them and also feared them. That is the paradox of race in America and has been since slavery times. Anyone who paid close attention to this year's presidential race and avoided the easy democratic and social generalizations of the mainstream pundits got hit over the head with this reality on the job, in the public schools in the neighborhood and on the streets every day. Certainly the Obama victory was a significant fact in this racially divided society. However one would be living in a fool's paradise to think that overnight the race question had been eliminated. But enough of that except to say that we could certainly have used Studs' talents to do a postscript on this book today.One thing that I noticed immediately after reading this book, and as is true of the majority of Terkel's interview books, is that he is not the dominant presence but is a rather light, if intensely interested, interloper in these stories. This is important in trying to get to the bottom of such a socially charged question as racial attitudes. Here, for better or worse the interviewees get to tell their stories, unchained. In this age of 24/7 media coverage with every half-baked journalist or wannabe interjecting his or her personality into somebody else's story this was, and is, rather refreshing. Of course this journalistic virtue does not mean that Studs did not have control over who got to tell their stories and who didn't to fit his preoccupations and sense of order. He has a point he wants to make and that is that although most \\"ordinary\\" people do not make the history books they certainly make history, if not always of their own accord or to their own liking. Again, kudos and adieu Studs."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"This book is great. Studs is a great author and went around America asking people about their experiences with racism. The title is properly titled &quot;Race : How Blacks &amp; Whites Think &amp; Feel About the American Obsession&quot; and as you will see that really fits into this great Turkel book. I heavily recommend it. It will make you think twice about being a racist."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"Studs Terkel once again has demonstrated to my satisfaction his genius for capturing the essence of a person's experience in a few short pages. With interview after interview, he weaves a story that left me with a far greater understanding of where we all are... and how we got here. This book was a major addition to my knowledge of how African Americans feel... about whites, about the society they live in... about each other. Done with sympathy and never, ever condescending, Studs clearly marks out the dignity and full personhood of everyone he interviewed... from drug dealers in the projects to members of the power hierarchy. I don't know how he does it... I'll read anything with Terkel's name on it."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"i've followed Studs Terkel.everytime he is on tv being interviewed i listen because he is always on point about Race in America.this book is solid in his findings.he breaks things down and shows and points out many different kinds of issues.he is the real deal."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"Studs Terkel applies his oral narrative to the great American racial divide. The interviews are often interesting, revealing, and at times jaded by misconceptions or fear. We hear from people of genuine goodwill, but there are also unfair denials of white privilege, nonsense about how only whites can be racist, and a seeming reluctance by some interviewees to open up completely. Sadly, we get little perspective from Asians, Latinos, recent immigrants, or Native American Indians. Nor does the author interview many of those multitudes of suburbanites who fled city neighborhoods because racial change brought marked increases in violence and blight.RACE falls well short of Terkel's best efforts like WORKING and HARD TIMES. The book lacks a certain bite, in part because people are hesitant to honestly discuss racial issues, but also because Terkel stacks the interviews to promote his politically correct views while avoiding certain troubling issues. RACE should have been a more engaging, more popular book."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"This book was written by a Zionist that wants all races to feel pity for blacks. The book fails to mention how blacks and whites feel about the anti-white propaganda promoted by the Zionist since after the feminist movement."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"Studs Terkel has done some very good things with this book and he clearly is a talented interviewer with a strong grasp of the state of race relations in the US. I don't know that this book was particularly well written as he really did little more than aggregate a lot of (often, not always) interesting interviews. I'm not sure the book is still contemporary and I do feel that race relations have come a good ways along since this book was written. That being said, I do think this book is very worthwhile for most anyone, even today. While it was very interesting to gain insight into minority views on the Reagan administration, Farrakhan, etc., I think I honestly gained more from the every day stories and perspectives that were related. It will certainly get you to think about race relations from an entirely new perspective and that is far and away its most valuable aspect."},{"Title":"Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession","review":"Growing up in Detroit in the 40's and 50's I remember the respect we were taught to adults be they black or white. If you were on a street car and a lady got on and you were the youngest you would surrender your seat. it didn't matter if the lady was black or white. Then came the riots in the 60's and the flight to the suburbs, which we all made. It has remained. Whites and blacks have gone further and further out, some driving up to forty miles to work in Detroit. It is not as much a race thing as disrespect from black and whites in the city. There is not respect for the law, elderly or even themselves. In turn this is where all our large citys are failing.The drug dealers run the citys and it is in plain view. Ask anyone that lives in the City. Drugs are big money and it works its way up the line to the politicians. Without law and order no one will return no matter what race they are.

I found it written in an incredibly dry and humorless style, though the seriousness with which the author wrote some of his passages had me laughing.Here's some gems:\\"Professionalism also applies to what you talk about in front of customers. I was at a Nashville restaurant in March 2005 when the server asked how I was doing. I gave my standard response, \\"Better than I deserve! How are you?\\" He explained that he wasn't doing well because he was having trouble with his finances and was worried about the health of Pope John Paul II. The entertainment experience of eating out had just been reduced to zero for this meal. It was nave of him to answer a rhetorical question. I might have felt a little empathy or at least identified with him if he told me he was worried that the Tennessee Titans might lose our starting quarterback or that lawmakers were trying to pass a state income tax again. The problem with his response regarding the Pope was that he was already on his deathbed and everyone knew it. It was sad but I came to the restaurant to be happy. The server just didn't get that. The ironic part was the comment about his finances. Tips are how servers make most of their income and I'm a generous tipper. He would have received a better tip from me than from most of his customers if he had just been a run-of-the-mill server. Whining about his finances hurt them even more by ensuring that he was getting a minimum tip from me no matter how good his service was. This turned out to be a moot point since he was as unprofessional in his service as he was in his behavior.\\"\\"My ninth-grade English teacher once asked for volunteers to help with the Junior/Senior prom. I raised my hand and asked, \\"What's in it for me?\\" I was never as humiliated as when I heard her answer. She looked straight at me and said in front of the entire class, \\"It's not about you Glenn. When you grow up, you'll learn that sometimes in life you have to do things for others out of a sense of duty. This is why young men volunteered to serve in Viet Nam and Korea.\\" I still remember that look of disappointment and disgust in her eyes when I uttered those fateful words.\\"I think those quotes speak for themselves.He also claims that PowerPoint is a program very few will use at work (ha!), and that people often try to drag down those who want to \\"work harder\\" by saying things like \\"there's more to life than work.\\"As stated in other reviews, the book is definitely common sense. And to be fair, there are some basic good points in there that workers often forget, like about how a job is not about you and the importance of working hard. But much of the advice sounds like it's being given by a traditionalist baby boomer that served in the military and expects everyone else to follow in line or expect failure. I found almost nothing in this book helpful or that I hadn't read somewhere else (and in much richer and better detail). If you find yourself nodding seriously and agreeing with the author after reading the above quotes, then you just might like this book."},{"Title":"My First 100 Words in Spanish/English (My First 100 Words Pull-Tab Book)","review":"There are 5 locations (farm, store, park, town, and home) fromwhich 20 words are translated from English to Spanish by the pull of atab. I was disappointed that the basic words like colors or body parts were not chosen as part of the 100 words. On the left side of each page is a full picture of the location; on the right side is the 20 words with a picture of each directly above the written word. The individual pictures do not directly match the same object on the opposite page; often the object is flipped or is seen from a different angle.

It will be interesting to see the quality of William Hague's biography, which will be published later this year."},{"Title":"Joyful Christian","review":"C.S. Lewis' works, insofar as I have read them, are philosophically and theologically well considered. Of course, that is an understatement. He shies away from no serious question or &quot;problem&quot;. He was the most important apologist of the twentieth century.The Joyful Christian is a collection of 127 readings drawn from his extensive body of work, varying in length from a few sentences to several pages. This reader found only a few discussions in which (I believe) Lewis errs. Most of this collection is very sound (again an understatement). At the same time I was reading this volume, I was reading the thoughts of another well-known 20th century theologian, who was in search of the &quot;historical Jesus.&quot; Lewis' thoughts on the subject were much closer to being correct: &quot;In the last generation we promoted the construction of such a 'historical Jesus' on liberal and humanitarian lines; we are now putting forward a new 'historical Jesus' on Marxian, catastrophic, and revolutionary lines. The advantages of these constructions, which we intend to change every thirty years or so, are manifold. ...for each 'historical Jesus' is unhistorical. The documents say what they say ...each new 'historical Jesus' therefore has to be got out of them by suppression at one point and exaggeration at another ...religion of this kind is false to history...&quot;Lewis on 'Prudence': &quot;Christ said we could only get into His world by being like children... as St. Paul points out, Christ never meant that we were to remain children in intelligence: on the contrary, He told us to be not only 'as harmless as doves' but also 'as wise as serpents.' He wants a child's heart, but a grown-up's head. He wants us to be simple, single-minded, affectionate, and teachable, as good children are; but he also wants every bit of intelligence we have to be alert at its job... He wants everyone to use what sense they have.&quot;Lewis on 'Hope': &quot;The Apostles themselves, who set on foot the conversion of the Roman Empire, the great men who built up the Middle Ages, the English Evangelicals who abolished the Slave Trade, all left their mark on Earth, precisely because their minds were occupied with Heaven. It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this. Aim at Heaven and you will get Earth 'thrown in': aim at Earth and you will get neither.&quot;Lewis on 'Apologetics': &quot;The great difficulty is to get modern audiences to realize that you are preaching Christianity solely and simply because you happen to think it is true; they always suppose you are preaching it because you like it or think it good for society or something of that sort...&quot;'The Joyful Christian' is one of the best collections of theological thought and Christian apologetics you are likely to find."},{"Title":"Joyful Christian","review":"Lewis eagerly inspiring throught he whole thing. I recognized the selections from other series, and have since bought those books. His works amaze me and never cease to enlighten me. This is a must read; it'll take you no time at all."},{"Title":"Joyful Christian","review":"From invariably the most influential apologist of the twentieth century comes one of the best collections of thoughts and essays ever compiled. From his thoughts on 'Intercourse in the Afterlife' to his view of Jesus Christ, Touchstone Books has struck gold with this brilliant excursion into the mind of C.S. Lewis. It is a true classic and is a must-have for any true fan of this century's greatest theologian!"},{"Title":"Joyful Christian","review":"\\"The Joyful Christians\\" is definitely a 5 star volume.Contained in this book are 127 readings from many of Lewis' greatest apologetically works (\\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"Mere Christianity\\", \\"Miracles\\", \\"The Problem of Pain\\"), and even a few from the fictitious \\"Screwtape Letters\\". Topics range from deep theological matters - such as prayer, Divine omnipotence, the three-personal God - to more applicable subjects like sexual morality, marriage, divorce, Scripture reading, etc. This is a superb compendium of Lewis' main arguments for many subjects pertaining to the Christian life. New Lewis readers will find \\"The Joyful Christian\\" very interesting and delightful, especially since the book is organized according to subject. If you're looking for a Lewis quote on a particular subject, this is an excellent resource. Great for new readers and old timers alike."},{"Title":"Joyful Christian","review":"This is one of the few books that christians can read fo real incite.

Most of the books that I purchase from Amazon.com are for a young man, a friend of mine, that is on death row. He does not like just any kind of books. He is very picky. When I send him Christian books, once he reads them, he shares them with other death row inmates. The opinion he gave me about this one in particular was: \\"I really enjoyed this book. I usually pass my books around to bless other inmates, but I believe I will keep this one for a while.\\" I believe this says it all."},{"Title":"Joyful Christian","review":"The 127 excerpts gathered together in The Joyful Christian give an excellent introduction to the scope and range of C. S. Lewis' thought. The bibliography and list of sources in the back of this book are a panoramic picture of the legacy Lewis has left us.These 127 excerpts also illustrate the cohesiveness of Lewis' thought. An excerpt from Surprised By Joy is consistent with what is found in The Abolition of Man. Other readings from Christian Reflections are consistent with what you would expect from the author of the Narnia and Perlandra series.The excerpts, for the most part, are relatively short. One or even two readings can be completed in a relatively short time. A \\"daily reading\\" approach allows time for cogitation and meditation on the thoughts presented.C. S. Lewis remains one of the most influential Christian writers of the 20th century, and rightly so. This collection is an excellent representation of the breadth of his philosophical and theological thought.For someone looking for a representative sampling of Lewis' writings, The Joyful Christian is the one book to get."},{"Title":"Joyful Christian","review":"The late Eastern Orthodox priest and theologian Alexander Schmemann once remarked that Christianity lost the world when Christians lost their Joy. This collection of 127 themes gathered from Lewis' extensive corpus remind us that \\"joy is the serious business of heaven\\" precisely because God is love and love is truth and humans are created to live in the conscious joyful reality of praising God in the love of our brothers and sisters through our union in Christ.If you have never read anything by Lewis, or if you have be long-acquainted with his genial and witty prose, you'll find this Lewis Reader a true joy to read. But the appeal of this collection will extend well beyond the perennial veneration of Lewis to the very heart of Christian living, thinking and defending. This book is also an excellent way to see what Lewis books you would be interested in reading at length.Topics include: life on other planets, right and wrong, atheism, miracles, death, the historical Jesus, liturgy, eucharist, salvation, prayer.You will not be disappointed in this book. Joy is attainable through reprentace."},{"Title":"Joyful Christian","review":"Lewis is such a great Christian author!

I'm glad I did because my end users are loading programs in 14 seconds that used to take 186 seconds. They may not thank me, but they're not complaining.The book included a CD-ROM that had some scripts that were easily customized for my environment so that I could collect some baseline performance information (this was really easy with the scripts). Also, the CD included some performance monitor workspace templates that helped me to easily turn on the important metrics that needed to be tracked. There are many sections in the book that give definite recommendations about what to, and what not to, do. There was one section of the book where the author said to &quot;never, ever, ever&quot; do something that I had done - I undid it. The book also helped me by identifying several third party products that proved to be useful in analyzing and fixing my problems.My recommendation to anyone considering this book is that it should not be purchased when you have a problem - buy it before you have the problem. But if you have a problem, this book will help you."},{"Title":"Tuning & Sizing NT Server","review":"Mr. Aubley's book is an excellent technical resource which addresses the difficult task of correctly sizing NT Server implementations and also how to tune NT for maximum performance with regards to various hardware and software considerations. Mr. Aubley explains the complex tasks succinctly and concisely and draws on many obvious years of experience to present hands-on solutions and case studies for reference. I would recommend this book to any NT admin that is responsible for scaling NT beyond humble file and print services. It has presented approaches to the tasks at hand that I have successfully used to effect client solutions."},{"Title":"Tuning & Sizing NT Server","review":"This is an excellent book! The information on tuning and sizing in the NT Resource Kits is scattered and haphazard. Also, the Resource Kits have a profound reluctance to discuss real figures, and to give examples of reasonable values for counters. That's exactly what Curt's book comes to the rescue. It gives concrete examples, methodologies, and tips. Tuning and Sizing is really where it's at. Anyone can install an NT server, but to know whether a server is running optimally is much harder.Well done Curt! Excellent value!!"},{"Title":"Tuning & Sizing NT Server","review":"Curt Aubley has written the essential resource for system administrators who are interested in getting the most from the NT systems they manage. Not merely a rehash of other published work, this book breaks new ground and is a direct result of the author's extensive independent and collaborative research into the relationship between the NT operating system and the hardware on which it resides. Want a foolproof means of justifying to management a requirement for more money to fund IS upgrades and replacements? This book shows you how to conclusively spot performance bottlenecks, and how to accurately predict the point at which increased usage levels compromise a system's ability to meet customer needs. Take this information to the \\"bean counters\\" and you won't be denied! But more important than that, if you really want to understand what it takes to monitor performance and make your systems super responsive, you'll find all that, plus more, laid out step by step, and thoroughly explained in this book. Furthermore, the practical nature of this book lends itself to an immediate payback for the reader. In the first few pages, Curt describes steps that can be easily implemented for immediate results. AND I will say it again; this is not a repeat of information found in other publications. I highly recommend \\"Tuning &amp; Sizing NT Server\\" to those of us who live and die by the utility of our systems."},{"Title":"Tuning & Sizing NT Server","review":"Within very little time, we applied the case study from the network performance chapter, and experienced a three-fold increase in our tape restore operations.

It is about a girl with dark strawberry-blonde hair. She goes off to college with her friends: Charlie, Gilbert, and Diana. She makes some new friends and one of them, Priscila which is Pris for short, they meet in the graveyard across from the college. She meets many men she thinks she is in love with, including Gilbert, but when the propose to her she finds out she really doesn't love them that much. She even turns down the man of her dreams. So, it is partially a love story. She was adopted when she was young by Marilla. Now they have taken in twins when their mother died and their only relative can't take care of them. The younger one is Davy, who is always asking questions and getting in to mischief. He especially likes to bother his twin sister, Dora. She is always quiet and quite lady-like. They all live on Prince Edward Island in Canada. If you want to know the rest, you can read the book for yourself. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book wasn't very romantic in my opinion. I don't think Ruby Gillis was treated very nice in the beginning half of the book. It should have gotten more in about Avonlea, it was too much about college and was kind of boring."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book is a satisfactory installment in the Anne of Green Gables series. Anne continues growing up and continuing her education (you can see this as an continuation of Anne of Avonlea) but like in books 1 and 2, Anne is still a very loveable and spirited character, and her maturity doesn't change that, so honestly, Anne Shirley is as much of a loveable character as ever. The story picks up in Anne of Windy Poplars (Book 4) but this volume is still a good one and definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is book 3 in L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series. It is a continuation of the story of Anne Shirley as she goes away to school at Redmond College in Kingsport. Some of Anne's old chums from Avonlea are also at Redmond - Charlie Sloane and Gilbert Blythe, but Montgomery also introduces new and interesting characters. L.M. Montgomery certainly has a way with characters! She writes people that are really believable. These are people you will wish were in your life - as you follow them on their journey, they become your friends as well.Anne of the Island is the book that finally sees some serious development in the Gilbert/Anne dynamic, and for this reason it seems to be the favorite of the series for a lot of Montgomery fans. While I enjoyed the story just as much as the previous two books, I wouldn't say it would be my favorite - my heart will always belong to the little orphan girl from Anne of Green Gables. She becomes a remarkable young woman over the course of the years, but some of my favorite Anne-escapades take place in the first book.As always, L.M. Montgomery is a master of the literary form. Her descriptions are well-formed and breathtaking in their scope - not a single word could be omitted:\\"The sea was roaring hollowly in the distance, the fields were bare and sere, scarfed with golden rod, the brook valley below Green Gables overflowed with asters of ethereal purple, and The Lake of Shining Waters was blue-blue-blue; not the changeful blue of spring, nor the pale azure of summer, but a clear, steadfast, serene blue, as if the water were past all moods and tenses of emotion and had settled down to a tranquility unbroken by fickle dreams.\\"Isn't that fantastic!? Drink in the beauty...These are wonderful books for all ages and there is a little something for everyone here: adventure, romance, drama, suspense, and comedy. If you give Anne a chance, you'll have a bosom friend for life!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Every summer, my daughter, Amber, who has cerebral palsy, has me read Anne of Green Gables to her. It's tradition. And, this sequel is just as good as the first two. This author, L.M. Montgomery, was so skillful, it's as if she poured out a beautiful soul onto the pages, fully alive and full of wonder, inviting us, her kindred spirits, to join her in her imaginings and adventures.We're halfway through Anne of Avonlea now, and can't wait to start Anne of the Island next. Nobody wrote characters more real. There is no way to fully experience the richness of these works except by reading them, or hearing them read. Movies can never do them justice, as good as they can be.Yes, Anne still delivers thrills, scrapes and wonders after all of these years, and they're just as fresh now as they ever were."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This third book of the series (Anne of Green Gables) is as good as the first and better than the second."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"If you like Anne of Green Gables in any way, you have to read the other books in order to see her grow up. She stills continue to get in trouble, romance with Gilbert continues, just about anything that can happen, happens. These books fulfill everything that you could ever want out of a book."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I agree with the rest of the reviewers that this book is a page turner, suspenseful, fun, romantic, and all those other fine things.But what I come back to is that this is a story of a bunch of country girls going to COLLEGE in the 1880s. Not twenty years before we had the March girls in &quot;Little Women&quot; who never seemed to seriously consider college as a womens' venue. Yet here we have an actively coed college a few hundred miles north of Concord in Nova Scotia. Montgomery alludes to the presence of at least one professor who disapproved of coeds, but they were clearly an accepted part of the community.And it's funny to see both how much and how little college life has changed. Colleges don't have a coed's dressing room any more, and you rarely see ball gowns, or balls for that matter. But there are still lots of students like Anne attending on a shoestring from one year to the next, relying on a summer teaching job this year, a scholarship the next, and a surprise inheritance after that. Coeds (a long forgotten word) still juggle schoolwork and and social schedules, and have surprise visitors drop in when they're least prepared. When Anne announces she's made money selling an article, her roomie replies, &quot;Let's go get drunk!&quot; I suppose that's the most subversive line I've seen in a Montgomery work, but it also shows how little campus life has changed. And it also leaves me wondering what Anne might have been like after a few glasses of wine.This may also be the most quotable Montgomery book. I cited the &quot;I can't keep secrets -- it's no use to try&quot; in a recent publication of my own, and that's a pretty pale example. Real gems include &quot;Sometimes I sits and thinks and sometimes I jest sits,&quot; or the immortal &quot;Facts are stubborn things, but not half so stubborn as fallacies.&quot;This would make a terrific film. You don't need a Megan Follows for this, you need someone else. For all her good work in other episodes, she was never quite tall enough nor whimsical enough in style to play this sort of Anne."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is a wonderful book. The story is about a girl, not an earthshaker, and yet Maud Montgomery makes the book very suspenseful. Right up until the last chapters I found myself on the edge of my seat, wondering who Anne would marry. A very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is my favorite book in the series because it is the most romantic but it still contains wit, humor and a little bit of every emotion you can imagine! It gets right in Anne's sole just like the others but in a different way. You get to understand her fellings about Gillbert and her new and old friends that she has with her at Redmond collage. Misunderstandings are all understood in the end of this Romantic humorous classic that brings you back to its time!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne and Gilbert finally arrive in Redmond college, and start a new stage in their lives, and a new stage in their relationship. Anne must decide if she's ready for love, and when she is - would Gilbert still be available?Anne, as usual, manages to get into scrapes - adopt an unexpected cat, have an unexpected room mate join her, and have lots and lots of romance, Anne Shierly style! Of course, many of her childhood dreams of the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; stage are left behind when faced with reality, but she manages to build new ones. much lovelier than those - especially as for her future love with her beloved one."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love alll of the Anne of Green Gables series. They are so vividly written you find yourself wishing that you were born as Anne a hundered years ago on PE Island. I would have happily endured all her hardships for all the wonderful moments in her life, and the fact she married Gilbert Blythe! It's so well written that you actually feel that you know Gilbert and I actually found my self falling in love with him! I've read the series 2 times. The first time I couldn't stop thinking about Anne. I read Anne, I tried to live like Anne and I dreamt Anne. Anyway, this book comes after Anne of Avonlea and Anne is about 18 when it starts. She comes to Redmond college with friends from Avonlea- Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane. She finds herself lonely at first and homesick but she meets new friends such as Phil and lives with 4 other friends in a place called 'Patty's Place.' This book is soooooooo well written you almost find yourself in Patty's Palace surrounded by Anne and her friends. Gilbert Blythe proposes in this book (my favorite chapter) but Anne. . .well you'll have to read and find out. In the end Anne realizes she loves Gilbert and life wouldn't be worth living without him. The end is so beautiful. Although I love all 8 books almost equally Anne of the Island is just a little better. And although it's romantic it's definitely not just a romance. Anne of the island includes wit, humour and a lot of other things that makes it an all-round perfect book. If you're an Anne fan you havvvvvve to read this. I could not describe how wonderful it is in 1000 words. Anne of the Island is truly a book you CANNOT put down. After I read the series I didn't have the appetite to read anything that didn't include Anne and all the PE folk Anne was familiar with. After reading this I recommend you read all the rest of the Anne of Green Gables series (there are 5 more books,) although you'll probably be rushing to buy them anyway."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love Anne! She was, at times, my greatest friend in the world. I am now in my mid 20's, but I still cherish the memories of the moments Anne and I spent together when I was a child, and regularly revisit her. If someone asked me which Anne book I liked least, I couldn't answer. I loved each and every one more than the next.Anne of the Island is no less wonderful than the books preceeding it or following it. Like all the books, it has a blend of humour and poignancy; joy and sorrow. The key drawcards of the Anne books are the characters. They are lovable, good, kind, wholesome folk who make you care about them and want to know what happens next. Incredibly vivid characters, it was no exaggeration to say that Anne was my childhood best friend - she was as real to me as any person I knew.The cast includes all kinds of interesting guests including the wonderful Miss Patty and Maria with their china dogs, Miss Ada and her cushions, Mrs Skinner and her romance (&quot;Jog along, black mare&quot;)... the list goes on. Best of all, our old friends are back - Anne, Gilbert, Pricilla, Diana, Davy and Dora, Marilla and Mrs Lynde, Charlie Sloane, and all those we knew and loved in earlier books. There are also some fabulous new additions to the circle of friends - Stella, Aunt Jimsie and the irrepressible Philippa Gordon.Anne of the Island takes us away from Avonlea to Kingsport, where Anne is attending Redmond College. This new setting doesn't mean that we miss out on Green Gables altogether, as Anne does return home for vactions, but it does give one a sense of moving on. Never again will Anne be a child living under Marilla's roof - she is an adult, and in this book she is beginning to break away from Green Gables in preparation for the next chapter in her life. Many of the events in this book shape Anne for the rest of her life, and it is an important book for those wishing to read the whole series.If you aren't familiar with Anne, please go back and read Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea before embarking on Anne of the Island - you'll know the characters so much better if you do. If you've read them and are wondering if this book lives up to the earlier ones - it does. L.M. Montgomery kept Anne consistant throughout the entire series, and there are few authors who have done so successfully. While Anne does grow and mature throughout, she is always the Anne we knew and loved."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love alll of the Anne of Green Gables series.

Having spent time as the teacher at the Avonlea Schools in &quot;Anne of Avonlea,&quot; the Anne girl leaves Prince Edward Island for four years of college (hence, she is now &quot;Anne of the Island&quot;). The theme of this story is Anne dealing with &quot;How horrible it is that people have to grow up,&quot; as she confronts how her whole world is changing.Ironically, what makes &quot;Anne of the Island&quot; so romantic is the way it challenges romanticism. Even as a young woman Anne creates a romantic fantasy around the world in which she lives, just like she did at Green Gables where there was the old Snow Queen at the window, the Dryad's Bubble, the Haunted Wood, Lover's Lane and all those &quot;dear spots where memories of the old years bided.&quot; Now Anne and Priscilla, her school chum from Redmond, are renting rooms in Patty's Place, and making the home of Miss Patty and Miss Maria into their own. Meanwhile, after a thousand romantic drams and enduring both Diana Barry's wedding and the rejection of Gilbert Blythe's proposal (her second actually), Anne finally meets her Prince Charming, Royal Gardner.He is handsome and rich, in short, everything that Anne ever dreamed that she wanted in a husband. Then comes the fateful moment when Roy proposes and Anne opens her lips to say her faithful yes. But this is but a false dawn in Anne's life and there is a fateful Book of Revelation that Anne has to endure before love takes up the glass of time. There is romanticism and then there is that which is romantic and Montgomery shows the difference. There is a reason that this character and these books are enduring classics of (supposedly) juvenille literature.As usual this book is also filled with interesting and colorful characters, such as young Paul and the Rock People, John Douglas who finally speaks at last, and Anne's friend Phillippa Gordon, who also has her eyes opened to the what true love really means. For those who are familiar with the delightful Kevin Sullivan &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot; sequel there is also the whole episode of &quot;Averil's Atonement&quot; as well as the entire end game with Gilbert. That is the most important part because at long last the final line of Montgomery's original &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; novel rings true for our Anne girl."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I had just begun to read the first Anne book in the beginning of January, and now, as the month has already come to a close, I've just finished my third. If nothing else, the book will sure keep you entertained. Even though I knew how the end of Anne of the Island would turn out, I still waited in suspense 'til the very last page. It's an excellent read, and I'm going to try to force myself not to go onto the fourth book because I really need to start reading other materials. It's written beautifully, and I found myself trying to speak as flowery as Anne but could never pull it off. It's really a blessing to find a book that you truly can't put down. The story was wholesome and simple, but it was indeed a classic to me. Take my advice, bibliophiles, read Anne--and give yourself some &quot;scope for imagination.&quot;"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book is about how Anne went to Redmond Collage which is a very rare thing for people in Avonlea. She really enjoyed this as well as making knew friends. Anne also loved a small white cottage that was near Redmond.Threw the last three years of her stay at Redmond she spent the semesters at &quot;Pattys Place&quot;, the white collage. She of course went back to Avonlea during vacations/breaks. She really enjoyed this. She went through many proposals, but she had to say no to everyone of them. Then she realized that Gilbert Blythe was the right one for her to marry. She realized this when Gilbert was deathly ill."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"this book never gets old. i've had it for so long and now i'm off to college and i still enjoy reading it cover to cover. anne is a great character, one who is easy to love and who explains herself well. the other characters are also quirky. something about this book is very universal, which i think explains why even in this century i still find myself being able to relate to Anne. the plot, while essentially a love story, is not overly sappy. and while most people would probably expect the ending, the twists and turns throughout the novel keep you entertained and engaged."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I first read this book in middle school after reading Anne of Green Gables. When I first got to college, I was having a hard time adjusting and rediscovering this book made it so much more bearable to be away from home. L. M. Montgomery captures the feelings of homesickness and confusion so beautifully. Every time I need a pick me up, I just go back to the novel."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is my absolute favorite book in the whole entire world. It is the best out of the whole entire series! I have read and re-read it so many times, I know it practically by heart. The book is about Anne's four years at Redmond college with the introduction of Patty's Place featuring beloved characters from previous books including Gilbert Blythe, Priscilla Grant, goggle-eyed Charlie, the grown-up Diana, Ruby Gillis, Stella Maynard, the critical Mrs. Lynde, Marilla and of course the twins, Dora and Davy who just always happens to run into trouble. Many new friends emerge such as the unfogettable Phil (short for Phillipa) who can't dream of marrying a man who isn't rich, romantic Roy Gardener and the sweet Anut Jamesina. The book also includes the publishing of one of Anne's stories. It is definetly worth reading at least once."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"i love the anne series... that seems a bit cliche to say, but man, does it ring true. each of these books hold a very special place in my heart, and each of them sits on my shelf with the tattered, well-worn pages of a book that has endured the loving hands of one who reads far too much. as i have read in the below reviews, many people focus on the romance of this book. while it is an underlying theme, tossing this book off as a romance novel would be a travesty. this is an enduring book filled with so many timeless issues, romance being only one of them. i do recommend this book, as well as the others, with a clear conscience and hopeful anticipation on your behalf. you will not be dissapointed. do be sure to read the other books in this series, as your experience would not be complete in reading just one. beautiful prose and thrilling imagery. what a treasure."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"\\"Anne of the Island\\" is my favorite Anne book, and the last chapters of my copy are worn and torn because I have read it so many times. I loved it as a young girl, and I loved it again when I read it from my college dorm room (in fact, I think it's time for another rereading!). Plus, of course, a college education makes many of the literary references more relevant than they were at age 11.Anne fans already know how wonderful are these chapters of Anne's life. This book outlines an important epoch in the series and answers the all important question of whether they will or they won't--a turning point on which the next five books hinge. And since you must start at \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" to appreciate any of it, this review cannot convince to you read just book three. It is just one more love letter to \\"Anne of the Island\\" added to this review panel."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I was lost in nostalgia as I read this beautiful classic from so long ago. It was a walk down memory lane for me and moved me to smiles and tears as I revisited the characters in this remarkable story Pure Delight!!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I really enjoyed this book and am enjoying the series, but wish that they made Anne of Windy poplars on kindle fire.

I really enjoyed this book as and recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"All the Anne books are amazing. We liked Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea slightly better then this one but we also enjoyed this book. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I have enjoyed all of Anne Shirley's Green Gable Books by Lucy Maud Montgomery. Ms. Montgomery is an excellent writer. These writings sent me on a trip to Prince Edward Island with my husband and two grown daughters."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love all the Anne of Green Gables books, and this may be one of my favorites. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. So well written and full of colorful characters and exciting adventures."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I first read the \\"Anne\\" series when I was a child and have read them several times since and thoroughly enjoyed them every time, reading them most recently at the age of 41, a couple of months back. They always make me laugh and cry as much as they did the first time I read them, possibly even more so now, because I can now relate to a lot of the experiences she has as she grows up into a woman and mother.Many readers are aware of the 6 original Anne books by Lucy Maud Montgomery - Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Anne of the Island, Anne of Windy Willows, Anne's House of Dreams and Anne of Ingleside (all beautifully written and thoroughly enjoyable books), but there are two further books by Lucy Maud, which may or may not be in print now, called Rainbow Valley and Rilla of Inglside. These final two books in the series tell more of Anne's story through the exploits of her 6 children and are well worth a read - both made me laugh and cry in equal measure.All of these books leave you wanting more from Anne and I believe that is the mark of a truly fabulous book! :)"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is the last good book featuring Anne. After the initial 'Anne' books, a sequel was squeezed in between this book and \\"Anne's House of Dreams\\". I think LMM was under pressure to write sequels, so after this the books are either average or poor, excepting \\"Rilla of Ingleside\\". In this book, Anne is more mature. She leaves Prince Edward and heads to Redmond college. There, tension arises between her and Gilbert--one wants friendship, the other love. Anne is getting a taste of living truly independent, away from home, but she has wonderfully amusing new friends to help her. Love, humor, and drama make this a very satisfying book indeed."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I have loved the Anne of Green Gables books for a long time, and had purchased a few of them at a local thrift shop. This is the only book I could not find so I decided to purchase it on Amazon. I have not read it yet but I am looking forward to doing so soon. Thanks Amazon for allowing me to buy this great book!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Ever since I was eleven when I first read the Anne books I have found a true kindred spirit in Anne Shirley. I find my self relating to her in so many ways. Whether it be in temper or making mistakes or having a nack for getting in trouble. This book inperticular is filled with romance. I love how Anne slowly relizes that Gilbert is for her. I love Anne Shirley.

I've read this over 10 times and it still makes me go puppy eyed when my favorite couple are together~ Hands down, this is one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"In the 3rd installment of the Anne of Green Gables series, Anne is off to Redmond for her college experience. The only thing from Avonlea that will be at Redmond, is dear old chum Gilbert Blythe. The question is, will Anne & Gilbert finally get together, or will Anne continue to maintain her \\"only friends\\" status? Montgomery teases the reader with little incidents, and hope is created, that this couple we love will get together at last.Amazing in Montgomery's writing is the discovery of how much and how little college years of L.M.Montgomery's time compare with those of our modern day. Though times are surely more old fashioned-where gentleman callers visit during certain hours, and no dorms are co-ed, some things never seem to change. When Anne achieves a certain accomplishment, her friend calls out..\\"Let's go get drunk!\\" Anne of the Island takes an entertaining look at Anne leaving her childhood years behind and enjoying those life changing 4 years that college brings. You'll meet her new college friends and the charming house she lives in, Patty's Place, and see Anne through as she begins life in her twenties."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This Anne book is my favorite one of the series. Anne's romances make the story so spellbinding. All throughout the book, I was hoping Anne would wind up with Gilbert. Her romance with Roy adds a twist to the story. All of the Anne books are wonderful but this one holds a special place in my heart."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is the third novel in the Anne of Green Gables series. The story was ver predictable at times, but was extremely addictive. I felt like I was right there besides Anne, and almost cried at some parts because I felt so attached to her! Throughout this book, along with the others, Anne is growing up and noticeably changing as the story progresses.After spending a few years teaching at the Avonlea School, Anne leaves her beloved Avonlea and Prince Edward Island to attend Redmond College in Kingsport. Attending Redmond with Anne would be her old friends Gilbert Blythe, Charlie Sloan, and Priscilla. Anne and Priscilla soon meet another girl, who they find talkative and funny.During her college years, Anne received a few marriage proposals from very unexpected men. She met her \\"Prince Charming\\" one day out in the rain, but realized that she could not marry him when it was almost too late. Confused, Anne almost entirely gave up hope about marrying anybody.While back in her beloved Avonlea for the summer, Anne reveals her true feelings for a dear friend before she loses him forever. The happy couple end up planning their life together."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"The best Anne book. Sweet friendships and great romance! I love Phil and Patty's Place! It's a great story that you can't help but love. Read It!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"It was ok, although I thought it could have been much much better. Anne goes through a lot as far as self-realization, especially at the end. My favorite part is when she goes back to her birthplace and discovers the home her parents lived in, in Bolingbrook. Gilbert's character needed more developing, just like it does in all the other Anne books. I think he's a real bore, but wouldn't be if she would just develope him more.I wanted more of a finale too.....more of them talking, etc. It was just too predictable....that she would fall out of love with Roy and go back to Gilbert. I wish she would endeavor more to be ambitious and she and Gilbert would discuss that.There are other Anne books that are better, such as Rilla of Ingleside."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"In this third volume of Anne Shirley&#65533;s life, Anne goes off to college, gets a marriage proposal, and loses a friend. With everything that happened to her while at college, I just couldn&#65533;t put it down. Anne is growing up and having to deal with the trials of being a young adult. Anne has problems of love and I couldn&#65533;t stop reading until I found out what happened. Montgomery does a great job with this sequel and I can&#65533;t wait to read the next!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I have never read this book but I've read and watched the movies and read the books of Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea. I think they should make a movie of Anee of the island.

Then read Anne of Green Gables sieries 1-8! Fun sweat Anne will charm you you'll never get enough!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I thought this book was a good book. Towards the end I couldn't put it down because I had to know if it turned out all right with Anne and Gilbert. At the begining I thought I would HATE it but I told myself that all of the &quot;Anne&quot; books start kind of slow at least the first two did. So I just read it. And I loved it."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"If you like the Anne of Green Gables series this is the best one in the whole thing! Anne of the Island has something for everyone! Anne Shirley leaves the small town of Avonlea to attend Redmond collage.. There the novel introduces you to a character who is extremely funny named Pricella! (Hope I spelled her name right). In this novel Anne falls in love with a fellow school mate, while her long time friend Gilbert Blythe finds a love interest as well! Do they end up together at last? Read the book and find out! This book is definatly for people who liked the movie &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;. They are without a doubt slightly similar, but the book is definatly better!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I think that this is my favorite Anne book. I have read it over a hundred times to myself and soon I will need to order a new copy. It tells the ongoing story of Anne Shirley and chronicles her adventures in higher education, friendship, love, and of course WRITING! This is not a childrens' book as some might think. It is very easy to read, but it is for people of all ages. Of course, it features the same Gilbert Blythe who we all know and love as Anne's constant admirer and the irredeemably Sloanish Charlie. She also has Priscilla Grant at her side. She also makes a new friend, Phillippa Gordon, who makes Anne's freshman year wonderful and may someday prove to be quite sensible. In the course of the book, Anne will gain friends and admirers as well as continue to matchmake and write (of Course). She will have her share of joy, tears, loss, and love and ultimately set her course for her life beyond the bend in the road. I learned an important life lesson from this book,you never value what you have until you have lost it. I loved the characterization of all the new characters especially Phillipa, I think that we all know someone like her who attracts men without knowing how or wanting to. I can relate to Anne in this book. This book is thoroughly enjoyable and you not regret reading it. If you still want more Anne after reading this book,you should read all of the other Anne books (the next is Anne of Windy Poplars) and the Chronicles of Avonlea(it includes several stories which include Anne in them: The Hurring of Ludovic, The Winning of Lucinda, etc.) I hope that you will love it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is a fantastic book, I couldn't put it down.It's about Anne going to Redmond College and meeting a load of new friends.

If you liked the other Anne books, this one will most certainly live up to the highest expectations."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book was absolutley wonderful. I loved it! It was histerical. I loved the part where Anne read the letter from Davy to her freinds. There was always a certain line that a certain someone said. Davy always said. &quot;I wanna know Anne&quot; I don't understand why she didn't understand she lover gilbert. Good book!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I thought this book was one of the best Anne books I've read so far. It revealed how Anne could manage friends,school,and quite a bit of romance outside of Avonlea. I believe the best scenes in the book are when Gilbert proposes the first time, and when they walk in Hester Grey's garden. Throughout the whole book Anne looks for her ideal man, but comes to find it in an old friend."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"All I have to say is WOW!This book is more heart warming than Anne of Greem Gables,funnier than Anne of Avonlea,and the most romantic of the Anne series.You should buy this book.I only bought this book two days ago and it is now worn out from being read too many times.This book will hold a special place in my heart and book collection. At first i hated all love mush stories but this is an example that people can change.Personally this is my favorite of the Anne series."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is anoteher book in the delightfull Anne series. It is about Anne's four years at Redmond, all of her beus, friends and sorrows. Gilbert is still one of her many friends, but wants more than Anne thinks she can give him. Anne and her three friends, Prisilla, Philippa, and Stella, or Pris, Phil, and Stella rent out the house of their dreams, Patty's Place. This book is about the wonderful times they have there."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I liked this book a lot. My favorite part was at the end, when Gilbert proposed to Anne, and they were walking and talking in Hester Gray's garden. I also liked the chapter 'Gilbert Speaks', althougt I felt bad that Anne turned him down. The only part I didn't like , was that they talked about college too much."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is an exciting book to read. it keeps you onthe edge of your seat, trying to figure out what will happen next to Anne and her friends. It is an excellent choice for reading."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Our beloved Anne has finally grown up. As bright and spirited as ever, you can't help falling in love with this beautiful book. It triggers every emotion. I laughed and I cried. You feel as if you're there with Anne. Can't wait to finish the series!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is the book that pulled me into the world of Anne Shirley -- therefore it remains as the most precious book of the series to me. I love the flowery descriptions of the surroundings, the characters and the little slip of sentimentality weaved into the story.The story got me desperately hoping that Gilbert and Anne will get together up till the very end. I knew that everything will finish well, but I couldn't help getting emotional and worked-up at certain parts of the scenes. A wicked piece of writing by Montgomery, indeed!The best of the series. And I seriously think it should have ended here, wrapping up the 'trilogy' as a reviewer has mentioned below me. As Anne would say, there would be more 'scope of imagination' if Montgomery had just left the series hanging there. (Minus the talk about Gilbert going for a medical course and Anne waiting for 3 years to be married, of course. That just ruins everything)"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"When I read Anne of the Island I instantly knew it is the best of the Anne books (though Anne's house of Dreams is pretty close) and probally the best book I have ever read. I have read the book so often my copy of it is litterally falling apart. I as a teenage girl can relate to Anne. L.M. Montgomery writes the book so clearly. I can visualize exactly what Kingsport, Green Gables, and Patty's Place looks like. I think in this book Anne finally becomes an adult. She relizes that Gilbert is the person she should be with. I think any teenage girl who did not read any of the Anne books is really missing something."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This is probably my favorite Anne book (but I love them all). You should read the first two before you begin this one, so you can get to know Anne. The characters are wonderful and I love the way L.M.M made you feel like you were at Patty's Place and laugh along with the college girls. I have read this book so many times and really I think that is the biggest compliment to a book."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love this book best of all among the 'Anne' books, though 'Rilla of Ingleside' is lovely, too! Anne of the Island shows her as a young woman venturing from the home she made for herself at Green Gables. She meets new friends, handles the challenges of college life and learns what love is all about. Anne changes and grows, but stays the same in so many important ways. This book (&amp; the others) always cheers me up! I can't wait to introduce them to my five-year old daughter!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"\\"Anne of the Island\\" is the third novel in Lucy Maud Montgomery's superb \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" series. After two years teaching school at Avonlea, the 18-year old red-haired orphan Anne Shirley is finally off to college. She will be joined by Queens Academy classmates Priscilla Grant, Stella Maynard, Charlie Sloane, and Gilbert Blythe.Redmond College in Kingsport will be a big adjustment for Anne. Fortunately, vivacious new friend Phillippa Gordon will fill out a foursome for the girls to rent cozy Patty's Cottage as a home base for studies and an active social life.The once awkward Anne has grown into an attractive, passionate, and caring young woman who excels at her studies and her many friendships. She will receive several offers of marriage. At least two proposals will pose tough choices. Anne's relationship with longtime friend and admirer Gilbert Blythe is complicated. Anne is attracted to Gilbert and cherishes their friendship, but she is not prepared to see her childhood chum as a romantic leading man. When Gilbert makes clear he wants more from Anne than her friendship, she makes an anguished refusal of his proposal.Wealthy, charming and worldly fellow student Roy Gardner will seem to embody Anne's notion of romance. Anne will ignore some warning signs, not least her continuing feelings for Gilbert, during their two year courtship. Roy's expected marriage proposal will force Anne to face the potential consequences of a choice: a comfortable life with a wealthy man who is not a kindred spirit, a lonely spinsterhood of good works, or, perhaps, a second chance with the man who completes her.\\"Anne of the Island\\" is very highly recommended to \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" fans as a moving and emotionally decisive chapter in her life."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I love all the Anne books...and I'm almost 70 years old! They were \\"old fashioned\\" when I was a child, and perhaps even more so now, but they take me back to a simpler, sweeter time, and when I am done reading them on my \\"every decade or so\\" re-reading binge, I hate to leave that time behind. I was missing this one from my \\"collection\\" of them, and enjoyed catching up on Anne again."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I have loved these books since Jr. High, when I identified with bookish, clumsy, often absentminded Anne. I, too, walked around with my head in the clouds! Although I never bought hair dye from a traveling gypsy, nor dyed my nose blue in an attempt to rid it of freckles, I have dumped an entire pan of cake batter into the oven while daydreaming about my future husband (at age 13!), spilled a full container of quick cook oatmeal while imagining I was adopted by my parents (I was really a princess!), and nearly scared my mother to death when at the age of 8 I decided I was old enough to cook and nearly set the house on fire! If you are a dreamy, headstrong girl full of life and mischief, yet loving and full of joy (or know a girl like this), these are the books for you! They are wonderfully written, you can almost smell the flowers and the ocean air, see Anne, and her friends, and wish you could go back in time! If only..."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is the third installment of the smash Anne of Green Gables series. The book begins with Anne leaving for college to further her education the second time. When she arrives, she encounters a slew of minor domestic problems, a new group of friends, and Love. All of which she deals with using that famous atypical personality of a \\"Kindred spirit\\"Although the book deals with more serious subject matter than the preceding books, as a reflection upon Anne's growing older, the book starts with the lighthearted catchy fun that made Anne famous in her prequels. Most of this fun is centered on the Anne's encounters with her roommate cats Rusty, Joseph, and Sarah-Cat. Anne's exclamations of fear at being stalked by the docile house cats is classic Anne and delicious fun.The Book also dives into more serious matter, with Lets be friends-Lets be more than friends-Lets be friends-I hate you-Marry me! Gilbert abandoning his indecisiveness and aggressively courting Anne. Although this relation is of little interest to male readers, it is made a key plot element, most likely because it is attractive to the books target demographic, pre-teen girls. Luckily, most of the content on Anne's romance does nothing to affect other parts of the story much and as a result are harmless to skip when they become drab.Anne of the Island is a solid installment in the Anne series. Although not equaling or surpassing Anne of Green Gables, \\"Of the Island\\" leaves little to be desired besides not having a near constant usage of the word \\"eh\\". If you an Anne fan, pick up her third book. Eh."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"The story of Anne continues with this work and the author stays true to her style, story line and character developement. This, like the other books in this series, have a rather timeless nature about them and a comforting charm. The reader, of course, must remember the time they were written and the style and syntax used at that time. From my own point of view, this is great. I enjoy this type of writing and certainly enjoy Ms. Montgomery's story telling abilities. In this work, Anne goes off to Redman College and her adventure continues. Recommend these books for readers of all ages. Wish there were more works out there like it."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"this is one of the best of the Anne of Green Gables books. from what Anne thought of Gibert Blythe then to what she thinks at the end of the book!

It was refreshing to read about diffrent scenery and new friends. Anne meets some great people gets many proposals and accepts one. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book is my personal favourite of all the Anne books. I usually see the first three in the series as a trilogy, because they're the best of the 8 books, with the exception of &quot;Anne's House of Dreams.&quot; I was impressed with this book because it managed to go beyond just Avonlea and Green Gables. It put Anne in a new setting and showed how she managed there, with new friends and a home away from home. I admit that one of the best things about this book is the not-quite romance between Gilbert and Anne. Any readers who have been dying to see their romance fulfilled finally get a bit of what they're looking for. However, Montgomery manages to bring in the romance while retaining Anne's free spirit. This diminished in the later books, only to be reincarnated at the end in &quot;Rilla of Ingleside.&quot; I recommend this book to anyone who loves a romance, but also loves creative characters like Anne."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is one of my all-time favorite books. It is romantic but realistic. It isn't one of those books where they see each other in some impossibly easy place and swoon over each other the rest of the book. It deals with real problems people can have, like deciding if and why you love someone. The characters are loveable and well developed. The book is topped off with a bone-tingling ending you'll want to read again and again!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This book contains one of my favorite characters from any &quot;Anne&quot; book. I love Philippa Gordon! Not to mention Aunt Jamesina, Priscilla, Stella, and all the gang at Patty's Place. I am a university student myself and all Anne's trials and tribulations as a college student are now very familiar to me. Of course, all the fun is familiar to me too. &quot;Anne of the Island&quot; and any other L.M. Montgomery book are my cure for a dull, depressing day. Anne and all her other wonderful characters will bring a smile to anyone's face."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"The third book of the Anne series, &quot;Anne of theIsland&quot; is a wonderful, romantic book. Anne Shirlyhas left her beloved Green Gables and has packedher bags for Redmond College, where she will findfriendships, adventure, and romance. She falls inlove with a house called &quot;Patty's Place&quot; a GreenGables away from Green Gables! There are two lovelyold maids that inhabit it, and Anne gets to boardthere for two years, along with some friends. Thisis a classic Anne book, and although Anne is growingup, she still gets into as many scrapes and messesas she ever did before!"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This third installment in the beloved Anne series is one of my favorites. Having just completed two years of teaching in Avonlea, Anne, along with friends Gilbert and Charlie, is ready to leave the Island and make her way to Redmond College. Her four years there offer quaint-seeming insights into college life a hundred years ago. After spending her freshman year in a boarding house, Anne and chums Priscilla, Stella, and Philippa move into a little house called Patty's Place. Even though they are committed to their studies, life is never dull. Anne has no lack of suitors, turning down no fewer than five proposals during the course of the story. And her summers are full of adventure, whether it's back in dear Avonlea or teaching as a country schoolmarm.I've read Anne of the Island each year I've been in college, and as I finished it this time, I couldn't help but relate to Anne's excitement for the future, mingled with regretful nostalgia about the college life she was leaving behind. College is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Having attended a small Christian university, I relate to Anne's old-fashioned values and the safe, wholesome environment of Redmond.Montgomery has such a pungent writing voice, alive to the quirks of human nature and the beauties of outdoor nature. She brings spice, optimism, and a touch of cynicism to the story and the characters. Anne's most personal experiences are recounted with poignancy, and are rooted in reality, although they may seem whimsical to modern readers. The ending is sweet and satisfying. I just love Anne, and especially this tale of her college experiences. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"I thought this book was SO wonderful. The delightful Anne Shirley is bombarded with marriage proposals, in which she acts accordingly. In this book, you see once again Anne's true character. In Anne's dream world, her Prince Charming comes riding on his white horse to sweep her off her feet. There is no hesitation, nothing to mar that picturesque world. In reality, however, everything is helter-skelter. We follow Anne to Redmond with all her friends, Phil, Aunt Jamesina, Priscilla, and Stella, along with Rusty the cat. There is so much excitement going on; so much drama that I soon got wrapped up in all of Anne Shirley's doings. Every scene in the park and every room at Patty's Place becomes crystal clear. You see a red-haired girl coming slowly into womanhood, not the bold text of the book. Anne of the Island is a remarkable read."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Anne of the Island is one of the better of the Anne books. Anne goes off to college, where she learns not only English, mathematics, Greek, and various other subjects, but also lessons about love and life. She adopts a homeless cat, receives (and refuses) five proposals of marriage, and wonders how Gilbert can spoil a perfectly good friendship with all this love-nonsense. She visits the town where she was born and makes lots of new friends. Then she meets her ideal - the dark, melancholy and handsome Roy Gardner. But is her ideal all that idyllic without a good sense of humour?"},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"This third installment in the Anne of Green Gables series is a lot of fun to read because it focuses on Anne's college years. Many readers remark that this book is their favorite in the Anne series, but I think it is difficult to assign one book that honor. All of the books fit so well together. I would have liked more detail. There were too many friends and not enough story line to justify so many people in her life. I love Patty's Place and Anne's life at Redmond, but I actually wanted more time devoted to her life in Redmond. I guess this is a sign of a true fan to want more. More time could have been spent developing the friends and friendships. I think Montgomery grew tired of writing the Anne series and rushed it along from time to time."},{"Title":"Anne of the Island","review":"Gave as a gift and the recipient love the book. I will buy more of the L. M. Montgomery books."},{"Title":"Little Mouse's Big Valentine (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Most of the Valentine stories available don't work well as read alouds for preschoolers, but this one is always a hit, AND it has a nice underlying theme of sharing with friends.It's also a wonderful story to be told with puppets at a story hour, especially if you end by giving all the children a little red valentine of their own!"},{"Title":"Little Mouse's Big Valentine (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The watercolor illustrations are cheerfully colored, and loosely rendered. There's very little detail, which I can appreciate with simple stories. Author/illustrator Thacher Hurd conveys his ideas simply, without fanfare. The age recommendation is preschool to first grade, which is appropriate, but I think an alert 3-year old might have the attention span to listen all the way through as well. Hurd succeeds in writing and illustrating an original story about Valentine's Day that deals with friendship and sharing in a positive way. Unlike so many tales associated with this holiday where the main characters compete for the biggest or best valentine, this one is actually about giving and making new friends."},{"Title":"Sew Easy to Kill","review":"This book is wonderful. For those who love British mysteries, I highly reccomend this. The plot is twisty enough to keep you in surprise and the humor that appears when it's needed is hilarious. This book can be easily read in one day and it's perfect for relaxing reading."},{"Title":"Sew Easy to Kill","review":"Sarah J. Mason is a pen-pal of mine. We both owned Schipperke dogs, and have spoken on the phone and corresponded a bit over the years. She used my name in the novel for a character that doesn't actually appear in the story. She asked my permission to use the name, and everything. Quite exciting for someone who works in a library.It is a wonderfully complex story, and very well written.Most enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Les Crimes de L'Amour","review":"Like other eighteenth-century \\"libertine novels,\\" especially Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons, The Crimes of Love tells us what happens when extremely virtuous characters collide with extremely evil ones. And as with other classic writers of the late eighteenth century, the French here is easy for foreign readers. But by contrast with the novels (and the real-life acts) that have given Sade such a bad reputation, these stories are economical and interest us far more through psychology than through cruelty or perversion. To the five entertaining stories he has selected, Michel Delon adds the author's \\"Idea on novels\\" and an informative dossier.The only recent translation (out of print) was published in the textually unreliable Bantam Classics series. A new translation of these stories would be a worthy project for an intermediate or advanced student of French."},{"Title":"Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures","review":"Its a must have for the resident of orthopaedics and a good mate to senior orthopaedist, I think that the way the autor writtes and the squema makes this a unique book in the vast fiel of the orthopaedics, i wish i had one 25 years ago, when i was in the residency, well any way i enjoy it now and a lot...it makes me easy any fast consultation i hope you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures","review":"The book was in excellent condition and I'd like to describe more about the seller who understood my problem how fast it had to be delivered, because I was sending this book overseas and shipped the book as soon as I made transaction.Thank you and GOD bless this seller, if I'm not mistaken his name was Philipe and The book store's is lastwordbookshop."},{"Title":"Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures","review":"A friend of mine have one and it's simple a wonder, it is made by arnold publishers and has 752 pp, its format is excellent.

I found only one short story by David Leavitt in an anthology of which title is &quot;Gravity&quot;. I found it so beautiful that I gave it to my students to read and I will also buy the whole book. &quot;Gravity&quot; is a masterpiece of short fiction that should be read by all straight people. I also would be interested in translating the book into Hungarian!"},{"Title":"A Place I've Never Been (Contemporary American Fiction)","review":"David Leavitt's fabulous collection, opened my eyes and made me feel warm and toasty inside. His stories made me cry as well and smile. Although I do not have an immediate connection with David Leavitt's stories, they did bring back memories of different life situations. I recommend this book to young or old, retired or a student. Life is always handing out situations to think about and Leavitt's collection could help you through it."},{"Title":"BATTLE FOR PLANET EARTH: The Chronicles of Dar-Rek Mar-Cus Ra","review":"I picked up my copy from some little grocery store owner in a town with no more than maybe 15 people. He appeared to be generally insane, but not in a violent way. He gave me the book as a gift, saying I needed to read it, and that he was friends with the author. Who knows. As far as sci-fi goes, it isn't all that good, but it is made all the better because some people actually believe it. Kinda like a book about Scientology and all their alien stuff, or Heaven's Gate. If you can find a copy, do pick it up."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Good material for any age of marriage. Very tasteful and godly. Well done. A bargain for four dollars. Worth the money."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Great book for Couples who are about to get married or one that are already married and want to better understand what God created marriage and sex and how to make it the most fulfilling for you both. I would also recommend the book Sacred Marriage by Gary Thomas."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I buy this book as a wedding shower present for engaged couples. If you want a book that explains \\"the act of marriage\\" from a Christians perspective, this book is for you. It's very detailed and very good."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Every Married couple or soon to be, should read this book. Wish I would of had it when I first got Married."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"my fiancee and I are reading this as our weding date comes. some chapters we are waiting tell the wedding is done before reading, but a good book.LaHaye doesn't know anythign about end times and novel theology should always be \\"left behind\\", but this is a good book"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I do not recommend this book to any well-educated Christian woman with career ambitions because she's bound to get even midly offended at such lines as, \\"Every woman...wants to be a homemaker\\" and explicit suggestions that women have no fewer than four to five children.This book was recommended to me by a friend through a friend. She had grown up in church and was not exposed to tons of sexual things growing up (which is great). I think this book is only for people like her, those who, although are fantastic people, have never seen an R-rated movie nor been to a liberal arts college.For a book that's allegedly \\"udpated,\\" it is certainly archaic. It references the world population as being 3.8 billion -- the world population is now nearly twice that figure. Surely some things about society (and the Christians in it) has changed with all those people now in it! But there is no mention or respect of this at all. (Additionally, although I would not call myself a \\"feminist,\\" I did find it terribly disrepectful that feminists were referred to flippantly as \\"women's libbers.\\" Grow up, please.) The \\"oral sex is to be avoided\\" argument is another laugh. Far be it from me to tell married people what to do in their bedrooms, even if it's outside of Missionary.Some of the facts are actually out-and-out incorrect. For starters, the author states that the clitoris \\"[may or may not] have about the same number of nerve endings\\" as the male genitalia. This is completely false! In fact, the clitoris has TWICE the number of nerve endings, 8,000 to the male 4,000! It is not only that this information is incorrect, it robs women of the chance to know that God created sex to be truly, geniunely pleasurable for women -- you most certainly would not know this from reading this book.Even as a Christian woman, I was totally taken aback and offended at much of what I read. And as a Christian woman who kissed a man before she married him, the book taught me nothing I hadn't learned in seventh grade health class.So, basically, if you are a Christian woman, well-educated, and have had some sexual experience (even just kissing), don't waste your time on this book. I hate that I ever purchased it and am tempted to throw the copy away.Pardon me for not wanting four children and for not wanting to be a homemaker. God has called me to other things."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book opened my husband's and my eyes -- and then our hearts! I had always been afraid to ask my husband to do what I wanted in the bedroom, thinking, foolishly, he would come to think of me as one of the prostitutes he regularly ministers to as part of our outreach program. Well, did this book change my mind! I have learned that &quot;crotchless&quot; does NOT equal &quot;unsaved.&quot; And our marriage is so strong now, nothing can pull us apart. Thank you, thank you!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I read the book before and after I got married. It gave basically one answer to a woman's ability to enjoy sex. It didn't work and now I'm searching for a different answer."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book has a lot of good practical information on sex for the Christian contemplating marriage or the newly married who has little or no sexual experience. The authors are frank, which is a plus.However, this book in my opinion reinforces unhealthy and untrue gender stereotypes. In Tim's pastoral experience counseling women, they all seem to have blushed at the word sex. I wonder if he did all his counseling in the 50s. Men are portrayed as having been designed by God to experience sex primarily as a physical experience, while for women it is not very much a physical act but is an emotional act. My husband experiences it just as much as an emotional and relational act as he does a physical act, as I believe God intended for men, as I also believe he intended for women. I as a woman experience it as a physical act as much as I do an emotional/relational act. I have plenty of friends who are the same way. So much for the gender stereotypes.The propagation of these old school views on gender angered me so much in fact that I ripped the book into pieces (literally) and threw it away. There are other good Christian books that frankly deal with the topic without pigeon-holing the genders or reinforcing an attitude that has excused men from being disconnected from their emotions and their wives hearts in the most intimate act invented by God. It is an attitude that has encouraged women to be available to meet her husband's physical \\"needs,\\" as if he needs sex to live, or as if her sexual drive is tiny by comparison (which I believe after the Sexual Revolution society has begun to realize is not the case).A minor issue but a point of annoyance for me: Tim reminds women to look their best when their husband comes home from work, while the the authors feel no need to say the same to men. This assumes that a) men are the breadwinners while women stay at home to do the domestic deeds (umm, I think times they are a'changin') and that b) women need to be reminded to spend time making themselves look good. Um, 'scuse me, but which gender tends to be more obcessed with their looks, and which gender is the one that tends to look sloppier and could use the reminding. ;-)For all my criticism, I admit I came to the book with anger-at-men issues, so the presence of some of these issues really lit my fuse; the book is valuable to those that can recognize and overlook the unhealthy gender stereotyping. It does contain much practical, helpful information about the physicality of sex, a topic which Christians, oddly, too often seem unable to talk about amongst ourselves. If the above topics bother you too, though, read The Gift of Sex by Penner and Penner."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I received the book as a gift in 1988. I decided to read the book starting at chapter 13. This chapter was the one chapter that stood out to me. The reason that this chapter stood out is it express the importance of the good lord Jesus Christ being head of any and all married couples."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"As a christian, this book gave me a lot of useful information before getting married (and after), it's a great introduction to martial sex life.

I love how they give their perspective from a Christian standpoint and talk about the immorality of today which can have a large effect on how couples view the 'act of marriage'. I learned a lot and I have been married 10 years! I feel much more comfortable with my spouse and our marriage is even better even though it was pretty good to begin with.

I love this book. Well written and straight forward, which is what Christian couples need. I love how they start off telling what sex means to a man and what it means to a woman. Then they literally break down our different bodies, and the functions of our sexual organs. This is great for those who have remained pure until marriage, and really don't know. This book is also great for our young people to help them understand how important it is to wait to have sex, until marriage with the opposite sex. This is makes a great wedding gift and teaching tool."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I learned about this book from a marriage and family class I took in college and bought it before my husband and I were married and it was great. I've also bought it/recommended it for friends getting married. It talks about sex from a Christian point of view and teaches those who are \\"inexperienced\\" pretty much everything you need to know to make the whole experience wonderful and less intimidating.It is also great for those who are already married. It has different sections about men and women and what they each need/want from an intimate relationship and how you as a spouse can do that for them. Additionally it has sections about \\"issues\\" within a sexual relationship and how a husband and wife can overcome those issues.I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a Christian take on sex within marriage."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"There is much benefit that could be obtained from reading this book, expecially for young married couples. However, all of LaHaye's theology should be taken with a grain of salt. There is no shortage of errors in his chapter entitled 'The missing dimension,\\" in which he presents a sub par half gospel and then procedes to go into a \\"sinners prayer.\\" The book is definitely worth reading for some practical advice from a semi Christian standpoint IF you are able to extract that without digesting the bad theology. For a more sound theology on sex I would STRONGLY recommend \\"Sex and the supremecy of Christ\\" by John Piper and Justin Taylor. If you are a new Christian, or if you are not proficient in the scriptures, it would be better to read Sex and the supremecy of Christ before you dive into this one. Because, after all, Christ and his gospel are much more important than just having \\"good sex.\\" Get your theology straight with Piper and Taylor, and then move onto the pratical with LaHaye.Soli Deo GloriaSex and the Supremacy of Christ"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I came across this book when I was looking for something to help with my \\"lukewarm\\" attitude about sex. My husband and I had been married for 17 years at the time. I borrowed \\"Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask\\" from my friend but found some things to be offensive and vulgar. I began praying about the situation because I loved my husband and knew this was a need of his. I found the Act of Marriage at a Christian bookstore and as I thumbed through the pages, it really opened my eyes about some things. I can honestly say it changed our sex life in amazing ways. We have now been married 32 years and our sex life is very satisfying. I have given this book as a wedding gift to many couples. I don't want them to have to wait 17 years to get this information!My husband is a pastor and we often counsel other couples. The \\"Act of Marriage\\" is one of the two books we often recommend. The other book is \\"His Needs, Her Needs\\" by Willard Harley.One word of caution. In the older versions of this book, the LaHayes expressed that there were cases when they felt abortion was permissible. I strongly disagreed with them. They have since changed their perspective on that."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book was SOOOO helpful when my husband and i read it before our wedding! We were raised in church and virgins when we married and had always heard all the \\"No having sex before you're married\\" speeches but i didn't realize til we read this book how little positive, Christian perspective we'd been given on the gift of sex other than that the act was designed by God and children are a blessing. i'd heard so many wedding night horror stories from friends and was fairly terrified and confused about why that would be...i think the reviews that talk about how outdated this book is need to realize how long ago it was written and that maybe some parts weren't helpful to them but after i read it i thought this would be so helpful to all couples no matter how long they'd been married, i think everyone could gain something from reading it. There's probably many couples thinking they know all there is to know because they've been in a married sexual relationship for 40 years or whatever but the value of the chapters(and from a Christian perspective) about how the Lord designed different areas of our body to function is not something you can just learn from experience. And some couples who went into marriage more \\"experienced\\" maybe don't realize why they're experiencing some negative residual affects after marriage.i would just think that one could consider the fact that this dear couple who love the Lord and want to help couples in this area of their marriage and who WERE writing to a certain audience at a certain time, and could read this with a little grace, take the good, disregard what doesn't apply to you personally, and realize that this book has had so many editions printed, it is a classic that HAS helped so many couples and we can REJOICE in that, that is amazing and valuable, i recommend this book whenever the topic comes up and i have personally seen the Lord bless us so much because of what we learned reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"As a young couple looking into marriage, our pastor gave us this book to read and discuss.

It also opened up the lines of communication between my husband and I before we were ever married. It is a wonderful study book for the couple.

My husband and I were able to get informed with a christian perspective and we were able to take from it what we needed. This is a book that I often give to friends whom are getting married.

Both of us were virgins before getting married as we strongly don't believe is premarital sex. This of course, also made sex a sort uncomfortable, yet important topic we needed to discuss before actually doing it. Reading this together helped open those doors of discussion and guided us in talking about sensitive subjects that perhaps have never were discussed before. Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it is in no way written in an offensive language. It mostly expresses general christian values regarding the importance of marital sex in strong relationships. I highly recommend it, whether you're about to get married, or already are."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"The Act of Marriage was very beneficial to me before I was married. I had never heard or read anything about sex from a Christian perspective. The LeHayes provided a course of the physical aspects of marriage (sex), while at the same time focusing in upon the more relational and spiritual. The physical aspects included things like the role of male and female hormones in the arousal of sexual feelings. The relational and spiritual focused upon things like pleasing your spouse and finding out what is most pleasing for your partner. I was especially pleased to hear about the physiological components of sex from two Christians, because my experience with Christians and sex has been very Victorian and repressive. The LeHayes are not like that at all.I was very nervous and scared about the First Night. I found out that my spouse was also very nervous. The LeHayes book helped to lessen and queit our fears. I think the best part of the boo is the description of the Brain and mind as the most important sexual organ. Overall, the LeHayes did a wonderful job."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book was great for those of us who entered marriage with no previous sexual experience. It explained things and offered helpful advice. Maybe some people don't need any tips but I was grateful to gain some knowledge about this area of my marriage that is important to us. It was also wonderful to have it presented in a religious way as part of a marriage rather than from magazine suggestions regarding sex while dating."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"The Act of Marriage, did have its good points- but also alot of bad points. For those going into sex blindly, it may be a good read, however, I found it very manual like. The authors presented sex in a step by step form and did not leave much room for experimentation. Tey made it sound like sex had to be done in a certain orderly and ordered way or it would not be right. (...gently massage the area around the vulva for 5 minutes then proceed to massage the clitoris for ten minutes, making sure finger nails are cut and clean) Sex needs to be spontaneous and fun sometimes! The good part of the book was the mentioning of the Kegel exercises. I was happy to read about them, seeing that you can read about the wonders they do in magazines like Cosmo, I am glad that the Christian women can get in on the info!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I was given this book as a present and I didn't start reading it until things were NOT that exciting in the bed between me and my new husband.Ladies, all you need to read is the chapter \\"For Women Only\\" and your sex life will be changed forever!!! Since reading our sex life has gone from \\"guess I have to do this\\" to \\"can we do it again?!?!\\"I give it to every newly married couple as a gift. I've given it to 7 girlfriends and all 7 of them have reported that it was the \\"best gift ever\\" and thanked me immensely for it.I recommend it to newly married couples or for those who would like to find more enjoyment in their sex life. God created sex to be enjoyed by both men & women & this book is a great guide to help you enjoy sex to the fullest!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book was recommended to us by a friend and my OB/GYN. It was great. For young, inexperienced, Christain couples, this tells you what you need know without feeling like you're reading a nasty book, while at the same time, putting sex in marriage in the proper perspective."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"My fianc&eacute; & I are both virgins and even though we are both excited & full of anticipation, we are also both (especially me) nervous about that first time together. This book has helped a great deal to relieve many of my apprehensions. This book is wonderfully well written. I have now passed the book along to my fianc&eacute;. I recommend this book to all my to-be married & already married friends."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I have read the first chapter of this book and I like this book so much. I am a Chinese and my English is no good so I can't continue to read. Do you have an Chinese translation for this book &quot;The Act of Marriage&quot;."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Me and my wife liked this book a lot. There is very good information about how to approach most of the situations you face when you are a newly wed"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"found this book had some interesting information. It brought my husband and I closer...sort of rekindled the flame after 28 years of marriage. I especially liked that it is written from a Christian view point and answers many questions about sex and marriage by looking directly to the bible to see what God wants for us and from us. Also has a lot of practical info. from years of research and marriage counseling. I think it would be especially helpful to newlyweds. Down side: stereotypes the roles of wives and husbands a bit. We need to work together, taking advantage of our God-given gifts and interests. That may mean the wife handles the finances or the husband does the cooking (just an example)."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"My wife and I read this book right before we were married and it contains practical information about what to expect in the sexual act and ways to increase physical enjoyment, although we did not find all of the suggestions to be useful. My main concern with the book is the chapter titled &quot;Sane Family Planning.&quot; The LaHaye's heartily endorse the pill (oral contraceptives) as the preferred method of birth control, although there is a lot of evidence that the pill acts as abortifacient at least some of the time.....In addition, the LaHaye's description of the &quot;rhythm method&quot; poorly characterizes Natural Family Planning (NFP) techniques currently used today............."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I was offended in the chapter about oral love. It was insinuated that decent people did not engage in this activity. It suggested that oral love was a recent phenomenom which encouraged promiscuity. I hardly see that as the case. What goes on between two married people in their bedroom needs to be left alone.Point number two was the saying female orgasm was important but on the other hand saying a woman could not miss what she never had. They spoke of earlier times when women just lay there for the man and did not complain. I was utterly disgusted with that.Point number three was the one about begetting children. Propagating our genes could be looked on just as selfish as those who want to abstain from having children. Look around at all the filled orphanages and tell me that we are taking care of our children on earth.I was given this book upon my wedding night by a friend's mother. It did not bring me comfort but instead caused needless guilt to my already inhibited husband.Please get your theology straight and stay out of married couple's bedrooms."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book was very information and still kept the act of sex in a sacred manner. If you view sex as special and sacred thing especially with a Christian outlook, then you'll very much enjoy this book. It's informative and helpful. It'll help you come to understand more about how to have more fulfillment and in a way to bring you closer to your spouse. It's fantastic for those who are preparing for marriage and need to understand more or who are married with a need to have greater fulfillment. I'd recommend this book to anyone who I thought it could help. That pretty much is anyone who is engaged to married for many years! You won't regret buying this book!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"We have found this book very helpful and have given copies to each of our children when they get married."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"A must read for anyone getting married or needed some help in the marriage bed!!!!!! seriously a fabulous book. my husband and I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Overall, an 'OK' read, but teaches human sexuality as though his audience was a grade-six sex education class as rather than mature-minded adults. This book is extremely simplistic and vague, and tends to lean towards a more dellusional depiction of human sexuality, often confining it to the contexts of outmodded biblical principles and male-dominated patriarchy. Lacking modern approach and intimate sensuality, I would sincerely hope that this book is not a reflection of poor Tim's seemingly mechanical sex life!! I would not recommend this book unless you are totally ignorant and clueless about what sex is all about. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a more relevant guide to sexual intimacy."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"The book was in great shape other than a few bent page corners and some underlining in the text. These things were noted in the purchase description however, so they were not a surprise. The book itself is a wonderful book that every married or soon to be married couple should read."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Book was exactly as described. Great book. Delivers speedily and in great condition. Would order from them again in the future. Thank you"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book is a great gift for newlyweds. The couple can read it individually and then together. I learned from it and enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Very graphic book. I was going to have my fiance read some of this too but i think I'm going to have to wait until like the week before the wedding. I've read almost the whole book now and it's just a lot of graphic material that guys probably don't need to be thinking about all summer."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I just finished reading the book 2 days ago and ever since I started I have been sharing its insights to my wife. I got married in May 1998 but my wife and I had been separated by distance since 2 weeks after we got married. I'm still in the process of sponsoring her to join me where I am now.This book had made me realize how much my wife and I still have to learn and it gives me the exciting anticipation of learning it with her using the principles outlined by the book. The Lord's involvement even in this area is crucial and I commend the LaHaye's for putting forth such great revelation to those who are missing the spiritual dimension in the act of marriage. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This important book has plenty of great information for newlywed couples, and I am grateful that it is available as an alternative to the non-Christian and sometimes amoral resources that seem to dominate this topic. But I cannot give it five stars, because some of the information is not adequate. The Birth Control Pill is promoted, although I understand it is sometimes abortifacient. Also, the information regarding Natural Family Planning (this book uses the outdated term &quot;Rhythym&quot;) is about 35 years past its time!! I would strongly recommed any reader to do their own research on the above two topics. I would also suggest that Catholic readers investigate Catholic teaching on the morality of birth control on their own, since this book takes a strong &quot;pro&quot; stance which is very different than the Catholic one. I also personally thought that certain historical comments in the book had a rather definite anti-Catholic tone. I am not accusing the LeHayes of being prejudiced against Catholics, but they do seem to have an unjustified antipathy towards the Catholic Church of history- probably because of a strong Protestant bias. The above points having been made, I would still recommend this book for married couples wanting to improve their physical relationship, and for engaged couples as they prepare for this special aspect of their married lives."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book is a must have for people looking to learn more about how to please your mate. This is not a book about &quot;submission&quot; or anything of the such. It explains the male and female body functions, how and why they function, what to do to get pleasure out of &quot;the act of marriage&quot;. This book also gives the wife and husbands pointers on turn offs and turn ons. It's a great book to enhance your knowlege in the bed in a very decent text. I think all people can learn from this book. It's got common sense and points out things people would never know about with out researching the human body on their own."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Read this book before you get married, or even after. I love the religious perspective on all the things my parents didn't know or were too embarrassed to tell me about. My husband and I learned so much from this book."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"As a Christian woman I have to agree with the original post. It is quite unfortunate that this book does not consider a \\"ladies first\\" approach to orgasm but rather merely speaks of arousing a woman in preparation \\"to receive him\\". Right and once he is finished and presumable tired and ready to sleep what about her?Another disappointment was the brevity in foreplay. Seriously? What woman Christian or otherwise can appreciate such a lack of consideration? The skin is a human largest organ and largest sexual organ and so little was mentioned in regards to taking time with a slow pleasing touch.Finally the complete lack of acknowledgment of the existence of the G-spot. Yes many Christian men and male authors are in fact quite ignorant. How can the author claim to show care for the woman's complete sexual experience while dismissing or failing to mention some VERY key portions of it.Very disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I was recommended this book by my pastor during premarital counseling. My fiance and I are both waiting for marriage, but are not out of touch with our own sexuality or God's intent for sex. I was disappointed with this book.The author referred to women as \\"beautiful creatures\\" on several occasions. I am a beautiful woman. I am a person, not a creature. I am different than a man, but am just as valuable as a man. The author also states that all women actually want to stay home and be homemakers deep down inside. This is not fact in a modern society where some women make the decision to balance a career and child rearing. What about men who are primary caregivers? The book also suggests that women reach their peak sexual years the same time as men. This is not the case, as shown in more recent medical and psychological studies. Women enjoy sex most in middle age. These are examples of the kind of content in this book.I love Christ and his word and appreciate the author's effort to include them and offer a biblical perspective on sexuality in marriage. However, this book needs to be updated to reflect current medical findings about sexuality. It also needs to update its commentary on gender roles to reflect the lifestyles of current married couples. I'm pretty sure God is okay with women choosing to work. Our friend in Proverbs 31 did!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book is a fascinating read. I have never read something thoroughly and yet delicately explains the inner workings of the sexual organs, the sex act, and everything leading up to it. It also contains great information on building a strong marriage, communicating with your spouse, and giving each other the best possible experience in bed and throughout your daily lives together.This book was essential in the early days of my marriage. Both my husband and I read it and learned a lot from it. We still go back to it as a reference from time to time. We have two copies, so that if we ever lend one out, we've always got one at home!I have no idea what a previous reviewer meant when they said that it was anti-female. Perhaps they read a different book and thought it was this one? This book focuses on TENDER, COMPASSIONATE, UNSELFISH love for both husband and wife. It gives pointers on many things that are not often talked about, and overall, this is one of the best marriage/sex books I have ever read.I would highly recommend this to anyone who is thinking of getting married, has recently married, or who has already been married for 75 years. If you want insight into your relationship and sexual lives, including ways to add more spark to both, this is the book you've been looking for."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Good book that really puts the act of marriage in its true perspective and original intent."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This explicit and detailed book about sex comes from a Christian perspective (more Evangelical in some areas). It emphasizes how wonderful and enjoyable and RIGHT sex is within marriage. It details what a wedding night could include. There's a whole chapter called \\"The Art of Lovemaking\\" that has a number of useful hints as well as explicit direction and some couples' experiences and comments. It addresses emotional, spiritual, and relationship issues as they intersect with sex. It supports having children, yet also supports using birth control in some circumstances to give the couple space to be a couple first or let the wife enjoy sex between desired children. Info is given on what makes men and women tick and how to make sure both enjoy sex as much as possible. Two words for you: Multiple Orgasms! Two words I think may be over emphasized: Simultaneous orgasms.I don't fully agree with the theology presented in this book (this occurs more in the later portion of the book). I also disagree with the whole idea of different temperments labelled as choleric, sanguine, melancholic, and phlegmatic. That's just not how I see the world, but is used to explain people surprisingly often, at least in the older version I have. However, that does not take away from the extraordinarily useful information presented in a way that keeps the trust of many Christians that have a strong sense morality. For example, you will not find premarital sex, or staying childless, or using pornography to fan the flame presented as normal and acceptable, as you will in many other sources of sexually explicit information."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"love this book.. it was recommended to us when we got married.. almost 18 yrs. ago... since then we have recommended to lots of new to be married couples. and some olds.. that it could help... this is the updated version.. if honeymooners would read this book. there would be much better marriages out there..."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Very informative and interesting, but a little too much detail when the author talks exactly how to have sex.

I buy it for every friend before her wedding night. It is an indispensable resource for both husband and wife in preparation for (or in maintenance of) a fulfilling sexual relationship. Contrary to another post, this book devotes extensive description to the woman's needs and how her husband can lovingly meet them."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"Sent this to my daughter as my sisters insist it inspired and dramatically improved their love life."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"\\"The Act of Marriage\\" is a book I kept hearing about while reading other books. I figured a Christian book on sex wouldn't have much helpful information. Well I have just been proven wrong. After reading several secular books on sex and comparing them to this one, \\"The Act of Marriage\\" is the one I would recommend to anyone considering marriage. Even if you have been married for over 10 years there is still more to learn. This is an extremely informative and detailed book on sexuality and it focuses a lot on female satisfaction and pleasure.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book simply needs to be read by every couple, married or not. Sex is one of the top two reasons people get a divorce in America (the other is money), and yet, most couples never bother to read a single book on either subject.I could recommend a few good books on managing money, but as for sex; this is THE book you must read.The authors are a Christian couple, and, as such, the book is written from a completely Christian perspective. It's not so much a hands-on guide, but rather it helps couples to better understand the psychology behind sex, which is infinitely more valuable than a bunch of pictures of people having sex. This is not porno disguised as a self-help book.My marriage has had many hard times, and most have been related to sexual discord, but this book helps us to really understand the other partners needs, and teaches us how to experience sexual harmony.If you know anyone who's engaged, or who's marriage is in peril, PLEASE give them 'The Act of Marriage'. Your reward will be a great one!You can have a happy marriage!!!!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"An excellent informative book with very clear and concise information which also embraces humour and personal experiences. The LaHaye's are both extremely frank in their approach to writing and are not scared to discuss issues which most Christian literature skirts around. I really wish we had been given this book to read prior to marriage, it would have prevented the stumbling around in the dark that inevitably occurs when you get married. This book will definitely be required literature for my children prior to marriage. I would recommend it to all couples - prior to marriage, newly weds and &quot;experienced&quot; couples - there is a lot to be learnt in these pages at what ever stage you are at."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This is a useful book but very, very repetitive and could have been 100 pages shorter and not lost anything."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"This book breaks it all down in plain blunt english.

You think you know it all until you read this book. Extremely helpful!"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"An an engaged woman who will be married in a few months, I found this book quite insightful. It was informative in a Christian way that made me feel educated without feeling embarrassed. I wish it had discussed the new Sympto-Thermal method of Natural Family Planning -- this is not the old, outdated rhythm method that they describe. My fiance and I recently completed a very professionally done training seminar for the Sympt-Thermal Method of NFP (conducted by the volunteer organization called the Couple to Couple League). It's a shame that we were the only Protestants in the class. If the LaHayes and other Christians knew that this method of NFP is 99% effective and that there are very few abstinent days due to its accuracy, we would have more bible Christians practicing this method. I don't understand how the LaHayes, who are pro-life, can tell couples that the Pill is the best birth control. It is now a medically established fact that the Pill causes micro abortions when it fails to prevent ovulation. Also, I have friends who have suffered severe side effects from taking the Pill, such as blood pressure abnormalities. I feel that the LaHayes should recommend the new NFP over the unethical Pill. Otherwise, I felt the book was worth buying. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"i have a copy of this book myself and wanted a copy to give away"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"It gave a a whole differnt perspective as to what consecrating a marriage really is."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"What really turned me off about this book was when I read the chapter on \\"Sane Birth Control\\". I would have skipped that chapter since I have no interest in being a parent. But something prompted me to read it. I found a condemnation of the childfree lifestyle. Apparently, the authors have no familiarity with childfree issues. Nor did they seem to have much understanding and sympathy for those who would like to have children, but are physically unable to do so. The authors also do not acknowledge that women's roles have expanded since the early 20th century. The idea that most married women are or will be stay-at-home moms is not reality. I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"My husband and I only had to read the first chapter of this book to realize how one-sided this book was. (Notice the more in-depthness in the &quot;What Lovemaking Means to a Man&quot; chapter compared to the &quot;What Lovemaking Means to a Woman&quot;.) Sentences in there, indeed paragraphs!, make the man seem like a neanderthal and a selfish pig. My husband took offense to this, as did I, and we stopped reading it after chapter 3. Would NEVER, EVER recommend this book for newlyweds. We would recommend &quot;Intended for Pleasure&quot; by Ed Wheat, instead. Shame, shame on you, Mr. and Mrs. LaHaye, for writing such an out-dated book. We will be taking our book back.(Of course, I could write TONS more on this book, however, Amazon would not give me enough space :-)"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I borrowed a copy from a friend in preparation for my upcoming marriage, and I was pleasantly surprised at how the LaHayes are frank and left no stone unturned. Good diagrams on the male and female anatomy. Also, their advice on enjoying your spouse to the fullest, throwing modesty out the bedroom door is to be lauded. But what kept me from recommending this book is how their Neo-Evangelical/Arminian theology affected their view on certain sexual techniques.First of all, oral sex is viewed not as an long-practiced supplement to genital sex but an recent innovation that \\"good spirit-filled Christians\\" should avoid or cut out. Second, they confused the Rhythm Method with Natural Family Planning that is effective. (At least they recommended use of a condom and spermicide, though I have reservations about their advice to the bride to use the Pill early.) Third: their usual \\"four temperaments\\"...you just cannot place people in a box.And finally, the biggest drawback: They tacked on this evangelical pitch willy-nilly at the end of this book. ....If only a Lutheran have written this book...but it had to be an Pre-Millenialist Evangelical...*sigh*"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I read this and while I appreciate the &quot;knowledge&quot; about the act, the LaHayes are way off.

Didn't the LaHayes do any current research, or are they just going by very old cliches?

Spousal love is intended to be completely self-giving. Married couples must always be on guard against treating each other's bodies as objects, or using them for purposes other than those for which they were created. Yet this book provided a formula for objectification-husband and wife are reduced to body parts on the page, and the focus is on how to better stimulate each other, reaching greater orgiastic heights through sexual technique and skill. There was no mention of the fact that co-creating a baby with God is one of the most significant and transcendent experiences of our lives.Pleasure has so little to do with technique that I wonder if the couples who write these books are even in communion with each other. I don't love the way my husband makes ME feel or the way he &quot;pleases&quot; ME sexually. I love him, period. I would still love him if he were injured and we could never make love again.Innocence and communication are the two best things you can bring to your marriage. It's 10 times better to read a down-home anatomy book, with clinical explanations, than these technical how-to mechanics.Selling 2,500,000 books does not make you wise (Dr. Ruth has sold more books than these guys). Being 60 also does not neccessitate wisdom (watch Barbara Walters on &quot;the View&quot;). After reading the implication that God's primary design for marriage is one perpetual mutual orgasm, the LaHayes lost any credibility of being wise Christian counselors in my estimation.People will accuse me of being sexually inhibited, because I thought this book was crude.Why is it that when people want to be reticent about private things and guard mysteries, they are accused of being &quot;prudish&quot; or having a filthy view of sex? Notice the way the Song of Solomon veils everything in metaphors. When sex is dragged out into the street, or reduced to explicit anatomical instructions, it does become ugly. I walked away from that book feeling like I was one big (insert female anatomical part) and my husband was one big (insert male anatomical part).&quot;You cannot examine the coal away from the fire. You can't learn the meaning of a rose by pulling it to pieces.&quot; What fun is there if God drops you off on a secret island--your own private garden of Eden--and the LaHayes meet you on the beach with a map of all the best sight-seeing spots?"},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"My husband, Joe, who wrote the review above, is the man of my dreams.

It is a good re-education about sex and how to truly love one another (Essentially make each lovemaking session a contest to outdo the other in bringing pleasure - and that takes some preparation and work, but it is a \\"good work\\", and creates a powerful bond between you). The book gave her and I a great platform for discussion. This book described some of the many disasters I and my ex-wife suffered 30 years ago resulting from bad attitudes we got from society or our previous bad experiences at the hands others, and a lack of education about love and sex. Much of the book seems obvious now, but it is not when you are young, and they give a good background and put a useful vocabulary to many topic areas, while discussing these areas with generally good candor. Perhaps I note following because of what I experienced - it also notes the \\"Leave and Cleave\\" concept and importance if you are young, and warns about the people (Aunt Matilda) trying to inject bad thoughts into your marriage and sex life, and how that is somehow found in every nation, every race, every tribe. I had a mother in law who I think must have truly hated men in general, openly absolutely despised sex, and sought to continualy disparage me to my wife and seek and destroy any happiness we had in our marriage. She finally won the war in 7 years, due to my lack of experience, assertiveness and/or inability to help my wife better see what her mom was doing, and choose to leave and cleave to me, versus \\"Mommy\\". Related: I have heard many women complain that \\"All men want is sex\\", but, I would offer, if it is that simple, i.e., \\"All men want is sex\\", you might find yourself with a \\"simple\\" solution to unlocking intimacy, assuming that all other areas in your relationship are going reasonably well. \\"Getting enough sex\\" is a huge anxiety for those with a sex drive higher than their partner (it is not always the guy, but most often). Reducing anxiety, of any type, is a good thing that you can do for each other. (Oh, and they warn against sex as a weapon - big intimacy destroyer). My Best Wishes to you and yours as you seek to apply the good thoughts this couple shared. Be all that you can be to each other in every way possible, not just sex. The book builds upon a strong Christain foundation (which works for us), but the importance of diligently developing authentic loving attitudes and practices would help anyone, and you get a lot of thoughts, ideas, and \\"case studies\\" on this that will give your relationship an advantage. You've heard the saying \\"The Devil is in the Details\\" - the details of your thoughts and attitudes are key. They also suggest other resources for your areas of interest or need."},{"Title":"The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love","review":"I heard about this book at a class I was taking at church.

The authors help women understand men better and men understand women better. The knowledge gained from reading this book can definitely make intimacy that much more rewarding for both husband and wife.

Pastors should give it to all couples they marry as a gift from the church.I mail it to all young couples in my realm who marry. Some of my friends waited five to ten years to experience physical pleasure; I have a friend married over 30 years who has never experienced it; although she loves her husband.

I am a Martial Arts practitioner for over 15 years, almost 10 years of internal training, and three in Xing Yi Chuan. These exercises are nothing unique or new. All of these, and a lot more, were normal conditioning in my Kung Fu and Tai Chi training. Also, I have fond them in other Tai Chi and Pa Kua books. The other books had much better explanations and guidance on how to do the exercises correctly. This book is nothing but standard Internal Conditioning."},{"Title":"Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development","review":"This book contains a fantastic set of exercises for developing flexiblity, tranquility and chi. If you have stiff joints, tendons, ligaments or muscles you will be totally impressed with these exercises. Looking at the pictures and reading the material gives no picture at all to the 'actual' experience of the set. From the very first exercise, which is one of my favorites, you just 'know' this set is going to 'sort' you out. As a Tai Chi practitioner of many years I have not seen a superior set of exercises. I tried 'yoga' to increase flexiblity and stiffness. Although yoga gave some relief, I was still very 'tight' in the morning. A problem, y, very tight left hamstring still did not improve with yoga. After 1 week of doing this set twice a day I noticed immediate improvement. Now after 3 weeks, I am far less tight in the mornings and my hamstring is 50% better, and getting better every week.One other thing that I was totally impressed by is the opening of the shoulder joints with the first 4 exercises. Why so many? Once you do the set you'll understand why. I found almost instant tranquility from soothing my shoulder joints. All major joints are worked in this set.For a total strength workout, including abdominals, give exercise 17 a go! My Tai Chi feels smooth and silky. I've been searching for 18 months for some answers. This book has brought great joy to my life as a Martial Artist. I can't imagine my flexibility after a year! My enthusiam for Chi Kung has totally awakened, even though this set is described as Nei Kung. I imagine the difference is Nei Kung includes Internal strength training as well."},{"Title":"Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development","review":"This is a great book to have in your collection if you practice Xing Yi Chuan. It has a wealth of information on the art and it's background, and takes you in-depth into the correct posture for San Ti stance practice, which is the best way of building power. There are also some other good exercises and stretches good for warming up, and a section on exercises to do before going to sleep at night. As a reference text for internal martial artists, I find this to be much more valuable than Sun Lu Tang's book, which is a classic, but this is of more use."},{"Title":"Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development","review":"The authors should be congratulated for their dedicated effort and research that went into this informative and satisfying text. It has it all- Weapons practice, technical and practical information for bare hand combat, and plenty of historical and lineage info, including the life and times of a superb kung fu practitioner, Wang Ji Wu (1891-1991). Wangs insights and practice methods, including a wonderful set of excercises, are very rich in humor and deep understanding. Not a word is wasted, everything pertains to perfecting the practice of Xing Yi Quan. The pictures of Master Wang himself are super, in his late 90's his every move is robust, firm and in perfect alignment. I had to spend weeks reading this book, because there is a lot of material here, quite impossible to absorb without attempting to integrate and apply the suggestions over time. Classic Xing Yi texts are included here, as well as the excellent input by the editors, but of course, the heart of the book is in the methods, philosophy and character exemplified by Wang Ju Wu and his disciples. I think Xing Yi Quan lovers of all styles will find a lot to learn from this book. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development","review":"I have had this book for ten years and have been practicing the exercises daily for roughly that amount of time as well. Though I was never really a practitioner of the internal arts, I have a clear understanding of Chi-development.I notice that alot of the readers reviews state that they are practitioners of Xing Yi and for that purpose,this book is helpful in many ways. However, this book is not just for the Xing Yi student,it can be utilized just for the exercises alone as the book states.In the book there are case studies of different types of people most of whom arent martial artists and they have benefited greatly from these easy to learn exercises. If you are student of Xing Yi or any art and have at least some knowledge of chi-Gong and want to do exercises that will give you a lifetime of health and vibrancy, then this book is for you.This book is by far my most prized book. The exercises are easy to do and learn,and with consistent practice can give you a good sense of well being."},{"Title":"Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development","review":"This book will not teach you Wu Xing (the five fists of Xing Yi) or any of the animal forms and linking forms. It won't teach you how to fight. It is NOT another \\"chi gong\\" book. As the title states, it is \\"nei-gong\\" (roughly, \\"internal work\\" or \\"internal exercise\\") and it is specifically attached to one of the most effective of Chinese internal kung-fu styles, Xing Yi Quan. The historical, biographical and introductory material is excellent and valuable to anyone interested in martial arts, Chinese culture or exercise for health benefits. The exercises themselves are well-sequenced and, unlike so many other books like it (martial arts, yoga, or otherwise), the directions will actually show you how to do the exercises on your own. It still would help to have a highly-experienced teacher such as Tim Cartmell review them with you.I practice Xing Yi and I do this nei-gong every day. It has deepened my practice and increased my power in a way that decades of hatha yoga couldn't. I recommend this book without reservation to anyone who wants radiant good health (or who wants to hit harder). Wang Ji Wu died at 100. The book pictures a number of Xing Yi masters who lived into their 90s (through the Cultural Revolution - quite a feat!). This nei-gong and this book can do the same for you."},{"Title":"Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development","review":"I've purchased many xing yi books but they are all the same. They show five element fist and 12 animals and maybe some basic application. But like most books show \\"nothing\\" of the power training required to make the system to work. As the book says, without the proper internal training when you're old you will have nothing. Another great thing is how each exercise is explained in great detail along with photos of the great master performing them. The explanation of San Ti which is of great importance in xing yi was explained in detail as well. Overall this is the best book I've purchased on any internal martial art. Thanks to Tim Cartmell and Dan Miller for sharing this info which is many times kept secret from all but the most trusted students.This is well worth the money."},{"Title":"Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development","review":"at age 100? One only needs to look at the pictures of Wang Ji Wu to see what chi is all about. Oh well, for me its one step at a time. The short letter from Wang Ji Wu at age 100 alone is worth the price of admission here. To the reviewers who gave the book low marks because the book was not about the Xingyi fighting style per se, uh, I realize it is in pinyin, but did you read the title of the book? It is called Xing Yi Nei Gong. To be clear this book is about internal strength training, stretching, taoist yoga and chi gung. If you are looking for a book on Xingyi as a fighting style please look elsewhere. If you want to read about the chi development methods used by Wang Ji Wu you have found a winner here. I must say that nearly everything that Dan Miller (e.g. his book with Park Bok Nam) and Tim Cartmell have been associated with in publishing the past decade has been of very high quality. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development","review":"Before I bought this book I was thinking that Hsing I is already internal and I didn't need anything more in my practice.

I find myself feeling very gracious that much of this material was almost lost and now it is available in the U.S.. We always have to be thankful when more is published on these great systems of Chinese martial arts (Hsing I, Bagua, Tai Ch'i).I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Xing Yi Nei Gong: Xing Yi Health Maintenance and Internal Strength Development","review":"Why are the prices on this book set so high????

The exercises are very good even though they will not be so exciting or (at the least) new for a Chi Kung or Tai Chi practitioner. However I found very interesting to practice them. Every different approach on a known item (considering nei kung) will always open new windows and helps oneself on understanding the own way on practicing. Very nice is the Historical part and the relative photos.In the end: &quot;not a book you can not live without&quot; but absolutely not a money loss to have it."},{"Title":"Krapp's Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces","review":"Although it is probably his most conventional play, this is my favourite Beckett work. It is as bleak as Godot and despairing as End Game. It is also as funny as these tragicomic masterpieces. What is different here is that Krapp is less of a pawn, or fragment of an idea than the other characters, we are given access to his past, to his fundamental ambivalences (the desire for solitude and companionship), his apprehension of beauty. It is remarkable to see on stage a whole series of seperate selves contained in the one entity Krapp. The play is depressingly, inevitable circular, and the sense of repetition (note the extraordinary variations on light and darkness) throughout the stories the younger Krapp tells is not continuity, but an awareness of death, failure, old age. The play is also a comment on the nature of theatre going itself: in listening to his old tapes, Krapp becomes, as well as an actor, an audience, and in interpreting what he hears, a critic. This Shakespearean self-reflexivity only adds to the melancholy of the film's close."},{"Title":"Krapp's Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces","review":"This play represents Beckett at what is without doubt his most accessible and possibly his most beautiful. Beckett adores using human memory and the pain of nostalgia in his works, and both of these themes are put to astonishing use in this play.In 'Krapp's Last Tape', our protagonist Krapp, now in his late 60s, plays back tapes that he has recorded on previous birthdays. Every year this task becomes a more and more onerous one, and every year he is more and more embarassed by \\"that stupid b**tard I took myself for thirty years ago\\". The pain of reconstructing the past is a pain that Beckett uses to dolourous effect throughout his prose and dramatic works and its use is particularly powerful here.Although this play is in fact a monologue, it would appear to take the form of a conversation between a past and present Krapp. This allows the spectator to witness a striking decline in the morale and optimism of the play's protagonist in the intervening thirty years. One is left to assume that the mental attitude of the character will continue to rot over the miserable years that are left to him.This beautiful rendering of sadness and human pain, is typical of one of the most astonishing and talented writers of the modern era."},{"Title":"Krapp's Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces","review":"Krapp's Last TapePublished: 1958Premiere: 1958By: Samuel Beckett (1906 - 1989)There is a single character named Krapp. He is on stage with a tape recorder and old recordings of himself. The only lighting on stage illuminates Krapp (Crap?) and his table where the tape recorder rests. We don't see anything of the environment, only the center stage. We are expected to ask where the play is taking place. It could be an afterlife library where the story of our lives is kept in ledger books and on audio tapes. Krapp is forced to confront the details of his life as an atonement or penitence.It could be Krapp's own library where he has kept a video/written record of his life. As Krapp faces the end of his life he chooses to relive his past before the last whimper of his extinction. Krapp is reading the ledger book of his life much as God and Saint Peter will read the ledger of our lives on judgment day.Krapp gives a rambling and emotional monolog relating his life experiences and decisions. He speculates about things that might have been better.At one point Krapp hears a noise from the shadows, outside where the stage directions indicate lighting. He either hears the rustling of the robes death or of the angel of death. He does not seem concerned that death is approaching implying that he is aware of his impending end.

It lacks the tremendous absurdity of \\"Waiting for Godot\\" or \\"Endgame\\" but it has its fair share. In some respects \\"Krapp's LastTape\\" has much more of a human face than the others: we can understand Krapp much more than Gogo or Didi. And this serves to make him someone with whom we can more easily identify and, therefore, makes him more tragic.The essential question that this play raises is \\"Who is Krapp?\\" Is it the old man we can see on stage? Is it his voice from decades earlier? Or was he the Krapp on the one tape he returns to again and again? Was that Krapp real and then killed and consummed by the bitter man shoving bananas down his throat? Consequently, we discover he is all and none of these. A life is not a static thing; it constantly changes. And, like Krapp, we will either embrace or resent what we do with our lives. This is a terrific play, and, in my humble (and I mean humble) opinion, Samuel Beckett's best."},{"Title":"Krapp's Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces","review":"Krapp's Last TapePublished: 1958Premiere: 1958By: Samuel Beckett (1906 - 1989)There is a single character named Krapp. He is on stage with a tape recorder and old recordings of himself.

Left alone to wonder about the family secrets that seem to be hiding everywhere, they turn to each other for the love and affection they can't find elsewhere.This is an absolutely haunting book. The writing was just about as beautiful and powerful as any I've encountered. Dunmore created such a strong sense of place that was so enveloping that I had to take breaks from reading just to warm up and bring myself back to my life, because I felt like if I spent too much time there in the world of the book, I'd be trapped and never make it out. I'm excited to read more by this author."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"Rarely, does one come across a gothic novel written by a modern novelist that is not totally insipid. Helen Dunmore's &quot;A Spell of Winter&quot; is literature and it is beautiful. The writing strikes a fine poetic balance - profoundly evocative without being overly dense or distracting from the story she unwinds. You are, quite simply, there. You smell, taste and feel everything. And, the scenery...ah, the scenes, the odd, strange and staggeringly beautiful scenes you find yourself experiencing (Dunmore is a master of place) - ones you won't forget after you close the book. It is all very confusing and exciting and exquistedly sad. The characters, particularly the female ones, are well-realized and deeply complex (just as people truly are in a life fully-lived). Dunmore has obviously, like many of us, been long haunted by Cathy and Heathcliff. Admittedly, I had a few problems with the novel's conclusion. Toward the end, I found many of the actions of the characters became totally, well, uncharacteristic and seemed manipulated to satisfy to the novel's plot, or lack thereof, toward the ending. I found this highly disappointing since I was so involved with the characters by that point. Much of the novel's trembling intensity seems to just peter out. Still, there did exist that &quot;trembling intensity&quot; and finding that anywhere in a novel is a gift not lightly dismissed."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"&quot;I saw an arm fall off a man once.&quot; So begins Helen Dunmore's beautiful novel, &quot;A Spell of Winter.&quot; The words above are spoken by Kate, an Irish maid in a pre-World War I English household that consists of eight year old Catherine, her ten year old brother, Rob, their tutor and grandfather. After making her startling announcement, Kate then relates a rather gruesome story that happened in the Dublin house of her grandmother many years ago, when Kate, herself, was a child.Although the above is certainly an engrossing way to open a novel, it really doen't have anything to do with the story that follows, except for introducing Catherine Allen, who, as a grown woman, will be our narrator through his dark and Gothic tale.As a passionate, independent woman who harbors far more than her share of both secrets and pain, Catherine Allen looks much as we would expect her to look, possessing dark, unruly hair and dark eyes that unnerve even the most strong-willed.Catherine's sharer-of-secrets and co-conspirtor is her brother, Rob, who seems, even at his young age, to be something of a dandy and, perhaps, more affected by the strange goings-on at the decaying estate the two call home than is Catherine.If Rob and Cathy aren't your typical children, even in a drafy English country manor house, it might have something to do with the fact that their parents are not your typical parents. Their mother (who was perhaps the wisest of them all, though definitely not the most kind-hearted), bolted from the strangeness of it all to live a bohemian life in the south of France. Their father made his escape through insanity and died (under suspicious circumstances) in an asylum ironicaly called, the Sancturary.If Rob and Cathy have apparently learned much from their parents, though and they harbor many dark secrets of their own. For most of us, these secrets heat up the storyline while giving us the shivers. Although I found this book both haunting and eerie, I think some readers might find the storyline a bit too melodramatic and over-the-top.While I thought Catherine was a good narrator, her often heartless approach to things that would have broken my heart made me dislike her and, as a consequence, I lost quite a bit of sympathy for her. Dunmore's writing is so life-like and so riveting, that we can't help but be pulled in when Catherine describes scenes that, at their mildest, could only be described as &quot;harrowing.&quot;The very best thing about this novel though, is not the characters or the plot, it is Dunmore's beautiful prose and her wonderful sense of place. She certainly has a way with description; I could have enjoyed this book for the gorgeous prose alone, though I doubt that that would be enough to please most readers.While the book does have a tendency to slip into melodrama at times, as far as the plot is concerned, it is really still believable. By the time we reach the last third of the novel, most of the characters are &quot;gone,&quot; and only Catherine remains. I didn't care for this part of the novel quite as much as the preceding pages. While the first two-thirds of the book had a dusty, claustrophobic feel, just perfect for the subject matter, the last third seemed more open, more expansive...and far less moody.The close of the novel is something of a twist, and a modern one at that. Personally, I didn't care for it but I know other readers may feel differently. It wasn't bad, I simply didn't find it at all believable.If you liked &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and the characters of Catherine and Heathcliff, you will probably enjoy &quot;A Spell of Winter.&quot; It has the same moody, claustrophobic feel (at least through most of the story) and the same unrelenting darkness. If you simply enjoy a good, old-fashioned tale, complete with lush settings written in beautiful and lyrical prose, you would also probably enjoy this book. If, however, you require stark realism and total believability, better skip this one."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"The blurb at the back of Helen Dunmore's Orange Prize winning novel, &quot;A Spell of Winter&quot; suggested a haunting gothic-styled thriller built around forbidden passions and family secrets. For a good two-thirds of the novel, Dunmore kept up the suspense with a litter of teases and dark hints which unfortunately remained unresolved and a mystery even at the end. You could have forgiven her deliberate sense of obscurity and vagueness had she gone for a less open ended denouement, but the last third of the novel was a major let down for me. I felt almost cheated after a such a promising start. Sure, Dunmore writes exquisitely. Her prose is smooth and fluent and a joy to read. Pity she let the suspense and momentum peter out midway. In my humble opinion, not up to the standards I was expecting from a prize winner. But Dunmore is an excellent writer. Perhaps the next book I read of hers will be more fulfulling."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"A Gothic novel that is as dark and atmospheric to the classics it has been compared to.

Her descriptions of the book's physical world are wondrous, usually connecting to the emotional atmosphere being created, and I did find myself slowing down to savor such tactile beauty of nature. Although some episodes threatened to be inscrutable without attentive re-reading (not a task I enjoy), for the most part the plotting of the novel was fascinating and I was definitely caught up in the gathering inevitability of Dunmore's story, a gathering storm of tragic consequences that put me in mind of McEwan's \\"Atonement\\", which is highest praise from me. The relationship between Catherine and Rob was truly creepy but I couldn't look away. The servant Kate is the most satisfying character in the book and her episodes the most potent. Although it's not long in # of pages, this novel required time to appreciate and I felt amply rewarded for that time. This is Dunmore's first novel and that is hard to believe. Her work surely bears seeking out."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"Got it in the &quot;bargain&quot; section, although it looked like a great read.It is, in fact, a great read.

It's a small world, for the story evolves around the house, a family mansion of the Allens, a dysfunctional family we grow to love as pages turn around and about. The novel is a pleasure to read, bu all accounts. beginning with an old-style clear typeface, beautiful dust jacket, well-bound hardcover, and ending with the characters, the frozen setting and dusty mysterious atmosphere of the storyline. Helen Dunmore is virtually unknown in America, perhaps because only recently the audience had the chance to discover her works. I am happy that I found A Spell of Winter sue to seemingly random book search patterns I have. Having read thousands of books, I have developed a sort of intuition which whispers in my ear: that's the one! I have bought Helen Dunmore's novel trusting my intuition, and having just finished it, I would like to make a heartfelt recommendation for fellow old-fashioned bookworms like yours truly. The novel is engaging, never dull, the writing style is unique, impossiblt to compare with anyone else's, the narration is soft, dreamilke, and even very topics which others would have found difficult, if not impossible to write about, were touched here with infinite gentleness, like a womanly barely audible whisper, a story told intimately, reserved for your ears only, in confidence of an embrace, in a small room of an old house lit only by a weak yet cheerful candle. I am sure some of you have lived through this; listened attentively with love when the dearest significant other opens her heart; slowly and gradually unfolding the most important tale of personal life. Have you? &quot;A Spell of Winter&quot; is the confession, such confession, this particular confession that makes you slightly tremble all along, while you are aware of both the intimacy and the importance of the moment. It might have been a diary. Yes, it might have been, but then it wouldn't have been as good as it is. Brilliant dialogues, where there is no word lost, or added beyond what is needed, devoid of ornaments, and yet beautiful in its simplicity. I have fallen in love with the voice of Catherine, the charming protagonist of the novel. Eccentric and feminine, Catherine unveils the mystery of her spectacular girlhood in the family mansion. One might say that whoever else tried to touch that subject, would definitely fail, having trivialized it, trampled over with some superimposed vision, where we would have no choice but to follow the interpretation served us by the author. Dunmore allowed us to follow the events, as they came, with her exquisite prose carrying us like the dolphin over waves, in a twirl, leaving it for us to ponder about. There is not a single artificial moment in the book, and boy, wasn't that easy to commit! Dunmore has class and grace, and I am sure that whatever she chose to write about, she would do that with her unique, delicate strokes of feather, leaving you amused, sighing, longing to enter her fictional world without a second look back. I didn't want the novel to end, nor did I want any of the chapters to end. Each page is like a lyrical poem; a poem written for you and you only. It's a rare feeling, you know?&quot;A Spell of Winter&quot; is the most beautiful novel I read in many years, and I will not exaggerate if I claim that it's place is among the notable books of the XX century. I will come back to this book many times in future. Rarely indeed I feel like starting to read all over again when I have just only finished. When a novel ends like this one, you just can't help but sigh and take a long walk. Reality is too much to bear. A tale of passion, tradition, youth, wasted lives, redemption, forgiveness, family ties, abandonment, eternal love, and the unbreakable spirit. I discovered Helen Dunmore and I couldn't have been more happy. I have written this review to share my impressions with you, dear reader. &quot;A Spell of Winter&quot; - a small diamond you will want to keep close to your heart, and take with you everywhere, with that 'specific gravity of smile' on your face..."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"Each season has its own feel about it and winter is certainly one of the coldest, bleakest times of the year. When I picked up this book, I assumed that this would be no different. The jacket promised poetic writing and comparisons with the winter months and the sticky humidity of summer, contrasting brother and sister. I didn't really find much seasonal comparison, which I was highly disappointed about, but the writing was certainly beautiful.The tone of the book was that of depression and desperation, abandonment and an unwillingness to fight on for something more. Things were bad, people accepted them, things moved on. I found that a little hard to take, that an entire family wouldn't stand up for something, somewhere along the line. It didn't change my enjoyment of the story, however, and I easily completed this book because I didn't want to put it down. I was curious about what the outcome would be and found another small disappointment in the ending, where I blinked and had to ask if there wasn't more hiding away somewhere in invisible ink. Things weren't quite as concluded as I'd hoped they would be with a book that was a prize winner."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"An absent mother and dying father leave Catherine and her brother Rob in pseudo-isolation, encouraging the relationship between them to grow intense and intimate. But when that relationship begins to break down, Catherine alone must reconstruct the fragments of her life. A Spell of Winter is a dream of a book, disjointed, atmospheric, and cold. However effective that atmosphere, it deadens the intensity of relationships and characters's sufferings. The right elements are there: a complex and distinct protagonist, a gothic (dark, often intense) view of relationships and experiences with a poetic (if unrefined) voice to match, and a well-intended character arc. But the book only floats along--surprisingly explicit in some aspects, it still leaves too many secrets to linger in implication; its tone is always cold, dreamy, disconnected, and its impact follows suit. I'm predisposed to love half a dozen tropes in A Spell of Winter, but to my surprise the book did nothing for me. The intent is there, and the book isn't a waste, but in its heart it stays frozen. I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"Just like the reviews written here, this book started out very good. Midway, again going strong, then .....then.....then.....are you kidding me....did the same person that wrote the first 1/2 of the book write the second 1/2. It just did not do it for me. The comparisons to Cathy and Heathcliff are like comparing a rain drop to Niagara Falls. This book can't even compare to Wuthering Heights on any level."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"If one of the Brontes had written a novel set a century later, would it have turned out like this? There is the same harsh northern landscape, the same tug of forbidden passions, family secrets similarly buried, and the familiar situation of the rich bachelor a distant figure on the neighboring estate. But the sexual frankness belongs to a much later period still, and there is also a modern sensibility in the heroine's path to self-realization, not through others but on her own terms. This is a most enjoyable book, if not an especially deep one, a sort of Bronte meets Lawrence meets McEwan. It might have been stronger had the approach of WW1 been heralded earlier, and had the impact of that conflict not so radically separated the ending pages from the rest, but this is a relatively small flaw."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"When I finished this book, I couldn't help but think that maybe the author was resolving her issues with how V.C. Andrews ended her Dollanganger series. The similarities between the VCA Dollanganger series which started with Flowers In The Attic and this novel are kinda hard to ignore. Except that this one had better writing (not too overwrought) in terms of phrasing and creating mood (not exactly in plotting...VCA may have been trashy sometimes, but that woman was great at writing page-turner situations), and of course, the heroine ended up with a non-blood-relative.I guess for the gothic genre, it is beautifully written. But in terms of how the story turned out...it was a disappointment. So three stars for the near poetic writing, but had to take out two for the blah plot."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"This book had a promising beginning as I was intrigued to discover why Cathy was alone in this cold deserted house.While I found the writing beautiful , I quickly tired of the one note plot. Did everyone have designs on this girl? The incestuous relationship was disturbing. The fate of Miss Gallagher was worse. We are never told why the Mother left, nor why she couldn't return after the death of her husband in the sanitarium. To sum this up, it was for me a dark depressing novel with nothing to recommend it but the writing itself."},{"Title":"A Spell of Winter: A Novel","review":"I hate this book! It doesn't even deserve the one star! Wait, scratch that. I liked the font. The font is the only commendable thing about this insipid piece of literary [...].This book is so bloody depressing that I don't think I can see straight. Whatever happened to books that made you think and feel good? I don't believe all of the rave reviews for this thing. These must be the same people that liked \\"The Piano Teacher.\\" Has everyone turned flaggelant but me? I didn't feel like Catherine was some kind of magnanimous hero. She was a deprived and lonesome child, and then she grew up. Big deal. I hated most of the characters. Kate was alright. The token Irish workhorse, full of strength and courage. Dunmore is so English. Catherine, our 'heroine' was, as I said, grating, but even I was annoyed when Dunmore desecrated her character in the end. Running along a secluded beach with a forty-year-old? I don't think so.I didn't appreciate all the metaphors, either. Dunmore compare's the way Bullivant ties his *sash* on his *bathrobe* to the smile of a small child. Bizarre. And no one ever explained Eileen or Gallagher or how they entered everyone's lives. Characters were not developed. Some fans say real life, I say bad story telling. I do not read a story to experience real life. If I wanted to do that I wouldn't be reading the story, would I? Time continuity made an utter lack of sense. Things just blurped together. A date here and there, or a month, or even three stars at the starting of a paragraph would have been welcomed.So, to sum up. Underdeveloped characters, crazy people that actually like this book, bizarre metaphors that serve no purpose other than to make the author look smart [...], and a RIDICULOUS ending. If anyone is thinking about reading this book, I say that you're better off reading 'The Days of Our Lives Trivia Book' or something by Madonna.

Well researched and extremely interesting to read. This book really tells the truth about M.B.E. and Christian Science."},{"Title":"\\"With Bleeding Footsteps\\": Mary Baker Eddy's Path to Religious Leadership","review":"I was raised in Christian Science, but the historical Mrs. Eddy only became fascinating to me when I finally discovered that the glowing image portrayed in church literature was largely mythological. Her life story is particularly interesting now that the Christian Science Church is once again attempting to widen its appeal.A friend recommended this book to me as exposing some of the Eddy mythology using heretofor &quot;classified&quot; material from church archives. What I found instead was a sometimes interesting attempt to analyse Mrs. Eddy's persona and life in psychological, but often apologetic terms. While he obviously wants to be seen as an impartial biographer, he often left me feeling that he wasn't telling the whole story. Indeed, what I found most troubling in his narrative were the many gaping holes, not only in terms of chronology, but of historical criticism. For example, we never really learn how Mrs. Eddy and her organization developed rapidly in the 1880's from a small group into a national organization, and how this related to a fundamental criticism of her character: that Christian Science evolved into a money-making enterprise that was frequently at odds with her purported metaphysical world-view. Thomas often leaves the reader unaware of some very controversial aspects of her career by making the situation seem innocuous. For example, her establishment of the &quot;Massachusetts Metaphysical College&quot;, he says, was &quot;to give her teachings a firmer structure and more respectability in the community&quot; and &quot;her graduates took away a diploma from a state-chartered school&quot;. He doesn't mention that this &quot;charter&quot; was under an ill-conceived state law that allowed virtually any diploma mill to exist, and that the school primarily existed to make money and create more demand, with her as the only faculty member. He glosses over the contributions of Rev. James Wiggin in virtually re-writing Science and Health by referring to his work as merely smoothing over &quot;rough edges&quot;, and dismisses Wiggin's criticism of her educational and literary shortcomings by accusing him of of being a &quot;lapsed Unitarian minister&quot; who had &quot;gender anxieties&quot; in his capacity as a nineteenth century man in a woman's employ. Mrs. Eddy's at times paranoid obsession with &quot;malicious animal magnetism&quot; is rather benignly explained as due to her being &quot;acutely sensitive to a form of interpersonal interaction that is largely unconscious...&quot; and stemming from an &quot;intricate web of relationships&quot; going back to childhood.I would still recommend this book as having valuable material, and as worth reading for some interesting insights into aspects of Mrs. Eddy's psychological make-up. However, any reader who stops here is likely to come away with a very incomplete and even fuzzy picture of the woman, her psychological motives, her many questionable claims, as well as the many vagaries of her early movement. I would therefore recommend that you get your hands on other, more critical histories, particularly Edwin Franden Dakin's &quot;Mrs. Eddy, the Biography of a Virginal Mind&quot; - out of print, but available. While Dakin's book has it's own shortcomings, including occasional use of a not well-documented &quot;omniscient narration&quot;, the historical narrative and especially the motives for many of the more sensational events of Mrs. Eddy's life, are, overall, presented much more coherently. Thomas would have done well, if he had issues with this much more critical view of Mrs. Eddy, to refute in detail the charges made by Dakin and others, instead of, to a large extent, dismissing them."},{"Title":"\\"With Bleeding Footsteps\\": Mary Baker Eddy's Path to Religious Leadership","review":"This book is supposed to be a psychoanalytic study of Mary Baker Eddy.

Dutton (1888-1964) in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Each one features an investigation led by Harley Manners, a well-to-do professor of abnormal psychology and a voracious student of the criminal mind. \\"Books, pictures, dogs and boats: these were the things Manners admired most.\\" He's also got a three-car garage that features a blue roadster. Harley spends the majority of his days at an unidentified location somewhere in the Great Lakes region. His large lakefront property sits on the outskirts of a small city (at least once referred to as \\"Westland\\"), near a sizable university; and in those days of Prohibition, residents there easily motored 20-30 miles across the water to Canada to buy liquor. (So logically, this anonymous city must be in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio or Michigan. Because of rare mentions of seeing ships heading toward Buffalo, and other slightly cryptic clues, I believe the setting to be Erie, Pennsylvania -- especially since the author was the pastor of a Unitarian church there from 1921-1929.) On occasion, Harley vacations at an equally unnamed but wealthy resort town on the Rhode Island-Connecticut coast. Harley is in his thirties, has never married, and has an oversized Airedale companion named Satin or Satan. His nameless and faceless housekeeper stays in the background, but she at least provides the meals he takes at home. Harley's best friend is local police chief Timothy Rogan, who despite decades of employment in that field, is seemingly clueless when it comes to solving intricate crimes. Most often he likes to rely on his hunches. Thank goodness he has Harley (who says, \\"Act always upon knowledge, not emotion\\") to come to his rescue and to offer solutions and explanations. The men can smoke their \\"stogies\\" and share a drink or two while they puzzle things out.\\"Streaked with Crimson\\" begins as Harley and his dog travel across the state to get to the ocean side summer home of friend George Carter. The resort town is called Mansfield, and for readers, its location is somewhat of a mystery. It's a 3-hour train ride from Boston, and yet folks talk about officials coming \\"down from New York.\\" Hmm. Northern New Jersey? The Connecticut coast, maybe? (The author's hometown was nearby Fall River, Mass.) In any event, Harley drives on unfamiliar roads enveloped in fog and believes he is lost. When he stops at an estate to ask for directions, he finds the place deserted ... except for the body of a dead man, swinging at the end of a black rope dashed with a streak of crimson, hanging from a rafter in one of the rooms. The place is devoid of furniture, with no chair in sight, so the death cannot possibly be suicide. Shaken by his discovery, Harley recovers enough to resume his drive, and he and the dog finally arrive at Carter's home. After he shares his news and the authorities are called in, everyone drives back to the scene -- and of course the body is now gone. But soon enough, a woman is murdered in the same fashion, and Harley and his friend George try to help the police chief (called James Rogan at one point and William Rogan at another) solve the crimes. (The dead man had been a wealthy scoundrel named Mason, and the woman seems to have been one of his conquests.) Eventually George's friend John Bartley arrives to provide necessary additional assistance. A busybody librarian even offers a few clues. Harley has never been involved in an investigation prior to this one, and he finally gets his wish. It's an exhilarating experience -- but one that maybe offers more than he expected.This volume provides a segue between Dutton's eight-part mystery series featuring John Bartley and the six-part Harley Manners series. Of special note in this installment is Harley's demonstration of his Airedale's ability to recognize English words. Besides studying the criminal mind, Harley has a passion for scrutinizing animal communication. He has spent a great deal of time training the dog, and he shows off its talents to the fullest extent in this book. Eventually Harley will write articles and his own book on the subject.In general: this is a mystery series that will keep you entertained, if you can find rare copies in libraries or through used bookstores. The series is not perfect, by any means. Most savvy mystery readers will be able to identify the perpetrator well before Harley reveals that information to the police chief. Inconsistencies reign. Dutton went out of his way not to identify real-life locations, which can leave a reader frustrated and wondering. Sometimes the characters think and think and think again, turning the same sides of the investigations over in their minds and on the page. The author must have been a male chauvinist (which wouldn't have been unusual, for the times), for women are not usually main characters, and the few women who do appear are often described as neurotic or flighty. (Or sexless librarians!) Harley's Airedale is named Satan in some books (#2, #4, #5, #6), and called Satin in others (#1, #3). In either case, I hope the housekeeper takes good care of him, because Harley doesn't pay him much mind, other than to train him to recognize English words. When the dog ate or got a bath after rolling in something smelly or did his business -- well, I guess that isn't any of *our* business. Harley hardly gives the dog any thought when he's out and about and in the middle of an investigation. The housekeeper herself is a faceless entity who has minimal interaction with her employer. She is finally identified as Mrs. McNeil in two of the books (#4, #6) and Mrs. McLeod in book #5. Hmm, more inconsistencies. Even so: if you want a glimpse of fictional life in the 1930s -- when men wore suits and hats and thin mustaches, and mulled things over in smoke-filled rooms -- then you might want to seek out these volumes."},{"Title":"Book of Soups: More than 100 Recipes for Perfect Soups (Culinary Institute of America)","review":"So far I have made four recipes from this book. Three of them were fabulous, and the one that wasn't was because of some crabmeat that was not fresh enough. The artichoke soup, and the wonton soup, were beyond belief!

All my favorites are flagged with post-its, Minnesota Wild Rice is rated tops with my family. None of the recipes are complicated and of all the ones tried, we have not come across any disappointments. I actually prefer to cook up large batches of a couple different types of soup when the weather is cold and so far all the recipes freeze well, making the comfort of home cooked soup a breeze even when the weather is close to 100 degrees outside. I highly recommend this book and have even purchased copies for friends and family who keep borrowing my copy after eating some of the delicious soups I made out of this cookbook. My copy is getting well worn and creased down the spine but still holding together after 6 years of use!

I am guessing that I have made about 40% of the soups, straight out of the book I say this because I usually tweak recipes, but I am referring to the ones that I followed exactly). For the recipes that I have used, they have not only worked correctly, but have resulted in very wonderful, flavorful soups. In addition, the introduction for each chapter goes into the theory behind that particular style of soup (for example, the chapter on chowders goes into detail on how the basic chowder is constructed, and how to create your own based off of these basic ideas). They have enough pictures to please and assist you. However, not all of the recipes have pictures accompanying the process or end result. I own about 20 different cookbooks, borrow from the library frequently, and find many recipes online that I use. However, I without a doubt use this book more than any other cook book that I have ever owned, and I am sure that if you like soup, you will feel the same way, and I honestly think that finding a better soup book would be quite the challenge."},{"Title":"Book of Soups: More than 100 Recipes for Perfect Soups (Culinary Institute of America)","review":"You will love this book .

This, along with Beard on Bread, the original troika of Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Marcella Hazan, and various Louisiana and Chinese cookbooks has definitely got a permanent place on my shelves.

It covers all the basics of making soups including helping me choose a proper soup pot and explaining many of the basic soup making techniques. The book also includes lots of photos of the finished dishes and that is important to me because I often get the urge to try something new, and that allows me to browse the photos until I find something that grabs my interest. To date I have made 4 recipes and all have turned out very well. My only complaint is that many of the recipes are not \\"my taste\\", my taste leans toward the hearty and rich soups. But of course this is to be expected as the book tries to show a wide variety of soups instead of focusing on a specific style.

And, if there are other books on soups which you like, you should own this book as well, since it's instruction on general techniques for soup making surpass the material in the nine other recent soup books I have read. This is not to say this book can replace all other soup books. This book is strong on basic techniques and excellent recipes for classic soups such as Vichyssoise, Clam Chowder, Chicken Noodle soup, Cream of Tomato soup, Borscht, Egg Drop Soup, French Onion Soup, Stracciatella / Egg Drop Soup, Black Bean soup, and on and on and on, with the cover advertising 100 different recipes.This doesn't mean that if I want a special chowder, I won't go to Jasper White's book '50 Chowders', since all the recipes I have made from White's book have been simply out of this world good. It also doesn't mean I won't go to my little book of vegetarian soups by Paulette Mitchell or to other little books of soups by Michael Congdon and by the New York staff of \`Daily Soup' or even the \`Twelve Months of Monastery Soups', since I may be especially interested in a vegetarian soup, a thick full meal soup, or an especially light soup for July, since all of these are good soup books. I will also still go to Daniel Boulud or Tyler Florence for their chestnut soup recipes, even though the CIA includes a recipe for chestnut soup. But, I will pay very close attention to the CIA's chapter on creamed soups before I make chestnut soup again.The only real competition for literary soup supremacy is James Peterson's \`Splendid Soups'. Peterson has several more recipes than the CIA and has a different organization based on ingredients rather than technique. And, Peterson deals in much more depth with the selection of good ingredients and their preparation than does the CIA. If you love soup, you really need both books, but if you can only afford or have the space for one, the CIA book is preferable, as it's list price is lower and its discussion of techniques is more portable to recipes in other books.The CIA has done several books on various subjects in addition to their main textbook, which is now in edition eight or nine. And, I generally find the titles oriented to amateur cooks such as their \`Cooking at Home' and \`Gourmet Food in Minutes' titles to be less friendly to amateur cooks than books from people who specialize in this subject such as Rachael Ray, Ina Garten, and Martha Stewart's staff. It seems they never quite forget to take off their toques and really see things from the home cook's point of view. None of that is true with this book. This may be due to the highly specialized subject, plus the effective scaling down of techniques the CIA authors has done. A common problem with recipes from restaurant cooks is that they are scaled to make eight to twelve servings. This book does not have this problem. No recipes except the stock recipes make more than eight servings. And, a special strength of this book is that it gives clear general suggestions on which soups and which soup ingredients will freeze well and which soups will survive long freezing or refrigeration. This explodes my mother's caution that you shouldn't freeze soups with tomato. On the other hand, potatoes and other starchy vegetables do not take well to freezing.The heart of this book, and the primary reason to buy it, no matter how many other soup books you may have is the very detailed, step by step description of the techniques for making six basic types of soups. These are broths; hearty soups; cream soups; pureed soups; bisques & chowders; and cold soups. The chapter on broths includes the recipes for the four most important stocks, chicken, beef, fish, and vegetable. The procedures are similar to, but just a bit less fussy than those in their textbook. I confess these recipes have been my standard against which I evaluate all other stock recipes, so I am committed to recommending them. Their primary virtues are that they are not on the burner for more than a few hours, the meat used in the chicken stock comes out as perfectly good poached chicken, useable in other recipes, and the vegetables are put in when there is but an hour to go, lowering the chance that the veggies will cloud up the broth. There are several very respectable authorities on stock making, including one of my heroes, Alton Brown, who cooks stocks for up to eight hours. I believe this is a great idea for commercial kitchens and an easier method for creating especially rich stocks than the \`double stock' method, but I still think, with the authority of the CIA behind me, that the shorter recipe is better for the average home cook.The last chapter of the CIA's book contains recipes for \`accompaniments'. These recipes for croutons, rusks, focaccia, buttermilk biscuits, crackers, gougeres, dumplings, granite, harissa, pistou, fried shallots, and vegetable chips are great to have especially the garnishes. This chapter may have been slightly closer to message if it would have limited itself to recipes for crackers and garnishes.This book joins the CIA volumes on Garde Manger and baking on my \`best books for the kitchen' list. That doesn't mean it is not also a pleasure to read with really useful pictures for both soups and methods. I noticed the CIA changed publisher from textbook giant Wiley to Lebhar-Friedman Books, who seem to have provided a lighter touch in their editorial guidance.Buy this book if you like to make soups!"},{"Title":"Book of Soups: More than 100 Recipes for Perfect Soups (Culinary Institute of America)","review":"Let's face it: most cookbooks have maybe two or three recipes you incorporate into your repertoire.

At least, not very much (only a brief reference or two). What it's about is what it's like to live as a young poor person in Philadelphia. The book was written in the 1950's, it's written about the 1930's, but as a former resident of Philadelphia, I can attest to the fact that it is as accurate a depiction of today's world as any other decade. The novel is a small gem that captures the essence of being unemployed and poor in the big city, but without being depressing or moralistic in any way. Doesn't sound like much of a recipe for success, but Goodis is a master at bringing a mood to life. He accomplishes with understatement what most novelists never achieve: genuine, believable characters in real settings. This book has not, to my knowledge, been made into a film as his other works have, which is probably due to the unusual plot structure (basically, not much excitement goes on in the book), but the trueness of his vision soars beyond any limitations. I lived in similar circumstances to the characters in the book, and was astonished at the accuracy that Goodis gives to real life. It's amazing. Worth a read, even if you are only marginally interested. It's a brief page turner that leaves you longing for more, just as the characters in the book feel. This book is a revelation."},{"Title":"The Blonde on the Street Corner (Midnight Classics)","review":"Four \\"bums,\\" all in their early 30s, all still living at home, all hopelesly frozen in the hell of inanimation, stand on the street corner eating Indian nuts and buying 16 cent packs of cigarettes, talking about nothing, doing nothing, going nowhere and not much caring. It is fascinating to think that The Blonde on the Street Corner [1954], stylistically most aytpical of David Goodis' novels, should appear just a year after the publication of alain Robbe-Grillet's The Erasers [Eng. Tr. 1964]. Goodis doesn't go nearly so far as Robbe-Grillet in dispensing with character, plot, and all the other traditional elements of the novel, but he does give us a kind of pulp analogue, with rhythmic repetitions of a domestic ugliness, banality, and violence not much short of the \\"spirit of ugly\\" celebrated by William S. Burroughs just a few years down the road.For Goodis, the icy heart of this ugliness is the essential meaninglessness of things, so that the novel's tired randomness of events moves forward in the kronos of the profane. By default, almost, nothingness becomes the novel's central obsession:\\"You don't know what you'll be doing tonight. Or tomorrow. Or the day after tomorrow. What are you? What do you do? You stand on the corner. You're one of the bums. You're thirty years old and what do you have?\\"Nothing.\\"\\"Is that what you want?\\"\\"It gives me very little to worry about. I don't have to think about losing it. There's nothing to lose.\\" (152)Nothing is mostly what \\"happens\\" in this novel, which is only superficially set in the Depression, but could occur at any time in the bleak unending asphalt of row houses and and torn overcoats in the Goodis Urban Freezer. Genuine relationships are impossible to achieve and undesirable to sustain. Marriage and family are dead ends. Work is a humiliating experience, difficult to come by, and ultimately without meaning. As in so many of Goodis's novels, at the center of this one lounges a fat, sensual woman, verbally abusive to everyone around her. Here, though, she is not so much fascinating for the protagonist as she is a way to pass the time, when time itself is of no account. It's as if Goodis had exhausted himself of his own masochistic leitmotif and stood looking in the abyss, seeing and feeling nothing but the cold. \\"What is this?\\" says one of the young bums, Dippy, whenever something he doesn't understand arises. It becomes, by novel's end, Goodis's own bewildered ontological question, one he is too far gone to care about asking, much less answering. Recommended for Goodis fans."},{"Title":"The Blonde on the Street Corner (Midnight Classics)","review":"David Goodis was one of the major writers of crime noir in the 1940s and '50s. Many of his best works were filmed to good effect, including DARK PASSAGE, with Bogart playing the lead, Tourneur's NIGHTFALL, Truffaut's SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER, Sam Fuller's STREET OF NO RETURN, and THE BURGLAR. Goodis's novels painted bleak, black views of the inner-city life he himself lived, populated by losers and drunks. As Ed Gorman once said, Goodis didn't write novels, he wrote suicide notes. But his power lay in his ability to get down on paper the stark reality of the low-life he witnessed around him, before he too fell victim to the type of decline experienced by the characters he wrote about.It's a tragedy that, apart from this reissue, few of the eighteen novels Goodis wrote are currently in print. This is the first publication of THE BLONDE ON THE STREET CORNER since it originally appeared in a paperback edition in 1954. The story is set during the depression years of the 1930s, in Goodis's own home town of Philadelphia, and seems to be at least partly autobiographical. Ralph and his buddies are out of work, and jobs are not easy to find. He'd like to be a song-writer, but there's little hope of getting that kind of break. Christmas is coming and he needs some money, and the only other options involve crime and sex. With his usual talent for brilliant prose description and language, Goodis takes you effortlessly into the murky realms of depression America to meet the deadbeat characters who populate the streets and bars.Serpent's Tail Press are to be congratulated for reissuing this long-lost classic by one of the legendary writers of the hardboiled. It's to be hoped that more by Goodis follows from them soon."},{"Title":"The Blonde on the Street Corner (Midnight Classics)","review":"This novel is Goodis's classic tale of urban desolation.

It talked about their condition, hopes and despairs in an unglamorous way, spoke their diction, and didn't pull any phoney punches. We need real literature again on the mass market paperback racks besides the usual thrillers and fem-novels instead of relying on trade paperbacks for the elite."},{"Title":"The Blonde on the Street Corner (Midnight Classics)","review":"Not a crime novel. Not the plot hijinks of David Goodis's crime novels. But atmospheric with that same pervading sense of hopelessness and what does it matter that makes David Goodis novels such a treat."},{"Title":"The Blonde on the Street Corner (Midnight Classics)","review":"After reading the Library of America's volume of novels by David Goodis,David Goodis: Five Noir Novels of the 1940s and 50s (Library of America), I needed to know more of this author. Goodis (917 -- 1967) is best-known for his novel \\"Down There\\", also available from the LOA,Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s: The Killer Inside Me / The Talented Mr. Ripley / Pick-up / Down There / The Real Cool Killers (Library of America) (Vol 2), which became the basis of the Francois Truffaut movie, \\"Shoot the Piano Player.\\" Goodis worked in Hollywood for several years before returning to his Philadelphia home in 1950. In Philadelphia, Goodis wrote many pulp, noir novels published in inexpensive paperback editions and seemingly destined for oblivion.Written in 1954, \\"The Blonde on the Street Corner\\" is among the Goodis novels not included in the LOA volume. The book is set in the rowhouses and streets of Philadelphia in the midst of the Depression in a cold 1936 December. The novel is distinctively noir in tone, but crime plays no part in it.Most of this novel offers a portrayal of four unemployed young men in their early 30's and their families. The men, Ralph, Ken, Dippy, and George, hang around together on a streetcorner in front of a candy store and in each others' homes. Goodis individualizes each character, as Ken is a failed would-be songwriter, Dippy a part-time laborer who calls women at random from the phone book in search of dates, and George, a failed baseball player in the lowest level of the minor leagues and on the sandlot. Ralph Creel, 30, the primary character of the book has the heart of a romantic. Unemployed and unwilling even to look for work, Ralph describes himself as \\"hoping for a cleaner better life.\\" Ralph lives with his family, including his working class father and his wife and two younger sisters.The four young men loaf on street corners, bum cigarettes,chew on nuts, try to meet women, and occasionally work. Goodis portrays something of the family lives of each of his characters in addition to Ralph. Dippy lives with his mother, his brother, a lawyer, and his brother's wife Leonore in a house full of quarelling. In the thin plot line of the book, Leonore eyes Ralph on a streetcorner winter night and determines to seduce him. Ralph has another potential romantic interest in a young woman,Edna Daly, recently arrived in Philadelphia as her family searches for work.Goodis' writing in the novel changes with his scenes and characters. When the book describes Ralph's inner life, his dreams and his fears, the writing takes on a stream of conscious, surrealistic and extensively descriptive quality. Ralph spends a good deal of time alone, away from his companions and his family, on the streets and walking restlessly around a small city lake. When the characters talk or interact with each other, the sentences are short and clipped.In one scene, the four men on the streetcorner have a discussion late one night about going to downtown Philadelphia on Market Street to look for work. They talk about the many people on the busy street and speculate on their motives for going downtown. One of the characters says:\\"All right, so maybe a lot of them were there for the same reason. Or they were going into stores to buy things. Do you think people are crazy\\" Do you think they come in town, from all parts of the city, just to walk up and down Market Street?\\"And one of the friends responds:\\"I think a lot of those people come in town and walk up and down because they're lonesome.\\"\\"The Blonde on the Street Corner\\" is a deeply pessimistic novel about people in large cities without prospects leading desperately lonely lives. The book offers a failed, gritty romantic vision. As do the Goodis novels included in the Library of America volumes, this book transcends the pulp format in which it was written and published.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Blonde on the Street Corner (Midnight Classics)","review":"This book was probably originally a short story, or at least the concept of a short story &lt; the first, third, and last three chapters> . Unfortunately Goodis adds over a hundred pages of disconnected vignettes that are many times only vaguely related to each other.Most of the book concerns four guys who are over 30, living with their parents, and perpetually unemployed because they practically never make the effort to even look for a job. The consummate losers. Ralph, the protagonist, tosses away the few opportunities that come his way for happiness or a better existence. The rest don't even try.As a short story, it could have been an interesting observation about a certain character type. Like a Chekhov story. But can you really imagine little Vanya in a Chekhov story sitting in front of the stove for over a hundred and fifty pages. Goodis devotes a whole page to Ralph getting out of bed and whether he should urinate or just \\"hold it\\". Not my idea of a story that is interesting.I think we've all seen too many of these pathetic creatures in public high school, or even college. Or for that matter just walk down enough streets and you'll run into them. Whether the inner city, or for that matter even the American suburbs.If you want fiction like this, read John Steinbeck. At least he wrote in the 1930s about life in the 1930s. His characters are basically believable people, some decent, trying to find their own little happiness and dreams, and usually being overwhelmed by their environment and the force of events.From reading the Blonde book and seeing the other titles of David Goodis books, all I can say is that his stories are just plain pathetic."},{"Title":"Dragon Sword (Dragonlance: The New Adventures, Vol. 5)","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my son and this is what he wanted.

PERSONAL EFFECT is the riveting tale of four fans who befriend a legendary movie star named Gilda, until one of them is involved in her 1979 murder. Throughout many torrid flashbacks, and many succulent exchanges between the culprits, Rex Reed delivers an eye-popping tale of an old Hollywood when studios were kings and stars their pets. There's never a dull moment in this novel. From love to jealously to murder, the author's uncanny flair for creating unputdownable escapist entertainment shines through. His colorful protagonists plus his clever way of building an explosive conclusion make PERSONAL EFFECTS a one sitting read. Another Rex Reed novel is way past due.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"The Handbook for Quality Management","review":"Mr. Pyzdek has done an excellent job of presenting this information.

Lessons are always the best way to go but sometime you need books to supplement your growth and I've probably looked at about 20-30 various books for learning music.This book is ok for what it tries to do but the reader should go into knowing its faults. First off, the book is strictly for beginners so make no mistake about that. This book is primarily inteded to teach the major chords and the simplest of strumming patterns. If you are looking for something to see if you might be interested in playing guitar then this book might be perfect for you. After an hour you will you be able to play RUDEMENTRY versions of Miss You (Rolling Stones) and Shout (Tears For Fears) and you will know Em, Am7, Cmaj7 and A chords. The book progresses along those lines slowly introducing more chords and strumming patterns. Eventually you will work through power chords, barre chords (major and minor) and some very basic riffs.For what it is trying to do, the book works and you get more intsruction then most books for its price as is it 4 books combined into one. Also the progression is perfect which I find to be a huge problem with instruction books.So what are the problems...- This book won't teach you anything about really reading music if you want to learn that. It breifly goes through the chromatic scale about halfway through but there are no excercises (which are needed) to help you through and practice. It touches upon notes up the fretboard but is really inadequate if this is what you want to learn.-It should have alternative finger positioning for chords. For example for Em it says use finger 1 and 2 where as many would agree that 2 and 3 is better.-Some of the songs don't really have the correct strumming patterns and thus don't sound right. Also some of the songs most people will not have heard of and this deafeats the purpose. (for example Down By the River - Neil Young)Bottom Line: Good book for the money. Probably better for the older crowd but worth getting if you want to learn some guitar to see if you enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Complete Rock Guitar Player Omnibus Edition","review":"Great reasource for the struggling new guitar player. I've bought a lot of books and this one really does a good job. Two key things this book does well:1) Good Progression - Introduces ideas, techniquie, and chords too you in a way that builds a foundation for the next thing you will learn.2) Good examples - Teaches by example using popular rock songs that are familiar.If it actually came with a CD that contained the music that would be ideal. You can find the songs on CDs or off of fileshare programs but not all the recorded versions include guitar tracks. For example &quot;Stand By Me&quot; doesn't really have a guitar track on it so you have to work to get the rythym when you're playing the guitar. It would be good if this book had a sample &quot;Guitar Only&quot; version of each of these songs that are included."},{"Title":"The Conservative Reformation and Its Theology","review":"The best book on Reformation (Lutheran) apologetics I've ever read.

In fact, just this year our veterinary school switched the required text from Langman's Medical Embryology (a very human-centered book) to Before We Are Born.I think the best way to learn about how the embryo develops is to actually see things happening...a professor can say \\"then the dermatomes extend out from the somites...\\" but it really doesn't mean much unless you can SEE it. Before We Are Born really does this well, taking a step-by-step approach to learning the processes of developmental biology. The illustrations are clear, and they try to make them as 3-D looking as possible.If you're taking a developmental biology or embryology course, you NEED this book!"},{"Title":"Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects (Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology & Birth Defects)","review":"I absolutely agree with Michelle Lee (one of the reviewers above) that it is essential to SEE what is happening when you study Embryology.

Unfortunately, this embryology text misses the mark. There are too many terms and concepts for a non-medical student to learn. This book should be pruned down and be concentrated on a fewer number of concepts. Also, embryological concepts are extremely difficult to learn and a CD-ROM showing animations of the various aspects of the developing embryo would be much more useful. The authors have done extremely well with the illustrations and clinically related pictures. In conclusion, if you must use this text, put together a list of terms from the book and then try to learn the many concepts elucidated."},{"Title":"The Immortal Unknown (Perry Rhodan #13)","review":"In book 13 of this Space Opera, Rhodan & crew finally reach the Planet of Eternal Life.After the adventures of \\"The Rebels of Tuglan\\", Perry Rhodan and crew return to Vega to restart their final calculations to get to the Planet of Eternal Life - only to find that Vega's sun is very quickly turning into a supernova.

Rhodan and his Mutant Corps travel thru a version of a Wild West town that could only come from the imagination of a truly alien being. Rhodan quickly solves the final riddles, and then he and a few hand picked others approach the final encounter with the being they come to call \\"PEL\\" (short for \\"Planet of Eternal Life\\").When the Arkonides Krest and Thora approach the throne to receive what they believe is their reward, they find they are mistaken - it is Perry Rhodan and Terra to whom the final secret of Eternal Life will be given. Although that secret is not without cost - Rhodan discovers that the treatment must be given once every 62 years in order to maintain the vitality of the first time you first step into the cellular rejuvenator. Next, a whole new \\"band\\" of stories begins with \\"Venus In Danger\\".I've never been this impressed by any series. I'm reminded of cliffhangers like \\"Buck Rodgers\\" or \\"Flash Gordon\\" when reading these marvelous books - a series that is still being published in Germany and is now well over 1,800 volumes. It's too bad American publishers stopped these after only about 120 books. I had to learn to speak, read, and write German in order to continue reading Perry Rhodan.This book also contains another editorial, another science fiction movie section, and another fan letters page. Well worth reading the entire series."},{"Title":"Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar (comes with a CD to help learn music) (Music Sales America)","review":"This is, simply put, a great book. The layout, selections of music, tab, and explanations are all outstanding. This is a superb book from which to learn this beautiful and fun-to-play style of music. The transcriptions are accurate, and there is something here, I think, for guitarists of varying abilities. This book is true to form with Hanson's other guitar books -- his tab and music transcriptions are very understandable and clearly printed. I can't say enough good things about this book. There are selections here from Sonny Chillingworth, Ray Kane, Leonard Kwan, Led Kaapana, Cyril Pahinui, and others. I have the Masters of Slack Key Guitar (Vol. 1 -- great disk) from Dancing Cat Records, and thanks to this book, I now have the music to some of these selections.

I recommend this without reservation."},{"Title":"Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar (comes with a CD to help learn music) (Music Sales America)","review":"If you play classical style guitar and maybe your music reading skills are not so good, this is a great book.

That said, it is not a begining book; the music is transcribed pretty close to what you hear from the greats."},{"Title":"Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar (comes with a CD to help learn music) (Music Sales America)","review":"First, let me say that the Hawaiian slack key community is the most open group of artists around. In order to preserve and spread Aloha through slack key guitar, the pro's very willingly share what they know with the rest of us amateurs. That being said, Mark Hanson gives you all the knowledge you need to play numerous songs in this excellent book and CD. I find the tablatures very easy to understand, and the CD tracks easy to follow. Both are true to the music as written. Add your own skill and interpretation, and you'll be playing in front of others in no time!"},{"Title":"Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar (comes with a CD to help learn music) (Music Sales America)","review":"This book is great! However, I can see how some reviewers got frustrated. I had been learning slack key off and on for about a year and a half before buying this book. So, I was already familiar with slack key style and familiar with learning from tablature. Tablature takes a lot of repetition and time. Being familiar with slack key helps you figure out which fingers to use for placement. Mark Hanson does an excellent job breaking down the songs in the book in an almost mathematical manner. Sure Mark Hanson butchers the Hawaiian language a bit and his playing is a somewhat mechanical, but his passion for slack key shows in his meticulous work. Also, some of the sounds produced using his tablature aren't exactly like the original song but you can put your own interpretation and style into it. Overall, this book helped me increase my repertoire of slack key songs and made learning the pieces way easier than trying to figure them out on my own. Mark Hanson did an excellent job and I'm thankful that he published this song book."},{"Title":"Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar (comes with a CD to help learn music) (Music Sales America)","review":"Maybe I misunderstood the other reviews but I got this thinking it wasa good way for a beginner to learn slack key.

It covers the short lesson/exercises and plays the songs in 'slow' and 'at tempo'. Listening to the CD along with the tabs makes learning much more successful.

It's not much on instructions or technique. I liked the inclusion of std notation and tabs together; for those who read music it provides a little more foundation. Only those techniques needed for the tunes in the book get minimal explanation. This book is for those fairly proficient on guitar; it wouldn't very effective for use by guitar novices. The CD has audio of each song in the book played at normal speed, plus a brief portion played slowly for clarity. The few exercises on the CD are lumped together several to a track, making them tedious to replay for repetitions."},{"Title":"Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar (comes with a CD to help learn music) (Music Sales America)","review":"Mark Hanson goes a little too fast through his CD lessons, with no explanation, and no details. He also manages to butcher the Hawaiian language, mispronouncing the titles of his songs so that the meanings are now something totally different. (Example: Moe uhane &lt; moy ooh-hah-neh > means dream, while his &lt; mo ohanay > (loosely translated) is about some non-existant island called ohanay.)He goes through the song twice, once at 'performance speed' and then slower, so that beginners like me can try and emulate. He doesn't take time for the at home learner to figure things out, he just zips right through it and moves on to the next song selection.I had to put this one away and grab my Keola Beamer book, and compared to that, this one is a GENEROUS three stars. Mr. Beamer, plays with feeling and enjoyment rather than the stiffness and confinement that Mr. Hanson displays.If I were you, I'd skip on this book and go for the better of the two... it just an average lesson book by an average player."},{"Title":"Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar (comes with a CD to help learn music) (Music Sales America)","review":"I love my new Slack Key Guitar book.

What makes this one stand apart is that it is less predictable than his other novels, in that everyone doesn't end up riding away into the sunset. It has been years since I read this novel, but I can still remember it vividly."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"I've read all of Louis L'Amour's westerns, and appreciate the straight-arrow ethics of his heroes and heroines, the starkness of the environment and their responses to it, and the appreciation of the men and women's appraisals of each other. Most are truly love stories, with action/adventure wrapped around them. This is also one of his saddest stories.Told in the first person, Tell is shot, and by the time he's able to recover and get back to where he left his wagon and bride, all traces of them are gone. He finally finds her grave. Anyone who knows Tell from previous books knows his determination and that he should not be underestimated. It's similar to movies such as \\"First Blood\\" in that a man who seems like any other man can step beyond others' comprehension in his ability and willingness to inflict the same measure of carnage on his enemies. As his attacks and the rancher's reprisals escalate until the odds are 40 to 1 against him, word reaches other Sacketts of the war, and they gather as well. The messages of justice, family, love, heartache, and duty all resound throughout The Sackett Brand."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"When I read this book I got a rush because I could tell it was a good one from the beginning. The Idea of the book was what got me interested in the first place. I had read some of the other Sackett books by Louis L'Amour and this one got me jumpin. It is just the Idea of every one coming to Tell's aide when he needs it the most. It has the makings of becoming a classic if more people would recognize it's greatness. I read it almost tree months ago and I can remember every bit about it. I am Seventeen and if I can like this book so much I am almost positive that others my age, older, and Younger would love it too. I loved reading it so much that I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Louis dates this book between 1875-1879, with the action taking place in the Mogollon (muggy own) Rim and the Tonto Basin of Arizona Territory. The Apache wars are still in progress as we visit Camp Verde and while there are exposed to Al Seiber. Camp Verde was originally named Fort Lincoln in 1861 when established to protect people from the Apache, the post was originally manned by volunteers, and then later by regular Army in 1866.Al Seiber, 1844-1907, is a name immediately recognizable to any reader of the Apache Wars period. Al was of German ancestry who scouted for the Army, later being chief of scouts over the Apache scouts. Earlier he had fought at Gettysburg, among other civil war battles, receiving at least two wounds. History still holds Al, or \\"Sibi\\" as he was known by Apaches, with great respect. And his times with both Tom Horn and the Apache Kid remains in the mind of any reader spending time with Dan Thrapp's 1964 biography of Al Seiber.This western novel assumes a somewhat strange storyline in that Tell's wife, Ange Kerry Sackett, comes to harm, and is actually murdered. Not just murdered but strangled to death. It seems very much out of Louis L'Amour character in that in all his other novels he continually reinforces the thought that a woman alone would never be harmed by a man, no matter how bad that man may have been. It is therefore somewhat hard to accept, at least for me, that this is the storyline Louis chose to begin one of the Sackett novels. But there it is, and one has to deal with it to try to understand this book.As stated in other reviews, I have all of the L'Amour books in hardcover and read them over from time-to-time. In all my reading of his books over the last 40 plus years, this is one of the more unique Sackett books. If you have not read that much L'Amour it may not strike you in that manner.One interesting aspect, however, of this western novel is that Louis continually mentions the manner which the Sacketts will come to the aid of any Sackett in trouble. Well, in this novel he shows exactly how that would happen, using the word-of-mouth grapevine the fact that Tell is surrounded by at least 40 gunmen in the Tonto Basin area quickly causes any Sackett hearing of it to ride to Tell's assistance.And it is always pleasant to encounter Cap Roundtree in the Sackett books. And I will let Louis himself describe Cap Roundtree: \\"A salty old customer, a mountain man, trapper, cowboy, all-round western man. Dry as alkali dust and twice as bitter. A tough old mountain man who had hunted gold and fought Indians and had the scars to prove it\\". That pretty much not only describes Cap Roundtree but can safely be applied to all the Sacketts as well.This book will afford its readers a couple night's reading pleasure. Let'r rip!Semper Fi."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Somebody ambushed Tell Sackett and left him for dead. It takes more, however, than cowardly sidewinders to kill a Sackett. Even worse, Tell's wife is missing. After Tell determines that somebody of Lazy A ranch is guilty, he launches a one-man war against the cowboys. Word spreads of the conflict, and Sackett brothers and cousins come out of the sagebrush to even the odds.Typical of Louis L'Amour, this novel is a quick hit of Western action. The Sackett tales stress family solidarity. L'Amour is adept at writing of the lure of distant trails, the freedom of the big sky country, and the Code of the West. He breathes new life and spirit into the usual elements of Western fiction. This is good downtime reading. Enjoy the ride. ;-)"},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"I read this book for the first time in the 4th grade. My dad gave it to me and said \\"You are old enough to understand what Louis is saying here.\\" It was my first book without pictures, and it lead me to read everyone of Louis' books!The message I got from the book was: \\"Doesn't matter what has happened in the past or who the person is, if family is in trouble, you help.\\" As I grew up, I added to it, certain friends, (Like Cap Rountree, and the Tinker) are family. They deserve the same support.I had my oldest son read this as well for the same reason. He may never read another western, but he understands the message I was trying to pass on.If you have ever wanted to read one of Lamour's books, this is a great place to start. If you want a good action book, with excitement, this is a great one as well. I have just downloaded this for my kindle so I can reread it at my leisure. I hope you will too."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Hey, I'm all over the place as far as what I'm reading, and by golly I sometimes enjoy reading a good ol' cowboy story. It doesn't take allot of brain cells, they're usually a fast read, and usually the good guy wins in the end. That sounds pretty good to me as this world is a pretty serious place sometimes. Westerns are pure escapism for me. The Sackett series, and probably all L'Amour novels can be enjoyed by young readers and adults alike.This is the 16th (and next-to-the-last) book in \\"The Sackett\\" series of novels that L'amour published. The series is basically a collection of stories about the fictional Sackett family who were some of the first settlers to come from England to America in the 1600's. The books follow the lives of multiple Sackett family members through several generations. The first 5 books are set in the early 1600's, and then all of the last 10 books have been cowboy stories set in the time frame of the 1870's. All-in-all I've really enjoyed the series, but some are certainly better than others. The books are also written in a way that you can pick up any one of them and read it, without ever having to have read any of the previous stories........ but it's really more fun to go through them as a series as there are always places, characters, and situations that the author refers to in a previous book, and that makes it kind of fun.Anyway, in this story Tell Sackett is ambushed and left for dead. All of his belongings are burned, and his wife is murdered. That doesn't set well for any Sackett as they're all John Wayne/Clint Eastwood clones........no matter what........the bad guy is gonna get it. This story was extra fun as many Sackett brothers and cousins from the previous books came together to help Tell out on his quest to take care of those dastardly sidewinders. He Get Along Little Doggie......I liked this one better than many others in the series. A quick read and just some good old fashioned cowboy escapism."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"One of the hallmarks of the Sackett novels is the consistent concept of family members coming to the aid of other family members. In this novel, Tell Sackett, one of the roughest and toughest of a very tough family, gets in trouble. He needs help, and the word gets out. This is L'Amour's chance to really highlight that theme of family and he tries...but just misses the mark. There are scenes in the book of Sacketts that were in other books (Orlando, Logan, etc) getting the word about Tell and leaping into their saddles to join the fray. The Sacketts are gathering, and you just know that the bad guys have no clue about the storm that is about to break. But alas, that storm never breaks. The book ends with all the Sacketts lined up, ready to draw, and the fight never comes off. This is very disappointing. His other novels don't hesitate to bring about the fight - why not this one? All in all, it is still a very good book, and if you are a fan of the Sackett series it is one of the top five. Tell's anger and sadness, and his measure of revenge, are all very well handled by a master storyteller. I just wish he would have allowed his characters to mop up the floor with the bad guys!"},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"This is one of Louis' classics. In addition to being a great adventure read, it will definitely pull your strings in a lot of ways. It is at first sad (when the event that is the fulcrum of the plot occurs), and then eventually very uplifting and satisfying. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"This book builds superbly, holding one's interest throughout. One can easily sympathize with Tell Sackett, being generally hassled for no good reason, and the hard confidence of his kin as they ride to his aid sets up two or three of the best scenes I've ever read in a Western, period. By the time they get there, you wish that you were yourself a Sackett--of whatever occupation--with the right to stand as one of the family when your relative is being ganged up on.While the Sackett series is generally accepted as one of the best Western series out there, this one stands above the others. Words are used economically to portray the characters; L'Amour doesn't waste your time. I've probably read 200 Westerns in my life (not many, I realize), and if I could keep only one, this would be it."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"\\"The Sackett Brand\\" starts with a bang--almost literally--and doesn't let up. Six paragraphs in and Tell Sackett is falling off a six-hundred-foot cliff. \\"Fear clawed at my throat, and I heard a wild, ugly cry...my own cry.\\" This is action from the get-go. We are off and running and we are hanging on Tell Sackett's every move as he finds his murdered wife Ange and then, pumped full of determination, tracks her killer and takes all the steps that are necessary to extract revenge. When he finds Ange's body he digs a grave up on a mesa and burns words into in a \\"crude cross\\" using the heated edge of a shovel. (Bet that took awhile.) Sackett thinks: \\"Now the chips were down. They would be hunting me, but I would be hunting them too, and there was no mercy in me. There was only the desire to hunt them down on their bloody trail, and give them a chance to try killing somebody who was not a woman alone.\\"Loaded with motivation, \\"The Sackett Brand\\" rockets along. There is precious let-up. The greater Sackett clan, even the outlaws, get word and come to Tell's rescue just as Tell is cornered and counting his last minutes. Yes, family rules. \\"The Sackett Brand\\" is straightforward, punch-to-the-gut action interspersed with the occasional thunder of guns on fire.I agree with at least one other reviewer who thought L'Amour should have shown us more of the bad guys going down, but by this time we know how it ends and feel quite satisfied nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Tell Sackett is only wanting a life of his own with his wife Ange, then all hell breaks loose. Ange has disappeared and a big cattle rancher wants him dead for some reason. This is an absolute good read, packed with action, emotion and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"This novel sticks to your fingers and is difficult to put down. Join Tell as he struggles to survive. His future destroyed, Ange murdered, hunted and harried he eventually reaches safety. As soon as able he continues searching for her killer. A few letters from a friend bring other members of the clan riding to his aid. An explosive finish grips you by the seat of the pants. Family values at their best and a great story."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Taking place several years after The Daybreakers, this book tells of the adventures of Orrin and Tyrel Sackett's oldest brother, Tell. In this story Tell Sackett and his wife are moving to Arizona with everything they have to establish an outfit and a new life. But when Tell leaves the wagon for a few hours and goes scouting ahead he is shot in the head with a grazing bullet. He immediately plummets down the near vertical hillside hundreds of feet but miraculously he survives. Of course, since somebody's after him for a reason that he finds to be a mystery, he escapes pursuit and gets away for the time being.He eventually manages to return to the site of his wagon. There he finds it virtually gone and burnt to pieces. And his wife Ange is missing. Eventually Tell makes it to a fort and finds aid for his wounded and battered body. He also discovers that he is being hunted by an outfit of forty men hired by Swandle and Allen. After having mostly recovered from his fall, Tell returns to look for the body he hopes he'd never find but he does. After giving his wife a proper burial he swears to hunt down the man that murdered her, and get revenge. But the odds of 40 to 1 aren't good. Tell eventually finds his luck running out along with supplies and places to hide. But an occurrence such as this is not common so the word gets out. And eventually another Sackett hears about it. Shortly afterwards there is a large group of Sacketts running to help Tell, including his brothers, Orrin and Tyrel. But some of them fear that Tell will kill all forty men before they get a taste of the action.I thought this was a relatively enjoyable book. I don't think it was as good as The Daybreakers but it was better than others. It had a lot of good action and gun fighting in it and I liked that they included Orrin and Tyrel. I also liked the part in the book where Tell is being pursued by hired guns up a high ledge when he comes face to face with a mountain lion. I think I will continue to read the adventures of the Sackett family in further books."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"If you like Louis L'Amour, I can't think of a better narrator than David Strathairn! He's able to play multiple roles to the point you feel as if you're listening to a larger cast. And not many folks can do \\"local/period piece\\" accents without sounding forced...this sounds as if you've been eavesdropping.A hearty round of applause for a quickly shipped product which was as advertised."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"A pair of young men once pulled Louis L'Amour out of a fight in Tucumcari. They told L'Amour that their opponents steered clear of them because they had over a dozen brothers, and whoever might beat one of the family would be attacked by all the others. L'Amour modeled the Sackett clan after his Tucumcari benefactors.Knowing this, I was puzzled to find that this defining feature of the Sackett family had never come into play in any of the five Sackett stories* I had read before. A Sackett in trouble rarely gets help from anybody, and when he does, it's only from one or two of his kin. But now, I understand. In The Sackett Brand, the family's power finally is fully mustered against one of its enemies, and the sight of a bunch of Sacketts dogpiling the villain turns out to be flat boring.And that's a shame, because the setup of The Sackett Brand is damned good. \\"Tell\\" Sackett and his wife are on their way West to start a new life with the wealth they won in their last novel. While they stop to rest, somebody shoots Tell in the back, he falls down a cliff into a stream, their wagon is stolen and his wife is kidnapped. In the first two minutes!From that point on, Tell has a desperate nonstop struggle to evade a whole gang of merciless, skilled killers, not knowing who is behind them or why they want him dead. Victory is out of the question for the moment; mere survival is going to take everything he has. He also needs to find his missing wife, and even though you know he'll succeed, the scene where he does so is surprising and original.And then, alas, all of Tell's efforts and suffering are pounded into irrelevance under a thundering avalanche of Sacketts, who set the course of the whole final act. The villain is unmasked, and turns out to be dull. The only glimmer of entertainment in the denouement is from Parmalee Sackett, who fights the family's enemies with his wallet instead of his gun. But a lot of Parmalee's charm comes from David Strathairn's voicing of his Tennessee accent, and may be lost if you read the hardcopy.For the Sacketts-all-come-running idea to work, L'Amour would have had to come up with an enemy that actually could give the whole Sackett clan a stand-up fight - something like the consortium of Wyoming cattle barons who started the Johnson County War, or San Francisco's Big Four train tycoons with their army of Pinkertons and railroad detectives. Maybe something like that lies hidden in the big pile of L'Amours that I haven't read yet. But such a concept doesn't play to L'Amour's strength. He was at his best when he was telling the story of a man alone who defines his manhood by struggle: struggle against other men, struggle against the environment, but most of all, struggle to maintain his own integrity.*My previous experience comprised Sackett, Sackett's Land, Lonely on the Mountain, Mustang Man, and the short story The Courting of Griselda."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Everyone of Louis L'Amour's books deserve 6 stars"},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"After reading this book and thinking back to it then I realize how much I really liked it. The main thing that I like about it so much was not the plot but how accurate the story was portrayed. The author did a great job of portraying how cowboys lived and felt back then. He showed the type of men they were and described in detail the way a man would go about things in the old west. This story had a great start that grabbed your attention and had suspence around every corner. It left you woundering what would happen next and if the main character would live or not. I enjoyed every part of the book except for one. The only chapter I did not like was the 9th because all it did was tell about the brothers of Sackett finding out what happened to him. Other than that borring chapter I would recomend this book to anyone that likes an old western adventure book."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Not one of Louis L'Amour's best. He stretches credibility too far. How can a single man, make a woman, a wagon and a team of mules vanish while mustering cattle with his forty cowboys , in country where everybody is an expert tracker. Also our hero, Tell Sackett, hides himself out in this wild country, but gets himself discovered with great regularity by the searching bad guys, not to mention a bad woman. The rest of the Sackett clan are given a great build up, but play disappointingly minor parts. However they come from all over the west and turn up together just in the nick of time to save our hero from impossible odds."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"I love almost every book by Louis L'Amour.

But when they got there they realized that someone had beat them to it and they took almost everything, but they went in to look around anyway. Once looking around they found Mr. Colcannon's coin collection and so they take a coin, chest, and earings. They then go over to their friend Abel's house and ask him what he thinks. He looks at the first two items and is about to pay them about $2,000.00 but they then show him the coin. It turns out that the coin is the very rare and valuable 1913-V nickle. He tells them it's worth about a half a million dollars and that he would buy it from them. They decided that they would give it to him but he needed to pay them at different times because he didnt have all that money. The next day the Colcannon's came home early and found an unwanted visitor. Abel and Mrs. Colcannon were killed. The police then pin everything on Bernie since it would be so easy.

But the idea of the cop on the take is brilliant for explaining that.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"I may just need a break from this series, but it seems to me this is the weakest Bernie title so far.The action is moderately different but so formulaicly similar that I am getting afraid that once you have read one Bernie story, you may have read them all. Kind of a shame, cuz I was so fond of the Keller books, and for that matter the first few Bernie titles were pretty good.I am just wondering - looking forward to the next Bernie books - how many times Block has dipped into the well of the - Guilty / Innocent burlgar who would never hurt anyone, and everyone knows it, but JUST THIS ONCE - everyone figures he went off and killed someone / several someones in the course of his job burgling folks fine trinkets and baubles and whatnot.IN fairness this was written 30 years ago in a bit of a lull for mysteries when the format was in a serious downswing, I just hope the next ones are better."},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"A fascinating psycological insight into the life of a New York burglar. Block utilises the writers craft of suspence to give you one big adventure. An easy read, which you will not be able to put down"},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"Lawrence Block is one of our most talented mystery authors. In the Bernie Rhodenbarr series he explores how an ordinary, but intelligent, \\"honest\\" person might go about pursuing a life of crime as a fastidious and talented burglar who isn't proud of what he does, doesn't like to hang out with criminals, and really gets a big thrill out of breaking and entering . . . and removing valuables. As you can see, there's a sitcom set-up to provide lots of humor. But the humor works well in part because Mr. Block is able to put the reader in the Bernie's shoes while he breaks, enters and steals . . . and evades the long arm of the law. To balance the \\"honest\\" burglar is an array of \\"dishonest\\" and equally easy-money loving cops. As a result, you're in a funny moral never-never land while your stomach tightens and your arm muscles twitch as tension builds. To make matters even more topsy-turvy, Bernie at some point in every story turns into an investigator who must figure out \\"who-dun-it\\" for some crime that he personally didn't do. It's almost like one of those \\"mystery at home\\" games where the victim comes back as the police investigator, playing two roles. Very nice!So much for explaining the concept of the series. The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza is the fourth book in the series. I strongly suggest that you begin the series by reading Burglars Can't Be Choosers and follow it up with The Burglar in the Closet and The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling. Each story in the series adds information and characters in a way that will reduce your pleasure of the others if read out of order. Although, I originally read them out of order and liked them well enough. I'm rereading them now in order, and like it much better this way. The Burglar Who Painted Like Mondrian comes next in the series.Bernie's friend, Carolyn Kaiser, the dog groomer at the Poodle Factory has a hot tip for him. Wealthy dog-owners, Herbert and Wanda Colcannon will be out of town breeding Astrid, their Bouvier des Flandres guard dog, who normally keeps burglars away from their possessions, which includes Herbert's famous coin collection . . . and which Bernie is already impressed by. Carolyn discovered a taste for breaking and entering while \\"borrowing\\" a Polaroid camera in The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling, and now she's a full-fledged partner who insists on joining Bernie in the burglary.Quickly inside the Colcannon's West 18th Street brownstone, they find the place a mess. \\"Burglars,\\" Bernie announces. But the first burglars mainly made a mess . . . and couldn't open the safe. But Bernie does and finds some jewelry, a Piaget watch, and a nickel. The main coin collection must be safe in a bank vault elsewhere. Carolyn's more pleased with the Chagall lithograph that she takes for her apartment. So far, so good.They retire to visit Bernie's charming fence, Abel Crowe, who had survived being an inmate at Dachau. Bernie knows that Abel is more likely to be generous if he's in a good mood, so Bernie brings Abel a little gift, a 1707 English edition of Spinoza's Ethics, bound in blue calf. Everything goes smoothly until Abel examines the nickel. \\"Gross Gott!\\" he exclaims. Bernie has brought him one of five known specimens of the 1913 Liberty Head nickel that the mint denies ever having made. It's worth a fortune. Abel offers a small sum in cash now . . . or to split the proceeds from a more leisurely sale. Bernie and Carolyn agree to wait on their money, and leave happily.By the next morning, everything has gone bad. Unless Bernie finds out what really happened, he's scheduled to be the fly in the soup.I didn't enjoy the mystery to be solved nearly as much in this one as in The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling. In fact, this is my least favorite of the books that Mr. Block wrote in the series. I was disturbed by who Mr. Block selected to be his victims, and found all of the coin collecting details to be not nearly as interesting as the bibliophile content of The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling. Although I wouldn't go so far as to suggest that you skip this one, I suspect that you will be disappointed compared to other books in the series even though the humor and dialogue are wonderfully strong and engaging. But stick with it, the books get much better from here in the series.This book's theme is being careful about whom you trust. Take nothing for granted . . . including loyalty!Donald Mitchell..."},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"With two deaths associated with a rare coin, Bernie the Burglar is trying to figure out who and why, partly to avenge his friend and fellow Spinoza afficionado, Abel Crowe. Unlike most of the books in this series, the police quickly lose interest in Bernie after the prime victim fails to identify him. Nevertheless, Bernie goes through an imaginitive investigation of his own, calling several museum curators to research the 1913 V nickel, and getting medical attention for his &quot;Morton's feet&quot;. The climatic scene is particularly good, as Bernie plays the part of minister, presiding over a funeral, while assembling the suspects for the showdown where he lays out the evidence."},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"Used book store owner Bernie Rhodenbarr is not only tired of losing money at his Greenwich Village establishment, he is inanely bored. Bernie knows that it is time to spice up his life with some excitement by employing his better skill, stealing, this time rare coins. Bernie's marks are the opulent Hank and Wanda Colcannon, who he learns from his friend Carolyn are leaving town.When Bernie arrives at the Colcannon place, he quickly realizes that a peer has already been there. Still, Bernie finds a few interesting items, including a 1913 V-nickel, which he takes to his fence Abel Crowe to appraise. Abel values the rare coin at $500K and willingly accepts it because Bernie is a pal who gives him philosophy books. However, everything falls apart by the next day when the cops come to accuse Bernie of murdering Wanda and Abel, and stealing the rare coin, which has been re-heisted. Bernie knows he has been set up and only he, with the help of Spinoza, can clear his name of the murder charges.THE BURGLAR WHO STUDIED SPINOZA is a reprint of the fourth novel in the Rhodenbarr series which is now up to eight. Even after a dozen years (think Reagan), the story line remains remarkably refreshing as it highlights Bernie's best (and worst) traits and showcases the City at its most intriguing and frustrating self. Lawrence Block may have been at the top of his game with this wisecracking, absolutely fun tale about a professional thief turned sleuth who seems to spend a lot of time clearing his name from a couple of murder raps.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"I read this book because I adore Spinoza, and figured any crook who has studied Spinoza can't be all bad, as of course Bernie is not. And Abel, his fence, is not. Abel is simply given to excess. His lifestyle, including his eating habits, he supports through non-legal efforts. Bernie, the narrator, one of Abel's partners in crime, has &quot;pretty much&quot; gone straight, probably because he knows--sooner or later-- crime really doesn't pay. But when you have a hobby...well, you've got to apply yourself to it, at least occasionally. The love interest is early on fairly predictable, but you don't want to bet the farm until the last few pages. The 3 main characters are fully formed. Their needs and fears, their hopes and dreams--everything that makes us human--are explored, Spinoza fashion, through relationships, deeds, and the solving of a murder. Sometimes the &quot;bad&quot; guy gets away, sometimes not. Sometimes the &quot;good&quot; guy gets a raw deal, sometimes not. There is a little bit of everything in this book...men, women, children, animals, relationships, theft, big money, murder, philosophy, psychology... all overlapping in a complex but not complicated fashion. It's the way life does us."},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"Bernie Rhodenbarr is at it again in Lawrence Block's fourth &quot;The Burglar Who...&quot; series. In this fast paced novel &quot;The Burglar who Studied Spinoza,&quot; Bernie has to turn sleuth once again to prove he is not guilty of anything worse than entering someone else's apartment with his trusty burglar tools and taking valuables easy to carry away and fence them for a quick turn over. This story involves a very rare coin, a 1913 Liberty V nickel. Our favorite reoccurring characters, Carolyn Kaiser who runs a dog grooming parlor, and Ray Kirschmann the best cop money can buy also make play their roles as they have in previous &quot;Burglar Who book...&quot; Lawrence Block does an excellent job telling of burglaries, murder and mayhem. As with other books in this series he does it with a great sense of humor. That's what makes these stories of a burglar who also owns an antiquarian bookshop in New York Greenwich Village fun to read. They are light reading, just right for a cold winter's night in front of a fireplace or a bright summer afternoon at poolside. I'm a true Bernie Rhodenbarr fan and look forward to reading the next on my to read list, &quot;The Burglar who Pained Like Mondrian.&quot; When I do a review will surly be posted here."},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"If you read the publication materials carefully you will notice that the book was copywritten in 1980, but not published till 1997. There are anachronisms in the text that make this clear. Though it reads as if the author and the reader share the same time zone (eastern, very eastern) silver is $20 an ounce, telephone calls cost a dime, and jogging is still a new fad. The plot could also use some revision, because the denoument, which I won't spoil more than it already is, doesn't really convince this reader, who is a very big Lawrence Block fan. What continues to please are the voice, the characters, the relationship between Bernie and his buddy, and the general sense of decency and good humor, so refreshing in a professional criminal. Block's last Matthew Scudder felt a little recycled , too. And his latest is a revival of a character he hasn't written about in almost twenty years. Why all this rehashing? Is he tired? Did he fall off the wagon? Does he have a new and more interesting hobby?"},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"I read this book on a plane flight. I was so engrossed in the book that I didn't care when we landed. Bernie is the best at getting himself out of the trouble he gets into. I just love the witty dialogue. I prefer Scudder but Bernie is growing on me."},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"This book is a good quick read, well-written and a page-turner. The interplay of the characters is entertaining and inviting, even the final &quot;Charlie Chan movie&quot; type scene where the characters are brought together and the murderer revealed -- the only thing missing in the book is the lights being turned off and the quick scuffle as the perpetrator tries to escape. The author uses occasional deft and subtle humor and brings in interesting tidbits from Spinoza.The description of the first murder crime scene (paperback page 78) led me to a correct guess of the murderer's identity.And strangely for a book where much of the plot turns around the type of glove Bernie wore for the burglary (rubber, with the palm removed), the cover shows Bernie taking the nickel from the safe while wearing a complete leather glove."},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"I have enjoyed all the Rhodenbarr books. Rhodenbarr himself and Corolyn Kaiser are charming, and the plot of this book is as imaginative as the plots of all of the others in this series."},{"Title":"The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza.","review":"When Bernie and Carolyn enter the Colcannon home to ply their trade, they find that they are the second burglars to be in the in the house that night. Bernie takes a valuable 1913-V nickel from the safe. The Colcannons come home early, and when Mrs. Colcannon is murdered, guess who is blamed. . .? Of course, Bernie. When a friend of Bernie's (also the fence with the 1913-V nickel) is also murdered, Bernie must become sleuth to clear his name, and find out who killed these 2 people. A strong addition to a very funny and entertaining series."},{"Title":"Circle Round the Zero: Play Chants & Singing Games of City Children","review":"This is a delightful collection of jump rope songs, clapping songs, ball-bouncing songs, and more.

Cawthorne pulls facts together from very credible sources and uses them to weave cohesive arguments that are difficult to refute. This book should be more widely read, and portions of it should be used in Civics classes across the United States to teach our youth to be more objective about political motivations.If any fault can be found with the book, it's the amount of detail it provides. Though, given the prevailing public &quot;knowledge&quot; of American POW's, it serves the author well to support his statements from many angles."},{"Title":"The Bamboo Cage","review":"Speedy delivery brought me this poular book about an unpopular war. Primarily it answered questions regarding American POW's/MIA's. A subject with which I have some familiarity it reenforced my belief that some have not come home. Those that have not,have stayed willingly or are staying forcibly in SEA or elsewhere."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"This is a great book for moms who feed their children whole and organic foods.

There are recipes for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and found it to be a very simple guide to really get going with baby food. I ordered Super Baby Food and Blender Baby Food at the same time, and was able to get started with baby food after reading the first few pages of this one. It's that easy to get into. Yes, order one of the bigger books if you want lots and lots of info, but if you just want a quick manual on how-to, this is a good book to get. The recipes are very very easy.My favorite recipes in here are the brown rice cereal (I make it all the time for my daughter) and the pear-applesauce, which is SO awesome, I steal my daughter's all the time out of the freezer when I need a sweet treat and finish off hers after she's done eating if she doesn't want any more!The only downside to this book is that some of the ingredients are a little weird, like sea vegetables, but if you're into health food, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"This book has so many great recipes and I am learning a lot more about cooking whole foods and even sea vegetables. I never cooked with some of these ingredients before but I'm so glad I found out about them and how nutritious they are. This book has really expanded our horizons when it comes to eating. And I haven't had any problem finding the ingredients - the are all available at my local natural foods store.My husband likes the dishes I've cooked - and my kids do too. All the recipes for sweets don't have any sugar but taste really good. I am happy that my kids are eating healthy foods and not all that processed, sugary stuff.I also like that this book is not full of a bunch of fillers that most of the other baby food books. Many were 1/3 to 1/2 of information before they even got to the recipes and who has time to read all that stuff.I love the simplicity of the recipes and the great suggestions like making toddler popsicles in ice cube trays - I always found that regular popsicle molds made way to much and it would just melt all over. These are the perfect size. This book also has lots of great cracker recipes which are so quick and easy to make and I don't have to worry about my baby eating hydrogenated oils and sugar. The smoothie recipes are awesome - who knew you could sneak veggies into a smoothie and it would taste so good.This book gives more than recipes. Some of the ideas are very simple but you don't always think of them on your own. I'm very happy I choose this book."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"What an attractive and well-done book. I read Simply Natural Baby Food from cover to cover. Great education and inspiration! I feel newly motivated to make healthful, new and fun recipes for my family.I would like to emphasize that this book is great for the whole family, not just the baby.We love the recipes for soups, sandwiches, pizza, breakfast foods...and most of all, we love the recipes for healthful snacks. Everybody loves a treat but isn't it hard to find snacks which we can really feel good about? This book will help. Some of our favorites are animal crackers, graham crackers, pretzels, muffins, cookies, bars, ice cream, pudding, smoothies and more!Simply Natural Baby Food would make a wonderful gift. The whole family will benefit from the nutritional tips and recipes.We look forward to Cathe Olson's next book."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Cathe's book is filled with fantastic ideas and super recipes. They are simple, easy to make, and offer great choices for all types of healthy diets - meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. Such a helpful book with so many tips and sandwich and snack suggestions. The ideas in her book make you say &quot;oh yeah - that's perfect for my child&quot;. You'll feel good about feeding these foods to your precious one! And my husband and I are even enjoying the fruits of Cathe's labor!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I bought this book based largely on the great reviews, and while it does have a few recipes my son has enjoyed, it is a very slim book. I'm not kidding when I say it has a recipe for cinammon toast! Other \\"recipes\\" literally have three ingredients and the direction \\"mash.\\" Now, I'm no gourmet chef, but I was looking for a little more-mainly sneaky ways to get my son to eat vegetables. I was hoping for recipes a little like those at the back of the \\"What to Expect\\" books. It does have some good ones,(great first birthday cake),just don't expect a thick volume."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"As a 2nd time mom, I already had some idea of what to introduce when and how to make basic vegetable mixes. I bought this book mainly based on the reviews, because the ideas of adding flaxseeds gfor fiber and using kelp and so on made it sound like an \\"edgier\\" healthy baby cookbook.I still gave it 3 stars because even though it's pretty basic, it still has some great tips and it really encourages to feed the baby whole foods: it explains how to make baby cereal from whole grains, good veggies and fruits to start with and some interesting mixes; it's also divided by age so 1st time moms will probably find it useful as it gives guidance while keeping things simple."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I found this book very helpful when deciding to make my own baby food. She gives great tips on how to prepare and freeze the food. The book is very basic, but for a first time mother, I did not want to get fancy when feeding my little one. I simply wanted to do it right. The recipes are no brainers, and she gives you great ideas to combine foods you wouldn't normally think to put together. The Banana Oatmeal cookies are great, so is the Purple Mash! My son loves it."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Many books claim to have \\"healthy\\" recipes for babies, toddlers, and children, however, I have discovered most are little healthier than Betty Crocker. This book is one exception. The recipes are health centered with the author explaining the nutritional benefits of many of the main ingredients for her recipes. The recipes I've tried have been easy to prepare although you may need to make a trip to your local health-food store to get some ingredients or order products on-line like another reviewer suggested because some of the ingredients are not mainstream. Please note - I am not a vegan, or vegetarian, just someone who was raised by a health conscious parent and wants the same in turn for my child. I credit my mother who took the time to learn about nutrition, shop at a health-food store, and create her own healthy recipes similar to the ones in this book for my good health today. I have never had any health or weight issues in my life."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Wow, I couldn't disagree with the last reviewer more. Sure, this book has some recipes with some harder to find items so just skip those recipes! I never would have introduced my daughter to some of the grains if they hadn't been recommended in this book. I always taste what I make for her....better than jarred! She LOVES the raisin bars but my husband loves them more. I now have to double the recipe so he won't eat them all first. Some recipes are more involved than others but the majority are easy! The bottom line is my daughter has enjoyed every recipe!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I will be buying this book for all of my pregnant friends! Unlike a few others who have reviewed this book, I did not feel like I was being preached to by the author. I found her informative and concise, which is exactly what I need as a first time mother of a 5 month old. Also, as has already been stated by other reviewers, if you want to use the suggested 'exotic' ingredients to obtain the full health benefits of these recipes, use the internet! Anything you could ever need is at your fingertips.I am very excited by this book, having already read it from cover to cover, and cannot wait to try the numerous, simple recipes at my disposal."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I purchased several cookbooks when my daughter was beginning to try solids and this little cookbook has become my staple for finding recipes. Olivia is 1 year old now and even though she is eating mostly what we eat, I still go to this cookbook for lunch, breakfast, and snack recipes. I just made the Oatmeal Banana cookies and they are wonderful. The apple oat pancakes were a hit and so easy to freeze for quick future breakfasts. The Lentil Stew is also amazing - I made enough for my husband and I to eat too! I highly recommend this cookbook for anyone interested in feeding their baby/toddler whole foods."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Great, quick and easy to prepare recipes with wholesome and nutritious ingredients (surprised at some of the bad reviews, I wonder why people that don't even know what millet or quinoa is would consider buying a book with this title in the first place?!?), ranging from first solid foods to nutritious meals and desserts for toddlers. The banana oatmeal cookies are delicious and contain zero sugar (except from the fruit sugar that comes with the bananas, naturally), my son (9 months) loves them. It's great to have a little \\"healthy\\" (as far as you can speak of healthy when it comes to processed - that is baked, in this case) treat at hand when there's not yet really much you can give.We are vegans, and most of the recipes in this book are either vegan or vegetarian and can be easily veganised.The book gives some basic information on nutrients and possible allergens, though you better check back with your pediatrician before introducing foods that are highly allergenic when your family has a history of food allergies.This book is for you when you are vegetarian, vegan or just health conscious and feel comfortable preparing your own food in contrast to buying highly processed foods for your family. It's not for you if you don't know what brown rice, millet or quinoa is, or couldn't be bothered to find out, or if for some reason you oppose shopping at health food stores to get the occasional non-supermarket ingredient (tahini, nutritional yeast etc). I found the instructions to be helpful and just right - everything I tried out so far turned out great, and baby loved it.Some of the recipes included: \\"make your own instant baby cereal\\", quick quinoa and avocado, cauliflower and broccoli, quick millet and applesauce, brown rice and lentils, sweet potato and green beans, veggie-rice-pilaf, scrambled tofu, creamy carrot soup, bean spread, teething crackers, apple-bran muffins, apple-oat pancakes, banana oatmeal cookies, instant banana pudding (made with silken tofu), plus beverages and smoothies... and many more. Love them all - we highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I really like this cookbook and appreciate the recipes and ideas for feeding a baby that don't involve just opening a box or jar of pre-made food from a factory. Some of the recipes are a little too complicated or time-consuming for me (i.e. if it takes 45 min to make rice cereal, you might rather just stick to oatmeal), but it is a good source of ideas. I have mostly just steamed and mashed veggies and fruits when I have had an infant to feed. This has good recipes of that kind, but also more ambitious kinds of healthy foods that kids will like."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"simple book easy to read, and gives you different options, to make food from scratch, not only the mashed food ,but also the cookies , also remind you of tips to create food experience for your baby not just eating, such as independent eating food habits ( give child spoon, or plate etc.)I recommend it as a gift for new mothers"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I just love this little recipe book!!

I missed one towards the end that said don't buy this, several of the recipes call for ingredients such as sea kelp, sea vegetables (I didn't know there was any such thing), or things like tahini, millet and quinoa. I don't even know what those are. I should be able to buy the ingredients in a regular grocery store. It also goes to the other extreme (also noted in a previous review)and actually gives recipes for juice pops (pour juice into an ice cube tray). I mean really. There are very few actually usable recipes in this book, and it is a very thin and small book to begin with. For the most part this book will be under the Mommy Made book. Buy that one, its much thicker, has much more recipes and uses regular every day ingredients. This one was a waste of money."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I was disappointed with this book due to a) the lack of suggestions for first foods (and I have enough to do without making rice cereal myself), and b) some of the ingredients I also wouldnt know where to buy or what else to do with them. There are many more foods infants can eat when they're starting out than was suggested in this book.If you or your family are not solely whole foods eaters this might not be the book for you."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I will be trading this book asap. Several of the recipes contain ingredients I don't use, such as low sodium soy sauce, miso, and Sea Veg Mix. I am not particularly trusting of additives such as Sea Veg Mix or salty additives such as soy sauce or miso (even in the low sodium form), so that doesn't leave many recipes left in the book for me to use.

After publishing &quot;Beyond Rice Cereal: Healthy Food Your Infant and Toddler Will Love to Eat,&quot; she now brings us, &quot;Simply Natural Baby Food: Easy Recipes for Delicious Meals Your Infant and Toddler Will Love.&quot; This authentic cookbook is not just for the baby and toddler of the family. There are recipes that everyone will enjoy. My mouth watered while reading the Toddler Foods section of &quot;Simply Natural Baby Foods.&quot;Cathe begins with secitons titled How to Use This Book, Equipment, Ingredients, and Vegetarian Babies. Throughout the book are tips and fun wasy to feed nutritious foods to little ones. And children will beg for more. What I like best about Cathe's book is how simple she makes it for parents to feed their children healthy foods every day. I wish this book had been available thirty years ago when I was raising my children. At the time, there were some books on nutrition, but nothing like Cathe's cookbook to make feeding time fast and healthy.Cathe Olson shatters a long time myth that feeding babies and toddlers a meal from a jar bought from the store is much easier. It's not. And it's not cheaper. You'll believe it once you've read and tried the simple inexpensive recipes. This book will start babies on healthy foods that will shape the way they eat for life."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"This book is a godsend to parents who want to make their own baby food and aren't sure how to do it or what to make.The book is broken down by age range so you can concentrate on making foods that are appropriate for the range your child is in.

I knew that it would be important to me to feed my son as many unprocessed foods as possible, but I was really nervous about how few ideas I could come up with on my own that didn't involve a gourmet recipe. THIS BOOK IS AWESOME! Not only are the recipes really basic, but after a while I was able to start coming up with my own by just changing out a fruit or vegetable that she called for. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Of all the baby food cookbooks in my collection (English, Chinese and Japanese), I have to say \\"Simply Natural Baby Food\\" is by far my favorite. I like it because it's concise and informative, and it incorporates some old ingredients that I grew up with, e.g. dried seaweed and tofu, and some new ingredients that I'd happily tried such as Tahini and Hummus. More importantly it caters to the needs of babies with food allergies and always offers alternatives. The simple and healthy finger food and snack ideas have been lifesavers for us as we tried to stay away from some common allergens. As for those recipes that call for nuts, skipping this particular ingredient does not affect the flavor IMHO. Last but not least, like other reviewers have commented, these recipes yield creative and delicious dishes for the whole family to enjoy."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Simply Natural Baby Foods by Cathe Olson is a Must Have for any parent wanting to provide nutritious snacks and meals for children of all ages not just infants and toddlers.When my children were diagnosed with food allergies, I took a look at what I thought was healthy eating and saw that there was room for improvement. I was afraid to order yet another cookbook, not sure if we could utilize the recipies. After emailing the author, she was more than willing to assist me in making exchanges for ingredients we can not eat, so that we could fully enjoy her cookbook. I wish I had this book 4 years ago.If you don't want your children eating processed, chemical laden foods, but don't know what to feed them, THIS BOOK HAS THE ANSWERS. The recipies are just as the title says \\"simply & natural\\" basically real food. My family has loved everything I have made from it. I can't say enough good things about this book, someday your children will thank you for caring enough to buy and use this book."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"When I had my children, I wanted to feed them nutritious foods but had a limited knowledge of the organic products available. Cathe's book was a life saver. Aside from the delicious recipes (that even my picky 5 year old enjoys), her section on healthy ingredients, and how and when to use them, was very informative. My oldest child even enjoys preparing some of the simpler recipes with me! Though we are not a vegetarian family, most of the recipes in this book are geared for vegetarians. I have found that these recipes are a great way to get more veggies into my meat loving kids and I have shared many of the recipes with my vegetarian friends. The wide variety of recipe choices offers something for everyone in the family. I particularly love the dessert section...finally I can indulge without feeling guilty!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I have not read this book, but I plan to purchase it based on the many positive reviews. The main negative review I've read is difficulty finding some of the obscure ingredients. The ingredients problem can be easily solved no matter where you live. The reason why I am writing a review is to add a comment to that discussion.Thanks to the internet, it is no longer necessary to live in Northern California to have easy access to obscure ingredients. If you like the idea of the book but are worried about finding ingredients, buy them online!!One reviewer had a hard time finding brown rice flour. Try www.barryfarm.com. You will find a 1 lb. bag for $1.29.Another reviewer mentioned Quinoa. Try www.mannaharvest.net. You will find a 12 oz box of Ancient Harvest Organic Quinoa for $3.25.These are only two examples of thousands of resources online. A great way to find any of these ingredients is www.froogle.com (Google's shopping search site).Yes, you will have to pay for shipping, but...1. If you can buy a lot of ingredients from one store, the shiping is a small percentage of the total price.2. You often don't pay sales tax online, which can offset the shipping cost. (In fact, if you have to pay sales tax, that means you're in the same state as the store which means you probably have easy local access to these ingredients anyway).3. The shipping cost can be worth the added convenience of having these items delivered to your door.4. Some online stores offer free shipping if your order is over a minimum dollar amount."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I bought this after reading reviews that stated it was a concise book filled with easy recipes for baby and toddler. HOWEVER, NO ONE MENTIONED IT WAS MACROBIOTIC. I am not macrobiotic, rather, I just want to learn to cook natural healthy baby food. I have no problem with eating that way, I just choose not to. I don't want to use kelp, quinoa, adzuki beans,yeast flakes, sea veg mix, agar agar flakes, bragg liquid aminos etc... If these are ingredients you cook with on a regular basis, buy this book!

I realize that these types of ingredients are not always easy to find, but in the case of some, you may be looking too hard.

Always do what your pediatrician recommends, but Olson provided good guidelines for our baby and lifestyle in recipes within each age range. I cook and live in a big city, so the ingredients were very simple to find and I was already familiar with most of them. It just helped for someone else to have already done the math and combinations for simple baby food recipes. Very pleased!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Finally a heathy cookbook for kids. All the other books have refined sugar or milk etc, ingredients that my baby can't have or I don't want her to have. I have been looking for a book that uses quinoa, millet and other incredibly wonderful grains. For those of you mainstream, it might be a bit of a challenge, but try this book. Find out about these grains. Do some research on the ingredients in this book. They are delicious, easy to use and sooo good for your baby."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I liked the idea of making my child's rice cereal and oatmeal. For a very first food, I could not get the uncooked rice or oats quite as finely ground as my baby needed it. They were still a little to chunky. I used my blender for this.

Everything I have heard from the Dr's or read says to wait at least one year and until two or three years if you have a family history of nut allergies. Very disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I started out just pureeing fruits and veggies (which is fine when your child is six months or less) and came to the realization that I had NO recipies that would work for an older baby or a toddler. My problem is now solved. This is a great book for parents that would like to avoid all the \\"processed\\" foods that are on the market. Gerber is great, but nothing compares to all natural baby food made in your own home. This book has it all, it even has a recipe for homemade teething bisquits! One of the main reasons we have gone this route is because of the amount of SUGAR that is in EVERYTHING (seriously..... look at the amount of sugar in juice.... wow). Since my husband can't have sugar and my father can't have salt... we needed something that would work for everyone and this book does. I am extremely happy with my purchase.I am in disagreement For those that say \\"it is too involved\\". The most difficult recipes are no different than making a meal for yourself; and those recipes are also good for adults so its not like you would be making one meal for baby and one for yourself....you would be making ONE for EVERYONE. It is a great way for the whole family to eat healthier."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I found this book to be wonderful! If you are the kind of person who is willing to put in a little bit of work and don't want your child to start solids with foods full of preservatives, this is the book for you.

I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"This is my most used baby cookbook. I've got 3 or 4, but this is my favorite. I still make the apple-oat pancakes for my son who's now almost 3. I will say some of the ingredients are hard to come by, but the recipes are pretty good. I used this more often with my first born when I had more time. Now that I've got 2 little ones I don't cook as often for them, but when I do, it's this book I turn to."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I love this book.

A lot of the recipes include an ingredient called the \\"Sea Veg Mix\\" which seems like a seasoning concoction that the author has made up and includes in a lot of the recipes. The Sea Veg Mix includes kelp, hiziki, arame, wakame and kombu. What? Exactly, I have no idea what ingredients these are and where to buy them. And I'm not a novice in the kitchen. Even if you know what you are looking for, these aren't ingredients that you buy at your local grocery store. Also, a lot of the baby food recipes are pretty logical, just pureed or mashed vegetables or fruits. You can figure those out without this cookbook. I would have preferred a book that had recipes with ingredients that one already has in the kitchen or can easily obtain at the neighborhood grocery store. Unless, you live in a big city where all this stuff is readily available, then you won't have much use for this book. My main gripe is definitely the ingredients that these recipes require. Its tough enough to have to cook healthy meals for a family but to add the extra job of trekking all over the place to find the right ingredients for the recipes in this book just doesn't make sense."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Informative book, but.....I do not believe it is right to be teaching \\"vegan\\" or \\"vegetarian\\" dietary habits for people to practice on their infant children. Children are in need of so many things in their beginning years, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, etc. I bought this cookbook to learn how to make more natural and more healthy babyfood for our children. Not to learn how to avoid meat products and get a philosphy lesson on the principals of vegan and vegetarian diets.I am sure the author is very well educated, I am not questioning that, I just don't think we are on the same page. I also think that alot of the food ingredients are not available at the \\"corner grocery store\\" thus limiting the application of many of the recipes in our household."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I was very excited to start feeding my son solids. I bought this book and Super Baby Food. This book is NO comparison to the Super Baby Food book. This book would be a great 3rd or 4th addition to your baby food cookbooks but not a very good starter book. It doesn't explain anything in detail.

The recipes in this book calls for things like sea kelp and other things that I know are not easily available in my town. The recipes were gor meals that I wouldn't make for myself. The author preaches about the neccessity for organic and whole foods. While I think that we need to feed our children the best possible foods, I don't think that I need to be lectured to. I was looking for something easy, and I found something that made making my son a healthy meal more difficult. It almost makes me want to go and stock up on jarred foods. It would be a lot easier than finding sea kelp and agar. I would not reccommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"This book was good in that it gave me the confidence to just start throwing things in the food processor.

I leafed throught it, thought it looked great, then it stayed on the shelf- until now, that is. My son in now 12 months and wants much more than breastmilk these days and this book has come to the rescue! So far the recipes are great, such as the veggie-brown rice pilaf, the hummus-avocado whole grain bread sandwich, the baby fish dinner, and the strawberry-banana UN-ice cream. My DS has loved each of these so far. It is so important to eat wholesome foods, especially while shaping young tastebuds. I was recently reminded of this as a collegue of mine told me that her four year old will only eat *gasp* hotdogs wrapped in bologna! He will eat at least four a day, and that's about it! Determined never shall this be in our home, I will happily spend the extra time to actually cook food for our kids, and this book has it all!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I have purchased several cookbooks geared towards babies and toddlers. This one is by far the best and definitely most used. At first I was put off by the small size of this book - but I find myself referring to it daily. EVERY recipe I have made has been delicious - especially the teething crackers and every single dessert I have made. I enjoy them as much (or more?) than my daughter. The food is simple, \\"clean\\" and healthy. We love it."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Like many reviewers, I'm not big on the organic, make-your-own-baby-food stuff either. But this book is very helpful if your child can't or won't eat dairy products. There are a lot of ideas and recipes for non-dairy sources of calcium.There were several recipes that my daughter liked when she was a year old but soon outgrew. Now at 2.5, when she is refusing to eat almost everything, there are still 3 recipes in here that she absolutely loves, and for those alone I'm very glad I bought this book. (The recipes she likes are vegetables with bread crumb topping, Almond Butter Noodles and nut butter chews. Even when she won't eat other vegetables, she'll gobble down broccoli with bread crumb topping and ask for seconds.)There are also some good recipes for healthy desserts (i.e. low sugar and even some nutritional content), which have been popular at family gatherings."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I bought this book along with several others, including super baby food. I found this the easiest to get started. I think anyone making their own babyfood will research the process from several different sources and ultimately figure out their own system for how they want to feed their baby. One of the nice things about this book is that it has a wide variety of recipes for different age groups and doesn't subscribe to a rigid menu. Although some of the denser books are good resources, this is a book you can thumb through for ideas. It's the one i turn to most consistently."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"My family loves food, we are the farmers market type of shoppers, picking up heirloom carrots, tomoatoes, and raw garbanzo beans. With this in mind, we LOVE this little book. We learned a lot about different sources of quality nutrition for our son (who is now 13 months). Although, we don't use the book a lot anymore, it was a good starting point for finding high quality, nutritious ingredients for little meals. There are some recipes that call for nuts, so we just skipped those until my son was one. No big deal.If you want simple recipes like smashed carrots and puree peas... this is probably not for you. The other cookbooks mentioned by previous reviewers are a great resource for these."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"This book gave me great tips and recipes. I especially like the tip about freezing extra food you make for baby in ice cube containers. I do this all the time now. They're easy to defrost, the ice cube tray size lets me take just the right portion for my baby 9just one or two cubes) and they're easy to defrost and feed to baby. I like the layout of this book and the easy recipes. One customer below says the recipes call for things she can't find in her town... well the author is not preaching, she just makes recommendations. You can get substitutes so skip the item. I like the book a lot."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"My kids have loved all of the recipes I have made from Simply Natural Babyfood. They gobble up apple muffins, carrot muffins, cheesy rice, and other dishes as quickly as I serve them. I no longer have to worry about whether or not they are getting enough fruits and vegetables.

I thought the simple recipes referred to being able to cook with what you have at home, and still make your toddler eat other things besides chicken nuggets. Well, this book is full of recipes that have things that are not in my home and not at my local grocery store - I guess I am just not a healthy eater, because I don't have seaweed, brown rice flour and etc. sitting in my pantry.I have a 4 month old and a 2 year old, so I thought I can use this book for some creative meal ideas, especially since I have been having major issues with getting my toddler to eat anything but bananas, chicken nuggets, and rice lately - hardly healthy eating. Well, the only recipe she likes as of now is the oatmeal nut pancakes - but even that she eats drenched in syrup, which I think defeats the whole purpose of serving the healthy meal. The other meals are wonderful but they are stock full of vegetables which my toddler is having problems eating. I put so much effort into gathering the ingredients (which are not always available at your local grocery store) only to watch my toddler spit out the food after taking one bite. So if your toddler likes to eat his/her veggies, does not mind tofu, or having rice flour, then this is a great book for you. It just was not what I hoped it would be - but then again, maybe there is no single book out there that can make your toddler to start liking everything at once :)"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I love this little book. I know a past reviewer criticised the book for being too thin but that's one of the things I like about it. I have always enjoyed cooking and bought quite a few baby cook books when my daughter was very young thinking I would potter around making her perfect gourmet meals but soon realised that there are many days when the thought of even leafing through the pages of those cookbooks is too much effort. I just find them too overwhelming and invariably reach for this book because the recipes are simple but still tasty. You don't need to be a great cook to be able to make these recipes, the instructions are very easy to follow.Despite being a slender volume, the book packs a lot of information into its pages, and still has a great collection of recipes.I never found it to be a problem finding any of the ingredients. I have to admit that even though I consider my cooking to be quite wholesome I had never used some of the items like dried seaweed (you only use a pinch) and ground seeds myself, but after reading in the book just why these things are included, I found myself adding them to my own food as well. They are incredibly nutritious and such an easy way to bolster your child's immune system which I found so reassuring during the winter. I'm sure you can order these ingredients online if you can't find them in a store nearby. You use such a small amount that they will last for ages. And you can always leave those items out if you prefer.The book is written in a very friendly manner and is a nice balance between educating and guiding you as to what your baby's and toddler's developmental needs are with easy to follow recipes. A reviewer below wrote that the last thing they needed was to be making their own baby cereal. Well I guess if that's your mindset then this book isn't for you because honestly it takes all of two seconds to make the cereal, and the jar lasts a very long time when you are using a couple of tablespoons at a time! Not that you can't find good organic packaged baby cereal, (I did try that myself but my baby would never eat it). And there's nothing stopping you from using the recipes as guides and substituting purchased products for some ingredients if it makes life easier.The book takes you right through to when your child is a toddler with tips that help you sneak vegetables into their diet and great snack ideas too. There are some lovely recipes for cookies and cakes as well, which is nice, it's very realistic in that although you want to feel that you are presenting your child with yummy healthy food, there's always a place for sweet treats in life. I'm not personally a fan of soy products which some of the recipes call for, but I just substitute the tofu or whatever with chicken,lamb or fish.I went online to check out the authors website and was happy to see that the adorable little girls on the website who I assume are the author's daughters look like very happy and healthy children. They are a great advertisement for the book."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"This book certainly has some mixed reviews. It seems people either love it or hate. While I am one of the ones who LOVE this book, I can see why this book would not be for everybody. Here are my thoughts:\\"Simply Natural Baby Food\\" does not try to make you vegetarian, vegan, macrobiotic, a raw fooder, or a carnivore - however, it pulls aspects from many different diets. There are many vegetarian recipes, there are vegan recipes, there are some smoothies and treats made from raw foods, there are recipes that use alternative grains like brown rice flour for those with wheat or gluten allergies, there are recipes that use whole grains and sea vegetables that are common in a macrobiotic diet, there are recipes that incorporate dairy products, eggs, fish or poultry.While this may sound like it encompasses everybody, it does not. This book is for people who want to eat (and want their children to eat) whole foods. That means whole grains like brown rice, millet and quinoa; beans and legumes; fruit and vegetables; cultured dairy products like yogurt and cottage cheese; more plant foods than animal foods; no white flour or refined grains; and no refined sugar.For many feeding your child fresh, organic, whole foods without sugar, articial colors and trans-fats may be too far removed from what they are accustomed to eating. If you expect to be able to find the ingredients for the recipes in this book at your local 7-11, you definitely have the wrong book - but if you prefer to shop at a natural foods store - or at least are open to checking one out (or even an online store), you will enjoy this book.I for one found it a refreshing change from the other books that offer recipes using jello, bisquick, and colored cereals. And that's not to say that the foods are bland-tasting health foods either. My husband, children, and I love the White Bean and Corn Chowder,Apple Oat Pancakes, Apple Bran Muffins, Quick Cheesy Rice, Banana Oatmeal Cookies, Pineapple Carrot Cake, Instant Banana Pudding, Smoothies, and the \\"Better Than Ice Cream\\" made in the food processor is incredible.I want a different way of eating for my children than I was brought up with. Look at the obesity rate of children in this country. Children are now suffering from previously adult only diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and more. In fact, this generation of children is expected to be the first generation ever to live a shorter life span than their parents. Processed food laden with trans fats, chemicals, pesticides, artificial colors and flavors, sugar, and sodium found in our local supermarkets are not producing healthy, fit children. This book gives an alternative - and I see my children thriving on these recipes - and the rest of my family as well."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Simply Natural Baby Food by Cathe Olson is a simply wonderful book.This little gem is a must-have for anyone wanting to give their baby or toddlerthe very best in whole, nutritious foods.

Many of these recipes make large quanties, but it all freezes well. I found myself cooking a lot for several days, but since I can store the food in my freezer and use small quantities at a time, I then have a week or so off from cooking. If you already practice eating whole foods and buying in bulk, chances are that you will have most of the ingredients laying around anyway. I did have to pick up a few specialty items at the local food co-op, but I shop there all the time anyway! The food is good, and my husband and I eat it as well. I have seen an improvemnet in my son's sleeping habits since we began practicing the recipes in this book. This is not only a book of recipes, but also a book about lifestyle change.

I think it is very important to feed your baby the best, most natural foods when they are young; not only to start them off with the most healthy \\"building blocks\\" for their growing bodies, but also so that the child comes to appreciate the various tastes and textures of \\"real\\", natural food, instead of the highly processed, prepackaged children's meals that are out there.Cathe has wonderful pureed recipes for very young infants (purple puree with made with red cabbage and other great ingredients was my daughter's favorite!), and then she introduces more chunky recipes for older babies and toddlers. There is a fun section full of easy and unique sandwich ideas, and some delicious dessert recipes for toddlers (and adults!) that don't even contain sugar.I also really appreciate all of the helpful cooking, storing, and feeding hints that are scattered throughout the book. Extremely helpful are her instructions on how to cook brown rice and various grains and legumes for infants; it's great to know how much water to use and the cooking times when making these staple foods for babies.Cathe offers both vegetarian and meat options for the older baby/toddler recipes, so you can take your pick there. She has introduced me to some really interesting (and natural, of course) salt and sugar alternatives, and her use of using sea vegetables to increase the nutrition of foods was also quite enlightening for me. All in all, a great book for anyone wanting some creative and healthful recipes for your infant and toddler!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I loved this book!!

I especially like this book because a) the recipes are very easy to make (great for a busy mom), b) the recipes are super healthy (no refined sugar or grains), and c) everybody in my family likes the dishes I prepare. So far, our favorites are: apple-oat pancakes, split pea soup, creamy carrot soup, white bean and corn chowder, squashed macaroni, carrot corn muffins, apple-bran muffins, pineapple-carrot cake, banana oatmeal cookies, and instant banana pudding - plus the smoothies and \\"better than ice cream\\" recipes. And that's not even counting the baby food.If you want to raise your children to eat whole, natural foods, this is the book for you. I also have Olson's other book, The Vegetarian Mother's Cookbook, and I love that as well.Edited to add:I came to order another copy of this book for a friend who just had a baby and saw the above review. I am really surprised by it. Nowhere in the book does the author tell you to feed your baby vegan or vegetarian. She does offer many vegetarian recipes but she also has some recipes for fish or poultry. The only thing I think she says is that red meat is hard to digest for infants. What's great about this book is that it offers recipes for everyone - vegetarian, vegan, and those eating animal foods. However, they are all whole foods so you do have to be willing to venture into a health food store to get some ingredients."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"I personally love this book. I don't follow it to key, like buying organic veggies, I buy just the regular ones, for example, but it is a good book. The recipes I have been able to do are great, and easy to do, plus tasty.My only problem is finding some of the ingredients. I live in the fraser valley/lowermainland of British Columbia, Canada. The area is very mulit-cultural, with foods from vertually every where in the world RIGHT here! It's great for shopping. And usually you can find pretty much everything you're looking for. But not in the case of the ingredients from this book.One thing, for example, was the brown rice flour. I found RICE flour, but not BROWN rice flour, and the bags are SMALL, and expensive.Other things, like kelp, I ... actually figured I would find, but I haven't yet. She, the author, uses a lot of sea vegitables actually for the older baby foods. Which is great, if you can get a hold of them, cause their nutritional value is amazing, sometimes way better then &quot;land&quot; veggies. I live ... not to far from the ocean, and I figured, reading this book, and getting these veggies should be a breeze. But it looks like if I want kelp, I'm going to have to get it right from the ocean itself. *laughing*But personally I don't like having to go to speciality shops to find ingredients for a recipe, especially recipes I find in a book that's supposed to make making your baby food an easy task. I found myself in a Chinese store, an East Indian store, etc. in hopes of finding SOME of these ingredients, cause honestly, the recipes sound great, and I DO want to try them. But I'm stumped ... where does one look?Now, there are recipes in here that you do not need special things, but it is a warning, that at least 1/3 of the older baby recipes have an ingredient you won't beable to find, unless you're making these ingrendients yourself, or ... have an AMAZING local grocery store. *laughing*So, lastly, I recommend the book, but with the warning that although the recipes are simple to make, they are not simple to get the contents of."},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"Simply Natural Baby Food is a well-written, easy to use cookbook for any parent who wants to make sure that his/her child is starting off with good eating habits.

I picked up a copy of this book at a local store, and found it to be just what I needed.It's a small book, so it's not as overwhelming as many others I've seen, but it has great information and basically follows the advice of my pediatrician as far as when to introduce certain foods, how long to wait before introducing something new, etc.In the beginning, the foods are really basic. Mashing an avocado or a banana is quite easy, but I hadn't thought about using avacado as a first food. It turned out to be a great first food that my baby really enjoyed--he started with avacado and banana at about 7 months old.From there it gives you some simple but good combinations, such as apple pear sauce and squash with peas. She goes into the equipment you need, and how to make baby food. I just make up a batch and use silicone ice cube trays to freeze it.Unlike many other books, this book is not geared toward raising your baby as a vegetarian, but she does say to wait until 10 months or so before giving meat (my pediatrician recommends 11-12 months). There are, however, many vegetarian and vegan meals in the book for children who are either not eating animal products yet, or who are raised vegetarian or vegan. For these children, she recommends additions such as nutritional yeast and sea vegetables to make sure they get enough vitamins and minerals.I really love the toddler food section, where she has many meals that sound great for the entire family. She also has a number of desserts that don't contain sugar or artificial sweetners (most of them contain fruit or other natural sources of sugar). There is absolutely no reason to ever give a baby or toddler any food that contains sugar, although a few other baby cookbooks I have contain sugar laden recipes.To answer some of the other critics about this being for \\"crunchy\\" people or containing a ton of weird ingredients, I'd like to say that I'm a normal person who lives in Alaska and is a full-time Realtor and a full-time mom. I like to hunt and fish, and we are not vegetarian or vegan. I do try to eat healthy, and buy organic produce when I can, but living in Alaska I'm limited in what is available.We don't have a lot of health food stores or restaurants here, but I can find the ingredients in her sea vegetables in our local store in the Japenese food section. I was unable to find one ingredient (hiziki I think), so I just used the other ones. I've added them to many foods I cook for myself and my husband as well, since they are a good source of iodine, iron and calcium.My pediatrician even recommends kelp as a good source of iron for infants at 6 months of age (granulated kelp is found as a salt substitute in the seasoning aisle of my local store). The author always says you can substitute kelp for the sea vegetable mix.I think this is a great book to introduce people to a few new healthy foods that are easy to incorporate into your baby's diet. I've purchased 5 books on baby food, and this is by far the best. My only complaint is that all cook books should have a spiral binding to make them easier to use while cooking!"},{"Title":"Raising Baby Right : A Guide To The 20 Most Common Mistakes New Parents Make: (Prince)","review":"The book is petite, as it should be; yet the writing is large and easily legible. Cathe's format emphasizes the simplicity of the recipes (that moms can literally whip up in minutes and freeze in batches for later use). Nonetheless, while the recipes contain just a few ingredients, Cathe emphasizes the importance of nutrition, and ensures that her recipes are well rounded from a nutrient perspective for each stage of an infant's development. In fact, there are numerous healthy tips and the chapters are broken down by age.Actually, I found several of the older baby recipes (apple oat pancakes and pineapple carrot cake) and toddler recipes (whole grain waffles and minestrone soup) enticing myself! Really, the recipes cover breakfast to dinner tastes, and everything in between. This book even offers recipes for homemade animal cookies and graham crackers!Worth noting, no diets are excluded from this handy guide. While there are a few omnivorous recipes (with meat), most of the recipes are vegan/vegetarian or offer easy alternatives. Along those lines, there is a plethora of dairy-free, wheat/gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free, and nut-free recipes for any child born with allergies or other diet-related autoimmune condition. Cathe does use some unique ingredients that are popular within the health food movement, yet they are becoming easier to find, and could easily be omitted if you don't feel like seeking them out. The only thing that I think would help this book is a food allergy index.It was hard for me to believe that over 150 recipes were packaged into this easily manageable cookbook, but after perusing the contents I was sold.

Do not miss the studies of brain wave function comparing activity level among readers, watchers of television, and sleepers; the latter two are about equal. The incident of the poet doing a reading of his poems in a coffee house who could not get the audience's attention until he stopped reading and turned on a tape recording of himslf reading the same materials is on the surface amusing but also chilling in what it says about society's relationship to real experience and simulation.While ostensibly about aboriginal peoples it is his extension of his research into our own society that for me makes this book most interesting and important."},{"Title":"Oh, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me!","review":"Edmund Carpenter is pretty much a genius.

I read it voraciously. I can say that in many ways it changed my life: the story of the new guinea school where mathematics was taught by rote (including errors) caused me to rethink many academic disciplines. The story of the australian teaching eskimos to use a boomerang with the rejoinder \\"just don't tell any visiting anthropologists where you learned this\\" caused me to rethink anthropology specifically.

I must stateupfront that I don't believe in UFO's or life on other planets. In spite of this, I am nonetheless fascinated with controversial phenomena such as UFO sightings and alien contact. While I don't deny that people who have had these experiences felt something that they perceived to be very real, I don't believe that what they experienced had anything to do with aliens, UFO's or abductions.The author and I come from the same skeptical background. We are also both Christians, yet I won't go so far as Rhodes does in his Biblical interpretations of alien encounters. Although he is using the Bible as his source, I found his scriptural backup for UFO sightings and alien abductions to be as weak as water. In his explanation for what causes UFO sightings, he makes the point throughout the book, warning readers about extraterrestrials:\\"Christians beware! Deceptive spirits are at work!\\"; and:\\"Don't be fooled by deceiving spirits!\\".So it's evil spirits who are making all those lights in the sky, is it? I don't buy into extraterrestrial travellers visiting planet Earth either, yet I don't think the answer to all these sightings is that they are manifestations of Satan's demon angels trying to hook humans into believing in them.I found the most interesting chapters in Alien Obsession to be \\"Are UFOs Mentioned in the Bible?\\" and \\"The Strange Case of Whitley Strieber\\". In the late eighties I read Strieber's first two books about his alleged alien abductions and visitations, Communion and Transformation. His first book, Communion, scared the living daylights out of me. I had never read a book that made me scared to move about in my own house. Strieber had repeated psychologically traumatic experiences, that, in my opinion, were not extraterrestrial in their cause. Rhodes sums up Strieber's experiences this way:\\"I don't believe for a minute that Strieber came into contact with bona fide aliens from outer space. Rather, he came into contact with demonic spirits who were posing as aliens.\\"This is stated so brazenly that it is laughable. The whole tone of this book, in its Biblical analyses and in the author's warnings to vulnerable potential Christian alien abductees, comes across as though it was written by --and I am sorry that a fellow Christian such as myself has to say this-- a religious wacko. How else to explain the author's tips to Christians who may find themselves abducted by demonics spirits posing as aliens? Rhodes gives the reader tips on how to get these demonic aliens to let you go. What? Has he used his own advice on himself to vouch that it works? Not a fun read, and I found myself shaking my head with scoffing laughter many times as I turned its 252 pages."},{"Title":"Origin of Mind: Evolution of Brain, Cognition, and General Intelligence","review":"The brain has long been the most mysterious of the organs. Part of the problem has been that the brain can be viewed in so many different ways. The same organ can think of Einstein's Theory of Relativity in one instant and be smiling and talking baby talk to an infant the next.In this book Dr. Geary brings together research from neuroscience, behavior genetics, and cognitive science along with the behavioral sciences such as primatology, anthropology, and sociology to present an integrated view of the brain as we know it today.The chapter \\"General Intelligence in Modern Society\\" is brilliant in it's explanation of IQ testing and its relationship with society. It both confirms, explains, and rejects the findings in the best seller \\"The Bell Curve\\" from 1994. \\"The IQ test,\\" Dr. Geary says, \\"was designed to predict educational outcomes.\\" And in this it works very well - in one study 20% of the people in the 99th percentile had Ph.D. degrees. He then discusses other aspects such as motivation, family, social presures and more as reasons for achievement in education, work and income. There's far too much to cover in a short review like this one.This is not a book that has been dumbed down for the general reader. It is a definitive tome on the state of the understanding of the brain as it exists today. It is fascinating reading, but not something that you're going to race through in an afternoon."},{"Title":"Origin of Mind: Evolution of Brain, Cognition, and General Intelligence","review":"This is an thoughtful, erudite and complex book weaving together various strands of research in evolution, neural organisation, cognition and mind together. Every page is littered with references, not carelessly I hasten to add. The author's main thesis, as i understand it, is that the mind essentially 'runs' simulations, and this is an evolution endowmnet arising from ontogenetic requirements to exercise control of behaviour and the environment. Anyone locked into folk psychology, especially Stich's simualtion theory, will find much to ponder here. Geary holds that folk psychology has many 'anchors' that orient the human organism towards fundamental activities to sustain itself, e.g. social cues. These anchors are shaped in development under evolutionary imperatives. Much of the book is devoted to teasing out in detail the framework that allows this to occur. The notion of a fluid intelligence is introduced to debnk the g factor (as too limitinf a construct) and explain adaptive behaviours. Each chapter deserves a review by itself. Overall, the book is tremendously impressive and detailed however, it still faces to problem of splicing folk psychological concepts with neuroscientific data, and it is here that most critics will focus there attention. Geary has assemled a welther of piece sof evidence and argumentation to make this work, but eliminativtists will not be satisfied. Having read this book quickly, I can state baldly that it is the first book in years that I will reread. Lots of food for thought."},{"Title":"Origin of Mind: Evolution of Brain, Cognition, and General Intelligence","review":"David Geary texts are always a pleasant reading! This is a book to understand about the evolution of our mind and a prelude of what is coming on the field."},{"Title":"Origin of Mind: Evolution of Brain, Cognition, and General Intelligence","review":"This book gives a brilliant, synthetic theory of the evolution of the human brain/mind. It is every bit as challenging as its subject. Dr. Geary has an enviable ability to collate disparate literature and put the pieces together into a coherent picture.As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is not written in the chatty, conversational tone of a pop-science paperback. Dr. Geary does not condescend or patronize the reader. He assumes we are intelligent adults who are willing to be challenged and enlightened. Further, the reader can easily select a chapter that interests him or her and read it in isolation.I think this book conclusively demonstrates that the only way we will ever understand the brain/mind is via the lens of natural and sexual selection. It is not the final word on the topic but it is one hell of a mid-point salvo."},{"Title":"Origin of Mind: Evolution of Brain, Cognition, and General Intelligence","review":"I purchased this book based on my professional and personal interests and the positive reviews on Amazon. I am a practicing psychiatrist with a research background in neurophysiology and a longstanding interest in the origin of the human mind and the nature of consciousness. This is an exploding area in neuroscience and Dr. Geary's efforts to bring the latest developments in evolutionary theory to bear in a comprehensive review are admirable.Here are the points I found most interesting. The human mind is unique in it's ability to create a sense of self which is stable over time and capable of utilizing past memories of self to generate behaviors likely to produce a desirable imagined future (a mental time machine). Human evolution was not driven so much by climatic or ecological change as by the need for different human tribes and subspecies to compete for and defend available ecological nitches. This produced brain systems supporting complex social behavior, abstract reasoning, the use of tools, and verbal communication. It also resulted in what the author calls an \\"evolutionary arms race\\". Read: evolution favored a war-like species capable of forming powerful inter-group attachments and loyalties and deeply rooted hostilities toward outside groups defined by geographic, racial, and cultural (and I would add religious) boundaries. Does this ring a bell as you read the newspaper?However, unless you are a professional evolutionary neurobiologist, be warned. The task of diving for valuable pearls (and they are there) in this book is formidable. There is excessive use of undefined jargon. The organization is poor. Sections headings are uninformative. The badly needed glossary is simply absent.I immediately abandoned any attempt to read the book cover to cover. Fortunately, an Introduction and Overview is provided which summarizes the content of each chapter. It also explaines the author's central theses and allows one to skip directly to the chaptes of most interest. For instance, Chapter 7 elaborates the brain functions distinguishing humans from apes and lower animals, their anatomical correlates, and the pressures driving their evolution.Alas for a good editor! What is \\"folk biology\\" and \\"folk psychology\\"? With luck we will have spotted their parenthetical translations: \\"understanding other species\\" and \\"understanding other people\\". Ponder this sentence: \\"Comparative similarity is particularly divisive, as it provides strong evidence in support of the proposal that the human brain and mind are products of natural selection.\\" The surrounding text doesn't help either, although one gleans that \\"divisive\\" has something to do with nature versus nurture.My suggestion: read the introduction and overview very carefully. Skip around in the book. When something makes sense, highlight it. Take time, leave the book and come back to it. Your efforts will be rewarded.Wayne Phillips"},{"Title":"Origin of Mind: Evolution of Brain, Cognition, and General Intelligence","review":"People often complain that modern psychology is a ragbag of phenomena without a theory to make sense of it all. The Origin of Mind makes that complaint obsolete, because in it David Geary has given us a coherent and satisfying framework for the sciences of mind. It combines an impressive coverage of the latest literature with hard thinking about how to synthesize topics like evolutionary psychology, neural plasticity, human development, and intelligence testing. The Origin of Mind is invaluable both as a reference work and as a road map for the sprawling territory covered by modern psychology and neighboring sciences.-Steven Pinker, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard University; author of How the Mind Works and The Blank SlateHuman nature is one of natural selection's most stunning feats. David Geary takes seriously the implications of this for psychology-that it must be an evolutionary discipline. He sets out the theories with admirable clarity and deals systematically with the wealth of multidisciplinary evidence. This book pioneers a Darwinian synthesis, pulling together the disparate strands that currently criss-cross the study of the human mind. Here lies the future of psychology. So now read on.-Helena Cronin, Professor, The London School of Economic; author of The Ant and the Peacock: Altruism and Sexual Selection from Darwin to Today.In his book, The Origin of Mind: Evolution of Brain, Cognition, and General Intelligence, David Geary shows that he is indeed a scholar for the 21st century, providing a truly interdisciplinary synthesis on a topic of both great theoretical and practical importance: human intelligence. He presents clearly research from neuroscience, behavior genetics, and cognitive science (among others) and integrates them in an evolutionary framework to yield a comprehensive theory of the human mind.

Contraltos, as her friend and colleague Tom Lovell is wont to say in his more sour moods, are liable to find themselves expected to sing a lot of Mahler.Sharing the driving en route to a concert in Liverpool, Maggie hits a patch of slick clay at forty, and the last thing she's aware of is her own voice, lamenting \\"My God, what have I done, I've killed Tom.\\" Even upon awakening in the Royal Hospital in Comerbourne after nearly dying in surgery, and being assured that Tom escaped with only a mild concussion, Maggie is filled with a foreboding shaken loose by the shock of the accident. Her surgeon, a great admirer of her music, persuades her to confide in him, as one artist to another who wishes to keep his work from being wasted. She's haunted by the feeling, too foggy to be quite a memory, that at some time, she failed someone so badly that he died.Her surgeon (meaning to tactfully steer her onto a therapist's couch), suggests, \\"Suppose someone else, someone who makes a job of that kind of thing, took over the stone-turning for you?\\" And Maggie grasps the idea with both hands - and gets him to put her in touch with a good private detective.Enter Francis Killian, a battered Korean War veteran, who mostly takes on impersonal investigations involving lots of paper: research for writers, tracing witnesses, searching records for lost details. Noting that Maggie always speaks of her victim as 'he', Francis begins combing through her past for the great turning points of her life, and looking for any young men she might have associated with before immersing herself completely in her concert career. Her serious study began with Dr. Paul Fredericks; as one of his star pupils, she accompanied some of his twice-yearly European tours ('Freddy's Circus'). And on her last such trip, there was one difference: Bernarda Eliot Felse, rather than Freddy's sister, served as chaperone.Enter Bunty Felse and her husband Inspector George Felse. Bunty had noticed a change in Maggie on the trip, turning her back on everything in life but music. And one troublesome young cellist, Robert 'Robin' Aylwin, walked out on the Circus in Austria - left the hotel, the Goldener Hirsch, and never returned. A hotel in a little town at the exact center of a lot of illegal activity along several borders, including another of George's missing person cases. And George, as a professional stone-turner who *hates* loose ends, suggests a little vacation, to see if Francis flips over the right stone to answer everyone's questions.Did Maggie have anything to do with Robin's fate? Or could he himself have flipped over the wrong rock one summer night, and turned up something deadly?Bunty has a larger role in this volume than in some of the cases set earlier in the Felse marriage. Their son, Dominic 'and his Tossa' are away in Yugoslavia (possibly _The Piper on the Mountain_) and don't enter into the story. Maggie Tressider, the woman with an archangel's voice whose face carries more force than any photograph can convey, dominates the story, however. After her ranks Francis, who's being forced to feel again after so much digging through her emotional history, looking for someone who could have made her feel so guilty. The supporting players are also very well drawn: surgeon Gilbert Rice; Friedl, an otherwise beautiful woman cursed with a harelip, one of the family who runs the hotel; and who can forget the platoons of drunken Austrian wedding guests infesting the hotel late in the story, getting in *everyone's* way as a search is undertaken. :)"},{"Title":"The House of Green Turf","review":"Ellis Peters was a great storyteller, and this book is a fine example of her wonderful work. The story is about a missing cellist from an English traveling orchestra. The cellist has been missing for 13 years, but events happen that bring his story to the forefront. The story is set in the Austrian Alps, and George Felse and his wonderful wife Bunty are there trying to figure out a mystery. This old disappearance seems to be linked to some modern day crimes, and George wants to follow the thread until he uncovers the long-hidden secret. The book is packed with action, and it will keep you guessing until the end. Ms. Peters knew how to pace a plot to keep her readers quickly turning the pages. Her characterizations are also flawless. If you love the Brother Cadfael series like I do, I suggest that you read the George Felse series as well."},{"Title":"The House of Green Turf","review":"This book is written by Ellis Peters aka Edith Pargeter, author of the Brother Cadfael and George Felse series. This book is labelled as a George Felse novel, and after a fashion it is (George and Bunty Felse play minor but pivotal roles), but the main character is none of the Felse clan, but a world-famous opera singer, Maggie Tressrider.Maggie is in a car accident, with a near-death experience in the hospital, which wakens the shadow of a repressed memory. Maggie is convinced she has killed someone, but can remember none of the details. She hires a private investigator, Francis Killian, to determine whom she has killed, and the circumstances around it. In the pursuit of his work for Maggie, Francis meets Bunty Felse, that one-time opera singer who walked away from fame to marry George. Bunty had been a \\"stage mother\\" to Maggie in Maggie's early career, and was able to give Killian information that begins the tumbler process of \\"unlocking\\" of everything that happened to Maggie.My main complaint with this book is that Maggie has a penchant for fainting. Whenever the girl is under stress, she collapses. I am used to the capable Bunty, and the women who appear in the Cadfael Chronicles--all of whom are made of sterner stuff than Maggie. I will, to some degree, forgive this flaw since the book was published in 1969, when fainting was much more \\"in vogue\\" (or at least considered a more reasonable response) than many of the more recently published stories. There is also an ending that strikes me somewhat as a Deus ex machina, but this is less disappointing to me than the fainting.Peters does a good job of suspense and tension as the story progresses, with an insightful commentary on human nature, pride, love and jealousy in the resolution of the story. I am not sorry I bought the book--even a \\"lesser\\" Ellis Peters book is pretty darn satisfying, and better than many other published books out there.In short, if you are an Ellis Peters fan, it's worth reading.

Unfortunately, Smith's trite, painful writing style left it a struggle to finish, and I almost didn't bother.The characters have no depth, and the scenes feel like cheap cardboard cutouts. I'm afraid I have to say save your money and pass on this one- it's an awful lot like an old, predictable melodrama without any sound.Again, the story is fine enough. Clint Williams is a Texas Ranger who changes his name and goes undercover to find the gang that killed his family (and almost killed him) and bring them to justice. His search brings him to Dry Springs and the Last Chance Saloon where he meets Rachel Hammond, the preacher's daughter, and falls head over heels.The book does have its moments- Rachel defending her stagecoach with a gun, Clint and his card games among them. Again, the story was fine, and that's why I finished the book. What wasn't okay was the way it was written. Smith clearly missed the lesson we learned back in eighth grade English- show, don't tell. Dialogue sounds unrealistic, descriptions are flat. I was incredibly, incredibly unimpressed with this book."},{"Title":"Defiant","review":"If you want to curl up with a good western, Bobbi Smith is your gal.

I'd love to see such a visualization on TV. A real western Texas storm. Rachel proved what a tough cookie she is, as she did in the stagecoach attack.Favorite scene with Clint-Revealing himself to Pete and getting the evil sheriff in jail before going after the rest of the gang. This scene is like that of a true western. Awesome!!! :)Together-With their son.What did you like about Rachel-Her obedience towards her parents, even if it put her in dangerous situations. Her strength, especially when she had to fight off a stagecoach attack. Her love for Clint, despite who he pretended to be. Although Rachel seemed like a supporting character in this story that was predominantly Clint's, she made what she had to work with meaty.What didn't you like about Rachel-There wasn't anything I didn't like about Rachel.What did you like about Clint-His love for his family. Despite wanting revenge, he was able to control his rage. If he had killed in cold-blood, he would have been just like the Tucker Gang. His love for Rachel.What didn't you like about Clint-There wasn't anything I didn't like about Clint.If I had to cast Clint, I'd cast Brad Pitt.If I had to cast Rachel, I'd cast Reese Witherspoon.You can read my Clint and Rachel blog at http://romancereadingclub.blogspot.com/"},{"Title":"Mechanics (Advanced Straight Forward English Series)","review":"This is a very good concise book on punctuation.

It has everything a beginner's textbook is asking for. Witty writing, step-by-step explanations, practical examples. By the way you understand what is meant with concepts and theories economists use to explain to us why a certain policy should be pursued or abolished, like the labor theory of value, price controls, minimum wages, and different currency systems. And before you know you understand what is behind the arguments of current policy issues, what are the true and the false arguments, misleading paths, right or wrong theories behind them.The author is not soft on the issues, but uses logical reasoning and explains in every step the possible fallacies. In the end - if one likes it or not - one has to follow his cogent conclusions about the way markets work in a free society and how government intervention affects those outcomes."},{"Title":"An introduction to economic reasoning","review":"AN INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMIC REASONING is probably the first book you want to read if you are planning on studying economics. Although this work is called an introduction to \\"economic reasoning,\\" it is perhaps more accurately considered an introduction to economics as such.This book is quite basic, and could be profitably used by high school students or anyone without a knowledge of economics. It hits many of the basic topics in economics, such as marginal utility, supply and demand, and money. It is from the Austrian perspective, so it could save a high schooler from years of unlearning. The only drawback is that although it contains many useful study questions, it doesn't include the answers (nor is there, from what I can tell, a teacher's guide).Dr. David Gordon is associated with the Ludwig von Mises Institute, the nation's premier free enterprise think tank. The Institute has published another work - ECONOMICS FOR REAL PEOPLE by Gene Callahan - that is more advanced and would make an excellent follow-up work."},{"Title":"An introduction to economic reasoning","review":"This book is a must for anyone that wants to learn about economics in a non intimidating book.

This book will leave you with an understanding that will allow you to make a reasonable economic argument with someone and make sense as oppose to those that think economics in ONLY about \\"supply and demand\\". The reading level of this book is arguably at a junior high level. I wish this was mandatory reading in school. I cannot emphasize enough how useful this book is. You will not regret reading it."},{"Title":"An introduction to economic reasoning","review":"This is a very good book for a high school economics 101 course. This book should be read by every high school student. The ideas are put forth in a very straight foward manner that is almost too easy to understand. If you have any knowledge about ecomomics, do not get this. You will be board with the concepts Gordon goes over."},{"Title":"An introduction to economic reasoning","review":"As the author states in the introduction this book is written from the viewpoint of the Austrian School of economics. More precisely it follows the teachings of Ludwig von Mises. Von Mises based his economic theories on a single axiom: \\"Man acts to achieve an end.\\" From this single axiom he drew all his consequences that led him to the conclusion that free market is not bound to a specific economic system but rooted in the very nature of man.Von Mises himself might have done better, but David Gordon does not succeed in showing what should prevent men from achieving their ends by non-market means like for example enslaving other people. That is at least what people did for thousands of years. But observations like this would not be taken into consideration by Misesian economists: Von Mises based his economic theories entirely on deductive logic and viewed empirical facts as simply irrelevant. The reader should take into account that this book follows a sectarian approach which is rejected as methodically inadequate by mainstream economics as well as by other members of the Austrian School.The autor is well versed in logic and writes a witty prose but he employed his abilities to write a right-wing propaganda pamphlet disguised as textbook. David Gordon makes out numerous enemies: Sociology, progressive schools, Hillary Clinton, trade unions, taxes, the New Deal, Minimum Wages, any kind of state intervention. The state is the villain anyway.In its essence this book presents a cynical viewpoint. We learn for example that \\"the marginal sellers will exit the market\\". But what does it mean if a marginal seller of labor exits the market in a society without welfare system? Thomas Robert Malthus was the last economist that dared to be explicit about this point: \\"Exiting the market\\" means starving to death in this case.David Gordon's promise is that in a completely deregulated marked there will be no unemployment. But will the sellers of labor also be able to make a living from their wages? David Gordon does not bother to answer this point but we can call the founder of the Austrian School to the rescue: Carl Menger stated in his Principles of economics (1871): \\"Experience also informs us that many labor services cannot be exchanged by the laborer even for the most necessary means of subsistence... In Berlin, a seamstress working 15 hours a day cannot earn what she needs for her subsistence. Her income covers food, shelter, and firewood, but even with the most strenuous industry she cannot earn enough for clothing.\\""},{"Title":"When the Whippoorwill-","review":"This collections contains the classics, Gal Young'un and Jacob's Ladder, plus some equally good shorter stories.

This book is a wonderful addition to my collection."},{"Title":"How Real Men Do It","review":"\\"How Real Men Do It,\\" the fourth volume of \\"Leonard and Larry\\" comics from Tim Barela, continues in the same vein as his first three. As their lives continue, Larry Evans and Leonard Goldman face day to day situations like most middle aged marrieds. The kitchen needs remodeling. The grandkids need a bedtime story. The son needs a new apartment. The neighbors are getting nosy. The crucial difference is that Leonard and Larry are a happily committed gay couple in Los Angeles.The typical nature of Barela's storylines is part of the brilliance of all his books. Borrowing liberally from 50's and 60's sitcom humor but remaining stunningly of the day, Leonard and Larry could be the American any-couple next door. They have friends that kvetch over the relatives, fight midlife flab and try to do right by their families. At the same time, they also have to deal with what many gay couples in America go through every day; homophobia, job discrimination and trying to protect their children (be they adopted or from previous marriages) from a world that eyes them with suspicion or hatred. Every so often, a panel with poignancy will leap from the page and strike you, as does the one single strip that mentions 9/11.That is not to say that Barela's terrific sense of humor isn't splashed liberally throughout \\"How Real Men Do It.\\" The travails of soap opera star Merle Oberon and his quest to save his failing TV show, and Larry's obsession with Bruce, the house repairman, are probably the funniest series in \\"How Real Men Do It.\\" Leonard and Larry remaining a refreshing alternative to the twinky obsessed standard gay literary fare. \\"How Real Men Do it\\" shows you who the real men are -- real men have beards and may just be celebrating 50. It makes each of Tim Barela's four books national treasures."},{"Title":"How Real Men Do It","review":"Leonard & Larry is one of the most classic gay comics out there. Absolutely hilarious. They deal with all the current issues we are all dealing with now, as well as some old stereotypical ones that everyone out there thinks we do.Larry and Leonard are a leather couple who had been married before they both came out of the closet. Leonard is Jewish and has to put up with his mother sticking her nose into everything like a typical Jewish mother. Larry's ex-wife loves her ex-husband even more now that he's out of the closet. But Larry has to help raise his sons, only to have one of them turn out gay like himself. There are many lessons to learn, messages to get across, all the while being hilarious."},{"Title":"Feminist Auteurs: Reading Women's Films","review":"The clear prose and succinct ideas make this book perfect for feminist film courses or anyone seeking to hone their critical analysis of film. The book is a must for graduate students taking up women's studies or film studies. Ramanathan's prose is direct and insightful. Because the prose is so clear and accessible, this text ranks essential, right alongside of an important work like Alice Doesn't. I especially like the range of films discussed, specifically such complex films as Watermelon Woman. An entire course could work around this book--I plan to use it when I teach feminist film. I highly recommend it and wish it were required reading in basic film courses so that students might experience an excellent critical lens for regarding women's film."},{"Title":"Feminist Auteurs: Reading Women's Films","review":"I read this book for a class, Women & Film. I don't consider myself an expert- or even proficient- in film terminology, so I found that aspect of the book to be a little confusing. This book is not for the film novice; though, if someone is particularly ambitious, they may be able to decipher it without the help of a professor. If you're up for the challenge, I can guarantee that you will feel as though you've accomplished something if you understand this book. It is a must-read for feminists, as woman's depiction in film seems to be one of the most troublesome aspects of women in the media. The films that Ramanathan chooses to examine are profoundly important to the women's movement and, in particular, the second-wave. If you're more of a film-expert rather than a feminist-scholar, don't let that aspect of the book scare you. Ramanathan interweaves issues of racism, nationality and sexuality throughout the text as well. The book is also divided into sections so the introduction to each chapter gives the reader the knowledge necessary to understand Ramanthan's exploration of each film; it's not really the sort of book that you sit down on the beach and read straight through. Be prepared to search for hard-to-find films once you read about them and are interested in seeing them."},{"Title":"Answering Your Call: A Guide for Living Your Deepest Purpose","review":"&quot;Am I really being called or is it wishful thinking?&quot; &quot;If I am responding to the call, why do I still have times of doubt?&quot; These are among the questions one normally asks when dealing with a call. John P. Schuster masterfully with these and other questions in &quot;Answering Your Call&quot;.The author makes a strong argument that we often don't feel fulfilled in life if we don't know our purpose. The reason we feel we have no purpose is because we continue to miss our callings when they occur. With this as his thesis he works through the process of knowing what a call is, recognizing when you are called to do something, and responding to your call. This is a fresh and insightful look at defining purpose in your life and a recommended read."},{"Title":"Answering Your Call: A Guide for Living Your Deepest Purpose","review":"As a 'twenty-something with a clean slate', trying to balance my potential career choices with my passions and callings, this book was a refreshing reminder of what I need to consider when I am making my next life decisions.

I read it. I bought ten. I gave them to my professional friends. I gave them to my personal friends and to my family. I wondered how John P Schuster knew what had been dancing around in my mind and heart.Schuster has found not just a niche but also a gaping hole in the search for a purpose-filled life. He provides a framework for being true to yourself and for being intentional about your life choices. He provides examples and exercises to help the reader claim the courage and the insight to approach a call as a legitimate opportunity not as a coffee break fantasy.This is a book that is warm and inviting. It is reassuring and yet it gives the reader a kick in the &quot;Yes But&quot; part of his or her response to taking a hard look at how we choose what to do with the time we have ahead.John P Schuster is a gifted thinker and writer. Answering You Call wil not set you on fire but it will put one under you."},{"Title":"Answering Your Call: A Guide for Living Your Deepest Purpose","review":"For far too many of us, the &quot;call&quot; is an unknown, or at best an uncertain, facet of life. As a result, the roads we travel are too often deserted, directionless or uninspiring: one of the tragedies of life. John Schuster's work creates a framework for introspection and self-assessment that helps the reader orient and energize for the journey.This book is particularly helpful to the reader who may be searching for definition of a call, but it just might spark an internal debate even within those who are rock-solid in their vocational and avocational pursuits. Schuster poses questions that get to the essence of who we are and why we are, and therefore whether we are positioned to fully experience life's great joys.Schuster does a wonderful job of weaving anecdotes from other travelers, philosophical views, personal reminiscences, poetry and practical exercises, all of which help the reader to examine his/her own feelings. In a non-presecriptive fashion, Schuster gently exhorts us to take the time to ask, to understand, to feel, the central call questions that are within each of us.This work is appropriate not only to the philosophical reader, but also to the pragmatic, objective-oriented business reader who aspires to know the road being traveled, why he/she is on it, and where it might lead.I encourage seekers to resource this book and I loudly applaud John Schuster in helping us to call for our own answers."},{"Title":"Answering Your Call: A Guide for Living Your Deepest Purpose","review":"In times of moral confusion and national uncertainty, when (as ever) traditional ways of making sense of our purpose are undermined and challenged, we have to look hard to find markers that reassure us we are on a safe path or at least can find our way back to one. John Schuster reminds us we can discern reliable direction, and teaches us to trust the subtle signals that call us to personal meaning and fulfilling action. I like books that provide useful conceptual tools, that propose workable models for thinking about one's personal mission. I'd like every high school and college graduate to confront the ideas suggested in this book. Leave No Child Behind! I'm not big on spiritual self-help manuals, but was glad to find the light touch Schuster uses to introduce serious ideas. We see our purpose and our source of meaning as if through a veil. Schuster helps us work our way across and along the veil, deepening our ability to realize possibilities that are ever-present but seldom seen. I am grateful for his guidance, and commend him to you warmly."},{"Title":"Answering Your Call: A Guide for Living Your Deepest Purpose","review":"As many of us do, in January of this year, I was pondering my resolutions. But this year was different for me in that I wanted to look more long term and take a &quot;strategic&quot; view of my life. &quot;Am I in the right place and time for what I am doing? Should I be doing something different? Am I sabotaging my own goals by just living day to day and not stretching myself to new horizons?&quot;After reading John's book, I didn't have ALL the answers, but I knew that I was asking the right questions. His book gave me ideas for tools that I can and should use for my life planning and a sense of hope that I don't have to live from day to day - but could &quot;re-discover&quot; the passion for life I embraced years ago.

As Schuster explains, \\"...(this book) is intended more for the person whose calling isn't always obvious than for the superstars who have an obvious and visible calling (p. 133).\\" He defines calls and callings, and describes some of the many callings in life. He does not suggest readers live a monk's life, but their own lives with their own callings. He never suggests what callings should be, nor judges the callings that are followed. What Schuster does is provide ideas to help readers thoughtfully determine their own callings, and describes the things that might derail those callings.The stories and examples taken from his own and others' lives are touching and realistic. The memorable bits of wisdom are broken out, highlighted and easily accessible for review. The honesty of the message is refreshing and clear without the cookie cutter approach of self-help books. While this is a relatively easy read (you can almost hear him speaking to you), it should not be read quickly and superficially, but carefully with deep thought. Read a chapter, put it down and reflect on the questions he asks.

She's all too aware of her superiority over him in this wealthy household and she loves to rub it in his face. However, her upper-class boredom leads her to spend time with the servant chatting away and killing time, and she doesn't realize that by interacting with him in such a casual and personal way, she's bringing herself more and more down to his social level. She feels trapped in her idle life of money and privilege, and he feels trapped in his badly paid lowly job. But she envies his freedom. Each has the exact opposite of what the other has, and each wants what the other has. Also, there is one other ingredient--they are both attracted to each other in this conflict between sexual passion and social position. This play was coldly received when it first came out in 1888 for its startling modernity. The antagonistic love-hate relationship it shows between the man and woman is refreshingly modern even today.David Rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"Title":"Miss Julie,: And other plays, (The modern library)","review":"This edition is truly awful. The first page of the book says that it was completely translated and edited by a computer without any human intervention, and it shows. It is riddled with spelling errors, has not been copy edited; the mistakes that were printed are so bad that it is difficult to read the plays. In addition, the actual translation is so bad that important points are lost.In regards to the overall organization, there is no separation between the plays. The first line of the second play immediately follows the last line of the first, with no acknowledgement that they are separate works.This version of the play may be inexpensive, but you will have to spend more money in the end to buy a different (better) edition of the plays."},{"Title":"Miss Julie,: And other plays, (The modern library)","review":"Exactly what I wanted.

However, since others have already so eloquently dealt with that aspect of the book, I thought it might be fun to dwell on the sci-fi aspect of the book in my review.Written in 1887, this novel is full of predictions about the year 2000. Bellamy gets a few things right, and he gets a few things wrong. Things have changed so radically since his day that it's fun to discover what a person from that time thought might come about in our time.While airplanes and international phonecalls might have been foreseen, who could have imagined computers that understand human speech or even the Walkman - something that's pretty mundane by today's standards? And who could have possibly imagined such bizarre musical genres as disco, techno and rap? I suspect an equal number of surprises are in store for our descendants 130 years down the road.Bellamy doesn't foresee any of the above. Nor does he mention automobiles or recorded music, two ideas that must surely have been under development already in his time. Instead, he foresees a time when various styles of music will be available 24 hours a day via telephone, all provided by real-live musicians. A time when all the public sidewalks of Boston will have awnings to keep the rain off those who get caught out in the middle of a rainstorm. And, if his predictions about how government will be run in our time are flat out wrong, the resulting situation isn't so far off. After all, the vast majority of Americans and many others around the globe live like the kings and queens that ruled their ancestors.But if a greater number of people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and many other parts of the world still live without adequate food and shelter, it only shows that we still have our work cut out for us. (More so than ever today, I suppose one might have to say.)Bellamy's prose is surprisingly easy to read considering how long ago it was written. The reader does stumble across odd expressions here and there, but it's less strange than one might guess it would be. And the strangeness of the prose is part of what makes the reading interesting.Also, the fact that Bellamy's predictions are so different from what one might guess at first thought suggests some interesting differences in thinking and culture between people living in the same country 100 years apart.Decades of carefully crafted propoganda have convinced most Americans that big government is anathema while big business grows and grows until today a company like Wal-Mart has a virtual stranglehold on major suppliers of many types of goods. I agree with the indictment of big government, but I think it's the 'big' part that's the most dangerous thing, no matter what the organization.In summary, I agree with many who feel there's still something to be gained from what we learn in this book despite the gross failure of communism and the problems, large and small, that plague socialist programs like Canadian and European national health care.Visionaries in the business world and the sciences are constantly working on new models for improving our life. Paul Hawken tells some of their stories in his book _The Ecology of Commerce: A Declaration of Sustainability_."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"This book takes place in the future, an ideal socialist world in which everyone is treated the same.This book genuinely holds up the idea of socialism to the very last page. Something that absolutely irked me about it is how even this book, written before George Orwell was already forecasting \\"some of us are more equal than others\\".The author begins by describing a young man in the 19th century who sleeps into the future and retains his current state. He there finds a doctor who's bent on mocking his barbaric culture of the past. The doctor describes a \\"utopia\\" in which every man works, no one is exempt from the working force. Sounds fair until you read a bit further....When an author prints a successful book, they are then exempt from service. They are excused from the working class. Even further, when you read about the politics the author deems the working class incapable of electing the President. Only the elite are capable of making that decision, which includes these successful authors. What a nice little utopia the author has dug out for himself.Edward Bellamy wrote this novel in a time of civil unrest, at a time when the classes were fighting amongst easy other. He deemed it very possible that his ideas may be implemented. Personally I think he was being very opportunistic. People of this era were looking for new means a of social class, so Edward handed them something he knew they would see as a fair solution.I think this book, by attempting to uphold socialism really shows why you it always inevitably fails. People are greedy and corrupted, and an all controlling system like this just invites people to take advantage of it.If you read this novel, prepare for a sneering tone and a mockery of typical culture. Rather hypocritical of the author really, he mocks people of wanting to take advantage of situations for their personal gain, yet at the same time, that's precisely what he did with this novel."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"This book is bad. The socialist Utopia taken to new heights, socialist USA. I knew this was a book highlighting the greatness of communal society, it was worse than most because it tries to paint the America of the past with a Marxist brush. It attempts to place liberty into a socialist utopia where, even in this complete work of fiction, it can't live. There is nothing particularly interesting or new here. Stick to the classics if u are amused by the socialist ideology."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Let us start by discussing the characteristics of the modern utopia, which began in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the present. The modern utopia was sometimes isolated by time or by alternate worlds rather than simply by space (such as an island or a mountain top). It also tended to be larger than utopias of the past, sometimes even global in scope. It was no longer treated as a static, unchanging society as much as it was treated like one stage of historical development. It was sometimes (though not always) more high tech than previous utopias. Modern utopias were sometimes (though not always) urban rather than agrarian. Modern utopian writers were more concerned with individual rights and freedoms in utopia, issues which did not bother writers like Plato or Sir Thomas More.There are a great many good modern utopian novels. But I believe that to date there are seven truly great ones. They are Edward Belamy's _Looking Backward_ (1888), William Morris' _News from Nowhere_ (1890), H.G. Wells' _A Modern Utopia_ (1905), Austin Tappin Wright's _Islandia_ (1942), Hermann Hesse's _Magister Ludi_ (1943, trans. 1950), B.F. Skinner's _Walden Two_ (1948), and Ursula K. Le Guin's _The Dispossesed_ (1974). These novels form a collective bar of quality. In evaluating the quality of other utopian novels, I hold them to the standards of these works. Does a utopia, for example, have the intellectual rigor of _Walden Two_? Is its setting as concrete and realistic as that of _Islandia_? Does it have the beauty of _News from Nowhere_? The literary subtlety of _The Dispossesed_?What is it, then, that makes Edward Bellamy's _Looking Backward_ so outstanding? To put it simply, it is the _archtypical_ modern utopian novel. It has most of the characteristics listed above. It inspired hundreds of imitations right after it first appeared-- some in agreement, some in the form of rebuttals. Even as late as the 1970s, writers like Mack Reynolds were writing imitations of Bellamy. It has been satirized and parodied. It inspired a short-lived political movement, the Nationalist Party. (At one time, there were over 150 Nationalist Clubs in America.) Whether you are an enthusiast who hands out copies of utopian novels to your friends or a steely-jawed capitalist who gives one-star reviews to utopian novels, you probably think about _Looking Backward_ when you think about utopias.Bellamy's socialistic utopia has been criticised for being mechanistic and impersonal, and many modern readers would probably argue that consolidated government and business is not necessarily better. A third argument advanced against Bellamy (and indeed against a great many other utopian novels) is that he assumes too readily that rational behavior and happiness will follow from the proper social conditions. Yet Bellamy nevertheless has a point. If we are going to live in a truly great society, we must first meet the basic needs of all of its members. They must receive food, clothing, shelter, education, and job opportunities. Bellamy offers a convincing plan to meet these needs, and his satire of the shortcomings and cruelties of a capitalistic society still stings:I cannot do better than to compare society as it was then [the nineteenth century] to a prodigious coach which the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged toilsomely along a very hilly and sandy road. The driver was hunger, and permitted no lagging, though the pace was necessarily very slow. Despite the difficulty of drawing the coach at all along such a hard road, the top was covered with passengers who never got down, even at the steepest ascents. These seats on top were very breezy and comfortable. Well up out of the dust, their inhabitants could critically discuss the merits of the straining team. (3)Bellamy should also receive some credit for his plot. True, it is thin. But he was the first writer to set a utopia in the future rather than on an island or lost valley, and he was the first to imagine a high-tech utopia on a grand scale. Bellamy is probably not read as much today as he was fifty years ago, but he still deserves attention. Pick up a copy of this novel.Note: There are a number of editions of _Looking Backward_ floating about, but the Broadview edition is especially fine. It is a sturdy, handsomely printed paperback. It has an excellent introduction by Alex MacDonald, a biographical chronology, and a good bibliography. There are a series of appendices of contemporary reviews, commentaries, poems, and excerpts from other utopian writing of the day. It is well worth the few extra dollars that you may spend."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Of all the pictures fun to imagine for the student of socialisms and utopias, American and otherwise, is to visualize a young Aldous Huxley or George Orwell sitting down near their respective public school fire places, during a cold and clammy English afternoon, and reading Looking Backwards. It is very easy for the reader to see Huxley and Orwell, if they did in fact read Bellamy's rather quaint vision of utopia, reflecting to them selves as they wrote their dystopic masterpieces, A Brave New World and 1984, respectively, \\"Alright. But what if...?\\"Just like Huxley's and Orwell's works, Edward Bellamy is reacting to the horrors of his age. Violent confrontations between labor and capital in every corner of the United States were all the rage, and strikes before the age of enforced collective bargaining or binding arbitration were no joke. Imperialist wars in every corner of the world were threatening a world wide war--seemingly every other year. There were rumblings of an international socialist movement that was yearly gaining strength in Europe in spite of serious legal restrictions--while Bellamy was in University in Germany, he would have had a difficult time avoiding knowledge of the imprisonment of SPD leaders August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht as well as the banning of the Party by von Bismarck's government. What most likely struck the most horror into Bellamy, though, was the absolute wretchedness of the slums that so many Americans were trying to survive in, and the inability of anyone to even try to create a way out of it that can not in some way be traced back to self-interest, greed or outright violence.Looking Backward is an attempt to imagine a world where poverty and ignorance are abolished in the sentimental tradition of Charles Dickens--hero of Bellamy and the novel's protagonist Julian West--coupled with a truly novel bureaucratic technocracy. It was at least in part the influence of Bellamy's idealism that Leon Trotsky found most loathsome in American socialism, whether he knew it or not, when he unforgettably called the New York Socialist Party leader, Morris Hillquit \\"the ideal Socialist leader for successful dentists.\\" Marx would likely have written off Bellamy using the language that Julian West uses to describe the Mesmerist, Dr. Pillsbury, who puts him into a one hundred thirteen year catatonic--a mere quack. What both Trotsky and Marx would have grudgingly realized on reading this book is that Bellamy was one of the few people in America in 1887--aside from a handful of socialists, anarchists, and union-syndicalists--who was openly hoping for a day when human beings would leave the realm of necessity and enter the realm of freedom.The world which Julian West enters at the close of the twentieth century, when entreated by Dr. Leete to rouse him self, is a radically altered one. As Rip Van Winkle woke up in the Catskills to find that he no longer owed his allegiance to a King and at first finds that this is a truly bewildering situation, West finds a world even more bewildering to a Boston Brahmin. Complete and total state ownership of all means of production had been achieved during his long sleep, but even more shocking was that the United States was no longer a country suffering from any social ills. Cooperation reigned in the place of the pecuniary interests of individuals. The mentality of dog eat dog, which bred both ridiculous ostentation and indefensible poverty, had simply vanished leaving in its place a world of light labor, high culture, and nearly universal contentment. The state is run by disinterested pensioners--yes, Bellamy believes such a political animal would exist--in such a way as to ensure that the profit motive does not exist, and all that men, and women, truly compete for is glory. All work to the benefit of this cooperative commonwealth to the best of their ability and equality in the most literal terms. This is not Julian West's Boston.What becomes apparent to the reader traveling with Julian in this new world is that in many ways Julian has not left the close of the nineteenth century. Boston at the close of the twentieth century, in spite of the technological revolutions and complete reordering of the state and economy, is very much the same for Julian West. He enjoys the highest of high culture through the intricate wall card telephone system of his acoustically treated room; drinks fine wine and smokes great cigars; at communal kitchens all eat cuisine that only the leisured rich could have afforded a century before. The blessings of civilization are enjoyed by all alike to the point that where, affectively, all have become members of a universally leisured single class. The impoverished and the working classes of America, seemingly, had nothing to lose but their poverty, ignorance, and despair. The truly leisured class had, seemingly, only their haughtiness and arrogance to lose. This is where some of my troubles with Edward Bellamy begin, and where some of his own prejudices become apparent.Bellamy identifies the world in his Boston as having been broken down into truly distinct peoples. As he puts it at the opening of his work, America was organized upon \\"the immemorial division of society into the four classes, or nations, as they may be more fitly called, since the differences between them were far greater than those between any nations nowadays, of the rich and the poor, the educated and the ignorant.\\" The ignorance and poverty that so horrified Bellamy was not the only thing about the poor that seems to have been truly their own seems to have died with them.In a truly disturbing way, any notion of how Boston, and America, changed between 1850 and 1887, escapes Bellamy's consciousness. The \\"labor question\\" has been solved through nationalization and making all people work, in one capacity or other, if they want to have anything other than bread, water and a prison cell. What have happened to the Babel of ethnics, the massive networks of parochial organizations, ethnic clubs and sport organizations that were the wellsprings of life for so many Irish and Irish Americans? There is no evidence in the improved Boston of the late twentieth century of anything other type of respectability than Bourgeoisie Protestant respectability. The people of this appallingly genteel world may very have only the variety of one of their singular stores, which have absolutely no variety in products. The twenty-first century reader is left with the truly weird possibility that Julian West and Dr. Leete, after having exhausted the topic of how much better the present is than the past, will have nothing left to talk about but yachting and literature--what with conflict being abolished.The transplanting of Victorian notions of how the world should be run is nowhere more apparent, and more disturbing for its implications, than when West and Leete speak about what portions of the world are organized on the system that America is organized upon. As Dr. Leete explains to West how international relations work in this era, he states:\\"[T]he great nations of Europe as well as Australia, Mexico and parts of South America, are now organized industrially like the United States, which was the pioneer of the evolution. The peaceful relations of these nations are assured by a loose form of federal union of world-wide extent. An international council regulates the mutual intercourse commerce of the members of the union and their joint policy toward the more backward races, which are gradually being educated up to civilized institutions.\\"The white man's burden and civilizing mission does not go the way of the self-interest in idyllic Boston of the future, and an idealist as deeply committed to social justice as Bellamy could not conceive, even in fiction, of any group outside of the boundaries of western society having achieved the level of sophistication that they could live in a classless society. One has to wonder what the old Confederate states would finally have looked like, and whether old rebels and unionists shook hands across a bloody chasm while educating American blacks up to civilization. Whatever, Bellamy thinks about race in America, and how West would have thought about it--the only black we see in this book is the faithful body servant of West in the nineteenth century, one Sawyer, and nothing of consequence comes out of his mouth--we can easily surmise that his utopia was close to being for whites only.Though Bellamy's idealism reads as totally genuine, Looking Backward has some very vital imagination lacking in it. Bellamy has his cooperative commonwealth based upon the principle that all work which serves the common good is equally important, but Bellamy finds it necessary to have West paling around with Leete, a retired physician. In a world where leisure and not labor is the rule, and where the masses are washed and wholly civilized by the exacting standards of an upper class education lasting until at least the twenty-first year, why was it necessary to have Leete be a someone that would be a portrait bourgeoisie respectability? The laboring intellectual, of astute and subtle brilliance with the gnarled hands of a quarter century of hard labor, is the glorious possibility of this world which Bellamy creates for the reader but never actually realizes. Though slightly saddening, this fact probably made the book more readable to the members of America's upper class, and possibly even more plausible to them.From the vantage of the twenty-first century, Bellamy has an ability to appear hopelessly ridiculous. He could not have known how collectivism would lead to mass murder on a colossal scale in Europe and Asia in the Twentieth century--though he would not have been surprised how much of it was done by men and women who looked on the red flag as their own. Nor could he have foreseen how the \\"backwards races\\" of the world would struggle for their own freedom in the second half the twentieth century, and have several become great powers in their own right by its close. Radio, motion pictures, television, digitized recording devices, the internet, air travel and the hydrogen bomb attached to an intercontinental ballistic missile probably never entered his imagination. He should not, though, be faulted for this. His future was one infinitely brighter than the one the world suffered through, as the nations of the world gorged themselves on the most murderous wars and massacres in mankind's history. For all the novels faults and short comings, it is a profound piece of republican idealism, premised on the very American belief that people coming together can actually change lives."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"If you think that the idea of e-cash was firstly mentioned in Robert Hendrickson's &quot;The Cashless Society&quot;, then you must have not read this book yet.To many novel lovers, this book may not be as attractive as many great masterpieces.

Lacking in plot, this novel is by no means an easy read, but worth reading even if only to say you finished!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Bellamy's year 2000 is a socialist heaven for the army of workers, a land of ease and plenty. Everyone has ageeable work, and the Victorian distortions of relations between men and women have fallen away. All of industry, in fact all of society meshes harmoniously under the benevolent wisdom of the central planners.Back in 1888, it seemed like a good idea. That was before the rise of national-scale communism, and long before its fall in Europe. Somehow, when it finally came, it wasn't as shiny as stories like this made out.It's easy to criticise in retrospect. Perhaps the central fallacy is that human nature will change so that \\"The coarser motives [of dread of want and desire for luxury] ... have been replaced by higher motives unknown to the mere wage-earners of your age.\\" It's not going to happen, and it didn't happen when the experiment was tried.The fact is that communism really does work in specialized environments like some monasteries. It is easy to see the higher motives and dedication, as well as the communal living at work there. That make it tempting to create a causal relationship between personal dedication and communalist practices.The fallacy, of course, is that the higher motives of a monastery have just about nothing to do with the monks' housekeeping arrangments. The household economy serves the devotion, it neither drives it nor is driven by it. Also, a monastery is a relatively simple environment, with a small and homogeneous population, without child rearing or family complexities, and usually with access to the economy and services of the greater world. However successful such an enclave might be, scaling it to a full and heterogeneous society is difficult at best.Still, Bellamy's book preserves a snapshot of his age's thinking. Almost 120 years later, it helps us understand the ideals behind the social experiments that have since been relegated to the \\"dustbin of history\\".//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Looking Backward\\" is considered a classic of its type: Utopian literature, which was popular from the sixteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth. But of course, the vast majority of lives were lived in desperation then, and any escape into a better world was well received. Bellamy was 31 when this book was published. As the narrator, he relates his experience of being put into a hypnotic trance as a sleeping aid in 1887 only to be awakened 113 years later, sound of body and mind just as he was when he went to sleep. But the world has changed to a completely socialistic system. Bellamy goes into interminable explanations of how the new world operates. His characters go into long winded, somewhat repetitive, explanations of all phases of this new order. These tirades become brain numbing in their length and use of archaic words. I believe it would have been much easier to take if he had made his explanations through dialogues instead of monologues. And then his character goes out into the world of 2000 Boston. But, what does he see that's new, different, and exciting? We never find out, because he doesn't tell us. In fact, the only new inventions he describes in the entire book are water fountains whose spray works as airconditioners in buildings, awnings hanging over the entire street to keep out rain, pasteboard credit cards, and music and sermons piped into the home through telephone wires. Too bad he didn't talk with some creative visionaries about what the world might be like in the year 2000, and incorporate some of those concepts in his tale. He says nothing about changes in fashions, transportation, or any other aspect of his new surroundings. And there is a glaring error in his utopian world: He does not take into account human nature. He glosses this over by claiming that the new socialist order was so successful, that all humans immediately fell into step and laziness, jealousy and greed are no more. As if that would happen. There is one thought in the entire book I found illuminating. Paraphrasing here: Credit can be compared with nothing else but the plight of a man building a house with dynamite for mortar. With that, I agree."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"The plot isn't all that original, a man wakes up 100 years in the future to find that things have changed considerably. Much like Rip Van Winkle or The Time Machine, except the narrative is extremely dry and most of the novel is dialogue between the unintentional time traveler and his hosts. It's only 120 pages long, but it took me almost 2 weeks to finish reading it because a couple paragraphs in I would start nodding off. Eventually I found that it was more effective to just skim the book, as I could easily gather the main points hidden in the rambling dialogue.I don't know why Bellamy didn't just scrap the generic plot and offer a socialist manifesto like Karl Marx or Adolf Hitler. Bellamy's ideas are wonderful, but the narrative sucks. His assumptions about 21st century America are way off. For instance, he imagines that America peacefully gives up its ineffecient capitalist ways and seemlessly takes up socialism. Given the impassioned debates about government run health care, it is proposterous to think that all the gun totting red necks in this country would sit idly by as the government took over everything.If you really want to experience a compelling, as well as entertaining socialist society I suggest the smurfs."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Edward Bellamy's \\"Looking Backward 2000-1887\\" remains the most successful and influential utopian novel written by an American writer mainly because the competition consists mostly of dystopian works, from Jack London's \\"The Iron Heel\\" to Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale,\\" or science fiction works like Ursula K. LeGuin's \\"The Dispossessed.\\" Still, I do not mean to give the impression that Bellamy's 1888 novel gets this honor by default. Magazine covers in 1984 were devoted to judging the track record of George Orwell's dystopian classic and I would argue that Bellamy deserves the same sort of consideration now that we have reached the 21st century. I certainly intend to use him to that end in my upcoming Utopian Images class.At the end of the 19th century Bellamy creates a picture of a wonderful future society. Bellamy's protagonist is Julian West, a young aristocratic Bostonian who falls into a deep sleep while under a hypnotic trance in 1887 and ends up waking up in the year 2000 (hence the novel's sub-title). Finding himself a century in the future in the home of Doctor Leete, West is introduced to an amazing society, which is consistently contrasted with the time from which he has come. As much as this is a prediction of a future utopia, it is also a scathing attack on the ills of American life heading into the previous turn of the century. Bellamy's sympathies are clearly with the progressives of that period.\\"Looking Backward\\" does not have a narrative structure per se. Instead West is shown the wonders of Boston in the year 2000, with his hosts explaining the rationale behind the grand civic improvements. For example, he discovers that every body is happy and no one is either rich or poor, all because equality has been achieved. Industry has been nationalized, which has increased efficiency because it has eliminated wasteful competition. This is a world with no need of money, but every citizen has a sort of credit card that allows them to make individual purchases, although everyone has the same montly allowance. In Bellamy's world is so ideal that it does not have any police, a military, any lawyers, or, best of all, any salesmen. Education is so valued that it continues until students reach the age of 21, at which point all citizens enter the work force, where they will stay until the age of 45. Men and women are compensated equally, but there are some distinctions between job on the basis of gender, and pregnancy and motherhood are taken into account.Bellamy was living during the start of the Industrial Revolution, and like Francis Bacon and Tomasso Campanella who wrote during the height of the Age of Reason, he sees science and human ingenuity as being what will solve all of humanity's problems. He does not get into too many details regarding the comforts of modern living in the future, but there are several telling predictions (e.g., something very much like radio). However, it is clear that Bellamy is writing primarily to talk about economics and sociology, especially because he always compares his idealized future with the problems of his own time.Obviously Bellamy's critique of the late 19th century will be of less interest to today's students that his various predictions on the both the future and an ideal world, unless they are specifically studying the American industrial revolution. But the latter two are enough to make \\"Looking Backward\\" deserve to be included in a current curriculum and I am looking foward to how well my students think Bellamy predicted the world in which we now find ourselves living."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Edward Bellamy's &quot;Looking Backward 2000-1887&quot; remains the most successful and influential utopian novel written by an American writer mainly because the competition consists mostly of dystopian works, from Jack London's &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; to Margaret Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale,&quot; or science fiction works like Ursula K. LeGuin's &quot;The Dispossessed.&quot; Still, I do not mean to give the impression that Bellamy's 1888 novel gets this honor by default. Magazine covers in 1984 were devoted to judging the track record of George Orwell's dystopian classic and I would argue that Bellamy deserves the same sort of consideration now that we have reached the 21st century. I certainly intend to use him to that end in my upcoming Utopian Images class.At the end of the 19th century Bellamy creates a picture of a wonderful future society. Bellamy's protagonist is Julian West, a young aristocratic Bostonian who falls into a deep sleep while under a hypnotic trance in 1887 and ends up waking up in the year 2000 (hence the novel's sub-title). Finding himself a century in the future in the home of Doctor Leete, West is introduced to an amazing society, which is consistently contrasted with the time from which he has come. As much as this is a prediction of a future utopia, it is also a scathing attack on the ills of American life heading into the previous turn of the century. Bellamy's sympathies are clearly with the progressives of that period.&quot;Looking Backward&quot; does not have a narrative structure per se. Instead West is shown the wonders of Boston in the year 2000, with his hosts explaining the rationale behind the grand civic improvements. For example, he discovers that every body is happy and no one is either rich or poor, all because equality has been achieved. Industry has been nationalized, which has increased efficiency because it has eliminated wasteful competition. This is a world with no need of money, but every citizen has a sort of credit card that allows them to make individual purchases, although everyone has the same montly allowance. In Bellamy's world is so ideal that it does not have any police, a military, any lawyers, or, best of all, any salesmen. Education is so valued that it continues until students reach the age of 21, at which point all citizens enter the work force, where they will stay until the age of 45. Men and women are compensated equally, but there are some distinctions between job on the basis of gender, and pregnancy and motherhood are taken into account.Bellamy was living during the start of the Industrial Revolution, and like Francis Bacon and Tomasso Campanella who wrote during the height of the Age of Reason, he sees science and human ingenuity as being what will solve all of humanity's problems. He does not get into too many details regarding the comforts of modern living in the future, but there are several telling predictions (e.g., something very much like radio). However, it is clear that Bellamy is writing primarily to talk about economics and sociology, especially because he always compares his idealized future with the problems of his own time.Obviously Bellamy's critique of the late 19th century will be of less interest to today's students that his various predictions on the both the future and an ideal world, unless they are specifically studying the American industrial revolution. But the latter two are enough to make &quot;Looking Backward&quot; deserve to be included in a current curriculum and I am looking foward to how well my students think Bellamy predicted the world in which we now find ourselves living. This particular edition, while not a Norton Critical Edition, does have a nice selection of additional readings in the back consisting of some of Bellamy's other writings as well as contemporary works by writers of other utopias and social commentaries such as William Morris, Charlotte Perkins, Henry Lloyd George, and William Dean Howells. All of these appendices provide a context for Bellamy's novel in terms of late 19th-century utopianism."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward, is a vision of a utopian Boston of the year 2000 seen in the eyes of the fictional, nineteenth century Bostonian, Julian West. Having fallen asleep for 113 years Mr. West is awakened by the Leetes family. Over the course of the next several days he discovers a multitude of changes that have occurred during his long slumber. Most importantly or most overarchingly is the idea of social change that has occurred. While many other authors' ideas of the future have involved images of great technological change, they have not demonstrated an adaptation of human behavioral change. In Bellamy's eyes however, there are some technological innovations but the primary changes occur in the areas of economics that leads to dramatic changes in the human condition. It seems to be a world in which, once everyone decided not to fight over money any longer, then people were capable of getting along. Public service and public caring for one another is the norm. In the USA of Bellamy's 2000, the government is a centralized state with the military as the primary employer. Bellamy refers to it as a corporate state and the industrialized army. In his world military and service go hand in hand. In his exploration Bellamy addresses many issues that would be of concern to not only his readers but to readers to this day. Obviously there is the economic foundation of both the nineteenth and the imaginary twentieth century of the book. This leads directly to the issues of labor. Issues of international economics, law and prison all come up in West's exploration of his newly discovered world. Again each of these issues is ultimately related and hence resolved through economics. Women's equality remains an unresolved although tremendously improved issue (an understatement). Women's issues are in some ways resolved because they are no longer the unpaid domestics that they were in Bellamy's day. There is less need for lawyers and understanding the law because things have been resolved with economics so that people are fighting over civil issues and since everyone has they same economic status then there is no need to steal. There is a great sense in Bellamy's writing that social Darwinism plays a significant role. Clearly there is an idea of eugenics (reminiscent of the Oneida community) where the bad parts of society are simply bread out of society. &quot;Like the social Darwinists of his day, Bellamy viewed character traits as inborn and believed that the morally as well as the physically unfit must be weeded out if human beings were to evolve to a higher state.&quot; (Strauss, 76) What must be addressed about this particular work is the influence that it exhibited on other writers in Bellamy's day and after. &quot;It influenced movements of Christian socialism wherever they appeared it positions echo and re-echo on George Bernard Shaw, Veblen, Debs, Norman Thomas and the early Zionists.&quot; (Halewood, 451) Although the book is missing from today's list of important contributions to American thought, the book's enormous popularity at the end of the previous century must be acknowledged. &quot;Looking Backward was possibly the most popular utopian novel ever written, igniting a nationwide social reform movement and leaving an enduring mark upon the rising generation of American intellectuals and writers.&quot; (McClay, 264) The problems that it raises for us, as readers near the end of the twentieth century, are in areas of middle-class elitism, overt ideology, and the lack of demonstrative communal activity. This book is, however, a powerful example of a novel that moved from text to social reform movement. It has been said that the book is not a well-written piece of literature but that the significance of the text is in its effect on the society in which it was consumed. A utopian vision of a future world does two very important functions. One, it shows a more perfect vision of a happy world. But inherently in that vision is the need to discuss or point out all of the elements of the current world that make for an unhappy world. This book had profound influence not so much in the literary world, although numerous other utopian texts were produced in the years following its publication. With Bellamy we find a book that influenced nationalism throughout the United States and lead to socialistic reforms in policy in the early part of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"I really wasn't expecting much out of this book. I'm not a socialist or a communist, so I figured I'd be sneering at much of what Bellamy had to say. Imagine my surprise when I found myself genuinely attracted to the book. Bellamy wrote a socialist tract in the form of a novel. He gets his points across and weaves in a romance tale along the way. I should say that the ending was no surprise to me, as I kind of figured out what was going to happen along the way.The book begins with our hero, Julian West, who is a quite successful gent in 1888 Boston. West is quite the dandy, and is engaged to be married to a lovely young lady. West has trouble sleeping, so he regularly employs the services of a &quot;mesmerizer&quot; to help him sleep. The problem with this is that someone must be around to wake him up or the mesmerizing process might cause a long slumber. You can guess what happens. West is discovered in 2000 in a world that is a far cry from the world of the late 19th century. The world has changed in a radical way, and the family that finds West, the Leetes, want to know all about his old world.The new world is a socialist/communist utopia in which the old problems of unemployment, war, inequality and the like have been solved forever. The rest of the book is a discussion between West and Dr. Leete about the new world and how it contrasts to the old world. In this one has to be fairly impressed with Bellamy's predictions. Bellamy predicted credit cards and even interactive music that can be piped into a person's room.A romance between West and Dr. Leete's daughter Edith eventually blooms, but I won't spoil the surprise this entails. The romance theme was put in to make the socialist text more palatable for the 19th century reader. It could conceivably do the same for the modern reader, although if you're reading this book you are probably reading it for its political value.I certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in utopian works, or 19th century political views. What is really neat is while you read this book you can easily find yourself believing that this could work, until you remember something that Bellamy never knew about. The utter failure of the Soviet Union, and Communism in general. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. The fact that it was published in 1888, is mind blowing. It is still very much relevant to today's society. There are ton of great ideas that really make the reader think about. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is open minded to new ideas, a forward looking thinker, and/or interested in the structure of society. This is easily one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"The first thing that stands out from Edward Bellamy's 1887 socialist utopian novella \\"Looking Backward\\" is that this is NOT a good book. What it is instead is one of those literary fads that temporarily grip the nation but lack any real staying power beyond some historical significance or maybe as part of a class on the history of popular fiction, American intellectual thought, or progressive politics in the USA. Of course, a lot of great fiction was written in order to make social or political point: \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" \\"Catch-22,\\" and \\"The Awakening\\" all come to mind. But what makes these works succeed is the fact that the message seems secondary to a powerful, moving, or darkly humorous story. \\"Pecado de Omisi&oacute;n\\" by Ana Mar&iacute;a Matute, for example, hides strong criticism of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in what appears to be a surrealist tale of a shepherd and his tyrannical cousin. Overall, I got the impression that \\"Looking Backward\\" was the result of Bellamy's awareness that most people are not going to read an economic treatise.\\"Looking Backward\\" is just that: a treatise thinly disguised as science fiction. On the one hand, in the information-driven society of the *real* twenty-first century it's certainly not unreasonable for any random citizen to be able to offer an adequate explanation on what makes our society tick. Yet Dr. Leete, a physician, rambles on and on about the minute workings of the government and economy for six uninterrupted pages. The \\"plot\\" itself is as dry as his lectures. For one, the world of 2000 is never fully realized beyond a platform for Bellamy to espouse his economic theories. (Some of which are astonishing in their hypocrisy. In order to eliminate corruption, for example, he imagines voting restricted to only a few \\"honorary members\\" of society.) Bellamy provides no description of the Boston of the future except that it's apparently very grand, splendid, clean, and orderly. There is simply no feeling of SETTING: the feelings and images evoked by descriptive prose. The characters, meanwhile, are as flat as the pages, exhibiting no unique personality, no true emotion, no life as anything other than cardboard props to people a plot.So needless to say, learning of the book's extraordinary popularity was rather surprising. Not only because Bellamy just couldn't write, but the message as well. Quite frankly, I found Bellamy's vision of the future extremely disturbing. A quote at the end of the book sums it up: \\"Some time after this it was that I recall a glimpse of myself . . . looking at a military parade. A regiment was passing. . . Here at last were order and reason, an exhibition of what intelligent co&ouml;peration can accomplish. The people who stood looking on with kindling faces, - could it be that the sight had for them no more than but a spectacular interest? Could they fail to see that it was their perfect concert of action, their organization under one control, which made these men the tremendous engine they were, able to vanquish a mob ten times as numerous? Seeing this so plainly, could they fail to comprehend the scientific manner in which the nation went to war with the unscientific manner in which it went to work?\\" In other words, Bellamy's ideal society is essentially one big military organization.In the Year 2000, the state supplies everything, down to the awnings that automatically come down to cover the sidewalks during rain. In other words, there is no conflict: no reason to exercise emotional strength, no learning experience, no reason to take initiative or be innovative, and absolutely nothing to inspire art or literature. How can you compose a compelling story when everyone is satisfied and happy? Everything is regimented, everything falls into place. \\"You're just another brick in the wall,\\" so to speak. The superficiality of the Leete family characters was not merely the result of poor writing, I feel, but the lack of room in their society for individuality. (What if you WANTED to walk in the rain?) But even in Bellamy's own time, people expressed unease with his vision. There were several unauthorized dystopic sequels to \\"Looking Backward\\" that were published shortly afterwards. Several deal with revolution and an overblown socialist bureaucracy on the brink of collapse; in another, Julian West's warnings about the threat of Chinese military invasion are ignored by a populace unable to think for itself and dissent from official state opinion.In the end, \\"Looking Backward\\" is fascinating from anthropological and historical perspective. It was intriguing to see how visions of an ideal world have changed and what is Utopia to one era is Dystopia to another. (Definitely check out the Thomas More story that inspired the entire genre.) But as actual literature, \\"Looking Backward\\" is epic fail."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Julian West is put to sleep by a mesmerizer (a quack) in 1887 and wakes up again in the year 2000. He encounters a Dr. Leete who explains to him in great detail how the world has changed - mainly how it has been transformed into a magnificent socialistic Utopia where everyone is the same. There is no war, no competition, and everyone lives in peace and harmony. Bellamy was a true believer in Marx and his theories and he wrote this book as a pleasing presentation of Socialism and, to him, its saving graces. When the government controlled everything and everyone, he believed everyone would be treated the same and there would be no class/economic differences and struggles. It's kind of laughable, in a way, because it depicts people in a way that seems contrary to human behavior. Bellamy also didn't have the benefit of the 20th century and the horrors inflicted by Stalin, Mao and others in the name of Marx to temper his overly optimistic views. It's a classic, though, of Utopian literature; one might even imagine it the last of its kind, but Utopia will always beckon a fevered imagination that sees great unhappiness in the world."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Written during the era of the worst excesses of the \\"gilded age\\" and some of America's worst early labor upheavals including the Great Strike of 1877 and Haymarket and just prior to the Pullman and Homestead strikes. Looking Backward is an expression of Bellamy's faith that the industrial age and industrial cities could be made to work for all, not just the few. The book, a top seller of its time, above all shows that our ancestors believed they could reach the future without perishing."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Our high school read this book for our Summer Reading Program. Most students and faculty agreed that the book raised excellent questions for discussion, but the dry, flat style of the writing made it very difficult to read. After falling asleep several times trying to read this at night, I finally forced myself to read it early in the morning. Bellamy spends much of the novel explaining how this socialist utopia functions, providing detailed analysis of the economy, government, education, and other institutions. I would recommend this book to readers interested in discussing political issues, but not for readers who need a strong plot or dynamic characters."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Having never really heard of this novel or its author before, I was rather surprised to discover how immensely popular it was at the end of the nineteenth century. Edward Bellamy does an excellent albeit sometimes pedantic job of communicating his socioeconomic views and provides an interesting and informative read, despite the fact that the utopia of his fictional creation is a socialist nightmare in the realm of my own personal philosophy. It is very important to understand the time in which Bellamy was writing, especially for a conservative-minded thinker such as myself who holds many of Bellamy's views as anathema. It was the mid-1880s, a time of great social unrest; vast strikes by labor unions, clashes between workers and managers, a debilitating economic depression. Bellamy, to his credit, in no way comes off as holier than thou; his wealthy protagonist recognizes his own responsibility in seeing the world in the eyes of the more prosperous classes, basically ignoring the plights of the poor and downtrodden, having inherited rather than earned the money he is privileged to enjoy, etc. This makes the character's observations and conclusions very impactful upon the reader.While I do respect Bellamy's views and understand the context in which they germinated, I cannot help but describe his future utopia as nothing less than nave, socialistic, unworkable, and destructive of the individual spirit. Indeed, it sounds to me like vintage Soviet communism, at least in its ideals. Bellamy is a Marxist with blinders on. I should describe the actual novel at this point. The protagonist, an insomniac having employed a mesmerist to help him sleep through the night, finds himself waking up not the following morning in 1887 but in a completely changed world in 2000. His bed chamber was a subterranean fortress of sorts which only he, his servant, and the mesmerist (who left the city that same night) even knew about, and apparently his home proper burned down on that fateful night and thus his servant was clearly unable to bring him out of his trance the following morning. It is only by accident that Dr. Leekes of twentieth-century Boston discovers the unknown tomb and helps resuscitate its remarkable inhabitant. 20th-century life is wholly unlike anything the protagonist has ever known, and the book basically consists of a number of instruction sessions by the Leekes as to how society has been virtually perfected over the preceding 100 years. There is no more war, crime, unhappiness, discrimination, etc. There are no such things as wages or prices, even. All men and women are paid the same by virtue of their being human beings; while money does not exist, everyone has everything they possibly need easily available to them for purchase with special credit cards. Every part of the economy is controlled by the national government, and it is through cooperation of the brotherhood of men that production has exceeded many times over that of privately controlled industries fighting a war against each other in the name of capitalism.Bellamy's future utopia is most open to question in terms of the means by which individualism is supposedly strengthened rather than smothered, how a complex but seemingly set of incentives supposedly keep each worker happy and productive, how invention or improvement of anything is possible in such a world, and how this great society does not in fact become a mirror of Khrushchev's Russian state. Such a society consisting of an \\"industrial army\\" and controlled in the minutest of terms by a central national authority simply sounds like Communism to my ears and is equally as unsustainable. Of course, Bellamy wrote this novel many years before the first corruptions of Marx's dangerous dreams were made a reality on earth. As I said, I disagree with just about everything Bellamy praises, and I think almost anyone would agree his utopia is an impossibility, but I greatly respect the man for his bold, humanitarian vision and applaud his efforts to make the world a better place. In fact, many groups organized themselves along the lines of the world Bellamy envisioned, so the novel's influence on contemporary popular thought is beyond question. Looking Backward remains a fascinating read in our own time.I should make clear that the novel is not completely a dry recitation of socioeconomic arguments and moralistic treatises. Bellamy makes the story of this most unusual of time travelers a most enjoyable one, bringing in an unusual type of old-fashioned romance to supply the beating heart of a novel that had the potential to become overly analytical and thus rather boring reading otherwise. He also managed to grab me by the scruff of the neck and shake me around a couple of times with his concluding chapter, quite shocking me with a couple of unexpected plot twists. This great humanist of the late nineteenth century can teach us all something about what it means to be truly human, although I fear that his socioeconomic theories are themselves far too romanticized to have much practical relevance in the lives of modern men and women."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Having been forced to read &quot;Looking Backward&quot; by Edward Bellamy, for a American History class, I can safely say that there are some parts that are interesting, but most of the novel is about as mind numbing as watching paint dry!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"I happened across this book while reading &#34;the politically incorrect guide to the 60's&#34;.It was noted as a utopian fantasy where the government solves all problems, spreads the wealth around, and all corporations and capitalists are evil.Classic Marxism and typical liberal fantasy!"},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Oh how lovely.

As I read it, I struggled to remember that this was written from the point of view of a man who really HADN'T time-traveled to the current day! In the last 30 pages or so, I was met by a big shocker---but then it all turned out alright! Great story full of love, compassion, hope, and some really great ideas.A few points that really stood out to me:In Mr. West's day, menial jobs were held in contempt. The \\"higher class\\" imposed even more contempt on those in menial jobs by looking down on them for holding those jobs. They \\"permitted people to do things for which (they) despised them for doing.\\" Wow...what a huge eye-opener. How sad that Bellamy had hope for our generation to finally have changed that.In the future that Mr. West travels to, library books are accessible to all patrons without having to go through any red tape!In the future, most criminal \\"trials are few, for in most cases the guilty man pleads guilty. When he makes a false plea and is clearly proved guilty, his penalty is doubled.\\" Wow---imagine how society would benefit from that law!Mr. West is shocked to know that in the society of the future, people marry purely for love!One thing I really appreciate about Bellamy's hopeful point of view is that America is still a nation under God.

Moreover, Bellamay wasn't alive during these times. ANd nowhere in this book were those who disagreed eliminated - it claims that popular thought evolved to this vision.What I remember most from this view wasn't that I agreed with its ideal society but a feeling of sweetness from its faith in the ultimate goodness of humanity and a willingness not to turn its head from the worst problems of our times or admit defeat to them."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"The utopia envisioned by Bellamy is so outrageous that I cannot help but to think that this was a satire.

Did he really believe that we would want to live in a society in which a man couldn't sell a five-dollar item to his neighbor without going to the federal government for approval?

In a way he was right. Like \\"Moby Dick\\", the book is much more interesting to have read than to read.The author's purpose was to describe what he thought was the ideal society. Since in 1887 he was living in a society which had resolved seemingly intractable problems like slavery, it seemed to him that a future society might also have solved problems that seemed intractable to his contemporaries.In his imagined society, there is no conflict. Everyone chooses a job, and in return is assured of the necessities of life.Perhaps the best way of describing the defects of the book is to note that the author argues that authors should not be part of this system, but should still be capitalists: in other words the socialism he advocates is for OTHER people. This is an easy pattern to recognise: left-wing politicians today send their own children to private schools, but insist that the public schools are perfect for other people's children.

This book contains a lot of the naivity of the Socialist/Marxist intelligentsia of that era. Human nature, alas, is still much too flawed for that. But politics aside, this is an enjoyable, well written novel. Bellamy is obviously preaching but it does not detract from the story. Julian West is a sympathetic character in spite his aristocratic origin. It should also be stated that some of the predictions of the book like credit cards and malls have come to pass.

In fact, she was in love with him before she ever met him.One chapter at the end of the novella actually does have human emotion and colorful images -- just one chapter out of dozens.As a prediction of future material progress: failed. Bellamy posits that countries all over the world will introduce radical social reorganizations leading to unbelievable economic progress. But the actual progress shown is paltry: four channels of live music delivered over telephone lines; roll-out awnings for city days. No improvements in transportation. Very little in communication. No new fabrics, no new foods.Dr. Leete does mention, in an aside, that healthy humans in the year 2000 usually live to 85-90 years; and the longer lifespan does figure into his economic plan. In 1900, the average lifespan of people in developed countries was 40-50 years. Even for healthy adults age 60, life expectancy in the US has roughly doubled from 1887 to 2000. So that prediction of increased lifespan and improved health is actually a radical prediction on Bellamy's part. Credit for that. But it's just one thing.In contrast to the lack of material progress, humans have changed their nature more in 100 years of Bellamy's world than in thousands of years of history before it. No more war: no country has an army. They just decided that not having armies would be better for everybody. Similarly, no more corruption. No more greed. No drug addicts, no alcoholics. (They were plentiful in 1887 -- what happened?). No featherbedding. New Bellamy Man just doesn't do these things.Last, on the political economy. Bellamy posits a socialist state -- there's one owner, and most workers work for the single benevolent owner. Except for writers. And magazine editors. And preachers. There's an escape valve in his single-owner socialism: any group of people can hire one of their fellows by agreeing to pay his ration costs out of their own, thus releasing him from the industrial army. But only for certain professions, such as Bellamy's own."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"In sharp contrast to the raving, misanthopic Capitalist who gave this excellent book one star, Bellamy laid out his vision for a humanistic society... one which was natural and beneficial to humankind, rather than one which takes advantage of the poor, weak, or less talented. It is sad that Bellamy's vision for the 20th century only saw some chance of coming true with the New Deal and some of the social movements of the 1960s. Today, when crony coporate capitalism, fundamentalist religion, and evil seekers of oil, money and power rule the mindset of this once hopeful country (USA), the chance for humanism is slim indeed. If only the likes of those misanthropic capitalists who mock and distort Bellamy were to dissapear, we'd have a much healthier planet.And by the way, what we saw in the former USSR or in China today is NOT what Bellamy had in mind; but itself a misantropic, power-based dictatorship-based government which was/is just as unhumanistic as the U.S. is now."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"An interesting read for dystopina literature.

Both cousins were self-proclaimed socialists and members of the \\"Nationalism\\" movement and its socialist auxiliary group, whose members touted Military Socialism and wanted the federal government to nationalize most of the American economy. They saw government schools as a means to their socialist \\"Nationalism.\\" Francis wrote the Pledge of Allegiance to promote socialism in the most socialistic institution -government schools.The early Pledge of Allegiance used a straight arm salute, not the modern hand over the heart. The Pledge was the origin of the stiff-arm salute that was adopted later by the National Socialist German Workers Party. Edward Bellamy's book was an international bestseller that launched the nationalism movement worldwide. Edward's book was translated into every major language, including German. They wanted government to take over all schools and impose robotic chanting to flags. The Pledge's early right-arm salute was not an ancient Roman salute, and the 'ancient Roman salute' myth came from the Pledge. In addition to the notorious salute, American socialists (e.g. Edward Bellamy and Francis Bellamy teamed with the Theosophical Society and Freemasons) also bear some blame for the notorious symbol usd by the National Socialist German Workers Party. The same symbol was used by the Theosophical Society during the time when the Bellamys, Freemasons and the Theosophical Society worked together. They also helped spread the stiff arm salute via the Pledge at their meetings.The symbol was used as alphabetical symbolism for socialism, and adopted later by German socialists as their flag symbol. Although an ancient symbol, was altered for use as overlapping S-letters for 'socialism.' It was deliberately turned 45 degrees counter clockwise and always oriented in the S-direction. Similar alphabetic symbolism is still visible as Volkswagen logos. People were persecuted for refusing to perform robotic chanting to the national flag at the same time in the USA and Germany (to the American flag, and to the German symbol flag). All of the above are modern discoveries by America's leading authority on the Pledge of Allegiance, the author of \\"Pledge of Allegiance Secrets.\\"Francis Bellamy lived long enough to see the Pledge's salute and a similar philosophy espoused by the National Socialist German Workers Party. The ominous parallels in Edward Bellamy's book are terrifying.Edward Bellamy's \\"Looking Backward\\" is about a man who sleeps from 1887 until the year 2000. The United States has become one giant socialist monopoly. The book openly portrays men treated as military draftees, from the age of twenty-one until the age of forty-five, in the USA's \\"industrial army.\\" Bellamy's glorification of the military includes government assignment of all jobs. Everyone is issued ration cards which are used to draw goods from government storehouses. Everyone is permitted only the same amount in value annually.Of course, all of the preceding is portrayed as a dandy utopia just as it was portrayed by so many apologists for the military socialist complex of that led to the socialist wholecost (of which the Holocaust was a part): the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics killed 60 million killed; the People's Republic of China, 50 million; the National Socialist German Workers' Party, 20 million. There were millions more elsewhere.Did Bellamy foresee soviet-style rationing, or did he inspire it?Bellamy's is the same socialist naivete that resulted in 7 million persons who perished from 1932-33 in the famine that resulted in Europe's \\"breadbasket\\" after the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics imposed collectivist land management in the Ukraine. By the spring of 1933, an estimated 25,000 people died every day in the Ukraine. It is the same socialist naivete that resulted in 27 million people starving to death in 1958 in the so-called \\"Great Leap Forward\\" in China.

As my professor lectured us to the smallest detail and never asked questions, I didnt bother reading it. My prof made this out to be a shining blueprint of how we should live. Finally broke down and read it myself recently. Im glad my teacher didnt have his way!Julian West is a well to do Bostonite who goes into a deep trance induced sleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. Dr. Leete, the man who revived him, and his family become Mr. West's host and guide. Shortly after West went to bed, the United States government took over the entire enconomy and brought Heaven on Earth.I really cant bring myself to be to harsh to Mr. Bellamy's socialist leanings. He did write this novel a full 30 years before the first workers' paradise started terrorizing its citizens and neighbors. Actually, Mr. Bellamy should be commended. He does a great job at picking out the major woes of his time and gives a brief but surprisingly comprehensive look at one of the two logical alternate solutions we could have taken. Of course we took the alternate route. That being to legally discourage monopolies and set up a minimal social safety net while still allowing for private property ownership and economic competition. Thank God we went this way!\\"Looking Backward\\" also gives us an interesting look into the socialist mind. Nationalizing the economy and abolishing private property ownership solves every woe in this alternate universe from starvation to diaper rash. You also often see the near religious ferver of a dyed in the wool socialist in West's conversations with Dr. Leete which often go something like this:West: Goodness, this is some fine strawberry jam!Leete: Well of course it is! Our jam makers are fully educated with the equivalent of a bachelor's degree from your awful, evil and backward times. What do you expect?As others have noted, this society is completely unworkable. While reading this book, I tried to figure out how I would operate in Bellamy's world. Personally, I would get a low stress job and work just enough to get by. Why do more? You get paid the exact same amount as everyone else and can live in a mansion if you want! I know what Bellamy would say. Im just a cretin from an unenlightened alternate universe. Everyone in his world strives for their best out of their undying love for their fellow man. Yeah, whatever. Heres another gem I note nobody has picked up on. North America, Europe and Australia subscribe to this socialist model but not the rest of the world. Its safe to assume they follow Bellamy's US model of having no armed forces or legal power to wage war. So whats to stop nations not on this little love fest from moving in and taking over?

He finds that Boston and even the whole world have been transformed to a great utopian society. A man by the name of Doctor Leete along with his wife (Mrs. Leete) and daughter (Edith Leete) take care of West in adjusting him to life in the year 2000.The story itself turns out to be more of a distraction to the main point of the book, which is to explain the economic and social workings of the utopia found in 2000. Everybody is now paid equally for their work and no work is considered menial. Rather than working for individual companies, everybody works in what the author calls the &quot;Industrial Army.&quot;To keep everybody contented with their lot, measures are taken. For example, everybody wakes up every day to some music that rouses them to feel great about the greater cause they work for. The city streets are clean and there is no crime. Things like this make the book, for me at least, entirely creepy.Unfortunately, the status of women in the book is not a whole lot better than it was in the 1880's. Women still leave the room when men begin talking politics. In addition, people have a tendency to talk in the book like they did, apparently, in the 1880's: with a disposition towards long-winded speech. As a result, the book has a tendency to drag on at times.Since the book was written in the late 1800's, it is understandable that the author has no history of socialism to look back on, much less the failed experiment called the Soviet Union. Despite that, it is enlightening to see the goal of Socialist thinking play out in the story of &quot;Looking Backward.&quot;The introduction in the Penguin Classics version is well done and gives the reader a good background before reading the book."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Ok, i got this book as a gift. I had never heard of Bellamy and was worried that I would not like this book at all. But my apprehensions were soon soothed by the most interesting background story written by the editor Laura Bonds. The prologue she wrote about Bellamy sparked my interest and,honestly, I could not put the book down.The book is about a boy who goes to sleep and wakes up in the year 2000 (113 years later). The boy intellectually struggles with the facts of his old world and this new world utopia he has awoken in.The fictional utopia created by Bellamy birthed several utopia movements in America.I would recommend it to my friends."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Edward Bellamy's vision of the year 2000 from the author's vantage of 1887 was wrong on the big things, but right on many smaller things. The Utopian communistic society never came to pass in America, but other things did. A previous reviewer mentioned the foreshadowing of e-commerce, but I would add cable broadcasting and the superstore, i.e. Wal-mart. Bellamy had a New Englander's hatred of waste and the book was his attempt to answer that very American question, &quot;How can we do this better?&quot;All in all, a hopeful and challenging book. It makes you ponder conditions in the real year 2000 and the possibilities a hundred years hence. If you liked H.G.

Many of the ideas are clever, and there are a few that I had never heard before, some that actually have the illusion of being plausible, until I give myself a reality check. I don't blame Bellamy for not knowing what would happen with many of his socialistic ideas, I blame him for not thinking. Complaints: 1: Apparently the improvement of working standards have eliminated all hate and crime. What!? 2: With equal reward for work in every job (except in the case authors), people are expected to be more motivated for honor's sake. That sure has worked well in the past. (rolls eyes). 3: The characters are nothing but vessels to transmit Bellamy's ideas. The main character awakens after a century long sleep with everyone he ever knew or cared about dead, and after a moment of shock, says 'hey, let's go find out how the new social system works, and spends the rest of the book doing just that. I realize that this was probably the most effective way Bellamy could find to convey his ideas, but if utopian novel were presented in this format today, regardless of the ideas put forth, I think it would be called a piece of trash. Out of respect for history and some of the good ideas in this book I will give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"I originally read this book while taking a course that examined the evolution of Science Fiction. To appreciate this book you have to understand a few things before reading it. First Bellamy is using this book to advocate this novel system of social organization call it Socialism meets market economics, which is actually an interesting system. At the time the book was written it was a sensation and many groups were formed with the aim of bringing about the same Utopian social system described in the book.Second when trying to predict what life will be like 100 years in the future, your gonna get some stuff wrong. Some other reviewers seem put off by this (I don't see anyone slamming Clarke for getting 2001 wrong though) but I think it is more interesting to see how many things he got right.Third, this is no action novel. The story is set entirely in Boston and there are no legions of attacking androids or well anything that is terribly exciting. So if Stainless Steel Rat is a staple of your literary consumption you may want to stay away. Then again you might not, the maxim that states that to know where you're going you have to know where you've been holds true for the genre of SF and Looking Backward is a formative part of that past."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"The main reason why I bought this book, was the optimistic tone on the cover. It's quite hard to discover books like that and when I come across one, it's mine in a second. As far as this is concerned, 'Looking backward' certainly met my expectations. It has faith in human nature and is quite optimistic about the future. The author has put great efford into figuring out a society that could maybe work if we put our minds to it. I cannot help but compare it to Huxleys 'Island'. A significant thought in that book was that people can't be happy before some basic living conditions are fulfilled. While Huxley focuses mainly on the total pursue of happiness after these basic problems are dealt with, Bellamy tries to work out a way to bring bread on the table for everybody. To me, this is the most valuable feature of 'Looking backward'. The system he describes however, seems to me somehow unatainable, unless human nature changes greatly over the years. Bellamy made the common mistake : He forgot about people. The people he describes in 2000 are aliens to me. Surely people cannot live in a ready-made society, where everything is taken care of for them. They need their goals in life and the freedom to choose their own path towards these goals. Where can teenagers who just want to travel around a bit after finishing school go to in Bellamy's utopia ? According to his presentation, they go into jail. Needless to say I can't agree with this at all. Moreover, people could never be as unselfish and pure as Bellamy describes them. In theory, this is a beautiful system, put real human beings into it and it falls apart. Why is it that most 'dreamers' can't accept the ways of human nature ? It's perfectly allright for people to be a bit selfish, confused, slobby, and so on... . Why not create an utopia that is really adjusted to US, instead of to something we will/can never be ? This I found very disappointing. Nevertheless I give this book a quote of 3 stars for making a really good try for a description of Utopia and offering people the insight that our main goal should not be saving ourselves, but saving everybody. This insight could be the start of something wonderfull... ."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"The book is very interesting on his perspective of how 2000 would turn out, however, it is mostly a conversation making it a little hard to read purely for enjoyment.

Goofy utopian societies have been invented by writers using the trite mechanism of &quot;if everybody would just agree with my ideas and get along, all our problems would mysteriously vanish&quot; going back at least to Plato, and they pretty nearly always spawn little cults or big movements of starry-eyed followers who just can't understand why everybody doesn't agree with the writer and thereby make the world a warm fuzzy place, tra la la. The movement propelled by Bellamy's folderol was certainly no little cult, and its silliness plagues us still, but that, too, is not really the problem with the book, per se.Nor is the lack of scientific or technological foresight the greatest shortcoming of this book. After all, it's no crime for an author to be subliterate regarding the physical sciences and engineering, particularly when that author was writing at a time before the pace of technological change had accelerated to twentieth century levels. Bellamy gets near the mark in a few cases, and the reader really shouldn't expect much more than that.No, what makes this a truly dreary, tiresome, wearing book is rather the one single crime for which no writer can be forgiven: he does not write well. Bellamy was a lousy writer, plain and simple, and regardless of one's social or political or economic church, a fair and impartial judgement of any novel should be based first on the quality of its writing. Edward Bellamy had no ear for language or dialog, no feel for wit or humor, no talent for description of a scene, no aptitude for characterization, and no capacity for engaging the reader and drawing him into the printed page. He was just not a good writer, and consequently the book is laborious and wearisome to read.Some twenty years after &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, H.G. Wells wrote &quot;The Sleeper Wakes&quot;, about a fellow who, like Julian West, takes a Rip Van Winkle-ish nap and wakes up to a future society vastly different from the Victorian one he knew. Wells' vision of the future is rather different from Bellamy's, and some of his notions might have been just as goofy, but at least he could write. A dyed-in-the-wool socialist looking for tedious paralogia to support his pet notions might find some value in &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, but a reader looking for a well-written Victorian look forward would be better off with Wells."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"On the surface this book published in 1888 is nothing but a small science fiction book about the future, but it doesn't take much digging to find the socialist vision of the future within. While very interesting and, yes, thought provoking, many parts of the book read very much like a political science book than a utopian novel. It is entertaining, yes, but I would not look at it as a study of human society. The book shows the government as 'allowing' things to happen, such as the evolution of small businesses to huge monopolies, while in our own history we know the government of the early 20th century fought it tooth and nail, with anti-trust laws, while the people fought the idea of monopolies, refusing to become nothing more than unfeeling consumers.We are more than just capitalists and workmen.

Forty years later this question still persists. This book is not only unoriginal in borrowing its leitmotiv from H. G. Wells and Washington Irving, it completely denies the power and unchanging quality of human nature. Nobody is truly motivated by altruism... for long at least. Altruism always provides a person with a direct benefit that outweighs competing self-centered interests; it might be enhanced self esteem or the esteem of others, standing in the community, etc., but it can't credibly be argued that people will indefinitely suspend self interest or the interest of their loved ones to serve a greater good. Society has never worked that way in good times, and it's every man for himself when food is being rationed. That is why socialism can only be maintained for long at the barrel of a gun. It goes against human nature, it goes against reason, and it goes against every concept of personal liberty.As an object lesson on the mental disorder that is liberalism however, the book performs admirably.

However, it is resolutely national. Everything in it is about how the nation by 2000 has taken over the direction of production and distribution and done away with not only money, but also spitefulness, sexual jealousy and claims of blood.It is no excuse for Bellamy that Veblen was yet unknown. He was writing in Boston, where Mayflower descendence was worth its weight in gold.The bloody shirt was being waved to effect at the time, too, and there is nothing here to explain how links to the Society of the Cincinnati or the GAR were eroded. In fact, the evolution of the 20th century is very much a black box in \\"Looking Backward,\\" except that it occurred with less bloodshed than the change of government in a minor state.The whole tone is strange. It is all about Bostonians and Americans, but the word America does not appear. The proper Bostonians, then very conscious of their role in foisting democracy in the form of manhood suffrage on the world, are said to have given up democracy without a fight. Strange.It is no fault of Bellamy's that he could not foretell the disappearance of the horse, but even taken as a vision, he does a much poorer job than Jules Verne. The editors of the Applewood edition (\\"publishers of America's living past\\") try to make something of the fact that Bellamy introduced the term \\"credit card,\\" but his credit cards had nothing to do with ours, and in fact he is relentlessly anti-credit.As an analysis of the ills of his time, Bellamy is pretty much a damp squib. About the only trenchant observation he makes is that \\"interest on investments was a species of tax in perpetuity upon the product of those engaged in industry.\\" If he had said \\"land\\" instead of \\"investments,\\" he would have been close to the insights of Henry George, writing at the same time.As a prophet he is a wet blanket. His hatred of individualism -- never exactly defined -- is complete, but one doubts whether even the resentful proletarians of his turbulent era would have welcomed a future based on \\"the strictest discipline in the army of labor.\\"Bellamy would have loved Mussolini.As for the book as a book, he chose to cast it in the form of a romantic novel. It is perhaps the most tedious romantic novel ever written, no small accomplishment. \\"Looking Backward\\" manages to be as precious, stilted and inhuman as the best of Henry James.It amazes me that I got through it."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Fast shipping!!

It is good historic read,and forecasted the world we still have not achieved."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Bellamy presents a simple, almost Poe-like magic realism; a man moves forward in time through the simple expedient of a trance. He is shocked by the utopia he encounters, and spends time acclimating to the new moral climate. His Utopian society is economically and socially egalitarian, without being totalitarian - imagine a combination of libertarianism and communism mixed and done properly. Of course, the 20th century has lead this book to seem, well, unreasonable; we gain few insights into society. However, as an early work in science fiction or magic realism, this work stands out; the man-out-of-his-own-time has been done since, well imitated and improved, but this is one of the foundations. A must for sci-fi and magic realism readers."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"First published in 1888, Looking Backward was one of the most popular books of its day. It inspired several utopian communities and hundreds of \\"Bellamy Clubs\\" across America. Reading it today, it's hard to see what all the fuss was about.Through a convoluted series of circumstances, wealthy Bostonian Julian West falls asleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. Upon awakening he is greeted by Dr. Leete, who will serve as his host and guide in this future society. The social order has changed drastically since West's day. America is now governed by an idealistic form of socialism, though Bellamy avoids the S-word in favor of terms like \\"cooperative\\", \\"rational\\", or \\"brotherly\\". It's not a strict Marxist socialism, but rather Bellamy's own brand. The overall governing principle is that cooperation is more efficient than competition. The trusts that dominated America in the late 19th century have eliminated each other through competition and consolidated into one giant trust, now governing all industry. This trust has somehow become the U.S. government, and now beneficently works for the interests of all citizens. The military has been replaced by the Industrial Army, all industry has been nationalized, money has been abolished, and all citizens receive identical wages in the form of credit which they are free to spend however they choose. Bellamy's society of the future sounds a lot like an early prospectus for the Soviet Union read through rose-colored glasses. In reality, its existence would require the total negation of all human greed and sloth. It is also heavily reliant on a benevolent ruler who wields absolute power. Unfortunately, as history has shown us time and again, those who wield absolute power are seldom benevolent.My main objection to this book, however, is not directed toward its political ideals. I generally enjoy reading the socialist literature of this time period, and I'm usually up for a good utopian novel of any political stripe, no matter how far-fetched. What I object to is the writing. Once West wakes up in this brave new world, how does he spend his time? Sitting on the couch talking to Dr. Leete, chapter after chapter after chapter. Occasionally they go out to a restaurant, store, library, etc. where all they do is talk, talk, and talk some more. What's the first rule of good writing? Show me; don't tell me. If your intention is to teach us about an ideal industrial society, why not give the man a job? Julian West is not an active participant in the society being described. He doesn't interact with it at all. He is a perpetual bystander. This is really not a novel at all, but a series of dialogues in which Dr. Leete is the mouthpiece spouting the imaginary Constitution of Bellamy's ideal America. Would we all be happier living in Bellamy's world? Probably. But that doesn't make it a good book."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Although this novel lies nearly forgotten today, when it was first released in the late 19th century, its impact on society and the imagination (and expectations) of that society were so immense as to be immeasurable. This book did more than strike a chord of hope in a population craving better times and trusting in humankind's capacity to make things right, it created a sensation. Clubs were formed in dozens of cities, which hailed Bellamy as a hero and prophet, and Looking Backward was quite simply embraced by millions as prophecy and a blueprint for what was certain to come. It all sounded so good, didn't it? The year 2000 would arrive upon a world at peace, where everyone had sufficient food, had dignity, where crime was heeled, where equality was a reality. It was, in short, both a utopia and a realization of the fantasies of Karl Marx. In fact, today this book seems both impossibly nave and touchingly---humanistically---idealistic. Communism was tried in the decades after Bellamy's death and the 20th century result was nothing like what the 19th century Bellamy suggested it would be. Instead of equality and liberation, it brought a new species of class stratification and suffocating enslavement to nearly a quarter of the globe. Looking Backward is neither a great novel nor a bad one. In retrospect it lacks the importance which in its early years it seemed destined to have. Today Looking Backward is an interesting read, especially when the context of its creation is considered, and we with perfect hindsight can know how flawed its fantasy of an Eden-like worker's tomorrow was."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Like most Utopias, Edward Bellamy illustrates his ideal society through a light narrative designed to both deliver his point and entertain the reader; in this case, the narrative evolves from suspense (kinda) into, of course, a love story. The tale centers around Julian West, a bourgeoisie-of-sorts from late 19th century society, whose hypnotic sleep leaves him lying peacefully until he is awoken in the year 2000 by a doctor and his family. The plot is obviously not meant to be particularly realistic, but as framework for Bellamy to build his theory upon it serves him quite well.For this review and others, please check out www.yourwords.caThe title, &quot;Looking Backward&quot; is derived from the dialogue between the main character and the family that found him, throughout which aspects from the &quot;current&quot; society of the year 2000 are contrasted with that of the past. The dialogue evolves to include Bellamy's theories on economics, production, political agendum and other less defined, though no less well-conceived, philosophies on social direction and operation. I found it most interesting that he was able to foresee the rise of corporations and their monopoly over production and distribution at a time when industrialism was at its infancy.I could write pages upon pages about the ideas in Looking Backward, but instead I'll just point you to the text itself. As a reviewer, one is always tempted to incorporate their own bias into the review. For instance, I have read reviews of this book that dismiss it for promotion of what later became known as socialism. This is most absurd as such a narrow minded dismissal not only blames a text for the faulty implementation of a faulty system in despotic hands but ignores the intent of the author, which was to illustrate a society based upon unity and equality as opposed to the current system disunity and inequality. I have also read reviews that suggest the book to be 'incomplete' for not elaborating upon the details in which the society of 1887 transformed to the Utopia of 2000. I put forth that such a task should not and cannot be undertaken by an author whose intent is to outline their ideal society, as it is to the rest of us who would see the ideal realized that would need to undertake its practical development and application. The task of all authors is to spread ideas, not necessarily to implement them.If you are looking for a good story to read, skip this book. The story is pretty weak and the writing is in most instances overly technical at times when simple language would suffice. What makes it the classic that it is are the ideas expounded within the text. The most admirable and practical example of such to me was his views on concerted production, where the extreme wealth of the state is achieved through the industries working together towards a single cause (the wealth of the state, of course) instead of against each other, profiteering from the collapse of their competitors. I also envy the idea, however unattainable it would seem, that since all wages are equal for all citizens, each pursues his vocation solely for the genuine love of the field.Time and time again while reading through this text, I could not help but pause and ask myself why such a system as described by Bellamy couldn't and doesn't exist. Perhaps it is too unrealistic. Perhaps it is too idealistic. But as I like to think, perhaps it just makes too much sense for such a flawed species to accept."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"I was assigned this book for a class, but I am SOOO glad. The Utopian approach is refreshing, even from the vantage point of 1887. The view of the future is suprisingly accurate for technology, and the reasons for a change from the past go far beyond astute.Many cynical people think today is the way life HAS to be. This book gives us an alternate view of our reality and hope in humanity for the possibility of progress in the future."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"Other reviews have described the plot, so I won't spend much time on it. A man, Julian West, goes to sleep in 1887 and wakes up in the year 2000. He finds a socialist utopia.At first, the book is quite interesting. Bellamy does a good job of capturing the protagonist's surpise and confusion at the new world he discovers. The fact that Edith Leete looks like his fiance back in 1887 Boston is a neat twist. The socialist state the author describes is appealing to me, and as someone who believes that socialism can work, I found it thought provoking.The problem is, there is not enough story or character development here. Bellamy's ideas aren't really suited to the fictional form. He'd have been better off to write a solely political tract. Because the author can't seem to decide if he wants to write a novel or a political essay, both the narrative and the politics are oversimplified, and given short shrift. The introduction by Cecilia Titchi (pardon my spelling), was excellent. In fact, the book fails to live up to it. If you know nothing about socialism, this book my enlighten you as to the philosophy. If it is an option for a political science class, it would be a good pick because it is easy and quick reading. Otherwise, I wouldn't rush to read it."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"This &quot;novel&quot; is an excellent description of socialism at its best (written, incidentally, decades before Stalin or the USSR). The story is pretty irrelevant, consisting of your basic heterosexual narrative thrown in simply for the purposes of getting published, I imagine. The ideas about what socialism would look like are presented almost entirely as dialogue in the form of explanations to a knowledge-hungry gentleman who has been in a hypnosis-induced comma for a hundred years, and awakes to find himself in a futuristic utopia.It's interesting to note that Bellamy wrote a sequel to this book (long out-of-print) that addresses the problems with his socialist vision. There is dissent in this new world, and Bellamy describes an alternative anarchist society rising on the fringes to address the lack of freedom in his socialist model."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"I liked to read this book because it contained very unusual or old words. The structure of the sentences reminded me of an era long gone in which people actually had to write to communicate. Nonetheless, the book serves its purpose by condemning his \\"present\\" of the 1880's and praising the future that he wakes up in even though it takes the entire book to do it. The main interest I had with the book is that Mr. West wakes up in the year 2000 and I wanted to see what Bellamy thought about it. Bellamy had no knowledge of cars and, therefore, weren't in the novel. Odd by our standards, but so were the flying cars in 1950's theorists' eyes.Its also a great novel because it completely changed my way of looking at a socialist utopia. You work for the greater good of everyone and if you don't work then you get tossed out. I like socialism and thought this was a more moderate stance. However, it was a great point to clarify and will hopefully push more into the realm of socialist style government.If you enjoy a short read, took me about a week due to work schedule that week, then I suggest you read this. His ideas about a modern utopia instead of the monopolistic capitalist exploitative world in the 1880's are wonderful and truly make you see the good in socialism."},{"Title":"Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics)","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Looking Backward.\\" It speaks much about the problems facing America near the turn of the century; the problems that affected almost everyone in America every day. The problems of greedy monopolists is the most evident, but also others. The book is not as much as a story as it is the author laying out his groundwork for a perfect society with a story sort of, but not really, built around it. There is sort of a romace, but almost the entire book is characters telling the protagonist what the future is like. I do find it funny though. Back in the 19th century, authors GREATLY underestimated the technological progress of mankind. Just decades later, it was the opposite- and authors were greatly overestimating it."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Mildred's unaffected prose, camera lens eye and splendid memory took me right back to splendid years and lessons on the farm. Though more than 15 years behind her, I remember well the children of depression she describes - persevering good people with good values. I miss them along with the sounds of meadowlarks and roosters, smells of fresh hay in the barn, going barefoot, and as she delightfully shared, falling asleep on sheets sun and wind dried on a clothes line. As you can appreciate from this book, the work and trials involved with farm living then were cheap tuition for an incredible education and bonding with God's marvelous creation."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Little Heathens was a page turner! Mildred Kalish's story of her childhood made me realize, as a teacher, how the simple things in life are crucial to a child's overall development. In an age of high tech devices, we are truly missing the mark on what children need as tools for life's hardships. Hard work, discipline and an overall appreciation for our environment. Mildred Kalish articulated so well what was expected of her, the learning that took place and the resulting closeness she and her family members had. How the togetherness in completing daily chores with her siblings added to her well being. Loved the recipes and household tips! I now yearn for a day in her past!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I read this for a book club, and found some of it quite charming. I particularly liked the home remedies for cleaning and medicine. The author's memories do carry the reader to a different place and time...but is not riveting reading. It is the kind of book you can pick up and read any chapter on its own -- an enjoyable escape if one is in the mood."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"My wife read all nine volumes of the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder (b. 1867) to our children, but if that's a stretch for your busy schedule, then Mildred Kalish's (b. 1922) best seller is a fine substitute. Kalish does for the Depression years what Wilder did for the American frontier, which is to give a nostalgic but realistic first person account of a place and time that is now lost to most people. Except for her epilogue, Kalish recounts her early childhood years on her grandparents' 240-acre farm in rural Iowa. As you would expect, her people epitomized the thrift, self-reliance, industry and independence of a family for whom \\"land was plentiful but money was almost non-existent.\\" Individual chapters describe farm life, daily chores, a typical Thanksgiving that took two weeks to prepare, church life, wash day, the farm windmill, the outhouse, food (complete with many recipes), and more. As a young girl Kalish could skin a rabbit, butcher a live chicken, and fry a snapping turtle. But there were limits. She was not allowed to see her uncle wield a sledge hammer to slay a hog or use the butcher knife to severe its head.Kalish acknowledges that not all people loved those years like she does even today. Her sister Avis refuses to talk about it at all. Nor does she gloss over negative aspects of her upbringing. She lived with her mother's parents because when she was about five her father was banished forever from the family and community for some unspoken misdeed, and his name was, quite literally, never mentioned again in her presence. She doesn't even know when he died. Her people were stern and emotionally reserved. They could be proud and moralistic. Any and all talk about sex education was strictly forbidden. Still, Kalish describes her upbringing as a \\"gift\\" for which she remains grateful, and in her telling it's easy to see why. A dozen or so original photos enhance the reading. The New York Times named this memoir one of the \\"Ten Best Books of 2007.\\""},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I was left disappointed. The New York Times rated this as one of their best non-fiction books of 2007, and I have to say that I am not sure why. It was like a real-life Little House on the Prairie, without all the covered wagons and moving from place to place, but not as interesting. Much of the chores were the same- milking, threshing, even making head-cheese. Even though this book takes place much later than the Little House books, the lifestyle it describes will be very familiar to readers of Laura Ingalls Wilder.The writing was clunkier than I expected- much of the book ended up being a laundry list of chores and every-day occurances. While I got a great picture of what every-day life was like on the farm, I did not feel that I got to know the author at all. She does talk a little bit about her insecurities growing up, and her experiences after the farm, but only just a little bit.One big positive of this book is that it is very cheerful and upbeat. The author is able to look at a very difficult time both economically and personally with a lot of warmth and fondness. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Laura Ingalls Wilder books (because for its clunky and sometimes boring style, it isn't a long book and goes fast) or anyone who wishes to visit/revisit this time in a way that is nostalgically cheerful, which is unusual for the time period."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"If you're looking for a followup read to Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books and/or Ralph Moody's Little Britches series, look no further than Mildred Armstrong Kalish's Little Heathens. It's early 20th-century, not 19th, but Kalish's book includes all the stuff your dear child loved about Laura Ingalls Wilder and more. There's less of a storyline--more short chapters on individual topics of farm and family life--than the Wilder books, but it's amazing. You'll love it.It's only a few years old so it's not yet on (m)any booklists for young people, but it should be!Now, there are at least three things to be aware of if you might be reading this with or to your child: Little Heathens includes (a) a discussion of the profanity she heard from grownups, (b) the shocking death of a family dog and (c) a very very oblique reference to an abortion in a sequence where she's describing the talk she would overhear from her aunts while they were gathered together cooking big family meals. The line (\\"I heard she did it with a lead pencil\\") is buried amongst a number of other overheard phrases so it can't be understood in context, but I feel like I should mention it.All that said, this is one of the most delightful books you could ever hope for your child to read.And her applesauce cake recipe is divine!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"One anecdote in a flood of memorable stories stands out in \\"Little Heathens.\\" The Urmeys (her grandparents) were not poor, not Okies or Arkies, not tenants or sharecroppers. They owned four debt-free farms in eastern Iowa (painfully acquired, one for each daughter), over a thousand acres. Sometime in the \`30s, when Millie was in third grade, the Ipana toothpaste company provided samples of toothpaste to the Garrison school, along with printed pictures of a modern bathroom, which Kalish recalls, they all happily colored, though none had even seen, let alone used indoor plumbing.Few people today understand how laborious and restricted life was in the countryside before World War II. Relatively prosperous Iowans with some education (the Urmey girls usually taught in one-room schoolhouses until they married) seldom traveled more than 10 miles, did not enjoy indoor plumbing, and -- during the Depression, which began in 1922 in rural America -- virtually dropped out of the money economy.In the South, things were much worse.It turned out not to matter that the Urmeys were examples of the hard-working pioneer settler way of life. \\"Grandpa and Grandma never quite made it into the 20th century.\\" The irresponsibility and incompetence of the financial classes nearly wrecked them. Kalish comments that her grandparents were land-rich and cash-poor, and terrified of losing their land in a tax sale.Commodity prices collapsed in \`22. The overall economy seemed to be expanding, but the rural economy crashed and stayed crashed. There was nothing farmers could do, alone or even in alliances to restrict production so as to praise prices. Farmers with debt were wiped out. It is no wonder that Grandpa Urmey believed in three things: hard work, the Methodist church and Franklin Roosevelt.There is a well-financed campaign under way in 2010 to rewrite the history of the Depression in favor of free market ideology. Here, through the eyes of a child,. is the refutation of those lies.However, \\"Little Heathens\\" is not an economic screed. (Such a screed has been written, by Linda Flowers in \\"Throwed Away.\\") It is more like \\"Life with Father\\" or \\"I Remember Mama\\" or any of the numerous other American reminiscences of family life, only much franker.As a Little Kid, Millie observed but did not entirely understand the sex, scatology and scandals around her. Late in life, she lays it out, without squeamishness or reticence.The book is organized by themes: religion, cooking, medical matters, laundry. The chapter on laundry will be an eyeopener for most readers.Millie describes her mother as overwhelmed. Her dad was missing, run off or driven off, amid rumors of prison and bootlegging. Thus, Millie and her brothers and sister were less constricted than the other kids. \\"Free range farm children,\\" she calls herself and her sister and brothers.Yet thanks to uncles and aunts, neighbors, older kids and even teachers, they learned a great deal, from how to rob a bumblebee nest to treating toothache. \\"I know of no comparable body of knowledge that young people today possess.\\"Yet one thing they did not learn. \\"We had no acceptable way to show affection toward people.\\"I am reminded of a remark I read from a younger woman recently: \\"My father never told me he loved me. Only now do I realize that \`Do you want to learn how to change the oil is the car?' was how he said it.\\" \\"Little Heathens\\" is an extended riff on that thought."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Anyone who lived through the depression years on a farm in the Midwest would surely enjoy similarities and differences in the way farm people both coped with and enjoyed their years with only the bare essentials.

When my much younger sister was born, my grandparents had 'moved to town' - where my grandma could never figure out how to work the gas stove! She could whip up the most marvelous meals and cakes just by adjusting the number of corncobs she added to the fire! I'm sorry my sister doesn't have these memories of life on the farm.....feeding the pigs, milking the cows (and how my grandpa could aim the milk right into the waiting cats' mouths), gathering eggs (Oh, how I hated to reach under a sitting hen for an egg) and playing in the barn.....and oh so many other wonderful things to do on a farm without electrcity or running water!

The book starts off mildly entertaining, but just like grandma (or grandpa), it gets long-winded. You start to feel bored and restless and wonder how much more you can sit through before you make the move for your coat. You might decide that the next time she repeats, \\"waste not, want not,\\" you'll excuse yourself and head for the door. But if you stick with this book through the dragging middle, you get to the best parts, the chapters called \\"animal tales,\\" \\"racoons and other critters,\\" and \\"me.\\" She tells how the kids in the family tamed racoons (the racoons slept in bed with them!) . The middle part drags in part because of obsolete practices that she describes. It's hard to picture what she's talking about when she tells of the oat shocking procedure, the mechanics of their laundry routine, and the windmill. Parts of these sections read like how-to manuals, including how to prepare various meals. Her chapter called \\"me\\" is the best, as it has the most human interest, telling a little bit about how she went to college, joined the coast guard, got married, etc. What is ridiculous is that she puts this chapter as an epilogue! Like she's so modest, she can't have a place in the book, it has to be tagged at the end? Like, here's a tiny bit about little ol' me if you care to know...Yeah, thanks, that's why I picked up this book in the first place!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I had this recommended to me and read many of the reviews before buying. But no where did I find anyone who mentioned the bad language. In fact, there's a whole chapter, listing the words that were said and by whom. Also, I guess I expected the book to be one about survival but the author's family was obviously well-to-do. My parents grew up on farms in big families during the Depression but their lifestyles were obviously much different. I didn't see any cornbread and buttermilk suppers. Also, much of their daily lives were built around the church, something the author has little use for. It's probably the area of the country they were raised in but I read this book, planning to pass it along to the four \\"girls\\" still living (2 in their 90s) but I'm afraid it's a little too \\"high spirited.\\" It frankly sometimes read almost like it was being copied from a notebook and the author wanted to make certain she included everything that was expected in a book like this. A few times the book was entertaining but other times I was left wondering if some of these things really happened or they were just included to \\"spice\\" up the book. I sure would have liked to have known the names of the \\"Big Kids\\" and \\"Little Kids\\", their anonymity leaving the reader wondering. I can't recommend this to my 91 year old mother or my 13 year old grandson because of the language and of the cavalier attitude toward churches, both something that some people take seriously."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This book was very disappointing. I had read reviews that lauded its descriptions of the Great Depression. Instead, it was a tedious recounting of all the ways life was different then than now. (\\"We put the wash in the bucket...Then we brought a larger bucket in from the barn. Then we turned the door knob...Then the Big Kids filled the large bucket with hot water...).We can appreciate that life was different 70+ years ago, as it will be different 70 years from today. But I wanted to know what it felt like when no one had money, when a great war was approaching, when people were leaving their homes for greener pastures.I'll have to find a different book."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Cute book but either the author isnt clearly rememberimg her facts or she made them up. in the introduction she states her ancestors moved to IA in 1846 and hunted pheasant on their farm, one problem, pheasant weren't intoduced to the US until 1881 and that was in Oregon. Secondly, in the telling of the preparation of Thanksgiving dinner in 1930 she has some issues. They sent someone out to the garden to pick sage? In IA? Average high temperature in Cedar Rapids at Thanksgiving is in the lo 20s, sage was long killed by then. And hardy souls those boys in the picture, waiting to be called for supper, must be what with sitting outside with short sleeved shirts on and it being 20 degrees out.

If you like history you will like this book. It really personalizes and brings to life a time in American history that was difficult on so many different social groups. This book doesn't make broad sweeping statements about anywhere else, just Iowa farm country and small towns, which is exactly what the author knows.

Perhaps if Kalish had had to live year-round with her grandparents, it would have been spirit-crushing -- and it would have been a different story.

I grew up on a farm in Southwestern Wisconsin in the 40s and 50s, a skip, hop and jump from the location of the communities described in this book. My parents experiences as children of the Depression carried over to the upbringing of the next (my) genration, as well. While reading, my mental reference was the old green shingled farm house where my grandparents lived just across the border in northern Illinois. It was equally as cold in winter as the ones described in this book. There was a big old iron cook stove in the kitchen; my Grandma made the best bread I've ever tasted and had the most diverse garden I've ever known. So many things written about in this book brought back wonderful and painful memories of growing up in the upper Midwest. I am going to keep this book on my cookbook shelves so, when the mood strikes, I might try to make homemade marshmallows! Thank you Mildred Armstrong Kalish, not only for the recipes, but for an important ethnographic and historical, yet thoroughly entertaining work."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Mildred Armstrong Kalish has provided readers with a rare treat in this rollicking memoir of growing up in rural Iowa during the Depression years.Meticulously written, filled with the sights, sounds, and smells of a vanished way of life, this book will hold you captive from the first page to the last. Armstrong's book is filled with hardy characters, skillful and canny, equal to the sometimes harrowing situations they faced.I wouldn't describe this as a \\"feel-good\\" memoir, as Kalish writes as honestly and precisely about the difficulties and the heartbreaks, as she does about the many delights. This is a window into the heartland of many decades past, as well as a window into human hearts of any age. It deserves the highest rating."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This was a gift I gave my 94 year old mother.

There were some good moments but overall the whole thing felt very thin-- strangely lacking in analysis and perspective. Nearly every chapter ends with a rhetorical question whose only purpose is to demonstrate how wonderful things were \\"back then.\\" For example the chapter about gardening ends this way \\"Do you need to be told, that with the addition of a marrow bone, Mama produced a magnificent soup. ..? Need I add that I adopted this final gathering routine right down to making a great soup in my own gardening days?\\" Unfortunately, by this point in the book, Kalish certainly doesn't need to tell us these things. This rhetorical strategy was exceedingly annoying throughout.Yes, Kalish succeeds in describing how hard everyone worked back then, and that there were advantages to living so close to the natural world (her penultimate chapter on the family pets is one of the best). But too much of the book takes on the tone of a cranky old relative spinning out only half-believable stories in a scolding tone. She often asks the reader \\"Can you imagine children of today doing such a task?\\" Of course the only possible answer Kalish can imagine is No.There are no other real characters in this book other than Kalish herself. Early on she writes about a charming maiden aunt named Belle, but other than Belle nobody else comes to life. Her brothers and sisters, even her mother are strangely flat--we are given no sense of them at all. Skip this one, and go rent a few episodes of the Waltons instead. You'll get more character development, better writing, and fewer lectures."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This is a lovely little book written by a woman who shares her memories of childhood in a delightful way. Those readers with parents or grandparents who lived during these years in the country or small town will have heard many of these same stories and smile at the remembrances. It was such a different life and a different way of child rearing than we babyboomers experienced. I loved the characters. This book is a nice, relaxing tale of America \\"way back when\\".NOTE: The readers' children might not enjoy reading nor having their parents read this book.....it might make a parent demand more from their child!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I bought this for my mother, who was living on a farm about 100 miles from the author at the time. Mom thought that this was incredibly accurate and great to read. We both loved the author's perspective; life was tough, but there was a lot to celebrate in the world that they grew up in. No self-pity, but great enjoyment of the good things that they had.Unlike other reviewers, I loved having the recipes and intend to try them. They remind me of my grandmother's cooking.I'm buying another copy of the book to share with my (adult) kids. They will have a better appreciation of their grandparents' world."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"As can be quickly discerned from the book's subtitle and from many of the Amazon reviews, LITTLE HEATHENS is about life on a farm in Iowa during the 1930s. The principal reason I bought and read the book was because my late father also lived on a farm in Iowa in the 1930s, although he was a few years older than the author, Mildred Armstrong Kalish. Because my father and I never talked much about his youth, I had a personal interest in Kalish's book -- namely, to get a better sense of the circumstances in which my father grew up. And from that perspective, this book certainly delivers; it is chock-full of information about life in rural America in the 1930s -- at least those portions of rural America that were almost exclusively white and where most of the farmers were able to avoid bankruptcy and keep their farms going.But truth be told, LITTLE HEATHENS is not a great book. In saying that I don't believe I demean the book. For one thing, I don't believe the author intended it to be \\"great\\". Kalish comes across as a smart, industrious, and very decent woman, and her book is a detailed, readable, and relatively well-written (although at times somewhat cliched and over-written) account of what was a rather commonplace farm-based childhood in the 1930s. But that's not the stuff of greatness.What is interesting to me is all the acclaim the book has received, as evidenced by preceding Amazon reviews and the fact that the New York Times saw fit to name it one of its notable non-fiction books of 2007. I can't help but think that for many readers the book strikes a chord of nostalgia and evokes a yearning (perhaps unconscious) for a simple and self-sufficient life. But the Iowa farmlife of Kalish's childhood entailed hard work and cooperation, and I doubt that many contemporary American families, except perhaps the few remaining farming/ranching families, are willing or able to work as hard as the families -- both adults and children -- did then. It also required a faith in the moral rectitude of one's lifestyle, and that that lifestyle secured one a favored place in God's universe, that is much less prevalent today than it was 75 years ago. Further, it was not very accommodating of those who did not share the same race, northern European heritage, or Protestant religion, or those who did not conform to a certain standard of behavior (witness the author's father who was permanently expelled from the family and cut off from his wife and children by the author's grandfather for reasons the author never learned). The brute fact of the matter is that the independent and insular world that Kalish describes was swept away by fascism, militarism, and World War II, and the following tides of history and technology and the sheer numbers of humans populating the planet. And, as was the title of another product of the Thirties, \\"You Can't Go Home Again.\\"I sense that Kalish is well aware of that point. But I also sense that many of her readers are not."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I loved this book. Kalish is such a descriptive yet straightforward writer, and this account of her childhood effortlessly took all my senses to her farm in Iowa.

Luckily, my instinct was right. I am so glad I read this book. My wife and son read it right after me and also enjoyed it.The book has the feel of a beloved relative talking about the \\"old days\\", except that the story is told with the literary sure hand of a retired English professor. Not only is Mildred Kalish's style wonderfully readable, I found her choices of subjects to be interesting.I did sort of skim over the recipes in the book, but there was one that caught my eye: the \\"apple cream pie\\". My wife baked it the other night, and it is pretty darn good. Beware though: there are a lot of apples in it!I think the value in this book are the lessons it teaches, and how it teaches those lessons without being preachy or judgemental about the current state of society. The values are some we could use more of today: self-reliance, respect for our family, the satisfaction of hard work, and bearing our trials with dignity. Sadly, when Ms. Kalish's generation have all passed away, these values are in danger of becoming some sort of antiquated curiosity. This book can also be therapeutic, allowing us to put the annoyances and challenges of life today in proper perspective. Maybe it's not so bad after all that the line at Starbuck's is long. Maybe our kids can learn that there are other ways to have fun than video games and text messaging. Maybe we can all just slow down a little, and be happy with what we have.The most telling passage is at the very end. She could have complained about the hard times, the poverty, and the back-breaking farm work. Instead, she is grateful. A lesson for us all.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"To be honest with you, I don't know who recommended this book to me but I am eternally grateful to whomever did, because it really was a fun read. I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought my own copy of it so I can lend it to people. My great-great-grandma immigrated from Germany to Iowa and her daughter and grand-daughter grew up in Iowa till the Great Depression drove them to Ohio. The grand irony is while the author lived in Iowa during the Great Depression, my relatives moved back east looking for jobs.The stories and historical tidbits that Millie had shared about her childhood on the farm are familiar stories passed down to me from my relatives. I grew up as a town girl and so did my mom, but she would visit her cousins every summer and they lived on the farm. She would share her stories with me at the family reunions and Millie has a great way with words. Reading this book almost made me feel like I was sitting at her knees as she rocked in her rocking chair and passed on so many stories of her childhood. She has taught me a few things as well as answered so many questions I never knew that I had.This is a thoroughly enjoyable book and one that every family in the Midwest should own as a reminder of their ancestors' past. It is chock full of information, stories, old-folks' tales and musings. It is a great book to share with your children and grandchildren, and a piece of history that is made all the more real since it was penned by a woman who grew up on the farm. I love memoirs and this one just beats them all.This one comes highly recommended.6/29/08"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Even though I'm young enough to be the author's granddaughter, I remember so much of what she writes about --- picking wild plums, grapes, raspberries, elderberries and mulberries and making preserves.

He would have been one of the Big Kids in the book. Dad had five younger siblings, and this book helped me to see their lives through Professor Kalish's eyes. Dad wasn't as good an observer as Professor Kalish is, and these details weren't always part of his stories. But I recognize bits and pieces of everything in the book, in part from having visited my aunt and uncle's Illinois farm in the early 1950s when I was young. They didn't have indoor plumbing or central heating either.Even if I didn't have that connection to the subject, this book would have attracted my attention as a wonderful way to create a bridge between my parent's generation and what my children experience. I intend to give a copy to each child for a Thanksgiving present.I especially enjoyed the descriptions of how everything was done before our labor-saving appliances and plumbing arrived. I was intrigued by the home remedies, and I was fascinated by the recipes. I can remember watching one of my aunts follow some of these recipes.The thrift described in the book I can remember from my parents who would reuse everything, any number of times in different ways. My children can't understand why I do the same thing.I think this book will be a great awakening to those who don't realize that you can have a great time without spending any money and while working quite hard.Appreciate your family and count your blessings!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This book honours a time, place and way of life that unfortunately is lost to most of us today.

This is a delightful memoir filled with loads of humor. In fact, there are quite a few laughs to be gotten from reading this book, plus lots of human knowledge. There was plenty of hard work, both housework and farm chores that needed to be done. But there were many hands to get it accomplished. Even the youngest, the little kids, as the author calls them were made to help. So the family all worked together.There were seven in Mildred's immediate family, Mildred's grandparents, her mother, two older brothers, Mildred herself, and her little sister. Her father was absent from the family and never heard from. Mildred never knew why.The grandparents were strict and expected good behavior, good manners, and good conduct from their grandchildren. Strong character was needed and should be built from babyhood. Grandpa was land rich, he owned four farms, but money was scarce. During long cold Iowa winters only the living room and kitchen were heated to conserve heat. Mrs Kalich was brought up upon saving,recycling everything.recycle, recycle as everything was used and reused and reused again in her childhood home. That family was today modern as people of today are encouraaged to recycle, recycle, recycle. The kids were required to eat healthy and to eat everything on their plates. Waste not, want not was one of the mottos of the grandparents plus many other bon mots. Mildred, her mother and other siblings would move out to Grandpa's farm from September until Christmas and attend a one room school where her mother had once taught. Their mother pretty much allowed her kids to do whatever they wanted to, to have much more freedom. So Mildred and her brothers and sister were brought up in two opposite ways, too strict, too much freedom.There was wonderful Great Aunt Belle who was as much a kid as her great nephews and nieces and was good at spoiling them, making up parties and games. She gave Mildred a good opinion of herself. She was as good and as pretty as any other little girl. Mildred, as too many little girls, felt she was not pretty.There was plenty of food. Thanksgiving was well celebrated. Relatives came together and all brought their best dishes. Mrs Kalish writes about all the home grown food plus well fed animals. To this day she states she has never tasted food as good as the home cooking, home grown food of her childhood. There is a section in this book containing recipes for farm food. This family had an abundance of food. Books and magazines were welcome in this house and the kids were encouraged to read. The whole family, except Grandma, was readers. This is so, so, so different from many homes during the Great Depression. Too many people had little food and couldn't even afford newspapers. This house was well to do. However, there was very few homes with indoor plumbing in the small Iowa town Professor Kalich was from. Indoor plumbing was a luxury. Children were switched with a buggy whip. When they got in trouble in school they got worse when their parents heard of their misdeeds. Things are much different today. Mildred went to the small town school when she was staying in town.Because of her country upbringing, Professor Kalich learned to know the names of trees, flowers, plants and to love all of them. She had many different animal pets, both domestic and wild. She learned to love the verdant country with its seasons to love nature and wild things.Mrs Kalich has come far from her childhood roots but it has made her into the strong and independant woman she has become."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"There was a time - not that long ago, really - within the memory of many of us, or right before our time - when people made a full life out of \\"making do.\\" Mildred Kalish's book is a delicious celebration (complete with recipes) of that all-but-vanished part of the American character.People \\"made do\\" because there was no alternative, and Mrs. Kalish makes no attempt to gloss over the hard work involved.

Just the title made me suspect the book would be enjoyable, but I identified greatly with it as it reminded me of my growing up on an Iowa farm in the 1950's. While we had running water, indoor plumbing, and the team of horses were gone by the time I was nine, the labor, seasons, and lifestyle had not changed. We still had gardening, canning, butchering, baking, and meals to prepare for harvest help. In retrospect, I would not give up those years for anything. The work ethic and family oriented goals were invaluable."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I am just old enough to remember a time when everyone's parents or grandparents had grown up during the depression. Today, anyone old enough to have actually remembered the Crash of '29 would be in the late 80s or 90s, and few children have had the privilege of hearing first-person accounts of what it was like to grow up then, when self-reliance was more than just a slogan. But luckily we have Mildred Kalish to tell us what it was like.If you grew up in the city- and most of us have- food is something that came from the grocery store, but for Kalish and her family, food was something you grew, gathered or hunted. There were vegetables to be planted, tilled, and harvested; chickens to be reared, killed, plucked and jointed, and rabbits and pheasants to be hunted and skinned. All these tasks were part of farm life, even for the youngest.. Can you image one of today's 12 year olds being asked to skin a rabbit? Not very likely!Kalish gives us a rich portrait of her family as well. SHe was raised by a single mother, who was generous and kind; stern grandparents, who found themselves helping to support several of their children thankls to the depression; and an assortment of curious relatives, like old Aunt Agnes, whom everyone agreed was \\"half a bubble off plumb.\\" Kalish's family were largely people who were not given to demonstrations of affection, but they cared deeply for one another, and were always there for each other. Kalish's mother and grandparents supported her literary aspirations, despite the cost,, and helped her to attend college, and eventually become a professor of English.All in all, this is a delightful and entertaining read, and a wonderful glimpse into a time that few alive today can still remember."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Little Heathens is a charming, salt-of-the-earth memoir by retired English professor Mildred Armstrong Kalish that is kindly generous with more tales of high spirits than of hard times. Still, growing up on an Iowa farm during the Great Depression was no comfort by most measures.Listening to this audiobook reminded me of my own grandmother, the fourteenth of fourteen siblings, who also grew up during 1930's in the nearby state of Missouri. And according to her, modest as ever, stories from her childhood are of little interest to anyone. After learning about Kalish's blessed life, I respectfully disagree."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"As a small-city Iowan whose parents were a ten years older than the author, I can understand why people in the Depression were so economically conservative. I can also understand that Garrison, Iowa, which I visited when its defunct brick-yard became a pottery in the 1970's, probably had no movie-theater. But Vinton, a county-seat just a few miles away must have had one or two and also had a wider variety of social activities, even in the 1930's. It is was also the seat of the Iowa Sight-saving Institute for the Blind, well known as a pioneer in teaching Braille. Didn't the family ever go to Vinton? And the author's grandfather had acquired four farms, one for each daughter, and drove out to visit them in a Buick. Grandfather and grandmother Urmy also lived in a large two-story house in town. In contrast to the Urmys, many farmers drove a Ford or Chevy, and had a much smaller house, or even rented the farm they worked, getting only half the value of the harvest. A photo of the large Urmy family tombstone also shows that this family were prosperous. My impression is that the social and economic status of the Urmy family was probably quite high in this rural area, and so it is difficult to see why such extraordinary methods of saving everything down to the inner scrapings of eggs was held in such high esteem. Surely eggs were sold regularly - every Iowa farm sold eggs to a dealer in those days, and usually the mother of the family kept her \\"egg money\\" for special occasions.What I am saying is that this family was extraordinarily conservative even for the 1930's, much more conservative than they had to be. Also, the 1930's were a period of protests against low farm prices. Milk was dumped, corn was burned. There is no hint of any of this taking place, and I suppose a ten year old child wouldn't have heard of these things. But the wider world of what was going on was available through the radio and newspapers in the 1930's, and if some awareness of that wider world had been included as the author grew into her teens, a more believable story of the maturation of a young woman might have been told. I also find it strange that the central drama of the book, the loss of the father, is mentioned but then is virtually ignored, when it explains so much of the straightened circumstances of the author and her family. Kindly Grandpa Urmy becomes the father. This is really be the underlying theme of the book, and the Great Depression and the need to conserve is really a backdrop and a metaphor for it."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This is a wonderful book that describes rural life in the 30's in Iowa.

Kalish's chapters tended to be collections of anecdotes centered around various subjects, from religion to farm chores to school, and felt more like nostalgic ramblings than a book. Although as a person of the 21st century I was interested in her recipes for home remedies (for just about any ailment you could think of) and the ingenius ways the frugal family found to recycle and reuse various items, I felt that perhaps Kalish's recollections might have been better suited to magazine articles or even a collection of short stories.

And I'm drawn to books of this sort. She has not only captured the details of that Depression-Era life, but has done so warmly and playfully. Sure it was hard and there was tragedy. That is in the book, but not at the expense of the fun and little joys her family and friends also experienced. That balance is honest and commendable. Too many who write books of this sort are determined to sound a single tone, be it bleak or sugary.It's also helpful to have farm history recalled by someone who experienced it entirely. While men have written many fine accounts, their's often lack an appreciation of what went on in the house. This book includes farm history barn-to-kitchen.Small things keep this from being perfect. (Petty complaints, I'll admit.) First, I would have preferred the recipes and remedies be tucked in a separate section of the book. They seem to disrupt the flow. Second, the grandparents do not come across as being so cold and austere as we're first lead to believe. Finally, the epilogue misfires just a little. The self-doubt seemed out-of-place for a woman who would one day write this fine book."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I know everyone loved this book.

Kalish is able to recount the routines and rhythms of Depression era farm life with such precision that it hovers in the mind's eye like a nostalgic dream.What made the farmhouse hum back then was a serious devotion to doing each task well. It was a life that required hard work and \\"elbow grease\\", but the rewards were sharpened senses and enjoyment of a close-knit family and oneness with Nature. Martha Stewart and her \\"Good Things\\" philosophy pale by comparison.Still, without admitting to irony, Kalish confesses that she was fortunate to escape this plain, P.

But as far as reminding us of how far family values have deteriorated, this is a first rate account. For that we can all feel nostalgia."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Will you enjoy LITTLE HEATHENS? Let's see: did your parents or grandparents ever you one of these names: scamp, rascal, dickens, devil, tomboy, hellion, smart-aleck, monkey, rapscallion? If so, I think you'll delight in HEATHENS. These somewhat dated terms of semi-endearment capture the tone of the book and its era, a time when children were expected to know their place and keep to it, a time when affection was delivered sideways, more often with a swat on the bottom than with a hug or kiss.HEATHENS is, in short, a book of nostalgia. Organized topically, its chapters recreate in abundant and convincing detail such essentials of Depression farm life as food, church, school, chores, recreation, animals, family gatherings, and much more. The tone is fond without being sentimental, appreciative but alert to ironies--the voice of a woman who lived through it all and is aware of how fully her own success and character were determined by the lessons taught and learned in those hard times.HEATHENS is a great book to read just before turning out the light at bedtime. It would be a fine companion on a plane trip, a excellent addition to a lazy afternoon at the beach or a rainy weekend in the cabin. It would make an appropriate gift for anyone who lived through the Depression, or who grew up on a small farm and cherishes the memories. And it would surely be an eye-opener to anyone who has no idea about what it feels like to eat potatoes and turnips you have grown, drink and bathe in water you have pumped or carried, warm yourself before a fire you built in a fireplace from wood you chopped with your own grimy little hands.Mildred Kalish's book was named by the New York Times Book Review as one of the ten best books of 2007.

From the recipes like my grandmother used to make, to the stories of making do with what you had, it was a trip through a time few can remember.

Can't wait to share with my mother, esp. the description of the old stove. Such a buoyant spirit to come out of hard times (no father, raised by a depressed mother and strict grandparents, etc.) Wonderfully descriptive, full of detail. Highly recommended. Especially for anyone with midwestern farm roots, and who heard stories of the old days from their grandparents."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This is an entrancing memoir of days now long gone, but vivid in the minds of those who lived them. While I lived on an Iowa farm in western Iowa rather than eastern Iowa, and was a boy, and was about six years younger than the author, this book recalled so much of what it was like that reading it was sn unmitigated delight. The author recognizes \\"the all-too-human tendency to gloss over the bad and glorify, or at least magnify, the good\\" when recalling one's childhood, but it sure makes greater reading to read of one's appreciated childhood than it does to read of one who looks back thereon in bitterness. Thus this book beats, e.g., Angela's Ashes by a mile in enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Little Heathens, the memoir of an Iowa farm childhood, is a marvelously vivid encounter with an iconic way of life that has largely gone the way of the elm tree. The author Mildred Kalish, valedictorian of her high school class back in 1940, turns a sharp, remarkably objective eye on those descendents of the pioneers, \\"more 19th century than 20th,\\" who raised her to live off the land through Iowa's \\"fierce blizzards\\" and some of America's worst times.But this is not Little-House-on-the-Prairie. Yes, Kalish can rustle up the poignant details of honey gathering and head-cheese making. She can tell you how to domesticate raccoons and explain the proper use of beets to draw boils. What's unique here, though, is Kalish's portrait of an austere people whose Puritan tradition frowned on joy, prohibited affection in word or touch, \\"built character\\" with an open bible and homilies that dotted their days.Fortunately, while Kalish grew up hearing that \\"whistling girls and crowing hens will always come to some bad end,\\" such warnings never dampened the spirits of the \\"little heathens\\" -- as her grandmother called the farm's children. Eight decades later she has brought those stern sepia-toned faces back to full color through their words (from \\"Oh my soul\\" to \\"shit from shinola\\"), their ideals (\\"better to wear out than rust out\\"), and their deepest pleasures (\\"the kinship of souls that is created when everyone gathers in the kitchen to prepare a meal\\"). Reading Little Heathens, you become part of that lovely kinship for a while."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I loved every word of this book! The author grew up fresh and innocent and kind and loving in a very difficult, but pure, time in our history. In this too-short book she goes into all aspects of that life -- the fun, the harships, the extended family, the recipes, schooling, holidays, etc. I would really love another book or two by her, fleshing out some of these chapters. I would especially love a cookbook. I loved the short chapters on their animals and pets! I would like more on her school studies and friends. And more old photos.After reading this book, I fervently wished I could know Mildred Armstrong Kalish. She is obviously a smart and sweet lady, appearing to be very much like my beloved grandmother who was raised in Kansas a few years prior to the time of which this author writes. It is amazing to think what changes she has been through, what changes our country has been through! I hope I don't sound too old when I say that I miss the good ole days, even though I wasn't fortunate enough to have lived through them. I miss the excitement over even the smallest things (birth of an animal, fresh-baked foods) and the simple but important teachings of her ever-present family. I would like more details about the members of her family and herself after she left town and began other adventures -- in the military, teaching, marriage and family, cars, television, etc. HOW this country has changed! Please read this book to re-connect with our roots. It is enlightening and funny and interesting and always educational and entertaining. And everyone today knows how we love our entertainment!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Mildred Armstrong Kalish provides a deep look back to growing up on a farm in Iowa during the Depression. Ms. Kalish's family of seven lived a frugal lifestyle in which three generations resided in the home with the only missing person being her exiled father although why she was not sure. Her cousins lived on nearby farms so the extended family was nearby to help if needed.The key to this superb discerning memoir is Ms. Kalish avoids acrimony and sugared (except when grandpa bought some) nostalgia to provide a vivid picture of a bygone era in which an extended family was there to raise the children with positive values. Life on the farm during harsh economic conditions was fun to a preadolescent Mildred although some chores were simply work. With black and white pictures to enhance the era and \\"farm food\\" recipes that were not microwave, LITTLE HEATHENS is a well written winner providing a powerful look at the 1930s in the Midwest. Ms. Kalish showcases how different life was back then from today when for instance the three Klausner brothers live in Georgia, New Jersey and Texas respectively and outhouses is a Three Stooges' joke.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Even though I am a 42-year-old city girl, this book resonated with me. Ms. Kalish writes with gratifying specificity of \\"the little things that make up a life.\\" You'll wonder how her generation had enough energy to do the endless work it took to survive on a family farm. I'd recommend her story to anyone who is interested in what daily life was like in another era.But here's what moved me to write this review: Ms. Kalish's recipe for Apple Cream Pie! It is an odd, open-faced creation with big chunks of apples and heavy cream poured on top. I've been baking apple pies from scratch all my life, but people keep telling me this is the best one I have ever made. Don't miss her recipe for pie crust, either. Her vegetable-oil crust is not only healthier and much easier than traditional pie crusts, but addictively delicate and crisp. When she tells you, in her intro to the recipe, that you'll never bother making any other type of crust again, she's not lying. I intend to try all the other recipes in this book. How generous of Ms. Kalish to share her time-tested gems with the world."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Mildred Armstrong Kalish is a retired English Professor who has much wisdom to offer in \\"Little Heathens\\". She wrote this book because she deemed it important to share, with the reading public, the great memories and the lifelong lessons she learned growing up on an Iowa farm during the Great Depression.For someone like me, the information I have about the depression era of the 1930's is comprised of facts from history books and periodicals, along with personal accounts from older family members and others who are quick to share what life was like during these times of economic uncertainty. The information offered by grandparents and some of my older aunts and uncles reflects a time that was difficult, but also a time that people came together as a family and took care of each other. When I heard about this book, I was curious about its contents. Would it be similar to the tales often told by older individuals who survived this bleak period in American history? Or, would it offer a fresh take on the situation and present a different overall assessment of this troublesome era?I fully expected this book to offer the typical gloomy account of the depression era 1930's but I am happy to report that the author didn't write the book in this manner. She doesn't speak in blissful, optimistic terms about the Great Depression and her life was by no means without its share of tough times. But Kalish had a different overall experience. Her family was tightly knit and completely self- sufficient. No one worried too much about unemployment or looking for ways to earn a living. The farm took care of everything necessary for survival and even though the work was physically demanding and the days were long, there was never any serious worry about having enough food to eat or a warm bed to sleep in at night. Everything was taken care of, and each family member had specific responsibilities for maintaining the household.This book offers many different lessons about life and chief among them is the recurring theme about self- sufficiency. Most of us live a very different lifestyle from the one described in this book and we would be completely helpless if forced to survive without electricity, grocery stores, computers, cell phones, and most other modern- day conveniences. Kalish describes over and over again in this book her experiences on the farm and how she and her family learned to live with what they had. Not only did she and her siblings know the basics of growing food, making clothing, etc., they also learned different cures for common illnesses and unique and creative ways to have fun.What I enjoy best about this book is the author's sense of optimism and pride. She doesn't speak of the Great Depression as a time of economic difficulties and strife, but rather as a time when she and her extended family worked as a cohesive team: an organized unit fully trained and ready to tackle any obstacle that stood in the way of survival. Kalish speaks with fondness when she describes one of her aunt's influences when it came to cooking or the fascinating experience of milking a cow. She describes her life as challenging, but also as entertaining and full of learning experiences.Overall, \\"Little Heathens\\" is an optimistic, honest, \\"feel- good\\" type of book that will appeal mainly to those who grew up during the Great Depression and who can relate directly to its many words of infinite wisdom. For the rest of us, this book is still enjoyable and valuable for the many life lessons contained within. Mildred Armstrong Kalish learned to be a survivor, and these instincts certainly were responsible for her future success as an educator. She and her various family members have many things to be grateful for and chief among them was the strong family bonds and the spirit of togetherness that made everything possible. It makes for a satisfying read and a refreshing change from the stories of gloom and doom so commonly associated with this era in American history."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"If you have never been on a farm and wonder what life was like when we had no videogames, cell phones, etc., you can do no better than to read this book. Having grown up on a farm in north central Iowa, I can tell you that this story is absolutely true and many of us miss it terribly! Iowans have very strong commitments, to life, to education, to religion, and to a life of independence. Few Americans can claim to living a life that is full. We are all missing something. In this book, you find real people living full, rich lives and they are much the better for it. Read this book and you will understand America much better!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I delved into this book with great anticipation. The author is only a few years younger than my mother and the area she writes about in rural Iowa is just 50 miles east of where my grandfather was born. It brought back a lot of memories for me as I am sure it will for many other readers.There were many things to like in this book that combines anecdotes from the 1930s with recipes and how to do things the old way. I enjoyed the anecdotes and would have enjoyed the book if it had been sprinkled with less of the recipes and more of the stories from the 1930s--stories which ranged from poignant to laugh-out-loud funny. Her stories range from such events as box socials (and giving a complete explanation of what one is for those who may not know) to how to gather honey from bees (and what happens if you do it the wrong way). She tells of how hard work it was it was back in the day, but does recall there was time for a bit of leisure as well.At once a memoir, a how-to book, and a cookbook, Kalish tells her story with enthusiasm but with a bit of pompousness that was a bit unnecessary. She acts as if she was the only person ever to know how to do some of these things described and that her way was the only way. Heck, I am 25 years younger than she is and I can remember doing many of the same things at my grandparents' farm in North Dakota two decades later, and even do some of these same things today. Although the subtitle mentions \\"hard times\\" it is clear that due to help from her grandparents and a self-sufficient farm, Kalish and her siblings never really went without anything on her farm during the depression so anyone who is reading this book and expects it to be a true hardship tale best look elsewhere. It is a great look down memory lane for those from Kalish's generation who I am sure will enjoy reading and reminiscing about another time and place. It seems though that most of the time the author is writing for an audience who hasn't lived through any of these events, remembers none of these times (stoking an old wood fire, splitting wood,making head cheese, butchering a chicken, making May Day baskets). That said, it is quick interesting read but recommended with reservations as although a memoir, how-to book and cookbook, it doesn't completely succeed at any of these."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Little Heathens is a wonderful memoir, heartwarming, but without a hint of treacle. Mildred Kalish grew up during tough times on an Iowa farm and lived a life many would complain about, but there is no bitterness in her story, simply an appreciation of her life and a love of her family. I read a lot of books and I have to say this one is like no other--an inspiring, yet wholly enjoyable story. I recommended this one to two people during the space of half an hour, one is 75, the other is 11, and both simply loved it. I would recommend it to all in between as well.

It is today a world foreign in this age of convenience and Millie laments the loss of the \\"rich store of knowledge that had been bestowed on us by life on that simple farm,\\" and the self-confidence and self-reliance it fostered. It's odd that this simple little memoir - nothing more than an elder grandparent retelling what life was like \\"when I was young\\" - has struck a chord with so many readers, it is one of the New York Times 10 most notable books of 2007. The Times attributes its success in part because so many memoirs today are about unsavory people doing scandalous things, it is a relief to read about a real person going about a \\"normal\\" life (if such a thing exists), someone you'd like to have as a relative or friend, or even to walk in her shoes (when she wore any). Partly it is Millie herself who is humble, sincere and likable.But it is also, I believe, about bigger current day issues: Global Warming, Peak Oil, Recessions, high food prices and other man-made slow motion train wrecks have many questioning if society is on the right track and naturally many are looking back to the past for answers. A return to the country, simplicity, slow pace of life, the values of thrift, honor and tradition are finding wides audiences in modern forms, such as organics, slow food, alternative energy. They say when you reach a certain age \\"everything old is new again\\" and Millies account of the 1930s is finding a lot of interest in these times. It's a beautiful book of substance and simplicity, I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I was really expecting this to be interesting.

This is the sort of thing that would be a treasure for a family, and belongs in Iowan history collections. I don't really understand why it was published, let alone so well received. My opinion of of the New York Times's literary taste was not enhanced.This is occasionally interesting, but at times fragments into a mishmash of scattered reminisces, and was at times so boring that only the fact that I was reading it for a book club kept me going. I also found the author's smug self-satisfaction off-putting. Does the frugal upbringing of which she so frequently boasts explain why she drove a basic, economical car like a Cadillac? Armstrong never does deal with the disconnect between her happy memories of the past, and the fact that she ran from that life as fast as she could. I often wondered as I read this if she is very disappointed in her children and grandchildren, as she tells us about her uplifting childhood that is so different from \\"kids today\\". Perhaps that explains a nostalgia for a life she didn't care to live as an adult. Otherwise, I guess she is just a nostalgia bore, like so many people, wanting to see a golden age in the past that apparently wasn't all that pleasant at the time."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"A five Star book for me!Even tho' I was born in SD in '42, I could relate to many of the chapters, but ours was a much less difficult time.I have sent copies of the book to 2 cousins and a close friend from Iowa who needed a good laugh to help him through some tough times. This book will definitely \\"take you away\\" and give you the therapy of many good laughs. You will also count your blessings that we live in this age.I compared it to Laura Ingalls Wilder books... with the tough times... except the Iowans were surrounded by generations of family in the same location; rather than a family alone moving from state to state enduring those hardships. What a heartwarming wonderfully written book that you just want to share with all, and hope that it brings them as many laughs and as much food for thought as you got while reading it."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Although of a different generation I have parents who lived through the depression, and not far from Garrison. This book echoes many of the stories I've heard in my family. It should remind us all how wasteful we are now and be a guide on how to be less so. Thank you Mrs. Kalish for this delightful history lesson."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I absolutely savored this book! After reading the first few chapters and found it be so delightful, I decided to only read a chapter each night before going to bed. It describes life on an Iowa farm during the depression years for a large family and how they work together, enjoying life despite hardships. Their many experiences as a family, the interactions of the siblings, their successes and disappointments kept my interest throughout. I read this book when it was loaned to me and enjoyed it so much I bought two, a copy for me and sent one to a friend who grew up in a large farm family during the 40s and 50s, not far removed from the depression era of the book. I will read this book again!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I also grew up in very rural Iowa in the early 1950s and my childhood was very much the same described in LITTLE HEATHENS. Anyone that wants to know about farm life will learn a lot from reading this book. There are also a lot of old saying explained. I liked the book so much that I bought 2 more to send to my brothers."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Cheap and a great bargain. Really enjoyed this story. After you read awhile, you get more involved in the characters and their lives. Book was in great shape!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This is a great book - especially for people born and raised around that time. Brings back many, many memories. I highly recommend it not only to that age but also to the younger group who could benefit a bit by reading what the \\"real world\\" was like for their parents or grandparents."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Delightful memoir about a time never to be experienced again. A real piece of Americana."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"For months, I passed the shelf at the book store on which this book sat. I mean, I picked it up occasionally, I read the blurb on the back, and then I would stare at the front as if waiting for a sign to buy it. Finally, I would set it back on the shelf from whence it came. It might look like a deliciously interesting piece of literature, but it had the distinct smell of a history book in disguise. Everyone knows the books of which I speak, the ones that lure you in with the promises of a rich and colorful glimpse at history and then turn out to be nothing more than a glorified textbook. Yeah those books. Well, I was determined not to have another one of \\"those books\\" polluting my bookshelf. So, I took a stand and refused to buy it, until the day I gave in and bought it. What can I say? I have an addiction.Once the book was purchased reading it became my number one priority. After all, I wanted to prove to myself that no matter how seductive the book seemed to be, it was really a textbook knock off. I read the whole book front to back, and from it I drew two conclusions. Number one: I was absolutely right the book was a deliciously interesting piece of nonfiction literature. Number two: a little bit of simple goes a long, long way.Mildred Armstrong Kalish, a retired English professor, is the person responsible for this well-written, vividly colorful account of the Great Depression. She writes from her own experience of being a child and growing up on a farm, an Iowa farm nonetheless, during the Great Depression. Talk about interesting, this book is a mind blower. Anyone who has ever wished that life was a little bit simpler, a little bit friendlier, or little bit more carefree needs to buy this book and read it.Chapter by chapter, this book sucks you in and takes you back to times long passed and forgotten. This book will teach you how to catch a raccoon and turn it into a pet, tell you about customs that have long since died out, like the gifting and receiving of \\"May Baskets,\\" and even let you in on why there were two toilet seats in the outhouse instead of one. You'll get directions on how to build a \\"Never-Fail\\" fire, how to get the most out of an egg, and how to get rid of a boil using a beet.The book provides a small wealth of recipes for the home cook. I've made several of them and they have all been delicious. My favorite is the recipe for \\"Cabbage Salad,\\" although it is more like a coleslaw; I made it for New Years and everybody loved it. A couple examples of other recipes offered are Corn Oysters and Applesauce Cake.The book provides more than a glimpse at what it was like to do laundry back then, the amount of work that went into keeping a farm, and how leisure time was spent by everyone from the children to the men. The book also provides a variety of common home remedies, from curing a cough to curing blood poisoning.Each chapter of the book provides a window to a specific aspect of life during the Great Depression. Separated, the chapters are amazing, astounding, and delightful; together, they join seamlessly to provide an uplifting account of life during a difficult and trying time. The book is rich and colorful in its detail and story-telling yet still maintains its historical integrity. It is the perfect novel. If you could only read one novel this year, I would highly advise reading this one. This book will remain at the very top of my bookshelf forever. Happy Reading!!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Whether you grew up on a farm and lived through the depression or just know someone who did, this is the book for you and for them. It paints a picture of a time and a place that was magical in spite of the difficult times. This is a trip in nostalgia, with humor in the reality, and it is definitely real. The hardships were dealt with and accepted. They 'made do' without fuss or self pity. You will recognize your Mom and Dad, your brothers and sisters, your cousins and neighbors on these pages. It is a chance to visit with them, to be there once again - what a good time I had and you will too.

Although it chronicles life on an Iowa farm during the great Depression, it speaks to how many of our grandparents lived and worked. I loved the descriptions of maiden aunts, cooking, funny sayings, descriptions of how children spent their days and how they grew to know what was important in life. I am not that old and I still think that a return to some of the values discussed such as hard work, self sufficiency, and emphasis on education, and family life would benefit us all. The book is funny, and not at all heavy handed... it comes across as being entertaining and engaging. I wish the author would write another. It is a quick read but is also a book that could be read aloud because each chapter could stand alone as a wonderful vignette."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This book was very well written and very entertaining.

Mildred A. Kalish captures the experience of growing up during the depression on a farm so completely. Her book is an inspiration and so very highly recommended.

Good portrayal."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This woman has indeed written a memoir for her generation. My niece was assigned this book in a Biography class in college. She was not particularly taken with it but had the good judgment to know that her Grandma, who grew up in rural / small town North Carolina during the depression, would enjoy it. Niece hit a home run - Granda RAVED about the book, finding that it captured perfectly her childhood experiences - hard times AND good ones. She would call laughing about different episodes in the book. We could tell this was special. We have since given it to a number of friends and relatives who lived in areas as diverse as upstate New York, Texas, and the mountains of North Carolina. They have been uniformly enthusiastic and grateful for the opportunity to relive their childhood memories with such a knowing storyteller. Thumbs up, high fives - BUY THIS BOOK for anyone you know in that generation who had a rural touch to their lives and enjoys reading. This is a very inexpensive gift that will bring invaluable pleasure to your older friends and relatives."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Imagine that you are having a delighful conversation with your grandma, sitting before a cozy fire, while she feeds you warm applesauce cake fresh from the oven. She tells stories of how the Little Kids and the Big Kids got together one Fourth of July and practically blew themselves and the house up by stuffing explosives down a lead pipe. She tells you how Old Man Mealhouse tricked the outhouse tippers one dark Hallowe'en with messy consequences, and how during cold winter nights she snuggled up with a small raccoon sleeping under her chin, another one at her feet. Warm, tender barefoot days of summer, gathering walnuts in fall, eating ripe tomatoes straight off the vine, and putting a good meal on the table. Does it get any better than that?No, and yes. It wasn't all fun and games for Millie Kalish growing up on a farm in Iowa during the Great Depression. Millie's family suffered back-breaking labor, freezing winters, and a heart-breaking infant mortality rate. There was no electricity and no indoor plumbing. Doctors were scarce and money even scarcer. But the down-to-earth frankness with which Millie talks about their hardships never leaves you feeling depressed. If anything, the fortitude with which these hardy Iowans met their difficulties was inspiring.Are those days gone for good? Millie asks that plaintive question several times, wondering if anyone out there remembers box socials and May baskets. I don't, but I can personally attest to the fact that farm life has not changed all that much in most of the world. And, if you were raised in one of the more remote rural areas, you will understand the meaning of the phrase \\"everybody pulls together.\\" There are still places where the strawberries are flavor-packed and luscious (my garden), where nature is close at hand, and where wildly careening down a swollen stream is the epitome of fun. All those things still exist. But what may indeed be lost is \\"a sense of security, a sense of belonging in the world.\\" Even for those people still living on farms, still growing their own food and putting it on the table, there is a feeling of displacement. The world is (too much) with us, but not in ways that encourage a sense of security and belonging. And that, truly, is a terrible loss."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"My mother who grew up on a farm in Missouri and lived through the depression on up through 2004 told me stories of growing up on a farm and I found this woman's experiencies much like some of the stories my mom told me.

He and his father were both great storytellers and their stories caused me to be quite fascinated with that time and place in history. This book was great for filling me in on a girl's perspective on Midwest farm life in the 1930's. I'm so glad she wrote the book--her generation is dying and with each death, so many memories die. At least what Ms. Kalish wrote here won't die."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"A charming book, I am just a year younger than the author and grew up on a farm in Ohio.

Kind of a \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" for grown-ups."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"If you are looking for a Great Depression story fraught with misery, this is not the book for you - instead perhaps consider \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" Kalish spent her childhood, and we're talking single digit years, living the frugal Iowa farm life to the maximum. This book is a hodgepodge or characters, events, recipes, and home remedies that all come together to form a picture of what it was like for one family during a particularly difficult time in American history.I was expecting tales of unthinkable sacrifice and tumbleweeds blowing across the barren land, and while there was plenty of sacrifice and hard work, Kalish looks back fondly on her childhood, reveling in these memories and reflecting on how her upbringing influenced her adult life. This book was actually enjoyable to read and I found myself laughing at the stories being told. Imagine that, laughter during the Great Depression. I never got the sense that Kalish feels as though she missed out on childhood filled with frivolity, and that gratified satisfaction is refreshing.If you are from the Midwest or have family from the Midwest (especially Iowa), I can say with confidence that it would be a safe bet to pick up a copy of this book. It gave me new appreciation for the luxuries in my life and new meaning to the idea of \\"letting nothing go to waste.\\" What continues to amaze me is that Kalish did all of this without asking for pity or taking me on a \\"woe is me\\" guilt trip, and as a reader, I am grateful."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"Although I didn't grow up in Iowa, I was born during the Depression years and grew up on a quasi farm; and many of the stories told here brought back some very poignant memories for me. Like the author, we were pretty poor in material things but very wealthy in things that matter - love, loyalty, appreciation for things we did have and the necessity for making our own fun instead of relying on expensive toys, dedication to family, etc. This book, while somewhat simple and easy to read, is a wonderful story and provides lessons of real value, reminding us that money and material do not translate into happiness; but, rather, those things come from within and are much of our own making!"},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This book was a veryveryvery good summer read.

The descriptions of the food for large family dinners makes your mouth water. The work to make the meal is amazing. I could feel the hot summer nights, reminding me of my own childhood. Filled with stories of a large country family that has grown close out of the Depression, this book is filled with cousins, aunts, uncles, grampas and grammas, the rural community is splendidly interwoven."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I loved this book. The account of life on an Iowa farm in the depression 1930s was both stunning and compelling. It's a way of life unknown to so many people in our country today, yet not far in the past at all. I know only vestiges of it, such as seeing my mother use a wringer washing machine, but mostly from hearing my parents tell about the way they grew up. While reading it, I was torn between wishing I could go back and live in that time and place, and being so very glad I can go to a supermarket and get excellent chicken without having to behead, gut, and singe the feathers off, then cut it all up myself! But the thread running through is the learning of self-sufficiency, pulling together, rising above, the building of good character, all of which is a huge help to one through life's hills and valleys. It's well worth going back to have a look at this way of life and what we've gained and lost."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This book brought back a host of memories from my own Midwestern childhood, although mine took place nearly fifty years after hers.

My mother is the same age as the author and eventhough she was raised on a Michigan farm, there are similarities on views of hard work, a child's place in the home, and a time for relaxation with the family. My mother often said \\" we were lucky to grow up on a farm so we had enough to eat.\\" This book is charming...not to sugary sweet and definitely no feeling sorry for themselves for the circumstances in the country.The relatives are self reliant. All are interesting. The author really gives us a flavor of the diverse personalities in the family.The stories of \\"the big kids\\" and \\"the little kids\\" are a hoot.

I was disappointed, though, not to learn what became of the various family members, how they lived out the rest of their lives, whether Millie's Mom ever remarried, and what happened to her father.

The author's reminiscences about growing up on an Iowa farm are interesting because her formativeyears were the difficult years of the Great Depression, when economy and making do with what one had were important virtues. She demonstrates the way in which the family was extraordinarily thrifty in saving and making use of every scrap of food, piece of clothing and spare bit of thread.Like a number of the books that have been written about people's lives inmore exotic locations, like \\"A Year in Provence\\" or \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\", the author also provides some recipes that she particularly enjoyed when she lived on the farm in addition to when she prepared meals for afamily. The variety of home remedies are also fun to take a look at. On the whole, it is an entertaining book as well as a lesson in how times of thrift and privation needn't be unhappy."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"This is a wonderful glimpse at depression era farm life.

For those who remember that time and those places, her honestly-written story and pithy anecdotes on everything from school to chores to church and hand-me-downs will evoke memories good and bad of having been somewhere near there and having done something like that- or at least knowing someone who did.

She makes the setting and times come alive and I especially enjoyed getting a glimpse of my parent's generation and what their childhood might have been like.The values she was taught as a child enabled her to become a member of the armed forces, go to college and become a college professor. Her family offered love and support to its members in times that were very challenging. This proves that it doesn't take a lot of money to become a succesful member of society as an adult.Some of the remedys for first aid I remember hearing from my parents and their siblings.It is truly worth your time to buy and read."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"My wife borrowed a copy of Little Heathens from our daughter, read it, and said I might like to read it.

I'm sure it will be especially interesting to those who, like me, grew up in the Depression."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"It would be a mistake to read this book through the lens of nostalgia. Certainly the childhood Kalish describes is very appealing, particularly her commentaries on how her family fostered thrift and independence. It's always tempting to think that the past is somehow a better place. However few of us, I suspect, would wish to return to a time when a failed marriage could mark a woman for life (and Kalish is clear about the effect of this on her mother) or when one measure of a woman's worth was the degree of shine on her windowpanes (and Kalish is clear about her disdain for that particular preoccupation). It's also important to remember that this memoir is just one view of the Depression years; Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" (1939), which is based on his firsthand observations of California migrants, tells a very different story. I'm a teacher, and I read this book with a group of high school seniors, for whom the book was a revelation, particularly in its descriptions of how little Kalish's family relied on purchased goods and how much she and her siblings relied on imagination, not expensive sports equipment, in creating their own fun. For them (and for me) the book is interesting not because it evokes a better time and place but because it suggests that life on a Depression-era Iowa farm might teach us a few things relevant to our present circumstances, economic ones included."},{"Title":"Little Heathens: Hard Times and High Spirits on an Iowa Farm During the Great Depression","review":"I read aloud so many parts of this great book to my husband that he just had to read the whole thing for himself - brought back many, many memories - funny how hard times can be remembered so favorably!

My husband loves it as he learned a good trick: he wears expensive leather work gloves, the right hand ALWAYS wore out first, he had 9 left handed gloves laying around. The book told the story of a family that 'made do' with what they had during hard times. Turn the left hand glove inside out and you have a right hander. So many little things that this family did, I can still turn a shirt collar like my gramma taught me. A great and fine story during the Great Depression of an Iowa farm family with several children.

It didn't take long time before I understand that this story began before we were human beings. It began when we were apes. It told me what happened in each part on this world through time, how medicine had developed and how it became to what it's now.

Each section includes great details of the history, followed by well written articles on what there is to see and do today. Special areas of interest to me are railroads and mining. The book has certainly peaked my interest in all the beauty of the Colorado front range.

This slim guidebook is packed full of historical info and peppered with fun facts. Outstanding photos, concise writing and a snazzy lay-out combine to make this a very usable guidebook. If you are a Front Range &quot;local&quot; this is a great book to have on hand when out-of-state family and friends descend.

By providing a diverse range of chapter authors rather than offering readings dominated by the traditional perspective, the editors expose their readers to perspectives different than are traditionally found in textbooks.This book is well organized and written to address wide-ranging implications for the study of how great ideas have been obscured in the traditional presentation of psychology. The book provides a balanced presentation of the burgeoning issues within the field of psychology. I am especially pleased with the careful treatment of the largely misunderstood ideas of both Wundt and James, two early founders of the discipline, whose original ideas are only now being recognized by the field of psychology."},{"Title":"Horse Conformation: Structure, Soundness, and Performance","review":"This book covers ALOT of stuff-Conformation(good & bad), bone stucture, muscle structure, Most conformational faults and even has a section on breeds, types and colors(the color section is lacking simply because it is all black and white). It also lacks in the description department. It leaves many pictures without enough explanation about why this conformational 'fault' is a bad thing or what a horse can still do well enough in spite of his less admired physical traits.(lets face it, there are plenty of horses out there that are less than perfect but they are sure keeping someon happy) Some of the pictures barely get descriptions. But there is plenty there to keep a person reading quite a while and this IS the first book I've read with so much on the subject. I would reccomend it as something to have on hand as a reference but keep on the lookout for another book that could help fill in the gaps. Maybe they will come out with a revised and updated edition. Overall this book is pretty handy."},{"Title":"Horse Conformation: Structure, Soundness, and Performance","review":"If you are interested in getting a well described picture of the author's idea of good conformation, you will probably be dissatisfied with this book. As an example, on page 200 (paperback) figure 8-20, the explanation of a profile of the rear portion of a horse says, \\" If the croup and thigh are fairly long, the hindquarters have a triangular shape.\\" Certainly drawing straight lines between three points (the point of the hip to the point of the buttock to the stifle) forms a triangle. In order to be of any value however, it is important that the type triangle formed be named (possibly an equilateral triangle?).The point I would like to make is that the book seems to be thrown together from different sources in what, to me, seems a slipshod manner. Some areas are helpful, but overall, in my opinion, the lack of attention to detail by either the author or the editor, or both is problematic.An example of a book on the subject, which I think was prepared to be truly useful, is \\"The Horse Conformation Handbook\\" by Heather Smith Thomas."},{"Title":"Horse Conformation: Structure, Soundness, and Performance","review":"the only think missing would be more info on how structure relates to performance, having a hard time finding a good book with lots of that info."},{"Title":"Horse Conformation: Structure, Soundness, and Performance","review":"This is probably the best conformation book I have ever owned.

This is very hard information to find here in Japan. Many of the sources I was able to find pointed to this book as their source material. I originally balked at buying it due to its prohibitively high cost ($150 new). In fact, I never did buy it at its full price. A $150 book is just not something I can justify buying. Luckily I was able to purchase an older copy here on Amazon much cheaper.I have some complaints. The largest is the price. This book is simply, flat out, too expensive. Not many people need a book like this, so I can understand why the price is inflated. If your customer base is small, the price needs to be high in order to make it worth your time. Nonetheless, it is still too expensive in my opinion.My other complaint is on how the data is organized. The data has been gathered in five year long sections (1941 - 1945, 2001 - 2005...etc.). So, in order to gather data, I need to not just look it up once, but many times...twice per decade, in fact. This can be very time consuming and frustrating. Because the data they have chosen to show in their book though can vary from section to section (No buggy whips were mentioned in the year 2000...and no computers were sold in the 1930s...etc.) it makes sense why they would group it this way...but nonetheless, I have to believe that a better method of organizing the data could be thought of.It's an essential for those who need historic pricing data. I'm not completely happy with the purchase though. Three stars feels about right."},{"Title":"The Value of a Dollar - Millennium Edition","review":"This book is a highly detailed and simply invaluable research tool for writers, historians, teachers, etc. Some books give you a quick sampling -- ie, bread cost so much, milk cost so much, a car cost so much -- without giving you any more specifics or backing up their stated facts with sources. But THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR digs deeper, giving you comparisons (high end cars, low end cars), plus charts of how much people in various professions made (while Elvis made ten million in one year in the '50's, a secretary with typing and shorthand typically earned around $85 a week). You can check out the grocery section to see how fruits, vegetables, and all household staples stacked up against a person's basic salary and how much of their income went for basic necessities -- or look at the cost of entertainments (movies, theater tickets, sporting events, games) in any particular era. Simply fascinating reading, carefully documented (columns typically list which publications the prices or salaries came from).

That being said it still may hold some value for those who are clueless. It breaks internet and pc related information down in a way that will help a novice in this area grasp a few concepts.If you need stock market 101, 102, and so on, then this is not really a good book. I found that the author trivializes some trading practices that could prove to be dangerous to inexperienced investors. It does give a decent general overview about online trading, and what to expect; however, you can generally get that out off of the e-broker's tutorials."},{"Title":"With the Phoenix Rising: Lessons from Ten Resilient Women Who Overcame the Trauma of Childhood Sexual Abuse","review":"My therapist gave me this book after I finished therapy and reading the book summed up my life as a resilient survivor. Until I read the book I really didn't realize just how resilient I was. I had always thought of myself as unsuccessful and not useful, but it is amazing to see in print just how successful my life is considering how traumatic and abusive the childhood-adolescent years of my life were. Working in therapy helped more than words can describe, and this book is the closure that I needed. It's nice to know there are so many women who are resilient after such oppressive childhoods. The title really does sum up resiliency in myself and hundreds of other women."},{"Title":"With the Phoenix Rising: Lessons from Ten Resilient Women Who Overcame the Trauma of Childhood Sexual Abuse","review":"I am most fortunate to have received an early copy and have already taken aid of the book for treatment in one of my abuse cases.

A superb work and I hope to meet the authors during my future visits to the U.S.A."},{"Title":"With the Phoenix Rising: Lessons from Ten Resilient Women Who Overcame the Trauma of Childhood Sexual Abuse","review":"This book is mostly about resiliency. It is so reassuring and the review of the 10 cases provides examples to describe the resilient characteristics and decisions of the survivors. While it is hard to imagine a book that is equally helpful to both the lay person and professionals, this book has that unusual quality. I never though of myself as survivor as being resilient. This book allowed me to see my resiliency, which has played a recent role in my healing."},{"Title":"Your Bible and You","review":"What a wonderful little book! The author brings home points in such an easy to understand fashion that it's almost embarrassing that the reader didn't think of the points first. Very informative without being dry or dull, the artwork is a bit dated but still relevant to what many of us over 40 remember as The Way Things Were. I recommend for anyone who is interested in knowing more about their Bible and doesn't wish to be bored or overwhelmed with too much information. An easy read for adults and older children."},{"Title":"Your Bible and You","review":"The book is excellent and is a good bible study aid for the whole family.

As expected, the book is much 'richer' in content than the movie could be. That's not to take anything away from the movie. It stands on it's own. Likewise, the book stands on it's own.The wealth of back ground material in the book is great. The author 'footnotes' to the relevant piece of factual history around which the story takes place. If you truly like history, as I do, you'll appreciate that detail. Today we call these types of works 'Faction'.I'm trying to find more books by this author.He had another of his novels recreated on the screen.

Ray Simpson is Guardian of the Community of Aidan and Hilda, as well as the founder of the Lindisfarne Mustard Seed Project. He is thus well-qualified to write on this subject and this book is evident testimony to this. Read it and use it!"},{"Title":"Celtic Worship Through the Year: Prayers, Readings and Creative Activities for Ordinary Days and Saints' Days","review":"This volume has services for the days of the week, important days on the liturgical calendar, and for the honoring of various Celtic saints. The services include times for singing (and occasional suggestions for the song/hymn) but does not include the text or music of any songs. Most of the prayers are original but some prayers are drawn from the Carmina Gadelica and other traditional prayers. While this may be used for private worship, it is designed for public worship and so sufficient copies should be bought. This would be the best arrangement for a stable group that is going to make continued use of the services. An alternative is to buy this volume and then purchase the CD containing pretty much the same text, which can be modified and specific services printed for public worship events... However, you would still want to have this in book form for easy reference and sense of layout."},{"Title":"The Xhitalian War: No Man's Land","review":"The author has told a story that transcends its genre.

I have a greater understanding and appreciation of what war is all about. Dad did not want to talk about what he saw and experienced when he was alive. He shared his scrapbooks on a few occasions, dodging some questions that were too close to him.When Dad died, I sent a letter to &quot;the outfit&quot; as he referred to the men with whom he served. I had some wonderful letters and calls from men who had shared a part of his life that I never knew. But, I now know better from reading this book, the courage and determination that these men showed just to survive the day to day part of the war. The horrors that these men shared needed to be buried until someone could put them into a context for the rest of us to truly understand and appreciate them. The author has done that in a vivid, yet compassionate manner. Everyone needs to read this book. Thank you, Mr. Towne for revealing this part of the war to the rest of us."},{"Title":"Doctor Danger Forward: A World War II Memoir of a Combat Medical Aidman, First Infantry Division","review":"If you want to learn what it was really like fighting to save lives with the U.S. Medical Corps in World War II, give this newly released personal account by Allen N. Towne a try. Mr. Towne relates his five years'service as a frontline medic with the First Infantry Division in North Africa, Sicily, Omaha Beach, as well as France, Belgium, and Germany. He carries you along with him as a former college student who finds himself in the thick of some of the war's bloodiest battles. You will find it difficult not to read it straight through in one sitting."},{"Title":"Doctor Danger Forward: A World War II Memoir of a Combat Medical Aidman, First Infantry Division","review":"I thought this book captured the essence of the tumult of three years of combat. I was spellbound by the way relationships developed and deepened. The author raised the question of why men respond so differently to the trauma of combat and war. A well-written story."},{"Title":"Doctor Danger Forward: A World War II Memoir of a Combat Medical Aidman, First Infantry Division","review":"This is one of the few books that deal with the combat medic. For the most part the medics roll is just a foot note in other works but this writing is all about the medics of the 1st Division.Sgt. Towne basically took his day reports and added his commentary to give a more complete picture of the day to day activities of Company B. It is not a polished historical read like you would expect form Ambrose, but I feel Sgt Towne's perspective (as a true to life, been there done that) gives him the view point that other historians could only wish they had.This book was of particular interest to me; do to the fact that my father was a platoon leader in Company B, from April to August 1944. His name was briefly mentioned when he was wounded on August 6th (my father was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his action on this day). I was able to locate the general movements of my father but disappointingly not specific actions. Many of Sgt. Towne's commentaries refer to other platoons but not by name; however I feel that I did gain a lot of information that is not located in any other writing.I would recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Doctor Danger Forward: A World War II Memoir of a Combat Medical Aidman, First Infantry Division","review":"Towne has given us a firsthand account of many of the significant American battles of WWII from a combat medic's perspective.

And do remember, in Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court voted twice in Bush's favor with the main issue of equal protection being decided at 7-2."},{"Title":"Steal This Vote: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America","review":"Because elections are the foundation of any functioning democracy, Andrew Gumbel's illuminating book serves as a sort-of alternate history of American \\"democracy.\\" His historical research sheds some light on the long-held American tradition of dirty elections, and his report on electronic voting machines should be mandatory reading for anybody who considers themselves a true patriot.His chapter on the 2004 election, however, is riddled with inaccuracies and oversights. Gumbel obviously did not read \\"What Went Wrong in Ohio,\\" a.k.a. the Conyers report (available on Amazon). If he had, he would have known that the recount in Ohio was rigged by partisan technicians, and therefore, not a true confirmation of Bush's \\"victory.\\" Team Bush stole the 2004 election, in ways far more subversive than 2000, thus averting 36 days of legal deliberations and partisan spin. All the evidence is hidden in plain sight, lucidly compiled in \\"Fooled Again\\" by Mark Crispin Miller (for the sake of full disclosure, I worked on Miller's book, but will not recieve a penny from its sales. My intention is to encourage people to read as much as possible about the current state of our electoral system).Read Gumbel's book. Then supplement it with Miller's and the Conyers report. Decide for yourself: was the 2004 election stolen?"},{"Title":"Steal This Vote: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America","review":"Gumbel has run over the history of American electoral fraud, starting as early as 1788 and running through extensive discussions of the 2000 and 2004 elections.On the way we learn about a number of fascinating scandals of the past, now largely forgotten, along with some that haven't been, such as the famous Tammany Hall gang that dominated New York City for a decade. Gumbel shows that, while big-city corruption got the publicity, elections in many rural areas were equally dirty. He also show how periodic concerns over ballot box stuffing have resulted in a numbr of reforms that, by making voting harder, have effectively lowered participation, which was once at around 80% of eligible voters, and now is sometimes below 50%. For instance, the secret ballot, by replacing earlier party-distributed ballots that had shown, by color and logos, which party they represented, had the quite intentional effect of disenfranchising many illiterate immigrants and former slaves. The practice of denying the vote to convicted felons even after completion of their sentence was invented entirely to prevent former slaves from voting, and is used to disenfranchise blacks to this day, as notably happened in Florida 2000.Gumbel's discussion of the Florida crisis is useful, although I thought a little too hard on Gore. His discussion of Ohio 2004, which he feels was clearly a legitimate victory, although he does show the strong evidence of illegitimate means used to suppress the Kerry vote, is obviously unconvincing for many of his readers here. (It's interesting to note that, although the book really works not to be a partisan tract, the reviewers on Amazon seem to be overwhelmingly Democrats.)The extensive discussion in this book of touch screen voting shows clearly how flawed the technology is in current form. He also adds a fascinating historical perspective by showing how past changes, earlier voting machines and punch card ballots, were promoted in their time as technological wonders which would eliminate corruption and make voting easier.One thing that is very convincing indeed in this section is the discussion of how professional election administrators have repeatedly ignored, downplayed, or just flat lied about the flaws in technology they have committed taxpayer money to, both with e-voting and with previous technologies. I used to think that the professionals who explained how my fears of touch screen voting were groundless probably knew what they were talking about, since they worked with the systems so closely. I won't ever trust those quotes again after reading this book.Gumbel's discussion of touch screen voting in other countries is also interesting, both for how he shows that such advanced nations as Venezuela do far better than the US at holding clean and reliable elections, as well as some anecdotes showing that American voting equipment companies have just as doubtful a record overseas as they do at home. This section will give you the mild relief of knowing that the way they're screwing up our elections is (probably) more a matter of corporate greed and incompetence than a deep conspiracy to install permanent right-wing government by fixing elections."},{"Title":"Steal This Vote: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America","review":"Wow! After 2000 and 2004 I really did feel like the crisis of electoral politics in the US was systemic but not until Gumbel's book did I realize that the history is all there, well there in HIS book, not in my high school or college history books. Thank heaven he ends with tangible suggestions for solutions and ways to return us to a true democracy. Now the job is to organize to make those suggestions into reality."},{"Title":"Steal This Vote: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America","review":"I was really impressed with this book. This is an incredibly important topic, and the author is so immensely knowledgeable, and his handling of the material is so comprehensive and fair, that by the end, I felt closer to grasping what's been going on with American politics than ever before. It turned my perception of the whole voting process in America completely around (I really never suspected it was THIS bad). If you have any interest at all in politics (and if you don't, well, you might be past saving), you should read this, and pass it along, and talk about it. It's an eye-opener. And so entertaining! I laughed out loud several times, and throughout, I felt that the author was presenting really substantial, weighty information in an appealing, witty style. (It's a fun book to cart around, too -- about 15 people stopped me and asked me about the book after glimpsing the title.)"},{"Title":"Steal This Vote: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America","review":"The election travesties of 2000 and 2004 left me angry and disgusted. I'm still angry and disgusted about those events and their conduct, but after reading Gumbel's book, I've softened my impressions a bit and redirected the focus of my ire and disgust. It's clear to me now that no American political party has ever seriously objected to election theft as long as the result was victory. Since achieving honest elections has never been an honest goal (except temporarily for the losers), a party in power has never had genuine interest in realizing honest results! So, here we are.I shouldn't be surprised at all that, but Gumbel's detail, clarity and focus make me wonder why I'm so late coming to the full realization table.Gumbel provides clear insight.

But far from it, Mr Gumbel has documented and told a quite extraordinary and at times amazing tale. Whether he is right in every detail I have no idea but either way it ought to have every US citizen asking some very tough questions. Politics can be a venal game but surely the actual electoral process itself ought to be above question. Sadly it seems in the USA it's not."},{"Title":"Steal This Vote: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America","review":"This book has gone almost unnoticed in the media. It is clear that Republican operatives took advantage of the fact that there really is no legal penalty for election tampering. Therefore, fixing elections is as American as apple pie. No penalty, no reason not to do it. Ask anyone you know in politics, especially if they didn't win, and they will tell you. Sad."},{"Title":"Steal This Vote: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America","review":"A great read. A great history with the premise that every election since George Washington in the US has been marred with dirty political dealings. LBJ and Jefferson seem to be the worst offenders outside the obvious candidacies of Nixon and George W. Bush."},{"Title":"Steal This Vote: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America","review":"Steal This Vote is a fascinating book whose interesting premise is unfortunately marred by a boring and choppy writing style. Gumbel's accusations, arguments and images are stirring and rather frightening; the fact that elections have been stolen for the last two hundred years isn't exactly encouraging to those supporting election reform. He paints a very clear picture of each point in election-stealing history, from the early days of the Republic to Chicago's Daley machine to the 2000 and 2004 debacles. Each shocking detail comes out fast and harsh, which is alarming (as it should be) for the first few chapters, but then soon becomes repetitive and tiring. That doesn't keep the whole story from enlightening the reader, however. Even if I struggled to get through this book, I learned the history of elections in this country and how they are taken for granted and are almost never clean. And though I am constantly distressed by the American population's election habits, Gumbel's suggestions for reform are reasonable goals for which I will fight to the end. With some more editing, perhaps a new edition of this book could be more easily read, and I think it should be read. This population is too ignorant of its system's workings; if the people knew that their perfect democracy is not so perfect, there would be hell to pay, and then there may at last be change."},{"Title":"Steal This Vote: Dirty Elections and the Rotten History of Democracy in America","review":"A neat book.

Despite some fawning passages about the late mayor &amp; demagogue Frank Rizzo, Kane isn't too far off the mark about the Fluffia political scene. The characterizations of media legend, John Facenda (WCAU anchor and voice of NFL Films), however strain credulity.Kane focuses more on his work at WCAU and KYW rather than the ground breaking work at WPVI in the early '70's. His contribution to WPVI's Action News continues to make it the #1 broadcast 30 years hence yet little is dished on crosstown rivals like Jim Gardner, Marc Howard, and company. The book closes on a weak note with a lot of local name dropping.However, the book still rates four stars for it's content, writing, and tight structure. This is a must buy for Fluffian's everywhere."},{"Title":"Larry Kane's Philadelphia","review":"Everyone has some point of view about local news and its value to our society or its impending decline. But, few have had an insiders seat on the evolution of local news as seen from the anchor chair. In his memoir of his years in television ,Larry Kane offers a brutually honest view of life in the same city for three decades. It is a wide ranging approach that includes the high and mighty from Frank Rizzo and the venerable liberal, Senator Joe Clarke to the confused and stormy reigns of Mayor Wilson Goode and Bill Green. Kane explores the relationship between politician and anchor in away not found in other books. He doesn't judge them as much as explain their challenges and how they conquered their inner demons or exorcised them. And he is no less tough on his own colleagues who ran the three stations were he served. News chiefs with willowed spines get their due , as do those who made unpopular decisions to serve Philadelphia. When they stood by him they are treated well, but when an obvious wrong was done, Kane offers vivid recollections of closed door meetings that you rarely get from a practicing journalist. Still this not at all a book of wrath. Kane carefully balances the things that matter to his community with the personality clashes that propel other memoirs.His accounting of the MOVE crisis in 1985 and the Rizzo years are as valuable as any historians more traditional approach. And there is warmth here as well. Kane always had a common man's touch and it shows up here. He treats media phenoms ,like d.j. cum anchor, Jim Obrien with great care. And his telling of how he revered the legendary oldies disc jockey, Jerry Blavat is a classic in character definition. His sense of proportion about people is also right on , no one is given too much space whether its the Beatles or this reviewer. Everything has its place and purpose. For a guy who has spent his life in an anchor chair there is a richness and value here found in few other television books.If you think anchors are hair sprayed blowhards, Kane's book will change that view. And all readers will get a very special tour of his city that destroys the classic Philadelphia cliches. This is one honest, tough and balanced account from a weathered newsman. Steve Cohen Salt Lake City"},{"Title":"Larry Kane's Philadelphia","review":"\\"Larry Kane's Philadelphia\\" is a uniquely rich tapestry of power and the powerful in a 20th century American city. Larry Kane propels the reader through three decades with understanding, insight, and a cub reporter's enthusiasm. Woven throughout the book are fascinating and highly personal anecdotes of the events and the people who made an unforgettable impact on us all. John Lennon. Three Mile Island. Hand grenades exploding inside a restaurant in Arab East Jerusalem. Rioting that followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. And even more one-of-a-kind stories about the famous of Philadelphia: Frank Rizzo, Ed Rendell, James H. J. Tate, and more. Most revealing is Kane's anatomy of the most crushing event of his career. The WCAU-TV broadcast of allegations against then-Mayor Bill Green, the retraction of the story, the lawsuit that followed, and the ostracism he experienced inside his own newsroom for a story steamrollered on the air by an egotistic general manager. My favorite part of the book is an anecdote about me, and the price I paid as a newscast producer for cutting the time of legendary weatherman Jim O'Brien's on-air segment. You can read about it on page 81. But every reader will find plenty that's special and memorable in &quot;Larry Kane's Philadelphia.&quot;"},{"Title":"Larry Kane's Philadelphia","review":"Larry Kane is such a familiar personality in the Phila. area as a TV anchor for all three Phila stations at one time or another but surprises abound in this book. Kane has managed to capture the heart and spirit of Philadelphia politics and the communities. I couldn't put this book down after just picking it up and thinking it was the same old, same old. Not a chance! The pace flows in this book and the insider's look at Phila. politics as well as the news stations is incredibly fascinating. You actually feel as though you were there. I highly recommend this book - even if you never lived in Phila. or its surrounding areas - this is an extremely interesting insider's view of politics and tv news. The author also speaks with great candor of his personal insecurities concerning his looks. This really was interesting as most people in the area (obviously we're referring to females here) speak of him as an extremely handsome individual! Always interesting to see how other's perspectives of themselves is different than that perceived by others. Definitely could not put this one down. Interesting insights with crazy politics, personal struggles and career decisions, etc. told with wit, warmth and style.

Check out \\"Larry Kane's Philadelphia\\". Here's a great yarn by a great newsman, a look at one of America's oldest and most colorful cities as seen by arguably the best local newscaster in America. I'd only visited Philly once before reading this, but learned a lot about everything from its hardball politicos to the tough-but-caring quality of its people.Larry was there to meet, talk to and report on just about everything and everyone in the area for 35 years- and on three stations. Filled with a bottomless supply of anecdotes both gritty and witty, the book not only takes you to \\"Rocky\\"'s turf but far afield- did you know he went all the way to Anchorage, of all places, for a papal audience? (He had one in the Vatican too.) Larry's open-hearted, warm personality worked well for him in front of one of the toughest audiences around- ask anyone who's seen those raucous Philly sports crowds- for many years, and it works here too. In short, Larry Kane's a class act, and Philadelphians are incredibly lucky to have him. I'd have been proud to watch him myself- even if I wasn't raised on \\"Rocky\\", cheesesteaks, and \\"da Iggles\\"!"},{"Title":"Larry Kane's Philadelphia","review":"Being from the Philadelphia area, I was pretty intrested in what Larry Kane would write about.

The book seems to reflect Larry's on screen persona: fast paced, open, sometimes cloying, but never dull. Larry's seen a lot of history in his career, and relates it in a highly entertaining book."},{"Title":"Larry Kane's Philadelphia","review":"Larry Kane writes a very deep memoir, delivering strong messages of which the premier truism was one that moved me to tears.I left Philadelphia in the early 80's; moving to locations where Philadelphia and gifted artists were cited enough times that it spiked my curiosity wanting to know what was it about this city that seemed to produce this talent. And then I opened Larry Kane's memoir where there he explained it--taking me back to memories of my family's passionate discussions. I can't begin to describe how meaningful that message was to me.Transcending through Kane's interesting career honestly relayed, him often paring journalism today to the past, I again thought back to my parents...and their parents...and deep into the generations recalling many wondering what was becoming of the newer generations. I used to tease them all the time; \`Why wonder? You raised us' --which none too ironic is the same driver I found conveyed in Kane's passionate Philadelphia driving journalism today. Caroline Kennedy's quote supports this contention. This is a profound keepsake of a memoir, to which I must add, Larry Kane (for me) will always be synonymous with Action News."},{"Title":"Larry Kane's Philadelphia","review":"Larry Kane retired from KYW 3 in December 2002 after 40 years of broadcasting.I really enjoyed reading _Larry Kane's Philadelphia_ by Larry Kane. I really liked Larry Kane. When I was in high school, I was up until 11:30 almost every weeknight watching Larry Kane on KYW-TV 3 (also known as CBS 3) at 11.In April 1994, when Bruce Hamilton and Jennifer Ward were the co-anchors of the station's newscasts weeknights at 6 and 11, things weren't going good for KYW 3. So, they got Larry Kane to replace both of them and be the sole anchor weeknights at 11.It was really fun seeing Larry being the sole anchor weeknights at 11. I really liked his reporting and how he signed off. I really liked the fact that he WAS the newsman in Philadelphia. He was better than Ken Matz (his successor at WCAU-TV 10 when Kane went to KYW-3, and also his predecessor when dealing with affiliates, because when Kane came to KYW, it was then NBC. Because the station's parent company then, Group W Westinghouse, bought CBS, the station became CBS, WCAU became NBC. Thus, Matz was his successor at NBC's local affiliate in Philadelphia, because he was the lead anchor at WCAU) or even Larry Mendte, his successor at KYW (and even Matz's at WCAU).I feel that after reading th book, Larry Kane showed excellence in broadcasting in Philadelphia, more than Ken Matz, Larry Mendte (Mendte has lived in the Philadelphia area most of his life), or even Tim Lake, Mendte's successor at WCAU."},{"Title":"Larry Kane's Philadelphia","review":"Larry Kane, a Philadelphia fixture for 35 years, has outdone himself with this book.

His own commentary on his art is helpful to further give meaning to the symbols and images he used.However he gives very little information on his own personal life. There seems to be more of a focus on his own personal ideas and beliefs, and only a brief mention of having a wife but never mentions how he met her.

This was released along with Batman and Robin, but thankfully it has nothing else to do with that atrocity.The story picks up after Contagion. Bane is floating around, having flashbacks so new readers know what's up. By sheer luck, he happens upon a floating nuclear power plant and decides to irradiate Gotham and Bludhaven. His mistake. The story of Bane is picked up in Azrael #36.The art is rigid, but not really bad. The dialogue is what we've come to expect from these characters.

Grant, though not considered one of our better presidents, was considered one of the greatest generals (and leaders) in American history. We need more men like USG today.This book flows well, and is full of vital information about the War Between the States, without too many, if any, biases or prejudices. Though written well over a century ago, hard to even say it's outdated.Simply put, gripping writing about the Civil War, or indeed, any war in US history. The conclusion was particularly splendid and prescient.And perhaps most commendable is the fact that Grant wrote it while dying a painful death from cancer. That only adds to its merit.

His explanation of the Fugitive Slave act as the trigger of the war (they made the Northerners into \\"slavecatchers\\") is the best I have ever read.

I have been a history buff for years and found out many things I did not know, or at least never thought about. He really made the point, that like today, the press had their own perspective and many times did not agree with the policies and decisions made by President Lincoln and the military, although they could have done no better or probably worse. I learned a lot about HOW the war was prosecuted after 1863 and the general's plan for the successful completion of the war for the Union side. I agree with Shelby Foote that the south never really had a chance to win the Civil War, the north was too powerful and industrialized to be defeated. I also have to say that most of my relatives from Virginia fought for the Confederacy and I'm sure that they would not have agreed with my opinion and they gave all they had to win the war themselves and honorably, as noted by Grant and others.

Grant","review":"Despite an obvious self-consciousness of writing for posterity as a U.S. President and the concomitant need to maintain a certain aloof dignity, U.S. Grant provides candid and illuminating interpretations of the causes of both the Mexican War and the Civil War and the imperatives of slavery, never cavilling in his opinion. He is also careful yet enlightening in his opinions of historical figures of his age. But 90% of his memoirs describe battle movements that are unapproachable to anyone without an intimate knowledge of the field. The average reader thus is left without any way of knowing whether movements were brilliantly inspired, ordinary, or absolute blunders. There is no reason for this, because a great many simplified Civil War maps exist that could have and should have been included in this edition, or, if copyright were an issue, re-drawn. That they were not included is a professional disgrace to the publisher."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I have been a history 'buff' all my life, and read what I thought were some of the best books about and set in the American Civil War. But until I read Ulysses Grant's Personal Memoirs, that wasn't true. I would never have believed that a career soldier and a very misunderstood, under rated US President could write such a fascinating, enthralling memoir of a time in our history we all think we know all we need to know.If you haven't read this wonderful book yet, I'm going to be bold and say you don't really know what the war was like for the men who fought in it, led the men who fought in it, and who drove themselves, as Grant did, for the sole purpose of perserving the Union and ending the war as swiftly as humanly possible. His insights are invalueable for the time, and his humor and pathos are electrifying.A reviewer on the back of this volume says it most clearly: Grant writes his memoirs so vividly, so humanly that you are on the edge of your seat the whole way through, waiting to see how the Civil War ends!And perhaps most amazing of all, Ulysses Grant wrote and revised and finished the manuscript for this book in the winter and spring and early summer of 1885, while he was dying of throat cancer. Also, he wrote it not to aggrandize himself, but to help his family, when bad business partners bankrupted the former President and Victor of the Civil War.This is a must read as far as I'm concerned for anyone who wants to understand that time and understand why the American Civil War was the transforming event of the American 19th century.Rielle"},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

I needed to use an atlas and detailed maps off the internet."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Civl War afficianados will be fascinated by Grant's detailed discussion of battles. The general reader will find value in the discovery of General Grant's personality. He doesn't boast of his attributes, but the fact that he succeeded as commander of the army of the Patomac where others dithered and failed -- even unusually able and intelligent men -- must make one wonder why, and the answer is revealed in the pages of this book. His discussion of the qualities of various generals is also valuable. Those of us who occupy competative professions will necessarilly find useful the discussion of the qualities of perserverence and courage it takes to successfully prosecute any difficult endeavor -- whether it is a battle for national unity, a jury trial, or even a sales campaign. Lest one think the answer is simply self-confidence, one must pause before Grant's humility and his revealed trepedation at the prospect of high command. Grant is also frank about his dread of his first military engagement of the Civil War, but he learned a valuable lesson when his enemy, who knew he was coming, melted away before he arrived to engage him. Grant learned that his enemy feared him as much as he feared his enemy, and this tempered his fright in future engagements. A person can be better for reading this book and absorbing its lessons, not to say that the book is at all preachy."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Although Grant doesn't blow his own horn, a close reading of his campaign accounts supports the \\"revisionist\\" view that far from being a butcher of men and Lee's inferior, Grant's victories (other than Shiloh) were tactical in nature, not brute force charges. (OK, there was Cold Harbor, but that was one mistake in a year-long campaign to destroy the South before the North lost its will to fight. Time was not on Grant's side.) Furthermore, Lee, Jackson, Johnson, et. al. always had the easier side of the equation, playing defense and disrupting the North's long lines of supply and communication.This is also an interesting study on how an apparently unremarkable person find greatness within himself when he is in his element, and how a great general can fail as a president because the leadership roles are quite different.There is a dry wit in much of Grant's writing which makes it a fun read even if you don't care for the details of his capture of Vicksburg and his eventual destruction of the South's Eastern armies. Grant does not shy away from describing the slogging nature of the war or his mastery of maneuver warfare."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"It is been said that Grant's memoirs are the finest written by an American president, and such an assessment may well be true, which is among the reasons why I wanted to read them. Lincoln held Grant in very high regard, and credited both Grant and Sherman with winning the Civil War militarily and thereby preserving the Union. Grant returned Lincoln's respect and praise, both in the words that he wrote and in his decision not to become a presidential candidate in 1864 -- and probably a very formidable rival, according to Lincoln's keen political judgment.It is a shame that Grant did not write about his own two-term presidency, and instead concluded his memoirs with the war's end. However, he died of throat cancer in 1885, twenty years after the \\"rebellion\\" ended and less than a week after completing work on the memoirs, which were written in large part to provide much-needed financial security for his beloved wife, Julia Dent Grant. They accomplished their purpose, and were encouraged and edited by his friend, Mark Twain.While I am not a student of the Civil War, nor of the other campaigns in which Grant served -- all of which are discussed in great detail -- his memoirs give the reader a window into the man and the war that wrenched and transformed this nation, and produced so much carnage on both sides. Like Eisenhower and other famous generals, Grant concludes, \\"this war was a fearful lesson, and should teach us the necessity of avoiding wars in the future.\\"However, Grant adds: \\"To maintain peace in the future it is necessary to be prepared for war. . . . [U]nless we are prepared for it we may be in danger of a combined movement being some day made to crush us out.\\" With respect to former slaves, Grant writes: \\"[H]e was brought to our shores by compulsion, and he now should be considered as having as good a right to remain here as any other class of our citizens.\\"As to the future of our nation and the healing of its wounds, he concluded:\\"The war has made us a nation of great power and intelligence. . . . I feel we are on the eve of a new era, when there is to be great harmony between the [North and South]. I cannot stay to be a living witness to the correctness of this prophecy; but I feel it within me that it is to be so. The universally kind feeling expressed for me at a time when it was supposed that each day would prove my last, seemed to me the beginning of the answer to 'Let us have peace.'\\"The expressions of these kindly feelings were not restricted to a section of the country, nor to a division of the people. They came from individual citizens of all nationalities; from all denominations -- the Protestant, the Catholic, and the Jew; and from various societies of the land -- scientific, educational, religious, or otherwise. Politics did not enter into the matter at all.\\"Grant dedicated his memoirs to the \\"American Soldier And Sailor\\"; and it seems true, as Geoffrey Perret has written, \\"he was modest, sensitive, generous, honest, and superlatively intelligent. Grant's courage, both moral and physical, was a matter of record.\\" And he lives on through his words and deeds."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I concur with the really good reader reviews above. I will add that what makes Grant's prose so engaging is that it is simple, unadorned, not self flattering, not pompous. It isn't pedantic, dull or uncertain either. In a word, it is Grant. It's probably the best way that you will get to know him. It is the portrait most often attempted by his supporters and the exact opposite of the portrait painted by his detractors. So, Grant presents himself and he is authentic.You cannot help admiring Grant for his strengths and endearing qualities, his military accomplishments and his everyman characteristics. If you take his version together with what may be valid criticisms from those less admiring, then you get a pretty well rounded view of Grant. You won't find anything in his autobiography that conflicts with that totality.Grant only covers his Civil War in this memoir, not his Presidency. He was in the last stages of a fatal throat cancer and trying to provide for his family. He had that clarity of a man writing to tell the truth about himself. No need to lie or hide. But that's also the reason that we don't hear about some of his grievances, disputes, recollections and characterizations of his contemporaries. We could have learned a lot from that but Grant is very forgiving and like a gentleman - he just won't tell."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Grant finished this lengthy memoir on the eve of his death from throat cancer. Impoverished at the time, the ex-President made his wife rich from the proceeds. Simple, straightforward, earnest narrative, sometimes ironic, sometimes colorful, always unpretentious. Inevitably self-justifying, but candid nonetheless.The most memorable anecdote describes his first action in the 1861-65 war. Although he was a combat veteran of the Mexican War fourteen years earlier, he was scared, almost frozen, as he led his men against the enemy position. When he arrived, the enemy had evacuated. \\"The reb commander was as scared as I was. It was a lesson that served me well for the next four years.\\"Excellent general's-eye descriptions of the battles for Fort Donaldson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Cold Harbor. His proudest contribution to the Union victory seems to be his strategy of \\"coordinated attack\\". He believed the early rebel success was due to the fragmentation of the National fources, which allowed the outmanned rebels to concentrate on one fragment at a time.Grant is full of forthright and fascinating judgments: he revered Lincoln and Sherman, detested Hallek, disliked Stanton but respected him.Civil war buff? Don't neglect this."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"The plain fact is U.S. Grant seldom gets the credit he deserves as a general. Conducting offensive operations into enemy territory is far and away the most difficult strategic task a commander can master and Grant did it for 4 years with consistent success. Writers usually reduce his accomplishments by insisting it was entirely the superioity of numbers and equipment that gave him victories, completely ignoring the fact that every other Union general who attacked the south and failed had those same advantages. Add to his mastery of strategy the fact that he was quite simply one of the best writers of his day. His prose is elegant, clear, and impossible to misunderstand. This memoir is informative, honest, and wonderfully written. Mark Twain referred to it as the greatest book in the English language. Grant was a man whose qualities are not instantly apparent. When you study him enough, you learn that he was a man capable of intense concentration and inexhaustible determination. It is worth noting that during the war, Grant almost never moved an army back in the direction from which it had come. He only went forward, determined to complete whatever task he had been given. Grant's writing and his military career prove that sometimes simplicity is a special kind of genius."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"An incredible book by an incredible man. I have never read a greater, grander book in my life. He wrote it when he was dying, yet you'd never know it from the words in the book. The greatest reading experience in my life, bar none. Read this book to understand this beautiful man!"},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Ulysses S. Grant like many other Civil War figures wrote a long and detailed memoir detailing his experiences in the war. Unlike many of the others however, he did it not to toot his own horn but for the noble purpose of leaving an income for his family. One of the most famous pictures of Grant is the one of him sitting on his porch, covered in blankets, writing. He died just a week after he finished this book. I wonder if the Grant family is still receiving royalties from this book after all of these years.In reading this book one has to take into account that by his own admission, Grant was not a scholar. Nor was he a writer, but for a sick old soldier he does a wonderful job. The writing is a little dry at times but that is mainly because he goes into so much detail about his campaigns. His West Point eye shows not only in his strategy but also in his writing as he goes into great detail about the topography of the areas he is describing. In fact, this is the most dull part of the book as he goes into so much detail that he will occasionally lose the reader entirely. Grant is not one to cast blame for his problems but as part of his topographical discussions he almost always writes that this ground was much more favorable for defense, he of course being on the offensive. It is also easy to avoid casting blame for failures when the writer has few failures, so while Grant is not guilty of this he has no reason to be.Grant does not describe his battles in detail for some reason. His overall campaigns are covered in detail but the battles themselves get little attention. The battles of others under his command are told in a far more interesting and complete manner than are the battles he was personally involved in. His descriptions of Sherman's Atlanta campaign and the march to the sea are riveting and his descriptions of the final days of the war and Lee's surrender are enthralling. He also goes to great lengths to defend some of his comrades against charges that had been made against them while never taking on charges leveled at him. His drinking is never mentioned. He even takes time to defend Joe Johnston's Georgia campaign against Sherman. His insights are incredible but this memoir could have offered the reader a little more of a glimpse into the author than it does. Although, toward the end of the book one does start to see Grant's personality come out.There are numerous maps included in this book but they will be of little use to most readers. I assume they are military maps, but they are so detailed that one can hardly make out the important points. There is also an attempt to downplay what Robert E. Lee had accomplished before Grant arrived on the scene. This could have come from humility on Grant's part, or it could have been jealousy, but whatever the cause it is unseemly. Still, Grant knew how to defeat Lee and did so, which is more than any other Union general managed to do.Overall, this is a very insightful and well-written book. Any serious student of the Civil War will want to have a copy of their own, not only to read but as a very important reference book. He points out the mistakes and shortcomings of leaders on both sides as well as offers praise when he feels it is due. It is amazing how kind he is to General Halleck considering how much trouble that man caused Grant early in the war. He does seem to take delight however in detailing Sherman's dislike of Halleck. Not much of the real Grant comes across in this book but what does come through is that while he was a determined advisory; he was also a very kind hearted man. A great man in fact, who was very much misunderstood, then and now."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

When it first came out in 1885 it was a great success. The informed reader will quickly realize that this was not out of sympathy for Grant, the great general who was dying of throat cancer while writing it, but well deserved recognition of a great autobiography.

Grant","review":"This book was listed as a major reference for Bill OReily's \\"Killing Lincoln\\" and was also on that book's recommended reading list...so I took a chance on it (for 99c). What a great book, laying-out the Civil War years of U S Grant, as told by him personally.Well written and easy to read (although it's a relatively long book...took me over a week to read it off and on). Covers General Grant from his childhood days in Ohio and Kentucky, through West Point, his involvement in The Mexican War and up through the end of the Civil War and President Lincoln's assassination.Grant's humility and self effacing character comes through load and clear, as well as his genius for organizing an army, designing brilliant war plans and doggedly pursuing them to final victory.You get a good feel for his close friendship with General Sherman and the professional relationships with all the other senior officers that served with him (or under him) during his military campaigns and during his unlikely rise to Lieutenant General of the US Army (to ultimately face General Lee in Virginia).I was especially fascinated with the western theatre of the Civil War that was fought along the Mississippi River and in east Tennessee. I never realized how important those battles were to the ultimate Union victory, and never knew the vital role that General Grant played to ensure those victories.I got so \\"into\\" those western battles that I went online for battle maps so I could follow along with Grant in his book. While I was online, I stumbled across civilwaranimated.com. If you end up buying the book, I'd highly recommend that you go online and have a look at this web page. It contains animated depictions of all the Civil War campaigns, walking you through each battle of the campaign. It's a great online companion to the book.Since I finished the book, I been scouring netflix to re-watch Ken Burns Civil War and other Civil War documentaries (now that I have the inside scoop on all of the major battles).All said, this is an outstanding account of a great American and of one of the greatest military leaders that the USA has ever produced. 4 stars!"},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

Why bother reading numerous biographies of him when you can actually look inside his mind and learn of his thoughts, his feelings,and his concerns. Witness the incredible journey he made in his life: from an ill-paid shop clerk to the commander-in-chief of the Union Army, and to the 18th President of the United States. Grant was a man who never lost hope, who set his goals up in the sky and built a ladder to reach them. His memoirs are not only an account of the times he lived in, but also a reflection of his powerful character and his venerable spirit."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I'm a little irritated at the usually terrific Modern Library. They have hatched a new series of volumes on &quot;War&quot;, with a general introduction by Caleb Carr. Apparently, however, aside from the slick covers, no attempt was made to provide the reader with any original material, such as maps, appendices, notes or other scholarly material. The edition of Grant's memoirs contains a new, curt, unhelpful introduction by Geoffrey Perret. (Perret offhandedly mentions that Grant's memory diverges from the facts on more than one occasion, but makes no attempt to further elucidate a matter that would obviously be of high interest to the reader.)The maps are old, crabbed and often difficult to follow; the geographically-challenged reader, such as myself, is often obliged to consult a road atlas to follow the Western campaigns. The memoirs themselves are terrific. Grant's plain, homely soldier's style, with dashes of self-deprecation and dry irony, is engrossing reading."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"That U.S. Grant is telling one of history's great tragic and glorious stories as the key actor would make this book a fine piece in its own right. He has a gift for story telling that renders his Personal Memoirs compelling and engrossing. One of the best books I have read. It is remarkable from several levels. First, it is undeniably great history. The story of our Civil War is moving enough to leave a tremendous impression upon the reader in Grant's hands. Second, this book is a great study in management. Grant succeeded where scores failed at similar command levels throughout the Civil War. He did due to his: knowledge and focus on his mission; his ability to conceive plans that served his mission; his ability to have alternatives that stayed the course; his ability to learn from mistakes and experience; his calm in the face of stress and chaos; his decisiveness and his willingness to take reasonable risks.This book surprised me by being an excellent management study. The lessons which are easy to take away from the book are aplicable to anyone who is faced with mission definition and achievement. It should be must reading in MBA programs.Grant's lack of ego is surprising when compared to other Civil War figures and high achievers who have reflected on their lives and actions. By not only focusing on things that went right for Grant, the book has a tremendous credibility borne of real life trial and error, frustration, lessons learned and later employed.A great book."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Almost without funds Ulysses S. Grant was aware that on his death from throat cancer his family would find themselves in a serious financial crisis - thus developed the impetus for putting pen to paper to write his Personal Memoirs. Shortly before his death he completed his memoirs and it is to our benefit that he was able to finish the task.I read Personal Memoirs with a fascination that was at times bordering on obsession. The book held me from first page to last, this due to the power of the words and the images that they painted. Grant writes with both eloquence and simplicity on his subject matter. He is clear and concise when other memoirs often flit about without a clear focus.For this reader as a non American who has not been raised with a Civil War bias - and I accept that not all US citizens will have such a bias - Personal Memoirs is refreshing in it's lack of romanticism - here is a man who \`tells it like it is!' Grant it would seem felt that he had nothing to prove with his Memoirs, thus what he wrote is a no frills, honest account devoid of moralising and self-adoration.When communicating with the Confederate General who held Fort Donelson there was no ambiguity in Grants words \\"No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted. I propose to move immediately upon your works.\\" It is this direct approach which Grant was able to convey with such clarity within his memoirs. It is this that is so compelling about Personal Memoirs and indeed in itself gives us an insight into Grant the manGrant ends his introduction to Personal Memoirs by commenting \\"With these remarks I present these volumes to the public, asking no favor but hoping they will meet the approval of the reader.\\" This book met my approval on every count and I recommend it to you highly."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Grant here gives a consistently interesting account of his role in many of the major campaigns of the Civil War. His prose is clear and his accounts of battles and strategies quite readable, even to those without particular expertise in military history. He sticks to the story, making few attempts to even scores with his numerous critics in the Army or the press.One thing that should be noted is that these 'personal memoirs' are in many ways remarkably impersonal. There is only a quite brief account of Grant's youth, and his wife, to whom he was apparently quite devoted, is barely mentioned. Grant tells the story of his career as an officer with increasing levels of responsibility, but says little about himself. Also, the memoirs end with the assassination of Lincoln, and do not at all discuss his presidency.The edition I read was lacking in maps, which was a serious drawback, however it was a different edition than the one discussed here. Because so much of the book focuses on the tactics of specific campaigns, a good set of maps is a very valuable addition, and would be advisable to check for in any edition you consider reading or buying."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

He is the closest to Hemingway in economy and clarity of language, and his sense of humor rivals both Twain and Lincoln. The modernity and lack of fuss will startle you. This is the General who dressed like a private, and wrote in the plain yet articulate language of the men he commanded."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Grant's \\"Personal Memoirs\\" was written entirely by U.S. Grant; there was no ghostwriting or heavy handed editing. Grant had a remarkable gift, he could truly write. He had a reputation, as a general, of writing clear, easily understood orders (indeed some are reproduced in footnotes). His Memoirs are written in this same clear style. Grant does not write about his presidency and devotes very few pages to his early life. This book is a military history of the Mexican and Civil Wars. Abraham Lincoln was a congressman at the time of the Mexican War and was opposed to it. Grant, as a young army officer could not oppose that war but, he makes it clear that he thought it was wrong, that the United States was amassing troops in disputed territory between the Rio Grande and Nueces Rivers in order to goad Mexico. In relatively few chapters, Grant gives a good history of that war and he asseses the characteristics of the two great generals, Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott.His history of his involvement in the Civil War is illuminating but I would suggest that the reader have a working knowledge of the war before reading these Memoirs since Grant writes about campaigns that he was a part of, not about aspects of the war he did not experience first hand. However, he broadens his scope after he replaced Henry Hallek and assumed command of all the armies. At this point, although he made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, he nontheless writes a much broader history of campaigns in other theaters since he was now in control. Thus, he gives a good account of Sherman leading his troops from Tennessee eastward as they take Atlanta and ultimately march to the sea.Grant was magnanimous in his judgments of others. In other histories, it is often clear that he was in conflict with others such as General John McClernand, a grandstanding political general who sought to beat Grant to Vicksburg in order to garner the glory. Grant barely hints at this, obviously seeking not to speak ill of McClernand, whereas other historians expose McClernand's shortcomings. Grant is effusive in showing his feelings for those he admired, including Lincoln and Sherman. Grant also, subtly, comes to his own defense against criticisms leveled against him. For example, he posits that he was expecting the rebel attack that became the bloody battle of Shilo and that he was not surprised. Also, as he begins to discuss the Overland campaign,in which he had been accused of being a butcher who put his troops through a meatgrinder, he notes that although the casualties were great, the war was to only last less than a year once this campaign was commenced. This implies that if the war had dragged on longer, more soldiers would have died even if the battles had been less devestating.The completion of the Memoirs was heroic since Grant was dying of cancer and by its completion, he assured the financial well being of his family. Other than his accomplishments as a general, the completion of his Memoirs may be his finest act."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

We all owe Samuel Clemens \\"Mark Twain\\" a debt of gratitude for publishing a dying Grant's memories in spite of the financial consequences for his publishing company.

Grant","review":"&quot;The Personal Memoirs&quot; of U.S. Grant are not only the very best memoirs ever penned by a former President, but they are also the most poignant.Imagine this. A man who was a failure at business and is even rejected by the pompous George McClellan when he practically begged for a regimental command becomes one of the greatest military commanders in United States History, perhaps even a more solid and accomplished leader than the Robert E. Lee whose &quot;Marble Man&quot; legend has eclipsed Grant (don't forget the unassuming Grant not only paved the way for a Union Victory in the West, but also bested the noble Lee from the Wilderness to Appomattox). He was elected President, but despite his own personal honesty and integrity, his administration was wracked by scandal.After the Presidency, Grant settled down for what he and his family hoped would be a quiet, successful life. His involvement and investment with a crook, however, left the Grant family almost totally penniless - and at practically the same time he learned he had cancer of the throat.In a valiant race against time, Grant agreed to pen some articles for Century magazine. Mark Twain caught wind of this, and urged Grant to write a book of memoirs. In the one year of life remaining, and all too often in great pain, Grant didn't write one book - but a two-volume set of memoirs that are regarded not just a classic of war, but of U.S. History and Literature as well. He proved to be a winner once more, finally writing the last sentences of the memoirs less than 2 weeks before he died.These Memoirs flow with great descriptive writing of events, battles, and characters. While there are no really &quot;legendary&quot; moments that pop out at the reader, i.e., Lee and the wounded Union soldier at Gettysburg, for example, all of the moments written, of friends who came to prominence in the Mexican war, and some who,like his protege, General McPherson, later died, are gripping ones. His description of the love and respect he had for Abraham Lincoln is touching. As in the description of what took place at Appomattox Court House.A must set of books essential to all Americans who loved their country and respect their history.I was presented with the limited leatherbound first editon 2 volume set as a gift from my parents, something I will always treasure (I can only guess whom they might have belonged to) I can heartily recommend the Konecky and Konecky hardbound volume, or this modern library edition that I am reviewing here. The print is better in the Konecky volume, but either way, this is one book that belongs in your library - and for your children."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"General Grant wrote this book while dying of throat cancer. He had been swindled by a dishonest Wall Street Broker and his trophies and possessions were stripped from him to satisfy the demands of his debtors. Bankrupt, suffering from a terminal illness and never passing a moment without acute pain, he produced this magnificent monument to his greatness. Those who denigrate Grant as a drunkard, butcher, bumbling President need to read this book in order to correct these errant assumptions. It is impossible to read this book and not realize that Grant was an inordinately intelligent man and one hell of a writer.Grant's Memoirs are a deserved classic in American literature and considered the greatest military Memoirs ever penned, exceeding Caesar's Commentaries. Grant wrote as he lived: with clear, concise statements, unembellished with trivialities or frivolities. The only &quot;criticism&quot; the reader might have is that Grant bent over backwards not to wound the feelings of people in the book. He takes swipes at Joe Hooker and Jeff Davis, but what he left unsaid would have been far more interesting. A compelling and logical reason why Grant was so spare in his comments was because he was involved in a race with death. He didn't know how long he could live and therefore, &quot;cut to the chase.&quot;Grant's assessments of Lincoln, Sherman, Sheridan and other military leaders are brilliant and engrossing. His style, like the man himself, was inimitable and couldn't be copied. In everyday life, Grant was a very funny man, who liked to listen to jokes and tell them himself. His sense of the absurd was acute. It's no accident that he loved Mark Twain and the two hitched together very well. Twain and Grant shared a similar sense of humor, and Grant's witicisms in the Memoirs are frequent, unexpected and welcome. There are portions where you will literally laugh out loud.Though Grant's Memoirs were written 113 years ago, they remain fresh, vibrant and an intensely good read. I have read them in! their entirity 30 times in my life and I never weary of the style and language that Grant employed. He was a military genius to be sure, but he was also a writer of supreme gifts, and these gifts shine through on every page of this testament to his greatness. All Americans should read this book and realize what we owe to Grant: he preserved the union with his decisive brilliance. In his honor, we should be eternally grateful."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I think this is the only real account you can get of the civil war. It's...Great!"},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I freely confess to having read this book simply because I one day remembered that it existed and that I hadn't read it. It seemed to me a gaping lacuna in my reading history. Now, having read it, I must say that the writing is competent - as it was edited by Mark Twain, one shouldn't expect less - and these memoirs of the famous General's life from birth to the end of the American Civil War are quite interesting, especially for someone such as myself who, due to my upbringing, knows rather too much about the history of Europe, whilst knowledge of the history of my adopted country remains comparatively scanty. But I must say here that I am not concerned here with the American Civil War as such, but rather with the personality of Grant and the role he played in them. These are, after all, \\"Personal Memoirs.\\"What a rum fellow Grant seems to me, having finished the book, especially in Volume I. Volume II tends to bog the reader down in tactics, dispatches, skirmishes and engagements with - to me - very odd names for the locations of these set-tos all piled rapidly on top of one another. Grant is a curiously passive figure in his philosophical outlook. He didn't fancy going to Westpoint, was surprised he passed the entrance examination and, whilst there, hoped that a bill pending in Congress to abolish the military academy would pass. It didn't.Early on, during his account of the Mexican War, he lists two separate accidental deaths of superiors who were favourable to the young Grant and the effect that they had on his career, and then comments: \\"Neither of these speculations is unreasonable, and they are mentioned to show how little men control their own destiny.\\"Throughout the book, proponents of free will or choice will find Grant as dogged an adversary as ever the Confederates did. Again, after being selected as head of all the National armies - The term \\"Union army\\" is not to be encountered herein. - Grant states again, \\"It is men who wait to be selected, and not from those who seek, from whom we may always expect the most efficient service.\\" This determinism rather surprised me coming from an American where the credo is that each man makes his own destiny. Grant seems to have been what pop psychologists of today would denominate a \\"Type B\\" personality, through and through.But, once selected, Grant was as tenacious as a pit bull, as the Vicksburg and all subsequent campaigns bear out. He speculates upon this sterling quality (for a commanding officer) in him thusly: \\"Everyone has his superstitions. One of mine is that in positions of great responsibility everyone should do his duty to the best of his ability where assigned by competent authority, without application or the use of influence to change his position.\\"And Grant carries out his duties, once assigned, with unmatched doggedness. An interesting read, this book, especially Volume I---The bewildering intricacies of Volume II are what leads me to bequeath it four stars - the memoirs of a man both determined and deterministic."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

A must-read."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Grant was a man of few words.In his Memoirs, he takes us with breakneck speed from his childhood to West Point in one chapter. The academy is likewise covered with a few antidotes and then on to service in the American west. His discussion of meeting Julia and their romance is entirely too short.Only in his descriptions of old Mexico does Grant devote the time needed to let us see that land through his young eyes.We learn nothing about why he resigned his commission and little about his harsh, sad time in Saint Louis. The mysteries of Chattanooga are not explained. His relationships with Sheridan, Sherman and even his family are not commented on. Grant supliments the standard histories, but you have to have a working knowledge of Grant's life to understand what a borad brush he uses.Perhaps Grant simply thought these matters unremarkable and of little interest to a reader. Perhaps Grant himself found such trivialities unremarkable. I admit, I had hoped to have learned how his wife supported him through his tough times.All in all, Sherman's memoirs with the shipwrecks, bankruptcies and misadventures make better reading than this. Still, Grant was there. Any serious student needs to read Grant's words and understand his point of view."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

(page 446-7 is one example)Other reviews have spoken admirmingly of this book, I would like to draw attention to an incident Grant tells of, where a Union soldier is stealing ALL of a Southern ladies chickens.The Southern woman vainly pleaded with the Union soldiers to please spare her a few at least.The Union soldiers looked at the woman and said,>\\"This rebellion has to be suppressed if it takes the last chicken in the Confederacy.\\"&lt; ( Page 555 Grants memoirs)( how will this woman and her children eat after this?)Another following incident--->\\"The South prior to the rebellion kept bloodhounds to pursue runaway slaves who took refuge in the neighboring swamps, and also to hunt convicts. Orders were issued to KILL all of these animals as they were met with.On one occasion a soldier picked up a POODLE, the favorite pet of it's mistress, and was carrying it off to EXECUTION, when the lady made a strong appeal to him to spare it.The soldier replied,\\" Madam our orders are to KILL every bloodhound,\\"\\"But this is not a Bloodhound,\\" said the lady.\\"Well, Madam, we can not tell what it will grow into, if we leave it behind,\\" said the soldier as he went off with it.\\"&lt;---------------The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

Grant","review":"We have found volume 1 of a series of books written by U.S. Grant. The book is called &quot; Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant. I was wondering the value or any information you have on this book to be e-mailed to me."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"There's a natural tendency when reading a presidential autobiography to compare the subject to the current leader. In this case it is hard to believe that Grant and Clinton belong to the same species.Ulysses S. Grant embodied valor and probity on and off the battlefield. Bill Clinton has achieved historical profligacy in and out of his trousers. Modern day illuminati may scoff in disbelief at Grant's non-boastful statement that he never used profanity, but that is consistent with the integrity that guided his actions. Clinton will long be remembered for perpetuating the most obscene activities unimaginable within the confines of the Oval Office.While one dodged the draft, spent the war in England, and regularly lead protests against his the country, the other spent years demonstrating patriotic fortitude by fighting in an even more controversial and divisive war. Leading the Union army to victory in the Civil War, Grant stands as one as one of the most salient figures who prevented the United States from being permanently splintered. It's easy to wonder what he would think of today's widespread push for group rights that pose nearly as serious threat to the nation's cohesion. He commanded a willing army of magnanimous soldiers in a bloody war to bring the races together and now major efforts are underway to split them apart by rampant multicultural separatism a century later.Grant constantly displayed a steadfast devotion to his family just as Clinton repeated betrays his. The general saw his wife and children as often as he could during the war, and it was his desire to be reunited with his children who were then in New Jersey that kept him from accompanying Abraham Lincoln to the theater on that fateful night. Once during the war when his oldest son was fighting a life-threatening illness, he obtained permission to pay a visit but could not relinquish command of the military. Dedicated to both his duties as soldier and father (two areas where Clinton has proved less than stellar), he went to St. Louis and maintained control of the army via messengers and the telegraph.If for no other reason, this book warrants a read because it bears witness to a once-in-a-lifetime moment in history: Grant's first meeting with Lincoln. This momentous occasion was shared by the author's eldest son shortly after his recovery form the nearly fatal ailment.There are two major aspects of General Grant's life missing. His victory over alcoholism is not mentioned nor even alluded to. In the late 1800's this affliction was probably not widely viewed as a disease. Rather it was seen as a weakness of character. Grant most likely was ashamed of this deficiency and did not want to be seen either as immoral or a victim-another far cry of the current &quot;it's not my fault that I can't keep my pants on&quot; attitude of the present commander in chief. The second lacuna is his presidency. The book ends shortly after the war and throughout only passing references are made to his tenure in the highest office in the land. Grant knew he was dying when he wrote this work-it was his effort to provide for his widow (the deviation from Clintontonism here goes without saying), and the millions in royalties it earned fulfilled this final goal admirably. Perhaps cancer prevented the second volume which no doubt would have done justice his presidency. Still, this work is enough to explicitly contrast his differences from Clinton. The war record proves that Grant was a somewhat underrated president and a most extraordinary man; now we are stuck with a grossly overrated president who could not be underrated as a man."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"These memoirs are feted for supposedly being he work of a simple, honest and plain speaking man but they are hardly honest. Grant downplays or outright ignores many of the massive mistakes he made in the war. He makes little mention of the nearly devastating results at Shiloh when he inexplicably failed to have his Army set up pickets and fortifications after arriving, which nearly resulted in a general rout of the Union Army on the first day. He also plays down the sheer stupidity of his actions at places like Cold Harbor where he attacked extremely well entrenched forces in frontal assaults; assaults that left thousands in union blue needlessly dead.These memoirs are also an incredible insult to the best union general of the war: MG George H. Thomas. He paints Thomas as slow and plodding but Thomas is absolutely central in the only two battles where Union forces caused general routs of Confederate forces, Chattanooga and Nashville. In the latter, Thomas destroys John Bell Hood's Army of the Tennessee with a hodgepodge of forces after Sherman, off making war on civilians in Georgia, takes the best forces in the Army of the Cumberland from Thomas. In Chattanooga it is Thomas' Army, the Army of the Cumberland, that leads the rout, to Grant's chagrin.Grant was tenacious and that was about it. He had a massive war machine and he simply battered the Confederates into submission, killing a lot of good men on the union side needlessly. Sherman, who was also incompetent but similarly tenacious, was a perfect partner for Grant. As Sherman said, \\"I took of grant when he was drunk and he took care of me when I was crazy.\\"If you want to read about the best Union General of the War and a truly heroic figure, read about MG George H. Thomas. If anybody should be on the 50 dollar bill it is him, not Grant."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Grant is, as others have said, a lucid writer, and though he might have been a great military mind, he is neither a visionary nor an intellectual. The vast bulk of his memoirs recount the Mexican and Civil wars and thus are interesting primarily from a military standpoint.

And, of course, the actual effects of journalism in any form on the conduct of war and beliefs of the population of both sides. Remember Iraq and Vietnam?"},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

He was certainly a great general and he talks about his career and the people he knew on both sides with compassion and a desire for the truth.He doesn't deal very much with his Presidency, but we learn much about his character which explains much of why his presidency was the way it was."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I learned of a General Grant who was far different than I had thought. I believe he wrote an honest view of himself and others. One thing that impressed me is not only did he fight he had a broad understanding of what was needed to win the war in the West and East. I've always known he was a good General but now rate him as a Great General. In the East he was highly respected by his men who cheered him after The Battle of The Wilderness when he headed South after Lees' Army. It had been a terrible fight but they cheered him. Why?? Because they had realized Lee must be defeated to win and the only way to do that was not to withdraw but pursue him. Grant was the first Northern General not to withdraw after a battle and they recognized Grant meant to win and knew how too. They never fought harder for any General than him. He was a great judge of other Commanders and didn't put himself above other sucessful ones, giving them credit for their actions. One simple thing he wrote impressed me, \\"Many thought Robert E Lee couldn't be defeated. But I knew Lee.\\" It hit me like a ton of bricks that this man was not afraid of Lee. Later after defeating him he did show respect and compassion for him and his men. His Memoirs made me take a deeper look at this man. I when young remembered him being called a \\"Butcher\\". Reading another book about him I learned Grant lost a total of only 15% of his federal troops in 4 years, approx. 94,000 killed or wounded. While Robert E. Lee lost 20% of his men or approx 121,000 killed or wounded which was far more than any Civil war General. With Lee losing 80,000 in killed and wounded in his first fourteen months of Command and that equaled the number he had started with originally. Those facts changed my view of U.S. Grant. I would recommend his Memoirs to anyone interested in the Civil War and feel this is one of the most honest, informative books ever written by anyone directly involved. I recommend it to anyone wanting to see an honest view of the Civil war. One thing I would add is I have the paperback copy and also the hardback by Library of America which contains Selected letters written by Grant also. I really like that copy better not only because of the letters but it's written on finer paper, smaller book but very easy to read, and reminds me of a time when the written word was valued more than it appears to be today. It kind of transports me back to that time. Just a personal thing for an old guy but maybe others will understand that too."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Very late in life, destitute and sick with the cancer that killed him, U.S. Grant penned his personal memoirs. He focused almost exclusively on the war years, with some mention of his youth and early years in the old army. You could read this book and not notice that he had ever become President, that job must have been an afterthought and clearly not a role he relished. Like many of us, Grant was terrified of public speaking and interacting with large groups. Even as President he generally avoided such requirements, preferring to issue orders or read a brief statement. Not sure that would work these days.Grant's humor, compassion, humility, and honesty come out in this book. Since it was the end of his life and many of his colleagues had already gone to collect their just rewards, Grant does not pull any punches in his opinions of the War Department leadership and officers and some of the politicians who crossed his path during the War. Grant was also a very modest man. When hostilities commenced in 1861 he offered his services to the local politicians, with no hard sell of his military experience and capabilities. He is also clear in that he was not a supporter of the goals when he served in the Mexican War but went along with the orders provided him.Perhaps the experience that most grew his character were his years out of the army, when he was leading a series of failed business and farming ventures, reduced to cutting firewood for his neighbors on some days. Grant also took the opportunity here to set the story straight on some War stories that would have been good stories if only they were true. We dont hear much about Grant's family, other than his concern when they were ill or in harms way, and he never mentions the thing he is best remembered for in popular tales, his drinking.All in all, this is a fabulous book. Despite Grant's reservations about whether he could write or anyone would want to read it, this is a fascinating look at Grant, Lincoln, Lee, Davis, Sherman, Sheridan, Longstreet, and the rest. Grant was a man who knew how to lead in an authoritative style, with a real strength in knowing his own skills and shortcomings."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

I could not have been more wrong. In fact, his use of the english language and occasional anecdotes are what make this book a true joy to read. Another positive about this book is that though it is a large volume, it is broken up into small chapters which provides the reader greater flexibility in choosing when or where to read it."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I didn't become engrossed in the Civil War until I visited the Grant/Lee exhibit at the New York Historical Society this summer. There I first saw Grant's Personal Memoirs book displayed. It is an unbelievable, first-hand interpretation of war, leadership, and politics. I'm amazed at Grant's personal relationships with the southern generals, many that he knew from West Point and later fought against. One of my favorite quotes in the book, \\"The natural disposition of most people is to clothe a commander of a large army whom they do not know, with almost superhuman abilities. A large part of the National army, for instance, and most of the press of the country, clothed General Lee with just such qualities, but I had known him personally, and knew that he was mortal; and it was just as well that I felt this.\\" page 116. Grant starts his book with the Mexican War where he gained experience fighting battles which eventually proves to serve him well in the Civil War. He provides his opinion of the war, southern politics and his feelings towards other generals. I love when he evaluates the actions and performances of generals on both sides just like a business executive would of employees and superiors. For example, Grant was almost arrested for not following orders of the commanding General Halleck. This reminds me of office politics we face during our business lives. Grant clearly lets the reader know his displeasure with Halleck whom he eventually outranks. He lets you know which generals were soldiers and which were not up to the task of fighting. Like Jim Collins in the book Good to Great, Grant tells you about effective generals that were humble. Of General Taylor he writes, ...he never made any great show or parade, either in uniform or retinue...he was known to every soldier in his army, and was respected by all.\\" page 63. Of General Howard from the south, \\"It occured to me at once that Harris had been as much afraid of me as I had been of him...From that event to the close of the war, I never experienced trepidation upon confronting an enemy...I never forgot that he had as much reason to fear my forces as I had his. This lesson was valuable.\\" page 149. Grant humbly lets the reader know how he was able to win battles, get promoted, and end the war. Basically, most generals on both sides were hesitant to attack where Grant attacked any chance he got. Page 35, \\"One of my superstitions had always been when I started to go anywhere, or to do anything, not to turn back, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished.\\" President Lincoln eventually recognizes these qualities in Grant and makes in the top general of all the Union armies. Grant had a clear vision and plan and executed it quickly once he had the power to do it. You may be wondering why I gave it a 4 rather than a 5. Sometimes Grant gets into way too much detail about different things where the story and chapter drags on. But if you are patient, you will get by all of this and appreciate the intimacy and first hand experience of one of the most effective generals in US history."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. It is the first book I bought that I actually highlighted quotes from. It is one of the best books on the War between the States from one of the most important figures in American History."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I entirely agree with the praise that previous reviewers have heaped upon these extraordinary memoirs. It is beyond a shadow of doubt that the two finest autobiographical works in American history are this by Grant and the earlier one of Benjamin Franklin.Grant is a remarkable prose stylist who offers unforgettable set-pieces: life as an indifferent and non-soldierly cadet at West Point, downplayed heroics of a junior officer in the Mexican War, dreary days in far-off California, waiting fretfully in General McClellan's outer office while hoping that one of the gilded staff officers might notice him; taking command of his first regiment and being introduced to the troops as \\"United States\\" Grant, leading a brigade over a hill to discover that the enemy commander had been even more frightened of him than he had been of the Confederate, demanding the capitulation of his once and future friend Confederate Simon Bolivar Buckner to earn the name of \\"Unconditional Surrender\\" Grant, Grant as supreme commander offering a command to McClellan only to be turned down because Little Mac had the presidential bug, and finally that amazing, brilliantly etched scene in which the dusty Union generalissimo meets the magnificently turned-out Robert E. Lee in the living room of a house at Appomattox Court House.That said, I feel obliged to warn that neither Franklin nor Grant should be given their readers' absolute trust. About Franklin I shall say no more than that he was simultaneously one of the most admirable men who ever lived and more than a little bit of a scoundrel. Only such a man of corkscrew soul could have performed so exquisitely at the Court of Louis XVI during the War of Independence.Grant was not a man who wrote to justify his failures (such as about half the Yankees and almost all the Confederates) nor was he a man to re-fight ancient battles (such as Jubal Early), but he did have his pet peeves. Grant's method of dealing with them was to blot them out of history. During the war, one of the most prominent members of Grant's inner circle was John Rawlins, who often served as de facto chief of staff in an army which did not yet have a general staff. After the war, Grant took notice that Rawlins had often been far more concerned about Grant going on a bender than he'd been with fighting Confederates and, worse, that some thought Rawlins to be the brains behind Grant's military successes. Those were subjects about which Grant had become touchy, to say the least. In the memoirs, Rawlins is reduced to a faint figure in the background.Throughout the war, Grant had been friendly with and highly respectful of Henry Wager Halleck, known in the army as \\"Old Brains,\\" for awhile his immediate superior in command. Grant believed that Halleck had protected him and supported him against attacks from envious generals and Washington politicians. When Grant was researching these memoirs by examining the War Department files, he came upon correspondence between Halleck, then commander of the western theater and McClellan, the overall Union commander. They had clucked like a pair of hens over the manifold sins of loutish, drunken, lazy, insubordinate Grant, almost to the point of dismissing him from command. Grant quietly blew a gasket. Halleck was hurled into the outer darkness with Rawlins.Grant, then, does not tell quite the whole story but, ah, what he does tell is magnificent. This is a true classic!Five stars."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses. S Grant, and General Grant's conduct of his role in the Civil War stand as two of the highest, most nobly Human and Honorable credits to the United States - ever.Conducting an effort involving thousands of people on several fronts stretched over a thousand miles would be a huge achievement even today. But do it on horseback and on foot. Do it without cell phones, GPS, decent maps, radar, and with medical support little better than butchery.Tradition has always cast Grant's opponent, Gen. Lee, as a \\"refined and gracious Gentleman officer\\", and he was those things. But Grant's simplicity and humility, his intelligence and heart, made him every bit as gracious and elegant as his southern foe.Grant's memoirs show, all of us, what the Civil War was really like for, and did to, an ordinary, decent, affable human who could have just as easily been our neighbor, or uncle or fishing partner. It illustrates one ordinary American who achieved the Extraordinary with mostly just his determination and belief in Purpose. Of a hundred or more incidents that prove Grant's goodness and humanity I doubt any could outshine his deep concern for reconciiation at the war's end and his insistance upon immediate respect for the vanquished at Appomattox. He shepherded a nation divided through it's darkest, most desperate days and then gave that wounded nation it's finest hour. This IS Ulysses S. Grant, a Man among Men."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"As I read this book, which includes both volumes of General Grant's memoirs, I couldn't help but wonder how many thousands of people had read it before me over the past 120 some odd years and if they, too, came away as impressed with the general as I have been. And I couldn't help but wonder if they also came to see the general, not as the narrow caricature which has come down to us - as a failure in business, a cigar chewing drunk, a man who willingly led his men to slaughter, and a corrupt president - but as an intelligent, thoughtful, honest, humane, and brilliant leader whose primary failing seems to be that he found it almost impossible to speak ill of his fellow man.I learned more about American history by reading this book than I ever learned in school while, at the same time, learning it from a man who was actually helping to create that history before, during, and after the Civil War. In the process, I learned, for the first time, why America is considered by many to be an imperialist nation and why so many Mexicans feel that Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California should legitimately be part of Mexico. I also learned that unscrupulous and conniving politicians are nothing new to the American political scene and that even way back then many leaders, both military and political, placed their fortunes above the call of duty, honor, and country as many do now.I have often heard the question asked: \\"If you could have dinner with any historical figure, living or dead, who would it be?\\" Before reading this book, I would never have considered Ulysses S. Grant to be that person. Now, I'm not sure he wouldn't be very close to the top of my list. What an interesting man - very human, down to Earth, thoughtful, tolerant, and humble - yet brilliant. Based on my reading of his memoirs, he was simply the kind of man you'd like to have as your best friend, and if you had to fight a war he's the man you'd want to have to plan your strategy.I found this book to be interesting throughout, but I particularly enjoyed the early part of volume one, that part leading up to the time at which Grant first became a general, and the final chapter of volume two in which the general summed it all up. Those early chapters show Grant as the man he truly was, and that final chapter is an absolute must read.Bottom line: Any serious student of the Civil War must read this book, and anyone having the slightest interest in American history would certainly be wise to read it."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

For a military leader, Grant writes with tenderness and strong opinions about the United States' role in taking Texas away from Mexico. He shows the heart of a man who wanted to see men go back home to wives and children. He laughs, he loves, he weeps. The style of the books is a fast read (well, fast for 500 pages!), but it moves along. While it does a great job on history, Grant is not bashful about putting in his view and commentaries on the actions of other leaders, his insight in leadership, his love for the people of all races, and his hatred for death. While his legacy stands side-by-side with Lincoln, for many people in the American west (especially the Mexican people) he was a man that was not to be feared. When a town was taken over, the people ran in fear, but only to come back, open their doors, shops, and windows, and welcome the kindness of a general who simply learned to live among other cultures and people. In the end, you are left with the picture of man, not a General. It gives the reader great hope that our jobs and tasks do not define us--our hearts define us."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I have never been much of a Civil War fan, but after reading &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; by Shaara, a historical fiction about Gettysburg, I was interested in following up with some non-fiction about the most important event in US History. This book kept me turning the pages from end to end. Despite its bulk (some 618 pages) I simply couldn't put the book down, as Grant's matter-of-fact description of the events that surrounded him was completely engrossing.Grant was not an extraordinary man or brilliant tactician, his soldiers did not have the same obsession with him that the South held for Lee, he simply saw the war for what it was, a campaign against a rebellion. He looked at the entire war in its entirety, from battlefront to battlefront, and he repeatedly used that to his advantage. Many times he makes reference to deploying troops to no clear end other than to occupy an enemies flank, this often as a junior with no authority over the battle as a whole. Grant was a man of action, who realized he had to take a step in order to walk a mile. He took the battle to the enemy, divised clear and necessary steps which were needed to win the war as a whole. He was a general who did not just see the war as independent sets of battles, but saw those battles as a means to ending the Civil War.One of my favorite parts of the text was watching the scope of Grant's vision widen. Starting with his actions in the Mexican American War his vision is very limited: he sees only the immediate battle, and his descriptions focus on minutiae reflecting his low rank. His vision escalates with his rank, until the end of the book, with the surrender of Lee, he sees and describes the entire army, and battles that would have once taken chapters to described are now dismissed in single sentences.My one disappointment with the book was that it ended with the surrender of Lee at Appomatox. I would have liked to learn more about his actions after the war, and especially learned more about his presidency. I wish that there were similar autobiographies by other presidents, and certainly feel that this one elevated my expectations of all other autobiographies!Favote Excerpts:&quot;It is men who wait to be selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect the most efficient service.&quot; - Grant (page 368)&quot;All he wanted or had ever wanted was some one who would take the responsibility and act, and call on him for all the assistance needed, pledging himself to use all the power of the government in rendering such assistance.&quot; - Grant on Lincoln (page 370)&quot;Wars product many stories of fiction, some of which are told until they are believed to be true.&quot; - Grant (page 577)&quot;To maintain peace in the future it is necessary to be prepared for war.&quot; - Grant (page 614)&quot;The war begot a spirit of independence and enterprise. The feeling now is, that a youth must cut loose from his old surroundings to enable him to get up in the world.&quot; - Grant (page 616)"},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is an incredible Memoir, but the edition that you want is the one by the Library of America. Yes you will pay a little more, but you will get a better quality edition, and you will get 200 pages of letters written by Grant, including letters sent to Lincoln and Halleck. These letters give you an even better insight of Grant the general/husband /person.If there is anyway at all possible that you can spend the extra $9 I recommend doing it. If you are on a shoe string budget then buy this edition. It is a 5 star memoir, even without the letters.I have a full review at the other edition, but I will say that I cannot recommend Grant's memoirs enough. It really is an awesome book."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"More than the descriptions of the great battles, which were of such great scale that they were beyond my ability to grasp, I was most impressed with the courage and intelligence of the man, who wrote these memoirs while dying of a painful cancer. His assessments of the generals on both sides, many of whom he knew intimately from the Mexican war, are priceless. I think the one I like best was of General Warren -- \\"His difficulty was constitutional and beyond his control. He was an officer of superior ability, quick perceptions, and the personal courage to accomplish anything that could be done with a small command.\\"General Grant also never lost the ability to make fun of himself (a lost art among today's leaders?), recalling being mocked by a stablehand who had seen him prancing in his uniform shortly after being commissioned. Perhaps that is why in his prime Grant so often wore a simple private's shirt with his proper insignia of rank.The anecdotes from his conversations with President Lincoln are unforgettable. So are stories from the war with Mexico, when long-range Mexican cannonballs came into his lines at such shallow angles that his men could open ranks to avoid the bounding projectiles. The language of the day - \\"reducing\\" the enemy \\"works\\" with great \\"execution\\" -- adds to the enjoyment and reminds the reader of today's \\"collateral damage\\" military jargon.Grant, great lover of a good cigar, comments on his observations from the war with Mexico that people smoked tobacco more when it was an expensive item they they did later when the price was much cheaper.Where are such men today? Probably still out there waiting for the next great challenge to bring them forward. General Grant comments that \\"Those who wait to be selected, rather than those who seek, can be expected to provide the most efficient service.\\""},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"A must read for all Civil War buffs and those even remotely interested in history. The 600+ pages in this book (both volume I and II are included together) articulately spell out the military career of one of the United States' greatest generals. Grant's Memoirs are well-written, thoughtful, insightful, and offer more than a glimpse into the mind of U.S. Grant.Volume I opens with a heartfelt preface where Grant explains how his diminishing health pushed him to complete this work and &quot;asking no favor but hoping (his remarks) will meet the approval of the reader.&quot; They most definitely do. Following the preface, the reader is given a (very) short review of his early childhood, life at West Point, and early Army life. The next one hundred pages are dedicated to the Mexican War followed by his resignation from the military and civilian life in Illinois. The remainder of Volume I and all of Volume II extensively deal with the War Between the States.I found Volume I (written before Grant realized he was critically ill) to be rich in detail of the various military campaigns (perhaps too detailed) and his ascension through the military ranks, but it is somewhat lacking in personal observations and insights. It even drags at times--but stick with it. The patient reader will not be dissapointed. Volume II hurls the reader into the conflict, reads rapidly, and is rife with Grant's personal observations and insights.This second volume picks up where the first left off--following Vicksburg to the campaigns in Tennessee to the Battle of the Wilderness to Sherman's March to the Sea to the Battle of Franklin right up to Appomattox and all the events of April and May 1865. These campaigns are told from the commanding general's perspective with great overview and detail. However, what really makes Volume II (and this volume is much more fast paced than the first) special are all the personal observations and insightful (rarely negative and always humble) comments about those Grant served with and against. Grant is thoughtful and displays much about himself as this great book draws to a close. An eloquently written, detailed, first-person account of the Civil War that offers much to those who read it.I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"General Grant wrote this book while dying of throat cancer. He had been swindled by a dishonest Wall Street Broker and his trophies and possessions were stripped from him to satisfy the demands of his debtors. Bankrupt, suffering from a terminal illness and never passing a moment without acute pain, he produced this magnificent monument to his greatness. Those who denigrate Grant as a drunkard, butcher, bumbling President need to read this book in order to correct these errant assumptions. It is impossible to read this book and not realize that Grant was an inordinately intelligent man and one hell of a writer.Grant's Memoirs are a deserved classic in American literature and considered the greatest military Memoirs ever penned, exceeding Caesar's Commentaries. Grant wrote as he lived: with clear, concise statements, unembellished with trivialities or frivolities. The only &quot;criticism&quot; the reader might have is that Grant bent over backwards not to wound the feelings of people in the book. He takes swipes at Joe Hooker and Jeff Davis, but what he left unsaid would have been far more interesting. A compelling and logical reason why Grant was so spare in his comments was because he was involved in a race with death. He didn't know how long he could live and therefore, &quot;cut to the chase.&quot;Grant's assessments of Lincoln, Sherman, Sheridan and other military leaders are brilliant and engrossing. His style, like the man himself, was inimitable and couldn't be copied. In everyday life, Grant was a very funny man, who liked to listen to jokes and tell them himself. His sense of the absurd was acute. It's no accident that he loved Mark Twain and the two hitched together very well. Twain and Grant shared a similar sense of humor, and Grant's witicisms in the Memoirs are frequent, unexpected and welcome. There are portions where you will literally laugh out loud.Though Grant's Memoirs were written 113 years ago, they remain fresh, vibrant and an intensely good read. I have read them in! their entirity 30 times in my life and I never weary of the style and language that Grant employed. He was a military genius to be sure, but he was also a writer of supreme gifts, and these gifts shine through on every page of this testament to his greatness. All Americans should read this book and realize what we owe to Grant: he preserved the union with his decisive brilliance. A truly oustanding book."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Grant's memoirs are a must-read for any serious student of the Civil War. While praise is heaped upon Confederate generals such as Lee and Jackson, Grant's legacy has always been a little more uncertain. His reputation has been associated with allegations of drunkenness, and with an apparent unflinching ability to send men to their slaughter which this book helps to dispel.Lincoln loved Grant, as he was the first Union commander who seemed willing to fight it out with Lee's army, and who enjoyed any consistent success. When one considers Grant's predecessors at the helm of the Union army, one can understand Lincoln's enthusiasm. You had McClellan, who never read an exaggerated report of the enemy size he didn't believe; &quot;Fighting Joe Hooker&quot;, flanked and embarrassed at Chancellorsville; Burnside, who foolishly sent wave after wave of Union soldiers across the Rappahanock to attack an impregnable stone wall at Fredericksburg; and Pope, who was soundly beaten at Manassas. Meanwhile, Grant caught Abe's attention with his successful siege of Vicksburg in the summer of 1863, as Meade was beating Lee at Gettysburg.Reading Grant's Memoirs is a fascinating experience, as the war, at least that part of it involving Grant, comes to life in the hands of a thoughtful commentator. Grant was obviously there, and he shares informative communications with his inferior officers (such as Sherman) and with the President. Grant sent many men to their doom to be sure, (the Wilderness campaign comes to mind as being especially bloody and ineffective), but overall you get the sense that Grant was respected by his men, who were happy to be marching forward and not backwards after a battle. He restored a sense of pride and accomplishment that was sorely lacking in the Union rank and file. He gave cogent reasons in his memoirs for the actions undertaken, sometimes admitting mistakes in humble fashion, and sometimes explaining why a siege would accomplish the same overall goal without unnecessary bloodshed.My only regret is that Grant didn't live long enough to write a companion memoir about his presidency, which was clearly outside the scope of this book. Readers who have gotten this far in the Amazon review process are no doubt aware that a broke Grant, stricken with painful throat cancer, wrote out his Memoirs of the Civil War right up until the end of his life to provide financially for his family, finishing the book days before he died. We should all be grateful that he was able to preserve these pages for prosperity, they are truly a model of military memoirs that I consider an extremely rewarding reading experience. When one considers the circumstances in which Grant composed this work, the end result is nothing short of miraculous."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"This is one of the best, if not the best autobigoraphy of any major military leader. This is the most insightfull view of the cival war, after all he was there. Grant writes in a clear detirmined tone, and is suprisingly modest and fair to all sides. The vast majority of the book is written about his military career. He gives one of the best acounts of the Mexican War, and a long and very descriptive account of his Cival War campains. He talks very little about his years in private life, or his years as president. He seemed to feel uncomforable out of uniform, and trusted the wrong people too much.Very few people come across as well as Grant in their autobiographies. One of the great military leaders this country has had. As a general, much like Washington. he was only a good but not brilliant tactian. What made him great was that he simply knew how to win, and did whatever he had to win. He understood that war is not about honor, it is about winning, and sending the troops home with their goal acomplished."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"The book is remarkable for its clarity of speech and the simplicity of its presentation, but most of all for the quality of focus of a man whose final chapter is as moving as any I have read, and written just a week before he died. I recommend that the trilogy of Grant; CAPTAIN SAM GRANT, GRANT MOVES SOUTH, and GRANT TAKES COMMAND, be read first. Then read his MEMOIRS, and follow it up with ON THE BORDER WITH CROOK. The characters in the MEMOIRS appear prominently in all the others; men known by Grant from West Point, the Mexican American War, and who served, subsequently, as officers during the Indian Wars following the Civil War. Connections such as these fascinate me. Grant's knowledge of his adversaries most of who he knew from experience was perhaps his greatest weapon. Yet, war being war, he never let let friendship interfere with his duty, which is why he became known as UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER (U.S.) GRANT. it seemed to me the more he got into his work, the better he expressed himself, and his CONCLUSION rose to the level of greatness as a writer. He seemed the perfect compliment to Abe Lincoln whose policies he hoped to carry forward."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"No less an eminent man of letters than Mark Twain called Ulysses S. Grant's &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot; &quot;the best [memoirs] of any General's than Caesars.&quot; Having now read this outstanding work along with those of Julius Caesar, William T. Sherman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, Colin Powell and H. Norman Schwarzkopf, I must agree with Mark Twain's assessment. For sheer honesty, humility, and simple but powerful language, U.S. Grant's memoirs are without peer.Grant allows the reader to go along with him and live once again his experiences during the Mexican War and American Civil War. He interjects his own judgments and opinions sparingly, yet always honestly. Where he feels he made mistakes, he admits them freely, and his criticisms of his colleagues is always tempered by an obvious attitude of professionalism. The fact that Grant wrote a memoir of such eloquence while dying from cancer makes it all the more powerful a book.I found this modern library edition especially outstanding. The introductory notes by Caleb Carr and Geoffrey Perret, while brief, are extremely informative. Maps and etchings from the original 1885 Charles Webster &amp; Co. edition are included, as is General Grant's report to Secretary of War Stanton on Civil War operations during 1864-65. This appendix makes fantastic reading by itself!I highly recommend this outstanding edition to all Civil War and military history enthusiasts. It is simply the best military memoir I've ever read."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Being a Civil War buff, I just received a copy of the old 2-volume edition of this book as a birthday present. It turned out to be one of the better presents I have received.Grant begins by stating that he will NOT present all the details of each campaign and battle. He keeps this promise. Rather, the book is a general overview of his background, youth, and military career from Mexico through the Civil War.I expected some self-aggrandizement, but was (pleasantly)surprised by Grant's frankness and obvious sincerity. He tells things as he experienced them, with no flourishes. When he was wrong, he says so. When credit belongs to someone else, he also says so. It is a straight-forward story by an obviously straight-forward man. Knowing that he was soon to die, Grant wrote a remarkably honest piece - especially compared to the works of some of his contemporaries.When I finished reading the book, I don't believe that I knew that much more about the war itself. Rather, my strongest impression was of Grant's character; that I had, in a sense, met the man.It is a book NOT be to missed."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"I've always been a Lincoln fan and have read a lot of biographies and other things about him but have not had too much interest in the military history of the Civil War. I certainly know enough to get by with someone who does know more but only as happenstance in reading about Lincoln. I actually don't know why I bought the Grant book because I rarely buy biographies or autobiographies and certainly not by Civil War generals. I think I had read that Grant was a very good writer, like Lincoln, and that it is considered amongst the best autobiographies by a military person since Julius Caesar. Also, and this intrigued me for some reason, I'd read that one of the reasons given for Grant's success was his ability to \\"on the fly\\" write out clear, succinct orders on the battlefield that his generals or subordinates could follow and win. In the book a good number of these Orders are re-produced and I'd swear that if I had a map and knew how to move military units around I could follow his orders, they are that clear.Anyway, I picked up the Grant book and I thought it was absolutely fascinating. He IS a very good writer and his analysis of what happened during the Civil War (and the Mexican War before it) is really fascinating. I think it is the first \\"primary source\\" (e.g. a participant in the history writing about it) that I've ever read. What I found most fascinating were his character sketches of the Union generals and of his Confederate opponents. One of the many things he said that struck me is that it is very easy in war for an army or a general to become over-awed by the reputation of the enemy or its generals. But because he had gone to West Point and fought alongside (even if very indirectly) almost all the Confederate generals, including Lee, he knew they were human beings and good as they were could make mistakes and be fooled. The other thing was his relationship to General Sherman as compared to the other Union generals. With Sherman, his orders were always general, focused on the goal. He left it to Sherman how he went about accomplishing the goal. Almost every other General received explicit orders from Grant with clear and specific tasks they needed to accomplish. Sherman, for his part, knew he had the total trust of Grant but never presumed upon it, he always ran his plans by Grant first and Grant willingly would do what he needed to do from his end to help Sherman succeed. His opinion of Lee was very high and he worked hard to move fast against Lee because he knew Lee could get himself out of jams if given half a chance.That is the other thing about Grant - the thing he hated most was not jumping on opportunities to push the enemy when they came available. My impression was that that was the most unpardonable sin in his book, he would tolerate just about anything else. It was also what Lincoln valued most in him. I'd read this elsewhere but Grant confirmed it that Lincoln stated upfront that he did not know how to fight a war but his job was to do whatever Grant needed him to do to help Grant win. Finally, I learned a lot about the battles in the West that I had not known before. As Grant noted, the West was important but still a back-water theatre compared to the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac. I had not realised how \\"Eastern biased\\" most of the books I'd read about the Civil War were until I read Grant's book."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Over the past year or so I have read several books related to the history of the Civil War, including several that focused on Ulysses S. Grant. This moved me to seek out and read his memoirs, to see in his own words, his perspective on his role as a military leader and president. I found his recounting of his role(s) during the Civil War to be very interesting and informative. I expected to see more about his role as President, given that this was to be a complete memoir. Nonetheless, for anyone really interested in the details of the Civil War campaigns that Grant was involved in, this is an important book."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

Grant","review":"This book probably tells more about Grant than any biography. In fact, none of his biographers seem to be able to do him justice. Grant's personal diffidence may have played some part in this. The clarity of expression and lean, strong use of the language tells us much about the type of man that Grant was. Grant seems to be an ordinary man who took advantage of his opportunities and whose guiding principal was perseverance and more perseverance. In fact, many of us are drawn to him because he seems to have been so ordinary, not regal, aristocratic, handsome, imposing. He had many problems that are common, business failures and alcoholism. Yet Grant finally got a real chance and took advantage of it. He was not without his moments of brilliance. The Vicksburg campaign was marvelous strategy. The relief of Chattanooga was complex and brilliantly executed. His final move against Petersburg and the railroads, trapping Lee's army, was solid and, in the final analysis, effective. Grant is still something of an enigma. These memoirs do not solve that, but contribute to our understanding of this great figure in our history. After having studied much literature about him, I find myself drawn to this plain spoken, hard working man, much more so than Lee or Jackson. Some of Grant's character shows here. It helps if you have read a great deal of civil war history prior to picking this up. Bruce Catton's books on Grant and on the Army of the Potomac would be a good place to start."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"This has long been regarded as one of the better memoirs to come out of the post-Civil War period and I can see why. Grant seemed convinced that the course he was on, and more importantly, the course the Union was on, would lead to eventual victory. Grant wrote his memoirs in the hope of providing some financial security for his wife and family upon the event of his death, which came very soon after finishing his memoirs. This is a refreshingly honest, fair, and generally unpretentious account detailing his own role in this pivotal event in American history.We get a brief glimpse into his early years, his time as a student at West Point, his military service in the Mexican American War and the most well-known period of Grant's life, his service in the Union army during the Civil War. I found the early part of the book to be very illuminating as I did not know that much about his life before the Civil War. He could be very self-effacing, could admit weaknesses, in other words he just seems to come across as plain spoken and honest about himself. Throughout the book he utters what I considered to be very insightful and thoughtful comments. For example, he admitted the reputation attached to Lee by the Northern press and other Union commanders, but he realized that Lee was still human. He also relates his first encounter as a commander in the Union army as he's about to face the enemy and finds that the enemy was just as frightened as he was. Grant's attitudes toward the earlier war with Mexico and the Southerners' attachment to their cause also offer revealing sentiments.I'm not going to describe every campaign Grant was involved in, but you will encounter Grant in the western theatre first, with notable successes achieved at Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, and etc., up to his appointment as Lieutenant General and head of all U.S. armies in the field. The nearly epic battles fought between Lee and Grant in Virginia from the spring of 1864 up through Lee's surrender at Appomattox in April 1865 are obviously covered, though we also get information on Sherman's movements in Georgia and the Carolinas and other important sections where the war was being waged. I think it's fair to say there is a certain amount of spin or a sort of expectations game being displayed in Grant's memoirs, for example, how the Union armies usually always inflicted heavier casualties on the Confederates, how the North, despite its superiority in numbers, actually had many disadvantages and etc. Some of his points are very valid, but there can also be no doubt that his victories in Virginia came at very heavy costs in terms of Union casualties.Grant offers opinions on the quality of the soldiers and officers, both North and South. He also demonstrates throughout his memoirs his rather magnanimous feelings toward his opponents, the rights of Southern citizens and their property (i.e., showing restraint in terms of looting and wanton destruction of private property and etc.). Some of this, I'm sure, was an attempt to improve his own image, but no doubt, there had to be some truth in his sentiments expressed. The maps included in this volume are very detailed, but often difficult to read. As a military narrative of the movements, battles and strategies of the Union armies, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

Although, of course, the Civil War battles and battle preparations are of utmost importance, I enjoyed his running commentary about horses, railroads and river navigation even more. His writing style was very direct and succinct, but inclusive of the life teeming around him. He was an expert quartermaster in the army, could remember the topography of a map after seeing it once and had a way with horses. You really get to know his world and after reading this book I wanted to read other first hand accounts of life in the 19th century, and have. Thus I discovered that Teddy Roosevelt is just about the best writer who was president, after Grant. And learned alot about wolves, cougars and buffalo in one of his books.This book has been the greatest eye opener for me. I guess I thought that people of history are somehow different than people of our times.

Grant","review":"Grant thought the war with Mexico was deceitful aggression, but he served America honorably. With Sherman's help he came to understand what the Civil war was about and how it had to be conducted - with unflinching brutality. Grant, a deeply humble and honest person, was intellectually superior to Lincoln. He and Sherman stand head and shoulders above Clausewitz. Grant wanted freed blacks to become dignified, self-supporting citizens and he set in motion a successful program to accomplish that. His compassionate wisdom was ignored and we are still a divided, rancorous and unjust nation as a result.Other nations later paid a terrible price for ignoring Grant's dogged defense of the Union; at Appomatox Lee had almost nothing to surrender since most southern soldiers had deserted. That's what war had become - not tactical brilliance but grinding down the opponents' will. Carnage. Petersburg pointed the way to the stalemate on the Marne; Shiloh reads like the Battle of the Bulge. If European leaders had learned from Grant there would be no disastrous Versailles to reinvigorate German will.Grant's personal reflections should be the basic American schoolbook. Well, maybe the maps could be improved. And the diary of General Pemberton's lady companion might be overlooked."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"The finest work of military literature ever written"},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant","review":"The book is for the most part wonderful. I was left with a clear understanding of how Grant got to his zenith in the Civil War, but I was left wondering what insights he had into his failed Presidency. As the book was finished 20 years after the war, this seems a curious oversight. It is, of course, an autobiography, so it is necessarily an unobjective view of things. Nonetheless, one message is clear: Grant was truly a man who met with a moment, but who clearly might easily have spent his life as an anonymous merchant in Ohio or as a mathematics instructor at West Point. Once assuming command of the Union Army, he was an efficient leader, but perhaps not a brilliant tactician. What he brought to the table was tenacity, a will to fight, something his predecessors lacked. He latched onto Lee and never let go, understanding that attrition would favor the wealthier and more populous Union. The result was victory, but at an awful toll. Grant's memoirs paints a picture of an honest, unassuming and sometimes sentimental man who was designed for this one mission. The rest of his life was unspectacular, and further reading into his Presidency reveals he had rather poor judgment in politics, but those who cherish this Union owe him a debt of eternal gratitude."},{"Title":"Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S.

It is about love and cultural differences. But, also it is about political differences and the situation of Latinos living on Europe for personal and/or political reasons. What I like about it is that the author uses different voices (his voice, the girlfriend, and the voic of those around them)"},{"Title":"Library Of Romantic Piano","review":"Another fat and interesting ring-bound book in the same series as &quot;The Library of Piano Classics.&quot; This book contains around 80 pieces from the Romantic period: mostly Chopin, Brahms, Mendelssohn, Schubert, and Schumann, but with single pieces by many other composers.Be wary if you own or intend to buy &quot;The Library of Piano Classics&quot; book one and two - most of the pieces in Romantic Piano are included in these two books (especially book one): only about 25 of the 80 pieces are unique to Romantic Piano, and these are generally the lesser known works. (Very disappointing!) The printing in some pieces is also of a lower quality in this volume, but it's certainly still readable and better than many other books on the market."},{"Title":"The Memories We Keep","review":"I could not put this book down. For Mr. Zacharius to have written such a poignant book about something we should all forever be aware of is amazing. The depth of his characters is \\"major\\". The chilling facts of the death camps and Hitler's terrorism against an innocent race should be understood by each and everyone of us and NEVER FORGOTTEN. I commend Mr. Zacharius for his compelling story and wish he had more books out for us to read.

However, now her past has caught up to her as clarinet player Vinnie Sforza sends her a letter stating he saw her in a Pathe newsreel working in the Israeli fields and by the time she reads his note, he will be airborne to see her so that they can remember the good but short time together in Brooklyn or perhaps be kicked out by her.Mia looks back to fleeing Poland where in 1939 she went from a talented teenage pianist to being \\"that Jew\\" forced to play Hitler's Wagner instead of her beloved Chopin. Her father sold diamonds to get the family passage to the allies, but they were betrayed and placed on a train to Treblinka. As far as she knows only she escaped by fleeing to America where she met Vinnie. Unsure whether she can truly love someone again, Mia, obsessed with her family probably dead in the death camp, leaves Vinnie for Paris as an undercover operative helping the allies by becoming a dominatrix servicing Nazi customers. Now Vinnie is coming to see his true love.The description of life in Poland in the late 1930s and early 1940s is incredibly detailed, vivid and harrowing as readers will wonder how people can do this to other people in the name of God and Hitler. Just having Chopin replaced by Wagner symbolizes how much the Nazis cleansed impure races especially the Jews. The small segue in New York is also deep as the impact of the horrors on Mia's soul overwhelm her love of music and of Vinnie. Though the Paris take turns too raunchy, historical readers will appreciate this powerful reminder that any form of human cleansing is an abomination.

I read for six hours straight. The believable plot line of a Poland girl before, during and after the holocaust both enchanted and terrified me. Her struggle to keep her true self unchanged throughout a series of historical, ungodly events captivated me. There are some raunchy, disturbing parts that would be wrong to look past as everything about the holocaust is.

It was a rather quick read as well."},{"Title":"Computerized Bookkeeping in Laymens Terms","review":"As corny as this sounds, reading this book saved me two thousand dollars making only one point on donations. Being self employed, I need every right off I can get. I give quite a bit to charity, but when it came to buyng a new car, I thought I would donate my old car to charity for a tax deduction - it sounds so good, right? WRONG! The book value of my car was $3,800. I was in the process of giving my car away while I was reading this book, and I couldn't believe was I was reading. After talking to my CPA, I discovered that my $3,800 car would have been worth just over $500 in tax reduction to the IRS. It made me sick! I don't mind helping charties, but I am not made of money. I sold the car for $2,500, which is obviously a much better deal than a $500 tax reduction. I would have never known about this until after the fact. I am so glad I read this book!This author is very funny, sarcastic, and a matter of fact. I got very upset reading the chapter on taxes, but the truth is the truth. The IRS get's there share - and the author makes her jokes. It is refreshing. This book is more than explaining Quick Books, it gives so much more information - especially for small businesses. I have a mortgage company and want to keep my books as simple as possible. This book is very easy to read and understand. I would recommend this book to everyone - especially the small business owner!"},{"Title":"Computerized Bookkeeping in Laymens Terms","review":"Julie:I started to read your book and I found that I could not put it down. When I told myself that, I felt like a nerd. What kind of person gets their kicks out of reading tax and bookkeeping stuff.Well I guess I do! Your book is candy for someone that is interested in bookkeeping.This book is just the thing to let me have the confidence to face that bad bookkeeping world out there. I knew 95% of everything that I was reading but, I read all of it anyway and you had things in there that I was completely unaware of. When I read these I just sat in awe of what I had just learned.I went through a wonderful bookkeeping course that taught me everything there is about bookkeeping and the course even had something about getting bookkeeping business but I always felt as if something was missing. I kept searching all over the place for months and I eventually came upon this book.I have re-read this book a couple of times and use it constantly as a reference.

Our accounting was in such a disarray that we couldn't even give our books to an accountant. We ordered Computerized Bookkeeping in Layman's Terms - it's in plain english and so easy to understand that and we were able to clean up our books ourselves. Now our balance sheet actually balances!"},{"Title":"Computerized Bookkeeping in Laymens Terms","review":"Hi - I read the other reviews for this book, and it sounded like exactly what I was looking for, so I bought it. Even though it did contain some good information, I was so distracted by the wording, grammar and spelling mistakes that I had trouble reading it, and finally gave up. So I returned it.I'll start out by listing some of the grammar and spelling mistakes (with page numbers):10: All's it takes is one human error.... (All's? Short for what?)38: Consultants are really all indirect expenses such as overhead if any. (huh?)38: Think of it as a \\"Cost of Service\\" account if your Joe Standard.... (you're)50: ...because that is what list you are at. (ending sentence with a preposition)51: QuickBooks is not automatically set up with it's own icon. (its)55: An Employee is someone in whom you pay an hourly rate or salary to, in which you deduct and pay their payroll taxes.57: We are going to make the business pay for it's own debts.57: Click on the Pay to the order of screen and type in the name of the company in whom you wrote the check out too. (in whom? Too?)61: When I'm posting these entries, I cannot expense them because we would have to track them as a fixed asset. You can only expense them at the end of the year when you post your depreciation. (Changing from \\"I\\" to \\"we\\" to \\"you.\\")79: If your entries are wrong, alls you have to do is, from the report your in, double click on the entry that is incorrect, it will open you up to the original entry, and you can change the account it's posted too. (alls? wait, I remember this word... your? Run-on sentence?)175: I know it's a pain and doesn't seem fair that you have to write something off that you buy over a period of time, but we didn't make the rules. (Misplaced modifier: she was trying to say: \\"I know it's a pain and doesn't seem fair to buy something, and then have to write it off over a period of time, but we didn't make the rules.\\"177: He used $1000.00 out of the Companies checking account by writing a check. (company's)Misspelled words: curser (63: for the little blinking thing on your screen), loose (70: lose), ketch (70, 90, 175: catch, the first time a came across this spelling, I thought she was just trying to be funny, but alas....)Political views: \\"Way to go Arnie!!!!\\" Distracting. If you want to say something like this, put it in the forward. Whether I agree with you or not, it distracts me from what I am trying to learn.All of these mistakes make me wonder how good her accounting advice is. No, I don't expect her to be an expert at vocabulary and grammar, but if she expects me to pay $70 for this book, I expect the grammar and spelling to be right. I don't think I'm asking too much.... If the grammar had been perfect, I probably wouldn't have gone looking for the publisher. But it wasn't, and I did, and so now I really am not sure if I should trust the advice of an unknown author who wrote a book that was then published by an unknown publisher. So from now on, if I buy a book that has the potential to change the way I do business, I will look for the known publisher, whose advice I feel I can trust."},{"Title":"Computerized Bookkeeping in Laymens Terms","review":"Computerized Bookkeeping in Laymen's Terms was written with my clients questions and needs in mind. My clients are the blue collar workers throughout the US who are not Harvard Graduates, but Self-Trained Entrepreneurs and tradesman who don't speak proper english. I welcome the notation from the no so favorable review and unfortunately I made a mistake. Each puplication is re-edited due to the templates and size of files throughout the book causing Word to change what it believes to be correct spelling to what I did correct or change. The wrong print file was sent to the printer with the un-edited changes to the book in which I did not realize until the review was posted on Amazon regarding the typos and gramatical errors. That mistake has been corrected. Any reader will be able to locate a typo or grammatical error in just about any publication, mine included. As far as changing the \\"slang\\" or grammer, I wrote the book in \\"Laymen's\\" Terms which defeats the purpose. Try explaining to a non bean counting professional how to do accounting in accounting language, and you will loose them. This book is the only Laymen's Term guide for the other 70% of the US Small Business population to finally figure out. The biggest question asked is, \\"If my small business has QuickBooks and I use the instruction manual that comes with the program, WHAT do I set up my books with? What do I need, and what are the Chart of Accounts?\\" Every QuickBooks instruction book has templates, how to set up accounts, how to bill customers, etc. What they don't have is Why, With What, and How do you read a financial report and what does it mean? What do I do to keep on top of my bookkeeping so my Accountant doesn't charge me a fortune at the end of the year? It is a wonderful tool that helps the small business owner answer the questions in a language that they speak.Julie A.
