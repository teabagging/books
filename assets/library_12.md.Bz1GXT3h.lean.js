He cannot remember exactly when and why he became so afraid of Erik, but he knows it has something to do with the cause of his near blindness. Paul has doubts about the explanation provided by his parents and has recently been experiencing flashbacks of memories from his early childhood that will ultimately reveal much more than the truth about this event; the memories will instill Paul with confidence and bravery to stand up for the truth.Although the character of Paul Fisher may be visually impaired, he is more insightful and perceptive than most 12 year old boys. He knows he is being ignored by his parents who seem to be obsessed with promoting his brother's future as a much desired college football place-kicker, the \\"Erik Fisher Football Dream.\\" Paul observes disturbing behavior by his brother, but is too afraid to mention what he has seen and heard because he feels his parents will not believe him if he reveals his knowledge, thus placing him at risk for no benefit.I did not want the book to end! The combination of Paul Fisher's heroics and the interesting plot twists and unsolved mysteries combined to make a terrific read. All of the characters are believable and well-developed. Young people will easily identify with the middle school and high school interactions, and root for Paul's emerging courage."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"\\"Once we dump this gargabe bag, that it will be it. That it will be the last evidence the Fisher family ever lived in Houston. Dad and my brother, Erik, are already gone. They've been living in Florida for a week now, with the sleeping bags, suit cases and chairs that they stuffed into Dad's Range Rover. The rest of our furniture left yesterday, professionally packed by two guys who really came to hate Mom. By now, it should be halfway over to our new address- a place called Lake Windsor Downs in Tangerine, Florida.\\"Paul is a not-so-average 12 year old. He wears thick glasses because of a mysterious eye injury. His brother, Erik, is a high school football star, but to Paul, he's no hero. Paul plays soccer himself, despite the glasses. When his family moves to Tangerine, every one tries to settle in. Dad becomes the Deputy Director of Civil Engineering. Mom is on the Architectural Committee. Erik, as usual, is the star on the football team. But as for Paul, fitting in will not be easy. Tangerine is a strange place: muck fires, lightning striking the same place. It gets even stranger when Paul discovers secrets about Erik, his friends, and his vision.Written in a journal format, it gives a very detailed and colorful description of Paul's point of view. This writing technique helped me create a \\"moving\\" picture of the plot. Edward Bloor's Tangerine is like a movie on paper.I recommend this book to those who like mystery, and to those who like making pictures of the story.(...)"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This is shelved in the children's department at my local Barnes & Noble, but I think it leans more towards a teen novel. Some of the situations are pretty violent, though there's nothing too terribly graphic. I would say 11 or 12 and up. This novel tells the story of Paul Fisher, a seventh grade kid who moves with his family to Tangerine County, Florida. It's kind of a creepy place. The development where he lives used to be covered with tangerine groves that slowly went out of business and were cut down. As a result, termites attack the houses, and Paul's school falls into a sinkhole. When he's placed at an alternate school in the lower-class downtown area of Tangerine, he gets placed on the soccer team and makes friends with a bunch of people he never would have met otherwise. It's a fast-paced sports action story with some elements of mystery- just why is Paul's brother Erik so frightening? What happened to Paul to damage his eyes when he was five and why can't he remember it?I really liked this book... a lot more than I thought I would, actually. I think most YA books can be recommended to kids and adults alike, and this novel is no exception. Especially recommended to fans of the book &lt;u>Holes&lt;/u> by Louis Sachar or &lt;u>The Chocolate War&lt;/u> by Robert Cormier."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This mysterious and interesting novel follows the journey of a teenaged boy named Paul Fisher and how he tries to fit into his new town. Shortly after Paul's dad got a new job in Tangerine, Florida Paul's family had to move, again. Paul tries to fit into his new school but while his brother is a football star Paul can't even get onto the soccer team. After a natural disaster at Paul's school Paul moves to a new school in Tangerine but this time he fit in a little better, even making the soccer team. Over the course of the book you find out that Paul's brother isn't such a football star and that maybe moving to Tangerine Florida wasn't the best idea for the Fisher's. I think that the moral of this story is that even though someone might seem nice and friendly, inside they could end up being the meanest person you have ever met. I recommend this book to anyone who like books you really don't understand until the very end and those kids who like soccer."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This story plot was unlike any book I've ever read for teens. Although definitley original and creative, this book lacked the drawing-in of it's readers.It didn't have the stability to keep the mystery of Paul's brother actually MYSTERIOUS. I, unfortunatley, am not a huge sports fan, so I basically skipped through all of the droning, detailed soccer games. All in all, this book lacked consistency. I reccommend this book to intellectual sports fans who like slow-paced (basically pointless) books."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"How would you feel if you moved to a different state and had a tough time getting used to your new surroundings? Well for Paul he has to experience that problem. Written by Edward Bloor, Tangerine, a fiction book, easily became a favorite for me. This book is filled with excitement and suspicion. You will be amazed on how this book will keep you glued to the pages, begging to read for more information.Paul Fisher moves from Texas to Florida. His older brother, Erik is a star football player and is favored by his father. Paul plays soccer but doesn't get much support from his father or brother. In the beginning of the book a sinkhole occurs at Paul's school. Parts of the school sink into a big hole covered in mud and rain. Paul is forced to transfer to another school. There he tries out for the soccer team and notices that there are older kids that tease him because of his glasses he wears due to his eyes getting damaged because he stared at the sun for a long period of time when he was younger. Paul manages to get through it and makes friends. You will have to read the book to find out how.The theme in this book is to \\"never give up\\". Paul is determined to play on the school soccer team and to get along with his teammates. I can relate to the main character Paul, because I also like playing soccer. Also it is true that sinkholes occur in Florida (where Paul's previous school experienced a sinkhole) and other states as well. I really like how the author chose the style of this book. He writes with great detail and uses fantastic words to describe characters. Tangerine won the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books Blue Ribbon. Edward Bloor lives in Florida with his wife and kids. This is his first novel and he is currently working on another one.I recommend this book to 5th graders and older. Even if you don't like reading fiction books, this book will easily become a favorite. Every page will leave you hanging with questions. You will be amazed on how much you will get to learn about the characters and events. Once you start reading this outstanding book, you wouldn't be able to put it down.By:Joanna Galeano"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine is a fantastic book! It starts out with Paul Fisher, the main character is moving to a county called Tangerine. There are sinkholes at his school, smoke that never stops and disappearing koi and thieves. Paul has weird glasses that he has had supposedly because he stared into a eclipse. But Paul knows that isn't true. Erik Fisher, Paul's older brother is in high school and is a no good glory stealing football player who tries to kill Paul. Erik gets away with everything even crimes!I think this is a great book for nine year olds through adults with some sad and some happy parts. Throughout this thrilling story there are bridges that connects from one thing to another. It was so exciting I didn't want to stop!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"The book Tangerine is in the thoughts and feelings of Paul Fisher, A 7th grade boy who loves to play soccer and who is partially blind because of a cruel incident that happened in his childhood. Paul has moved many times to many places and moves to a place called Tangerine. At Tangerine unusual things that Paul isn't used to, like muck fires, happen. Paul, his mother, father and his big brother Eric, are all surprised at what happens at Tangerine that didn't happen at the previous houses they had lived in.When they move to Tangerine, Paul starts to attend Lake Windsor middle school, but moves to another middle school because an unfortunate event that happens at Lake Windsor Middle School. So now Paul plays on a soccer team for his new middle school and Eric still plays football for Lake Windsor High School. Throughout most of the story, Eric and Paul's dad is going strong on the, \\"Eric Fisher football dream,\\" where their dad dreams of Eric becoming a famous, professional football star.In this story both fortunate, exciting things happen and also unfortunate, heart-breaking events take place. I think this book is quick moving, suspenseful and brings many mysterious surprises to the reader. I really recommend it to almost anyone that likes long, cliff-hanging stories."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine is a book about a boy called Paul Fisher. He just moves at the beginning of the book from Houston, Texas to Tangerine, Florida. Tangerine is a strange place where holes just appear in the ground. They are called sinkholes. Paul has a mother, a father and a brother named Erik. Erik is a star football kicker and is on a football team named the seagulls. Paul goes to a school named lake Windsor Middle. Then towards the middle of the book he has to switch schools because of an unfortunate mishap.I would definitely rank this a 5 gold star book. I like it especially because Erik makes it so unfair for Paul it makes me so angry I want to help Paul out. But it is funny when Erik does something that is embarrassing to him. This book got me to nonstop reading till I had to stop reading. I read this book as long as I could. I hope you like it as much as me."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"As soon as I started reading Tangerine by Edward Bloor I was excited, it seemed so interesting because the plot was nothing like any other book I'd ever read. I thought that the end would amazing and the best part of the book but when I finished I was a little disappointed. However, the trip to the end is wonderful with a lot of details and descriptions.The main character is a boy named Paul who is legally considered blind but has gotten better with special glasses that he wears, he can't remember how he became blind but thinks that it has something to do with an eclipse. He loves to play soccer but at Lake Windsor Middle School he can't because his mom fills out a form saying that Paul has a disability. Paul gets a second chance when his school is hit by a storm and the buildings collapse. He transfers to Tangerine Middle School and a lot of interesting things happen there. In the book there's also a lot of side stories that help lead you to the end of the book. Overall, the book is great but personally I was confused by the ending."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I really, really liked this book. It had such an exciting plot, and very realistic characters. There is always something exciting happening in the bizarre Tangerine County. This book is so symbolic; everything that happens in Tangerine symbolizes something in Paul's life. An exciting plot and realistic characters keep you reading until the last page."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"\\"Tangerine\\" is a book of mystery, fame, and sports. Paul Fisher is a normal teenage boy who has been a geek for his entire middle school career. His father had a job transfer, so the Fisher family's next destination was Tangerine, Florida; where the air always smelled like smoke. His brother, Erik, has always been the star football player. Paul was never an exceptional athlete, until he moved to Tangerine where he joined to school's soccer team. On the first day of tryouts, everything possible had gone wrong, not only in soccer, but in his family's life.Paul's first impression of Tangerine was sand, sand, and sandy hills. What kind of life would he have here? Was there anything to do in this new-developed city?This is a really good book for teenagers because they can relate to many of the same problems that Paul is facing. Paul makes this book more exciting with his adventurous personality throughout the book.\\"Tangerine\\" is a fast-paced book. It is also written with much detail, which includes vibrant portrayals of the characters, set in a sports venue. This book is of a struggle of a teenager growing up. At times he's down on his luck, but he always comes back with full strength. It is a memorable book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"War Eagles! War Eagles! War! War! War! This is the chant Paul Fisher's middle school soccer team yelled before every game.Just like the battle cry, the book, Tangerine, is a heart-pounding, exiting thriller. This book bounces around between Paul's present and past but comes together in a mind-boggling, although clear, conclusion.This intriguing story is about a boy, Paul Fisher, whose conflict in life is that he can never recall what happened to his eyesight. Unfortunately, Paul's parents get too caught up in his brother's football career and their own place in society to notice Paul's personal life and his need to recall the past. Journey with Paul as he tries to regain the truth about his family and all their buried memories.The story, Tangerine, is written in journal entries from Paul's diary. This format works because all the events occur through Paul's eyes, as he sees them. This plot works for us because it mixes adventure with mystery and engulfs the reader in suspense. Tangerine will make you laugh out loud, but it is really a serious book. There are deaths, robberies, and highly suspicious behavior throughout the story.This book was recommended to us by our eighth grade teacher, Ms. Childress. Now, we recommend it to you! Tangerine is for people of all ages who love twists and turns in their stories. If you like this book, we also recommend Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse. We recommend Out of the Dust because the main character, Billie Jo, faces similar conflicts as Paul Fisher does in Tangerine, like coming to terms with her family, her past, a disability, and death."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Thank you, Ms. Childress. We have a teacher, a very \\"UNIQUE\\" teacher. She introduces us to books all the time. The best one she has recommended is Tangerine by Edward Bloor.Tangerine is much like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. Like in Hatchet, there is page after page of mystery, suspense, and trauma. Yet, Tangerine is also different because Tangerine is even more mesmerizing and entertaining. Tangerine keeps you on your toes!This spectacular, almost perfect, book is about a nerdy boy setting himself free from his phony and controlling environment. Paul, the main character, is a dorky seventh grader surrounded by people who are focused on his popular older brother, Erik. In Tangerine, almost everything is not what it seems at first, so travel with Paul of his journey to find the truth.We really like the flow of this book. It is not too fast-paced, yet it keeps your attention. Tangerine is written in journal entries, which you will find very handy if you have a book report to do for your school (we know, because we did). We think the format works, and we love the ending. To parents out there looking for an educational book for your children to read: this is for you. It taught us about the citrus-growing industry in Tangerine, Florida, as well as the difference between right and wrong.The characters are so well defined we feel that we have been living with them. Paul seems just like my friend and me. We both are nerdy in our own way. The setting of Tangerine, Florida is perfect for growth and changes. The conflicts are original; you will not see anything else like them even at a Barnes and Noble superstore. You will become so involved with the story that you will jump up and down at the end. We were so engrossed that we were screaming in our minds and out loud, especially when disasters struck or there were new twists in the novel.We recommend this book mostly to boys of ages eight and up to whenever you die. You will love this book.!GO TANGERINE!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"The Geek of Texas is now the King of Tangerine!Wow! Need a reason to come to class? Then grab the book Tangerine! Our teacher, Ms. Childress, recommended this book by Edward Bloor, and we fell in love with it...and we are here to tell you it's awesome!Paul, the main character who's been lied to all his life, is searching for the truth. His 17-year-old brother Erik is the main attraction in the family because he's \\"daddy's little place kicker,\\" but that's all going to change.Paul's exciting journal entries documenting this change keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. We recommend this book to both middle school and high school students.The characters are very round and well described. Paul's story takes place in modern day Florida. We can relate to his small town because we live in one that's not much bigger.There is a gross amount of conflict in this book, and most of the problems revolve around Paul. However, the resolutions are very satisfying. They will answer any questions you may have and all of Paul's. The theme connects the conflicts together. From baseball bats to blackjacks, this book is action-packed, and the speed of this story is a steady pace.This book is a combination of Brian's Winter (with a character trying to survive) and the Harry Potter series (with a character finding out the truth).The novel generates many mixed emotions, and the emotions are ever changing. You never know when you're going to laugh or cry.If you're not psyched up already, there's nothing more we can do for you. Take our word and read this book!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"TangerineTangerine is an awesome book. Our teacher, Ms. Childress, read it out loud to the class. Tangerine is written like a diary or journal. At points in the story, our class laughed out loud. Often, the book was so full of suspense and danger, it made us sit at the end of our seats with our mouths open. Of course, we always wanted her to read more.The book is about a boy named Paul on a quest for the truth. Every day adds up and makes sense in the end. Tangerine makes you think. The story is so descriptive that you feel like you are standing there watching everything happening in front of your face. Many events happen in the book--both good and bad. People die, a lot of fights break out, a sinkhole opens, justice is required, girls phone, and games are won. Additionally, Paul's brother is an evil football player, and his father believes in and trusts his brother. His mother is too protective and doesn't stand up for Paul at all.Tangerine is suitable for middle school to high school students of both genders. This book reminds us of Among The Hidden. Both books keep you waiting and wanting more. If you like Among The Hidden, you should go to your nearest library and check out Tangerine now!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I like this book Paul is a good soccer player and good kid.

The students enjoyed talking about Paul and how he handled some tense situations. The author portrayed Paul as a person who wanted to have a normal school life, normal friends.

The suspense and surprises made this book enjoyable and hard to put down for my students. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine is an &quot;interesting&quot; book that shows the troubles of a legally blind boy. Paul and family move to Tangerine, Florida. His brother, Eric, tortures him. It was a mystery how he became blind. His school gets sucked into a sinkhole and then goes to a new school. Read about his troubles and good times.I didn't like this book because the plot didn't catch me. The characters were sometimes hard to believe but sometimes interesting. If you were looking to read a diary I would rather read the Diary of Anne Frank than this book. This book is for people who read half diaries, half novels."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul Fisher's older brother Erik is a high school football star, but to Erik he is just plain mean. Paul prefers soccer even though he has to wear these really thick glasses because, as you find out in the end of the book, his brother spray painted his eyes. His family moves to Tangerine, Florida where things are much different than he is used to. His home is right next to a muck fire, which is a fire that never goes out. He makes lots of friends at his first school, but his school is swallowed up by a sink hole. His parents move him to a harder school where he becomes friends with all of the &quot;tough kids&quot;. All of the tough kids are on his soccer team, he realizes that they are some of his best friends. Another strange thing that happens is: lightning strikes the same field everyday at the same time and place. A boy on Erik's football team was killed because he was standing in the place where the lightning struck when it struck. At the end of the book, Paul tells his parents that he really isn't blind. They are surprised but happy. Paul reveals all of his secrets of what he knows Erik has done. Erik was a thief and a murderer. He killed a brother of a girl and boy on Paul's soccer team! I really liked the book because it was funny, sad, and interesting. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read a book that they can't put down."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"When I read this book it didn't seem like there were any happy times in it. It seemed like all it was, was violence, and bullying. If I were older I think I would have understood it better, and maybe I would even like it.

So much was happing ,i was amazed. It was so intense. But then,the last page was so stupid. We NEVER know what happens to Erik,Arthur,Kerri, or anyone! We never know what happened to Arthur.And how does Pauls 3rd first day of school work out (I cant say why..read it yourself. What about hte muck fire,and the lightning,and the soocer team. what about Paul,does he get contacts or laser eye surgrey? What aobut the main plots of the book? They were left completely unfinish.

Paul moves to Lake Windsor in Tangerine, Florida. After attending his new school, it is sucked into the ground by a sinkhole. He transfers to Tangerine Middle School. Once again he has to adapt to his surroundings. The atmosphere is pretty bad, but as long as long as he can play soccer, he is happy. Paul wears thick glasses because of a mysterious incident. In the end he finds out what really caused his eyesight to decrease. Tangerine by Edward Bloor is an exciting book about entering new environments, becoming a school hero, and uncovering the truth.The main character of the book, Paul Fisher, develops courage throughout the story. Paul has always been afraid of his brother Eric. Eric is his father's pride. Eric does whatever he wants and he always has a goon that will do whatever he says. Eric and his goon beat up people, deface public property and steal items from houses. When Paul catches Eric and his goon, Arthur Bauer, he stands up to them and they end up being the ones who are scared. If the main character develops courage, the book usually turns out to be good. This book is a fine example of that statement.Another reason this is an excellent book is that the main part of the story is very discrete. The main point of the story is that Paul uncovers the truth about his eyes. In this book the reader doesn't really realize that that is the whole point of the story until it happens. The way the story goes, it seems that the story is about Paul saving the day even though he wears the extra thick glasses. Instead the book ties together and Paul discovers the truth. When a main idea is given towards the end of the book and it is given in a discrete manner, then it keeps the reader guessing how the book will end.The environment in the story is interesting. Tangerine, Florida as some unusual weather. At any time of the year the tangerine groves can freeze over. The workers have to stay up all night just to make sure that the trees survive the night. Also lightning strikes the same field at the same time every day. The people refuse to change the practice time even though someone got struck by lightning while practicing. The environment keeps the reader entertained and curious to find out if there will be any other weird weather.Tangerine is an excellent book with lots of good features. The main character develops courage and the setup of the book keeps the reader hungry for more. The environment is crazy yet interesting. The story line is a great nonstop story that readers don't want to put down."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"The book is about a boy named Paul Fisher and his family. They move to Tangerine, Florida where they no nothing about the town or the people. Paul is minorly blind from his older brother Erik spraying white spraypaint into his eyes.From this incidint he can not play his favorite sport which is soccer. Also his mom told the principal to give them a special form informing his teachers that he is partially blind. This is another reason why he can not play soccer at Lake Windsor Middle School.Through the book Paul changes from being a geek to being one of the most popular boys in his school. He is really good as a soccer goalie which got him to be so popular. Also he transfered from his old school which got swallowed by a sink hole.This was his chance to transfer from a school that wouldnt let him play soccer to a school that will.I thought this book was well written and very detailed. But some of the parts in this book I thought were a little weird for example when the school got swallowed by a sink hole. I didnt really like the book because it didnt really keep my attention. But it was good in some ways because I like books when you dont know whats going to happen next. You always think you know whats goin to happen but you end up being wrong because somthing else happens that you didnt expect."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Genre: contemporary realistic fictionTitle: TangerineAuthor: Edward BlooreGrades: 7-9Summary: Paul Fisher and his family have recently relocated to Tangerine County, Florida where Paul attends seventh grade. Visually impaired, Paul struggles to fit in at school and battles with his parents's preoccupation about his brother's, Eric, high school football career which may extend to college. After Paul's middle school suffers the affects of a sinkhole, he is transferred to Tangerine Middle. As he strives to understand his past and the daily rains of Florida for the tangerine groves, Paul makes new and loyal friends while pursuing his aspirations of playing soccer. When all seems to be proceeding smoothly, Eric and his friend, Arthur, are caught at a sinister intrigue, and Paul has to, once again, to be transferred to a third school for reasons beyond geology.Opinion: I thought the book was terrible when I finished reading it. The protagonist, Paul Fisher, is visually impaired. I myself, having once had impaired vision but now blind, have plenty of experience about the emotional turmoil, personal struggles, and legal aspects surrounding this disability. The book, I felt, grossly misrepresented or was glaringly inconsistent with some of the components unique to a visually impaired individual. In addition, the novel did not promote a very positive message about people who are visually impaired. I was disappointed at the author's lack of research.Classroom Activities: This book has the potential to offer a wide range of engaging activities in and out of the classroom. In fact, my class ate Tangerine Cream savors before reading the book and simulated a miniature sinkhole in a plastic cup filled with soil, sugar cubes, and graham crackers. A short and simple botanical study about the tangerine could also be conducted and ended with the kids feasting on actual tangerines. Also, depending on proximity and expense, a field trip could be planned to take the kids to a citrus nursery, packing plantation, or citrus grove. And for added extravagance, a simulation of developing a new variety of tangerine could be enacted, from scion grafting to approval by the state agricultural department or researching semi-exotic recipes incorporating tangerines and having the kids try to prepare them for the class."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I finally read this after having many people recommend it to me. I was pretty disappointed in the book for several reasons. One, I did not find the writing that great. I felt it needed to be edited, probably by 100 pages or so. There are so many repetitive passages, such as Paul trying to remember over and over how he became legally blind as a small child. Also, the plot wanders at many times, with too many quirks. Mud fires, lightning, and sinkholes all occur in this small town much too frequently, leading the reader to wonder, *WHY* would anyone ever move there?!The main reason I was disappointed in the book, though, was the plot line with the older brother, Eric Fisher, the football star. Erik is a star football kicker with many dark secrets. In the end, he is exposed, Paul's parents express their regret, and life is good.Having grown up with a violent sibling, I know that the family dynamic is never \\"cured\\" so easily. A lot of times, parents are aware of what their children are up to, but simply feel helpless. The Fisher family are all characterized as one-dimensional, and therefore, any problems and resolutions simply feel like a nice little tale, not reality.My advice, avoid this well-intended but disasterous book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"The book &quot;Tangerine&quot; by Edward Bloor teaches you a lot about real life. A boy named Paul Fisher has moved to Tangerine County, Florida from his previous home in Houston, Texas. Paul and his brother Erik are very involved in sports. Paul is a goalie for his soccer team and Erik is a kicker for his football team. An unexpected sinkhole sucks more than half of the school underground.

Will the truth about Erik ever be revealed? Find out the answers to all of these questions by reading the book &quot;Tangerine.&quot; I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something good to read. The book teaches you about life and how things aren't always as they seem. If you want a book that isn't boring and has non-stop action and suspense then you should read the book &quot;Tangerine&quot; by Edward Bloor."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I was unhappily surprised to buy this book for my 9-year old and find out it contains a murder by peers of a high-school aged boy and also a brutal childhood attack by the main character's brother, subsequently covered up by his own family.

I enjoyed the characters and the plots and the ending. I won't give it away, but I will say that the ending surprised me and was EXCELLENT. I thought it was very exciting and interesting and I think that I read it in a day because I couldn't put it down.The only thing I would say is that the summary on the cover made me think that the book had a touch of supernatural in it, but as I read on, there wasn't anything like that. I'm kind of a fan of supernatural books, so I was kind of dissapointed. After all, that was one of the reasons I picked the book up.Final comments- I really enjoyed this book. If you like books about sports with a little touch of mystery, this is a book for you...."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Edward Bloor tried too hard to develop too many plots too fast. The book moved around to different topics and got very confusing in the end. I had to reread several paragraphs over again because of flaws and weird changes in the subjects. I didn't really like it, and it had too many depressing endings to too many plots. IT WASN&quot;T VERY GOOD"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I had to read this book when I was in junior high, and now, almost a decade later, I stil shudder at the multiple torture scenes vividly described in it. I am entirely against books like these being forced onto children. I hated them when I was younger, and I hate them even more now. Kids have overactive imaginations. When I read it I was scared and paranoid at the thought that characters like the ones in the book might actually exist, or worse, I might encounter them. Not to mention the inter-sibling violence. I have a younger brother and I can't ever imagine doing to him what was done to the main character. And all I could think back then and now is how if anyone had done that to me, I would be out for revenge. Is that the kind of state you want to put your kids in?I can't say anything about the quality of the writing. When I'm so struck by the gruesome content, it's difficult to pay attention to prose. The author must have been one disturbed child."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This was in my opinion a good story. However it was very slow. Nothing interesting happens untill like halfway through the story and by then the stories super predictable. Also, there was little character development. Paul and his friend Joey seemed to have several different mood swings and weren't very smart. The book was overdramatic. Several little things were made into a big deal big things that happened were brief and confusing.Overall it was a good idea for a story but underdeveloped.

To make things even more boring, writing format is nothing out of the ordinary and seems to have been written by a third-grader. In other words, the writing style in &quot;Tangerine&quot; will set you to sleep.Character development is ridiculously non-evident. Setting descriptions are poor. Characters are described in a way so that a reader feels no sympathy. In fact, you may find yourself reading words instead of soaking in a nice story. The plot is unbearably ridiculous and you will NEVER find yourself turning a page in high anticipation of what is to happen. This book is not worth your time. Don't even bother~ especially if &quot;Tangerine&quot; is on your optional summer reading list."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"In the end of the book when the police ask Paul to write the story about his brother ,the Story that he wrote on the is Dad computer is the entire book-(Diary form) Tangerine,then is father took him to school for the first time because he readed it!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine was an \\"read catching\\" book.

While fearing Erik and his friend, Paul meets new friends and changes schools because a sinkhole that forms right under his school. Paul finds courage to stand up to his brother and lets readers know the REAL reason he is legally blind.I liked this book but if I could suggest any thing, it would be to get a better ending and I hope that Edward Bloor will write a sequel to this to Tangerine only because he kind of leaves the readers hanging at the end.Overall I really enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"The book Tangerine was definatly not one of my favorite books I have ever read. From a rating of 1-10 i would rate it a 1. The beginning was fair. Then it got worse and more confusing as i read on.The book is about a boy named Paul. He is deranged and is decrepit. He has poor vision. He has no idea how he got such poor eye sight. Although people have told him that he stared at an eclipse, and he then became blind. Paul and his family moved from Houston to Tangerine. He has a creepy brother names Erik. Erik is a very perfect,football, muscular, kiss-up type. He is very violent. He is like a rabies-infected savage. So, Paul and his family move to Tangerine. At Paul's school there is a soccer team. Paul is a soccer freak. He lives, breathes and eats soccer. But, then he gets kicked off the team because he is vision imparied. Then this guy Mike, perishes. Erik leaps with joy of the fact that mike perished. Then these muck fires create smoke and then there are these underground fires and there are thunder storms all the time. Then these sink holes crash some portables and then some kids get injured slightly. Then Paul's parents get mad at the fact that Paul can't play soccer cuz he can see just fine when every body thinks he can't and yada, yada, yada,. . . . . Then Paul and Erik go to another school and then Paul plays soccer on that school's team. The kids on that team are very wild.THE ENDhe book is not very good.

I wouldn't suggest this book to any adults, because you might get into way-to-deep thinking about it."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"For as long as he can remember, seventh-grader Paul Fisher has lived in the shadow of The Erik Fisher Football Dream. Ever since Paul's older brother Erik kicked his first successful 50 yard field goal, it seems to Paul that the entire Fisher household has revolved around Erik getting a football scholarship in hopes of one day advancing to the Pros. But there are two big things Paul just can't understand: 1) why everyone adores Erik, who he truly knows to be cruel and underhanded, and 2) why those same people are also in love with football. Now soccer, that is a sport Paul can get really get behind. Even though he happens to be legally blind, Paul is a talented goalie and is more than ready for the soccer season to begin at his new middle school in the town of Tangerine, Florida. Though, as usual, Paul is the first to notice that their seemingly idyllic planned community is not what it appears to be as natural disasters strike again and again and neighbors turn against one another; all while football and soccer games continue to be won. And lost.I can now fully understand why Tangerine is often embraced by educators. Its many themes could easily foster intriguing and highly relevant discussions in any classroom. Truly, it is astounding that such a small book could contain such a wide range of significant topics yet still remain so accessible to teens on a variety of levels. A list of themes discussed include clashes between the haves vs the have-nots, the impact of family relationships, the treatment of those with 'disabilities', environmental issues, race discrimination, and even bullying scenarios. And that's not even a comprehensive list. But even with its appeal to teachers, Tangerine can still readily resonate with any reader be they young or old, student or parent due to the honest and captivating narration of the observant Paul. His voice is clear, insightful, and above all, entertaining. A hero with coke-bottle glasses and courage to spare. I'm glad I found room on my shelves for Paul Fisher and Tangerine. It's one I'll be sure to share with my own son. Even if I have to wait a few more years to read it with him."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine by Edward Bloor is one of my favorite young adult novels, so this year I decided to try it as a read-aloud. Most of my students followed with interest, although I'm not sure how well all of them were able to truly grasp the multiple layers of the novel.Tangerine tells the story of Paul Fisher, a 12-year-old moving with his family to Tangerine, Florida. Paul lives with his parents and his older brother, Erik, who is a senior in high school. Erik is a star kicker on the football team with his eye set on a football scholarship to a major university. Paul and Erik's parents, especially their father, are obsessed with Erik's football career, leading Paul to derisively label it as \\"The Erik Fisher Football Dream\\" in his thoughts.Paul enjoys sports as well, although his favorite sport is soccer. He plays goalie, a position at which he feels comfortable, despite his disability. Paul is legally blind as a result of a mysterious accident when he was younger. His parents told him that he stared at an eclipse as a child, but the story doesn't add up.Paul quickly realizes that nothing is as it seems in Tangerine. He lives in a seemingly pristine development of McMansions surrounding a man-made lake, but it is plagued by many strange occurrences. A muck fire burns just outside the perimeter wall, the expensive koi are disappearing from the lake, and one house is repeatedly struck by lighting. Strange things also begin happening outside the development. The captain of the football team is killed by a lightning strike during practice. Also, part of Paul's middle school is swallowed up by a sinkhole.The idea that nothing is as it appears in not a new one to Paul. He feels that even though his vision is impaired, he sees things more clearly than other people. This is especially true in regards to his brother Erik. Where everyone else sees a fine young man and a star football player, Paul sees other things that are far less unpleasant. Whenever something bad happens around Tangerine, Erik seems to be nearby. Paul notices Erik's strange emotional reactions to events. Paul also starts to have flashbacks, thinking that Erik was somehow involved in the mysterious accident that affected his vision.The main part of the story occurs after the sinkhole incident. Paul decides to transfer from the wealthy, mostly white Lake Windsor Middle School to the poorer, mostly minority Tangerine Middle School. While this doesn't bother him at all, he sees ugly ideas about race and social class from some of his friends and family. Paul ultimately finds a comfort zone at Tangerine Middle, even as things around him become increasingly chaotic. Houses in Paul's neighborhood are burglarized, people are attacked, and Erik seems to Paul to be increasingly unstable.Tangerine has such a complex (but still easy to follow) story that it is hard to do it justice in a short summary. It touches on so many things. It satirizes the supposedly idyllic life of new developments, as well as the culture of youth sports, in which talent can trump character. It looks at the juxtaposition of social classes that is common in so many areas, where the lives of the rich and the poor who live close together usually intersect only infrequently. It looks at the struggle of Paul to find an identity as an adolescent who is often overshadowed by others. But most of all, it goes into the importance of looking beneath the surface."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"What can I say in this that I haven't said in the title? This book was so great as a kid that I had to reread it now as I'm older (20, anyway..) and it is still a perfect book. It's got a great story, with great characters, and it's really well written. The book takes you into it from the first page, and keeps you involved all the way through. I don't think I can explain very well. I do think if you read this book you will NOT be upset, whether you're a young adult, or older teenager, or even an adult. It hits home and it just makes you want to keep reading and reading it until you have finished it!Very much recommended."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This is a great read for all ages; the author weaves a story of a survivor who views life in positive terms and is never defeated!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I read this book in my 7th grade language arts class. I'm not sure if any of my peers really thought about this book the way I did.You see, this book has not just one message, but many. The first message is an environmental one. The second was about parenting, in a sense. The third was one I think I really understood. It was about the division between groups of people, like in The Outsiders, if you've ever read it. It was sort of a \\"rich vs. poor\\" scenario.Over all, it was very moving and very deep. If you or your child reads this book, I recommend discussing the topics and messages in the book. That is what my mom and I did as well as my class and I did. You can't just read something like Tangerine. It has to be thought about.I also think Tangerine was sad. Some people reading this may not like sadness in stories or movies,(I'm not sure anyone really does), or may not want their child exposed to those things. I believe it's good to once in a while, because sometimes to be able help people in situations like these, you need to think about what their situation is like.Despite the fact that Tangerine was a sad book, I really think it is a book not only worth reading, but thinking about."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Edward Bloor, Tangerine (Scholastic, 1997)Tangerine County, Florida, is a very weird place. (It should be noted, since it seems to be a frequently asked question, that while there is a Citrus County in Florida, Tangerine County exists only in Edward Bloor's head.) After you've lived there for a while, you get used to it, but Paul Fisher doesn't have that problem. Paul is a legally blind soccer player. (Yeah, figure that one out.) He's also a transplant; his family moved to Tangerine County just before the beginning of the school year. A new school means a lot of new difficulties (including getting his disability past the new soccer coach), but \\"difficulties\\" gets a new meaning when a sinkhole opens under the school, swallowing half of it. Did I mention that Paul's father works for the county engineering office? Yeah, that. Things get even weirder, but sports? They tend to be the great equalizer (cf. Chris Crutcher's fantastic Whale Talk).Tangerine gets off to something of a slow start, but I'd advise you to stick with it; all that setup is actually going to get used eventually. When the book takes off, POW. Bloor spends the first quarter or so of the book constructing his deeply odd alternate reality (that isn't too terribly alternate; just, you know, sinkholes and blind soccer players) so he can spend the last three-quarters of the book ripping it to shreds, putting it back together in different configurations, and then, just for fun, jumping up and down on the pieces in order to deform them even more. Yes, Tangerine County, Florida, is a very weird place, but I highly recommend vacationing there. You never know what you'll find happening next. ****"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This book is so good, it held my interest more than any of the Harry Potter books!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I read this book for the first time in 5th grade I think, and since then I've read it at least twice more. It's a great story about a boy who lives in Florida, with a brother who teases him and other cliche stuff that you wouldn't think makes a good book, but it does, because Bloor handles the subject wonderfully, intertwining all of the simple things that we all remember from our childhood into a great read that pulls you in and doesn't let go until you have finished it, swept up by the emotion that this man is able to leech out of you. Definitely recommended to children and adults alike, because it has themes that we all need to get in touch with."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"My ten-year old son absolutely loved this book. It is full of teen angst and sports-related action; however, the subject matter is very heavy and can be somewhat disturbing. The blurb on the back of the book gave me no indication that issues of violence and bullying in the book (and some uncomfortable language) were addressed within. The actual reading level is not difficult, but as thought-provoking as this book is, I recommend it for very mature kids or students in grades 7-12."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Through his computerized diary entries, Paul Fisher tells the story of his seventh-grade year. These entries not only let him describe what is happening, they give him the opportunity to reflect on his past.At the beginning of the story, the Fisher family has just moved to Florida from Houston. The diary entries tell the story of how Paul's brother, Erik, has always bullied him. He even has his friends call Paul Eclipse boy because of a bad vision problem that was supposedly caused by Paul looking at an eclipse for too long. His parents virtually overlook Erik's digressions because they are focused on what Paul calls the 'Erik Fisher football dream.'To make things worse, Paul gets kicked off of his new soccer team because his Mom had told the school that he has a visual 'handicap'. But Paul believes that his vision is much better and it is proven in his many observations chronicled in the diary.When the portable school units had Paul's middle school are swallowed by a sinkhole, Paul is given a chance to go to another school and he takes it. Because he knows that at Tangerine Middle School he can play soccer. Paul's ability to 'see' people for who they are may be even more sharp than his ability to see. He doesn't see the class or racial barriers that separate him from the kids in this other school. His eagerness to play also earns him the respect of the other team members.As the story unfolds, Paul sees snippets of his past and the history of his family comes clear to him. And he is the unlikely hero in this heartwarming tale.Paul was endearing from the start. The writing in this novel is impeccable. The story is fantastic - a real page-turner. I read it all through in a day. There is a dark undertone to this book though so I would not recommend it for younger kids."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine, by Edward Bloor, is a novel that is not like any book I'v ever read. It tells the story of Paul Fisher, a seventh-grader who has just moved form Houston to Tangerine County, Florida. Paul is legally blind- he has to wear \\"Coke-bottle\\" glasses so that he can see. His parents tell people that Paul's eyes were damaged because he didn't listen and stared at a solar eclipse too long. Paul has always been overshadowed by his older brother Erik, placekicker extrodinare. He plays a part in the \\"Erik Fisher Football Dream\\"- but just what his part is remains to be seen.When Paul moves to Tangerine, everything is different. Lightning knows where to strike. Schools get sucked up by sinkholes. People get killed- and no one really does anything about it. With the help of some friends, Paul sees the truth in things that other people seem blind to.

I would reccommend it to any young adult looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I thought that this book was very well written. I like books like this. Like when you don't know what's going to happen next but you think you know what's going to happen. This book is about a boy who moves to Tangrine, Florida who is half blind so he has to wear coke-bottle glasses so he can see.I personally didn't think it was right when he's mother told he princpal that he was handicapped because that messed up his chances to play soccer for that school and he was kicked off. When he first got there he didn't quite fit in. And then he made friends with the soccar team. He really hit it off with this boy.This boy got him on the soccar team. But they called him names.In the second part of this book Paul's school gets swallowed by a sink hole!! Which I thought was very werid. But then half hie school got swallowed so he got transfer to Tangrine Middle School where there were aloty of hard-nots there but oddly enought he fit right in. The third part of this book everything kind of comes together for him. He figures out why he has to wear those coke-bottled glasses.Which was when he was little his brother took a can of spray paint and sprayed it in his eyes.His parents in return lied to him and said that he looked at an elcipse."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"When you think of tangerines, you think of fruit, in this book, you think of a severely messed up neighborhood.

Paul is legally blind due to a strange incident that occurred when he was five. However, that doesn't keep him from being an awesome soccer player and the one member of his family who truly sees what is going on.The author raises a host of issues, including: vanishing farm communities, spreading suburbia, culture, class, handicaps, and family dysfunction. Best of all, he tucks them into a riveting story with characters a reader can't forget.The haunting imagery creates such a foreboding atmosphere and this tension builds to the point that it's hard to put this book down. Will privileged Paul find a place for himself with his Latino classmates in their underfunded school and why is his relationship with his older, football star brother so strained? There is more going on in Tangerine than meets the eye."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"My review on this book is depended on me and only me I really do not read very many books, but I had to read this one. I am a kid that likes action and violence, this book provided a tiny bit of both but I loved it anyway. One of the major reasons I liked this book is because it is one of those books that can't stop reading and you just want to read on and on and on. I really liked how each character had a totaly different personality not one of the characters are alike. Also I liked how Paul (the main character) acted tough about everything, and how he put up Erik (Paul's brother) and all his tortureing that he did to Paul. Well my over all review rating on this book is it is the best book ever. It is the best book I have ever read. The only part I disliked is the ending I would only give it two and a half stars. The problem is that it leaves you wondering about what happens, because it does not tell you. Well I would recommend this book to any ages. I hope my review helps you with your choice on a book.Enjoy!

I really like children's fiction and young adult fiction, but normally I wouldn't say that I like sports fiction. Thankfully, while the main character and his brother are both into soccer and football respectively, the story does not dwell too much on the games. This book is presented as a diary, but it flows like a novel (contrast this to something like the Basketball Diaries). Diary formats seem to be very popular with kids these days, so the format ought to be compelling. I found that I really liked the narrator. I would agree with some of the other reviews that claim the secondary characters are a bit sketchy, but this is a diary. Unlike other diary books, the secondary characters are not outrageous collections of idiosycrasies. I found this book absorbing and also a little disturbing. The ending raised a lot of issues - parenting issues. I don't think that teenagers would likely be as troubled by the ending as I was. All in all, though, it was a very good book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Great book! It was very interesting. I mean--I usually HATe sport books.( Harry Potter doesn't count!

It's just an excuse to cover up for what really happened. The problem is he doesn't even know how it happened, but what he does know is that his brother Erik is not who everyone thinks he is. Erik Fisher is the star athlete on the footbal team. Pauls's dad only pays attention to Erik and is covering up a horrible secret. Paul transfers to Tangerine Middle temporarily because his school was swallowed up by a sinkhole. Even with his thick glasses, the soccer team accepts him and he becomes one of them. Ironically, Paul, always known as a nerd, now belongs in the toughest group at school; his soccer team. He learns so much from attending Tangerine Middle. He knows how the fruit pickers live and how to stand up for himself against his brother Erik and Arthur Bauer. Paul witnesses the murder of Luis and doesn't know if he should testify. He later does and spills out the whole truth.

I think that everyone should read it because its exciting!!!!!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul Fisher is a legally blind teenage boy whose family just moved to Tangerine County, Florida. His older brother Erik is a high school football star but to Paul he is no hero. It's not easy for Paul when he first moved to Tangerine. He couldn't play his favorite sport soccer for his middle school team so he has to move to a different school. Strange thing start to happen in Tangerine and Paul soon discovered that his older brother Erik and Erik's new friends had part to do with some of them. Paul is threatened by his brother Erik not to tell but he tells anyway. Paul quickly becomes a town hero with his confessions. I would recommend this book to all reading levels because it is a very interesting read.Firstly, I like the characters in this book. Paul Fisher is an average teenage boy except for the fact that he is legally blind. Even though he is the main character I don't think he is the most interesting. I think the most interesting character in this book is his older brother Erik. The thing that makes his older brother so interesting is the way he deceives people about the real him. Everybody in town thinks he is a real nice guy and is a football hero. They never knew about the real Erik until his brother Paul confesses about his brothers wrong actions. Erik Fisher makes the book more interesting because he is the real cause of the problem although you could never tell at the beginning.Secondly I like how the author uses the setting to cause problems. In the beginning of the book Paul's' family moves to Tangerine, Florida. This move caused problems for Paul because he had to meet new friends and do everything anybody would have to do to fit in with his new peers. The move intensified Erik's cover-up because in Tangerine everybody loved him and he was a football hero. Nobody in Tangerine knew about the real Erik. The setting change caused problems making the whole story revolve around Paul's family moving.Lastly I like the mysterious content in the novel. The biggest mystery was about Erik and his new friends. Nobody was suspicious about Erik except for Paul. That is why when Paul confessed about Erik everybody was in a surprised mode. Erik was a very mysterious person and this caused the story to be not only a suspense story but it was also full of mystery.Tangerine by Edward Bloor is a great read. It is full of mystery and suspense. The characters and the setting make the novel more interesting by causing the problems. I would give this book two thumbs up and recommend it to all readers at any level.-Byron N."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I really enjoyed Tangerine because of the action, the suspense and the mystery.

This is exactly the kind of place that Edward Bloor describes in his book Tangerine.Paul Fisher is a boy with thick glasses and has just moved to Tangerine Florida. He is the brother of a mad man. Even though he has eye damage, he is the only person that can see that his brother is mad. Find out how Paul's eyes got damaged and find out who is behind the creepy things that happen in this book.This book has good strong characters that fit together perfectly. I especially liked Paul, the main character. He is weak physically, but in the end, turns out to be very strong mentally. Paul's friends, Joey and Tino, help him get use to school life in Tangerine. Victor encouraged Paul and pushed him hard on the soccer field.Tangerine also has a strong plot. There are a lot of disasters that happen to Paul and he must constantly adjust to them. The book has a good ending because it sums up the strange events happening in Tangerine. Paul finds his courage and stands up to his much stronger and popular older brother.Tangerine is a good book for young readers. There is a lot of suspense which makes you want to read on. You really feel like you know the main characters and are observing the events as they happen. I would like to read other books by Edward Bloor."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Over the summer, I read and discovered a great novel. Tangerine takes place in Tangerine, Florida about a boy named Paul Fisher who desperately tries to uncover his lost past. Paul Fisher has a star brother. He is a great football player and it's became his dad's dream to make him a professional player. But aside from his sports talent, he is a mean and cruel brother. To make matters worse, he seems to get away with everything he does. Paul dreams and fantasizes to play soccer, but he must jump over a big problem, he has very poor eyesight and was once even considered as having a disability, which resulted as in being kicked off the school team. Paul's parents tell him he lost most of his eyesight by looking at the sun for too long. But soon Paul learns that was only a lie to bury the truth from him...what was the real cause?I couldn't put the book down after I started. The way Edward Bloor describes Paul's feelings when he finds the truth seized my attention and made me seem if I was standing there and watching every moment. Everything was so vivid and the feelings were expressed so strongly. It tore me apart in the sad sentences and made me feel warm during happy times. I had not only a great time reading the novel, but experienced an unforgettable journey through the book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul Fisher embodies the characteristics of your everyday average boy wanting and waiting for his day to shine, while his older brother takes the spotlight every chance he gets. I believe any child who has an older brother/sister or friend who shines more than he/she will relate to this story where, in a sense, good outshines evil in the end."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I liked this book a lot because it's just one of those kind of books where you like a lot of characters but then you hate a lot of them too. I think anybody would like this book because there are some parts where you think the character is a cool guy but then he does something wrong and it just makes you think that he is the worst character ever. Which makes it a really good book.It's about this kid named Paul and his family. They lived in Texas but then they moved to Tangerine, Florida. Paul made a lot of friends down in Florida like Joey. Paul's best friend and he is also the first friend Paul makes. Paul has a brother named Erik. Paul and Erik both play sports. Paul plays soccer and Erik plays football. Erik also made some friends like Arthur. Erik and Arthur are also really bad kids their parents don't even know it.I think people who like books that surprise you would really like this book a lot because there are a lot of parts were you get surprised that the brother did something that you thought nobody would ever do. Or even Erik's best friend Arthur. If you want to know what they do that makes you so surprised you have got to read this awesome book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"If you have an older brother, you can really relate to this book. Paul Fisher and his family have moved to a new town where bad things happen to them constantly. Underground fires, sinkholes, robberies, termites, 2 deaths, and frequent thunderstorms are among the disasters in this book. Some things in the book seem like they don't fit in with the plot, but in the end they become crucial elements.Paul's older brother Erik is a locally famous jock who is loved by everyone and seems to get by with everything he does. Their father cares only about Erik and making sure that the \\"Erik Fisher football dream\\" goes as planned, even if it means completely ignoring Paul and his soccer playing. Then, Paul discovers that some people don't like Erik or his lacky, Arthur, at all. As Paul starts to remember what happened to his eyes when he was 5, Erik looms in the background, feared by his younger brother. When Paul's mother finds something shocking in their storage unit, she realizes that maybe Paul wasn't wrong about his fear of Erik and that the \\"Erik Fisher football dream\\" might not come true. When Paul makes his revelation, his parents know that they were wrong about Erik and the entire mystery unfolds to a surprising ending."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Have you ever moved to a new school in a different state where you had to make new friends and basically start your whole life from scratch? If you have you would probably be able to understand Paul's feelings as he has to move from Texas to Tangerine, Florida, a city full of unusual natural disasters, from underground fires to constant lightning everywhere.The family consists of a mom, a dad, and two brothers. The older brother enjoys football. His name is Eric and he is the kicker. The younger brother, the main character of the book who is in 7th grade, enjoys soccer. His name is Paul. His main position in soccer is goalie. Paul has a seeing disability because of something that happened to him in the past that he can't remember. He continues to have flashbacks throughout the book as to what really happened to his eyes as the mystery slowly unravels.I thought this book was excellently written. I would rank it a five out of five. I like how it is told in first person and gives you the date of each chapter, just like a journal. It gets you right into the action.In Tangerine everything that happens is unexpected which keeps you at the edge of your seat. They have underground fires, whirl pools that suck in entire classrooms called sinkholes, lightning everywhere and much more. One of Paul's friend's brothers gets struck by lightning and when Paul and his mom first get there they smell smoke so they called the fire department just to find out it was an underground fire that can't be put out. All of these natural disasters are constantly leaving you sweating since you don't know what's going to happen next.This book is also good because it is very detailed. Whenever there is a soccer game for Paul or a football game for Eric usually they don't just give you the final score, but instead the run you through it play by play. One of my favorite parts was when Eric was kicking an extra point after a touchdown and the team had decided to go for two points without telling him. When he went to go kick the ball it wasn't there making him slip on his back. I remember his dad especially because he really wants Eric to make a career out of football. It was priceless imagining his facial expression when he saw what had happened in the paper.The protagonist is Paul. He came into the book as kind of a nerd. He was scared to stand up to even his own brother. He played goalie in soccer which I think is symbolism for him holding back since later in the book you find out that that wasn't really entirely what he wanted to do. He was also picked on by some of the guys at school like Victor, a player on his soccer team at Tangerine High School. Also, when he first came to the school he was almost afraid of the people standing in front of the school that were all big and tough including a gang group in the 8th grade.By the end of the book, however, I think that Paul had begun to think of himself more positively which allowed him to be more confident in his actions. At the end, he was able to stand up to his brother, he was accepted by his soccer team, and he was accepted by the people waiting in front of the school who he had been scared of the first day. Also, by the end he was even willing to play a different position in soccer than goalie even though he had never played anything but goalie in a game for his whole life before that year.I think that what makes this book memorable is the constant twists and turns in the plot from natural disasters to Paul's flashbacks of what happened to his eyes. Also, this book is memorable because the main character is my age which makes it easier to relate to the situation.In conclusion, I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has any free-time (everyone)! It is great to sit down and let the images take you into Paul's life and allow you to experience everything that goes on in Tangerine, Florida."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine is a teen coming-of-age story you can really sink your teeth into - but be careful, this one bites back! Edward Bloor has done a phenomenal job of weaving some thought-provoking social and environmental issues into this teenage tale of self-discovery and self-respect, with an underlying theme of the imbalance of sports-worship in our society.The book is not a mystery per se, but it has elements of the mystery novel: how did Paul Fisher lose most of his eyesight? What are the haunting memories that tease, torment, and elude him? Who is robbing Paul's neighborhood pond of the resident koi fish? Who is robbing Paul's neighbors of their valuables?Paul Fisher is a young man to be contended with as he seeks to find the truth in himself, and the painful honesty of the events that have shaped his young life. We just wish Bloor would give us someone else to admire in this novel of the hype and shallow hypocrisies of the suburban school sports scene.Ultimately, the ambiguity that makes Paul Fisher, A.K.A. \\"Mars\\" and \\"Fish-Man\\", a three-dimensional character, and that makes life in Tangerine, Florida akin to life in a real-world suburban community, is also the achilles tendon of the novel. It's strength, in the end, has also become it's weakness.While lamenting his parents' (and the community's) sports-mania imbalance, Paul Fisher also revels in his own sports accomplishments and in the glory it brings to him, if for but a fleeting moment. While decrying the violence of his sociopath brother, Paul Fisher revels in the war mentality and bloodletting of his own team associates. While contemning the brutality of the \\"gangsta\\" culture, Paul Fisher revels in being feared as a 'bad dude' when an impulsive act of violence puts him at odds with the authorities.This is a minor flaw, possibly erring only by degree (a subjective matter at best), outweighted by the strengths of a strong plot, convincing simile, strong character development (in the case of the protagonist), and hard-hitting action scenes that at times are outright stunning.A good read. I would like to see a sequel, or even a series. Paul Fisher, like Grisham's Ricky Sway (The Client) is a teen character worth spending time with."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Bloor has created a set of very memorable characters in this novel, set in Tangerine, Florida. Young Paul is a vulnerable, sensitive young teen with a dysfunctional family situation. His mother, very active in her community, is, at best, a Junior Leaguer, and his father is obsessed with his brother's high school football career. Rarely does Paul see one of his parents at his soccer games. When his mother does attend one of his games while he is playing for Tangerine Middle School, she sits with the parents from the opposing team. Paul is plagued with sketchy memories of a very frightening event from his childhood, and as he discovers the source of these memories, he realizes horrible things about his family. This novel is not completely dark, though. There are wonderfully uplifting scenes that involve Paul and his new friends at Tangerine Middle School. Humor colors much of this book. This is a tale that demonstrates the values of persistence and determination, and it depicts personal triumph for young Paul. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR TEENS AND ADULTS."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul may be legally blind, but he can see what's going on.

The story starts out with Paul and his mom finishing their last minute packing for the move from their home in Texas to their new home in Tangerine, Florida. He stares out the window and suddenly has a flashback. He wonders if it involves what happened to his eyes. But he doesn't find out until much later. The truth about his brother, Erik, a football star. Paul thinks his brother is behind all this, but he doesn't remember why. He feels left out in his family because they seem to favor Erik.

The events within it were very strange, from a sinkhole swallowing a section of a middle school to lightening striking a student, I just had difficulty with it. I'm not saying these things don't happen, but there were just too many strange events that happened in this novel, and the blas&eacute; attitude surrounding them didn't really sit well with me. It gave off a rather supernatural feel when I felt the novel was supposed to be much more serious, and so it just didn't sit well with me. But, it's also written for MG and perhaps young, young adult readers, so I think that's where it's real appeal will lie. While I do like to read MG on occasion, not every story is for me because I'm not a MG reader anymore, and that's okay. But I really think 5th-8th graders will get a kick out of this novel, and the fact that it has great morals and themes also make it a great book for any young readers out there who enjoy sports. So, if you've got a MG child at home, I highly suggest picking this up for them!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"It is one of the most heart felt books I have ever read and it played through many emotionsOne word for it would be OUTSTANDING"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Great book that kept you on the edge of your seat.

You read it, and you're just... amazed. I read it for the first time years ago. I was a little younger than the recommended age for this, but I loved every part of it except for the cover we had, because it scared me (this was a cover with lightning reflected off of Paul's glasses, and for some reason it terrified me). I loved every word, every moment something happened.What this book has is a kid who nobody listens to. You've got Paul Fisher, who nobody pays attention to, and instead, all of the attention goes to his rather disturbing older brother because of his football talents. Paul, who sees and understands the not-so-pleasant aspects of his brother, goes his own way, playing soccer and living his own life. The thing that I loved was that Paul wasn't stupid. He was a sharp kid who saw the things everyone else refused to see, which, unfortunately, happens often.So, overall, I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this book, and how I hope you (dear hopefully soon to be reader) will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"At the middle school I teach at, we require this book for all 7th grade students in their reading classes.

The protagonist, Paul, is vision impaired; his IEP is meant to help him, but it actually threatens the thing he loves most: soccer. He feels like a \\"freak\\" because of his thick glasses, but mostly because he believes his vision problem was caused by staring at a solar eclipse, which he doesn't remember doing at all. Paul also has to deal with sibling rivalry; Eric is a star football player, a senior, and the object of Dad's attention. What's more, Paul is afraid of him. He sees the Eric that few others see...until the end of the story. When a freakish accident sends Paul to another school, he makes a name for himself away from his brother. He finds his comfort in a school \\"where the minority is the majority.\\" But trouble is never very far away...Feeling like an outsider, sibling rivalry, multicultural relations, working as a team, dealing with death, family secrets, and parent-child relationships are all addressed and handled in a brilliant fashion.

Or, has there been a time when you don't fit in and feel different? That's exactly how Paul feels from Tangerine by Edward Bloor.Paul and his family moved from Texas to Tangerine, Florida. The one thing that he loves the most is soccer. He's been playing soccer all of his life and is one of the best goalies out there. I like the parts when he plays his games. They're so intense. When Paul moves to Florida, they won't let him play soccer because of his eyesight. His brother told him that he stared at the sun too long for one time and damaged his eyes. Is he telling the truth? Most likely not.Paul likes his new home, but it rains every evening. They get horrible storms too. In my opinion, I don't like it when it rains or when it's stormy. Paul's new school over flooded, so he had to move to a different local school. Luckily at his new school, they don't know about his eyesight. This time he gets away with being on the team. Man, are the good! They even have two girls on the team! They were so good that they went undefeated. It wasn't as fun when he played his old school though. He didn't feel comfortable with playing his old friends. I wouldn't feel comfortable either.Paul's brother, Erik, is a great kicker. Now he's more of a football person. His dad really admires him because he likes football. His dad also loves the fact that he can kick fifty yard field goals. That's amazing! His games are interesting too. I wish I could kick that far. Erik is not the type of guy that you would want to hang around with. Neither his friend Arthur. Erik and Arthur are always gone and out somewhere. There's also been a mystery of stolen property from the neighborhood. Hmmmm?As you can see, there are many themes to the story, Tangerine by Edward Bloor. One way that Edward Bloor shows one of these themes is exploration. Exploration is when you travel from one place to another. Also he shows greed. Greed is not a good thing and it can get you in trouble in the long run. If you want to solve the mystery of Paul's eyes, read Tangerine by Edward Bloor."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine, by Edward Bloor, is a book with many interesting characters and events. The main character is a visually impaired boy named Paul Fisher. He is on a soccer team that is very good and they are winning all the time. His family moved to Tangerine, Florida, due to his dad's job. After awhile of staying there, strange things started to occur. People are killed, schools are destroyed and it all revolves around Paul's mischief brother, Erik. A soccer superstar that his parents love and everyone wants to be like. Paul may be blind, but he can see the real Erik, who is evil. Now Paul is starting to remember what incident happened to his eyes. This book had what ever a person wants some sad parts and some happy parts. The characters in this story were really energetic, like Paul who is an average teenage boy who is hurt by his surroundings and took actions and stopped it. His brother was also very interesting and what makes him interesting is the way he deceives people about himself.This book was trying to say that the truth will set you free, as they said it in the book. I recommend this book to everyone that likes mystery and suspense. This book has very strong themes and drama so I don't recommend this book to young readers. Don't just get the book for a quick read, get the book so you can think about it. It is a very meaningful story and it can really touch you inside. So go out and get the book to see what lies behind the eyes of Paul. This book will keep you turning the pages and keep you on your toes.

You could sit out in your lawn chair or walk around the development, or even play a game of soccer. This is assuming that the muck fire isn't burning under ground and the gangs from Tangerine Middle aren't out terrorizing the other kids of Tangerine.Tangerine is a great fiction story about the main character Paul Fisher who is a legally blind seventh grade all star goalie. He has thick coke bottle looking glasses that enable him to see. The book is a series of journal entries written by Paul on his lap top. He (Paul) is a book smart nerd and athlete who is looking just to make some real friends and just wants to play soccer. The book does make you feel sympathetic for Paul, but only in a few spots.The Erik Fisher football dream is really the center of the story. Erik is Paul's brother, a senior in high school and the star of the football team. Erik is the center of all attention and Paul gets nothing out of his soccer career. Mom and Dad can't come and watch Paul play soccer because they are too busy with Erik, and his flunky parakeet friend Arthur Bauer and their football games. Arthur likes to repeat everything that Erik says (that's why he is the parakeet). Tangerine is a very different place, where lightning strikes at the same time every day (not always at the same place) and underground fires burn for years, and the blind kid Paul, can see. His brother is a real jerk but plays the nice card when he gets around grown men and his mom and dad. Something happens at Paul's school, Lake Windsor Middle School, that's going to change Paul's life forever.Tangerine Middle and Lake Windsor Middle are two totally different places. Lake Windsor is where all the rich kids go and Tangerine is where all the real kids go, where there are bullies and kids with AK's and where there is some kind of fight every day.And just to show you a bit from the book, here's a quote from the book. Just to spark your interest. This is when Paul and one of his friends arrived at the carnival.Just outside the entranceway I saw a group of guys with a soccer ball. They were good. Three of them were doing the juggling bit with the ball, like Tommy Acoso does, but they were passing it back and forth too. I stopped to watch for a minute, and a kid called over to me, \\"Hey! Give me one of those tickets!\\"\\"I only got one,\\" I said.\\"Yeah? So I only need one. Hand it over.\\"Joey grabbed my elbow and hustled me away. \\"C'mon, man. Don't mess around with those guys. They're from Tangerine Middle.\\"\\"So?\\"\\"Don't talk to them and don't look at them.\\" We handed over our tickets and passed through a turnstile. \\"They have gangs in Tangerine Middle School. They have kids with guns, man. Real gangstas. Some of them have AK-47s.\\"\\"No way.\\"\\"Hey, don't believe me. Just don't mess with them \`cause I ain't bailing you out.\\"This part of the book is an emotional time for Paul's friend so it is good for Paul to be there with him, but not just that. Paul feels some type of way about one of the girls his friend hangs around. But in order to understand it for yourself, you have to read it!I love this book and I've read it again and again. Although it does have a few drawbacks where there are spots where it seems like Paul is just talking for his health, but altogether it's a great book. There are so many unexpected twists and characters so much different from real people, but the book itself seems so real. The book is set in present day and the beginning is a bit of a drag but you'll see why I recommend this book once you get into it. So much excitement in only 294 pages! I give this book a thumb and a half up, so if you are looking for excitement in a book, Tangerine has got you covered."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Sometimes things are not the way they look.

I won't tell you the about it because it would give the book ending away."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine, by Edward Bloor, was one of the best books I have ever read. I liked it because it was extremely exciting. The un-predictable major events just kept occuring one after another. Edward Bloor must be a genious to come up with ideas like the ones in this book!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"In the Begenning Paul and his family move to Tangerine, Flordia. His mom has everything plan out. She knows the exect time they will arive. When they do arive they eat pizza. Then they go to sleep for the night. When they wake up they think the house is on fire so they call the fire department. They say it's just a muck fire. According to the book a muck fire is an underground fire. The main charcter is Paul Fisher. He is almost totally blind. Through the book he slowly remembers his dark and erie past. His brother is Erik Fisher. His dream is to play for the Flordia Gators. Thier parents know what happened but they don't want anyone to know about it. During the end of the book Paul finally remembers exectly what happened. Erik almost goes to jail. To find out what happened to Pauls eyes and why Erik almost goes to jail your going to have to read the book. I think the book is ok. The last 50 pages are the best. You should read this book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This is the best book I have read in a very long time. It is great for ages 10-17 and I think even teens would like this book. If you are doing a book report though, this is not a good choose. It is a long book with a lot of pages. Edward Bloore putts great detail, you can actually see what Paul (the main character in the book) sees and it is like you don't need to read because you feel you are him and this stuff is happening to you, like at his soccer practices. I thought the characters were one of a kind and if you have any time left in your day you should pick this book up to read. You can't put it down. Edward Bloore has in my opinion the best book I have ever read so far. The ending is so weird you never would have thought of it."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I really liked this book because it is about a middle school boy who faces the hardships that come with wearing glasses. I liked the way he handled it. At the end of the story it becomes a mystery. This is a very good book. I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Although i read this book two years ago and I have forgetten the specific details of the book, I do remember very well how much I enjoyed this book. I am looking forward to re-reading it soon. For those of you who have not had the wonderful experience of re-reading books, I greatly suggest it; it reveals new meaning and understanding each time. Tangerine is one book that can only truly be appreciated after a second reading because of its complex nature and intricate plots. Many commented that it was too complex but I disagree. Perhaps you did not comprehend it but that gives you no right to diminish the author's talent. As for those of you using it as a book report, although for some it would be possible to do so, Tangerine takes much disection to be able to accurately explain and that is the representation it deserves. I don't suggest it as a book report book, but I do not see any problem with vocabulary. I ask you, how do you expect to learn any vocabulary if you never read books in which there are words you are not familiar with? This book is a perfect oportuniy to do so. I commend those of you who understood this book, and I will only entertain other opinions once the book has been re-read and openly discussed to understand its complex nature."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I liked this book a lot. It hits on some deep subjects which make you - well, me, at least - think. Paul Fisher, a 12-year-old seventh-grader, finds it hard to live up to his older brother, Erik, star football player.

When his four-person family moves to Tangerine, Florida, he finds out the truth about a lot of things - even though it isn't what he wants to learn."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"okay, where do i start? this was such a great book i couldnt put it down. it was a book that was totally different then any other book ive ever read before. it was written very nicely with so many good things. the town was so weird you just want to just think about it for hours and just wonder &quot;how could anybody want to live there?&quot; but its the type of thing where you learn to love that &quot;weird&quot; town. i know im getting off the subject but what more can i say then it was one of the best books ive read in a long time. and i auctually finished it!

It's about a boy named Paul Fisher who moved to Tangerine, Florida where countless strange occurrences happen to him. Paul wonders why people live in Tangerine, where underground fires burn for years, a sinkhole swallows his school, and lighting strikes the same football field everyday. Paul wonders why he has to wear thick glasses all the time, because of a mysterious eye injury. Surprisingly, Paul fits in with the toughest group around, which turns out to be his new soccer team. One thing that bothers Paul is that no one can see the terrifying truth about Erik, his older brother. Dispite Paul's handicapped situation, he still manages to same some tress, stop a crime, and win the soccer championship for his town.

The name of the book is Tangerine. My teacher informed me that the book was about sports. I thought it would be interesting, participating in and watching sports are two of my favorite past times. I am glad that I read the book because it is about more than just sports. It is about life.The title of the book is the name of the county where a boy named Paul Fisher lived. It narrarates the story of his life. The life is that of a normal eleven year old boy. .... His most endearing qualities were a caring nature, a helpful attitude, and a willingness to adjust to the ups and downs of daily living.The author's style was both captivating and easy going. Details of events and feelings were communicated well. It made the reading easy."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Sports novel, coming of age story, surrealistic social commentary--this novel defies categorization &quot;a la teacher genre wheel,&quot; but it never disappoints as a compelling and unusual read.Paul moves to a new Florida subdivision, and when a strange daily occurence finally forces him to attend a different school in the &quot;tough&quot; part of town, he takes the opportunity and runs. He becomes friends with and star goalie for the ragtag soccer team there. Underneath all the sports action, there remains a dark and undefinable but very real sense of forboding in Paul's world, and it all seems to point toward some past experience with his older brother, his father's &quot;golden boy.&quot;The twists and turns in the plot are fascinating to follow, as Paul moves closer and closer to confronting his ghosts. The reader begins to guess at what these ghosts might be, but Bloor's writing is such that we stay with it, hoping to find out we are wrong.The sometimes surreal setting and certain aspects of the plot are not for the unsophisticated young reader. For those kids who enjoy a complex storyline, and can deal with sometimes harsh realities of &quot;family skeletons,&quot; TANGERINE is engaging from the very beginning. My son read the book as a 7th grader, and his comment, other than that he enjoyed it, was &quot;I hate when a book makes you think even after you finished reading it!&quot; As a mom and teacher of that age group, that comment is music to my ears and sums up the book succintly!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine is an exciting, thrilling, and mysterious book. I would give this a 5 star rating. You'll notice that every chapter leaves you thinking of mystery and adventure. Later you'll learn the truth of Erik and Arthur.

Erik is a football star and he is very popular in his school. His friend is Arthur. Arthur and Erik are always together; at practice, when they go mud sliding, and eating, etc. Another character is Erik and Paul's Dad. He is a civil engineer and most of his life is about the &quot;Erik Fisher football dream&quot;. Other characters are Paul's mom, Victor, Tino, Joey,and Betty Bright.Paul is a soccer player but Paul's dad doesn't really care. Paul keeps having these mysterious flash backs. He doesn't remember why he wears thick glasses, or why his parents seem to be hiding something. Well, all this comes together when the Fisher family moves to Tangerine. I would suggest this book to all ages...Old...young...and middle aged."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine was about a young seventh grade boy named Paul, who was told he could go to a different school instead of doing split sessons with the sixth grade.

Paul dosen't like it at first, but then they start to play games and Paul goes in for anyone. Then someone's brother dies because of Pauls older brother Erik.

Erik is an exceptional placekicker and is on his high school's football team. Dad always seems to be caught up in the \\"Erik Fisher Football Dream\\", not spending much time with his other son, Paul.Paul's game is soccer. He's a fantastic goalie. There's one problem with Paul- his eyesight was damaged when he was very young. This issue creates problems for this kid's life. Throughout the book, Paul remembers terrible memories of the past, most of them regarding his eyesight.This book was excellent. I give it 5 stars. This was a very realistic story that could similarly happen to any family. It not only teaches good lessons to young adults, but to parents, too. Some of the lessons I learned was that the truth shall set you free, and that telling the truth can bring all the wrong things in life to justice. This book also teaches parents to spend equal time with all their children and not to invest most of their time in just one.I, as a young reader, enjoyed this book very much. The only critisism I have is that it uses 'said' most of the time when it comes to dialouge. Otherwise, this is a great read for people of all ages.C-Bob"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine. A county in Florida, which at first glance is perfect and second, is a nightmare of oddities. In Tangerine, where lightning strikes in the same place every day, where fires burn underground for years, never to be put out, where sinkholes can drown buildings, strange things happen all the time.Paul Fisher's older brother is a football star, so much so that the father in fact dreams of sending him to college on a football scholarship, then him becoming a footballer in the NFL. The Eric Fisher Football Dream, as Paul calls it. However, Paul sees what his parents choose to overlook.He wears very thick glasses, why, he does not know. He started wearing them one summer, that is all he does know, and that is because of the vacation pictures. His brother told everyone that he stared at a solar eclipse too long, without protection for his eyes. Paul goes along with the story. His parents do not provide any other explanation. There was a solar eclipse that year. However, while Paul does not necessarily have perfect eyesight, he has 20/20 spiritual vision. Paul sees what other people do not.Like the fact that his \\"perfect\\" brother is an evil person, who does not care if he has to scratch and claw his way to the top. Paul knows something about Eric, even if he cannot remember what it is. Until the memories start coming back.Edward Bloor has written a beautiful drama, about a boy, his past that would be better not to remember, and tangerines. When I first started this book, I thought it was going to be an average book, maybe a little better than usual, since it had been so prominently advertised as the One Book, One Island choice in the library. I was wrong. This is a moving story, one that seems to tell itself in a way that is not often found.\\"Did your parents ever tell you about the kid who stared at an eclipse so long, he had to wear glasses? Well, I'm that kid.\\"I'm that kid."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine, Florida. Doesn't it sound like a wonderful place to relax? A place where there are no worries, where almost everyone is friendly? Well, you are totally wrong! At least according to what this book is about!Tangerine is filled with action, excitement, a lot of mysteries to solve, and a lot of problems! Who is stealing the Koi from the neighborhood pond? Who is robbing the tented houses? Why does lighting strike every single day?This book is sort of like a dated diary from Paul Fisher. It is all about the problems he has encountered from moving to Tangerine, Florida. Paul's life story about his uncaring parents, when it comes to Paul playing soccer, and his mean rude brother.Paul Fisher, a legally blind goal tender, is a laid back kid, a \\"to himself\\" kid but, by the end of this story he is a hero! Someone who helped all the kids in the horrible tragedy that struck Lake Windsor Middle School Campus. He is also a hero to many people in Tangerine, Florida. By the end of this book, Paul discovers who he is. Why is he legally blind? Is it true that he stared into a eclipse to long? Does he get frostbite while he's out helping in the Citrus Freeze? You have to read the book to find out!Erik Fisher, Paul's older brother, and Arthur Bauer (Erik's Friend) are the villains in this story. Are they the reason for a death? How many lives have they ruined? Are they the mysterious robbers? Erik and Arthur are both football players. Mr. Fisher is all wrapped up in the \\"Erik Fisher Football Dream\\" and pays no attention to Paul's soccer talent. The two friends as I mentioned, football players, who wont stop at anything to be the stars of the game and team!Why does Paul move to a new school of gangster's? How does a \\"quiet\\" kid like Paul fit into a school with kids that have AK-47s? Is his father, the head chairman of the Civil Engineering Department, the reason for all of this?All of this exhilaration and more is included in this fantastic book! It will make you laugh, cry, and have you swimming in pool of sharks :)!I think the moral of the story is \\"it is better to give than to receive\\" for Paul at least. I would recommend this book to excitement, action, and mystery book lovers. Take my word for it! I am very picky when it comes t book, and this has to be one of the best books I have ever read! You have to read this book!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Do you have a brother who is the \\"golden child\\" to your parents? Well Paul Fisher does, but he really knows what his brother does, that his parents are not informed of. Its okay though, because now he is kind of use to it. His family (mostly his dad) is really into football, and I think you can figure out who plays football, because Paul plays soccer! His dad (not really his mom either) doesn't even attend his games, even though he is an excellent player! His mom though does care about his passion for soccer, and you'll see why, when you read the book!!So what if he is legally blind, and wears thick glasses? He can see things that regular people cannot see. People thought of him as the strangest person, but when he moved to Tangerine, Florida, everything changed. Why? Because the people there don't care if you are legally blind or not! You could have been an alien, and they wouldn't care!! Even if you are legally blind, you never know if that person can be a hero!I thought this book was a blast! Even though it is about a boy, girls can read it too, because girls are involved somewhere in the story!! It was so hard to put it down when we had to stop reading! Especially toward the end, you will jump and a tingle will go down your spine!! You'd be so amazed as to what happens!!!

Other strange things in this book are: What's wrong with Paul's cocky, cruel older brother, Erik? Why is he the way he is? What's up with the underground muck fires that burn constantly in Tangerine, FL? Why do Paul's parents ignore him, focusing only on \\"The Erik Fisher Football Dream,\\" as Paul calls it?

Paul struggles fitting in because he is legally blind. This causes tension between his relationships with his parents and his brother Erik. Erik is a high school football star, which Paul's father idolizes over. This makes Paul very angry because no one seems to care about him or believe what he says because of his disability. For example his mother is always saying, \\"Oh honey you can't see. You don't know what you saw.\\" This happens frequently throughout the whole book but one of the main events that this is said at falls in the beginning of the book when Paul and his mother are finishing packing to move. Paul is outside waiting at the car when he remembers a memory that happened one night when he was riding his bike home. He remembered a car riding up closer and closer to him and when he looked back at the car he saw a person wearing a ski mask hanging out of the passenger side window holding a bat. When the car got close enough to Paul the person hanging out the window swung at his head. Paul jumped right, wrecking his bike just as the person smashed the bat right into a mailbox. Paul ran home, he told his parents what had happened, first blaming his brother for trying to kill him. They didn't believe him because Erik had been home the whole time doing his homework. They never believe him because he \\"can't see\\". Paul's father is oblivious to what Paul really sees until they move to Florida and weird is cool. Paul joins the soccer team where he is an awesome goalie, hoping that his father will finally see his athletic potential as well.

But when they move to Tangerine Fl, Paul finds out something about his brother that will haunt him and his family for the rest of their life. I think this was a very, very, good book.

You can re-read it many times and find out something new."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This half sports story, half adventure story takes place in western Florida where muck fires rage wild underground and it rains every day. The book's main character is named Paul. Paul's older brother, Erik, is the star of the High School football team. Paul's sport is soccer and after a sinkhole swallows the school, he starts going to the town's other school, which makes him fit in with the toughest kids, who happen to be the soccer players. At the same time, something is terribly wrong with Eric, and no one can see it except Paul. This was a very good book because it was realistic. &quot;"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I had to read this book for seventh grade summer reading and I was left with my jaw dropped and my parents with a gigantic electric bill because of me leaving the light on all night long to read. Tangerine is the best book I've ever had to read for school and one of my top five faves of all time. This is coming from a person that only likes books such as Harry Potter, Alex Rider, A Series of Unfortunate Events,etc. Tangerine is basically the same story about a kid who moves to a new town and finds it sort of hard to fit in, but with a really smart and cool twist. In this case Paul Fisher is the new and somewhat misunderstood kid. He has a rare eye condition that only lets him see with a pair special glasses,yet he can see more about what's going on around his life than the people around him. Paul is also the one that narrates the story and you find yourself literally reading his journal, which makes the connection all that more powerful and makes you feel like your actually in the story (especially in the thrilling and wonderfully described soccer scenes). All the secrets, plot twists, and surprises make this a first class young adult novel that puts it in another level.Stories like these are hard to come across and Tangerine is just the perfect blend of reality, surprises, and imagination. A definete must read."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Are you intrested in sports novels with a twist? Then Tangerine is the book for you. Tangerine is a great book that I enkoyed. I liked Tangerine because it was so realistic and it could of happened. 12- year old Paul Fisher moves to Tangerine County, Florida where he knows nobody. He is legally blind and can't do what he enjoys most, play soccer. He is overshadowed by his blindness, who knows where it came from? His family sid he stared into an eclipse when he was little. Then Paul remembers a terrible event from the past. To find out about this horrible memory read Tangerine. Tangerine was written by Edward Bloor and is about 294 pages. You can find it for around $5-$6 at most bookstores or here for $3.99. This book would be most enjoyed by 11- 13 year old boys. For quick reference the ISBN is 0-590-66092-6."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"What a page turner! This engaging book is about a boy who has just moved to a new area, Tangerine County, Florida, with his family. He is a young man who is constantly outdone by his older star-football-player brother and is stuggling to find his place in life, in Tangerine county, and in his family. This book captures you into his world, taking you through the ups and down of the self-awarness and moral issues of middle school. This young man must ultimitly chose to do the right thing or to do what is expected of him. It deals with a question that every young person is asked, \\"What do you want to be?\\"Relativly short and an easier read than some, this book is a good read for most middle schoolers and young adults alike. It is well written and engaging with many twists and turns (especialy the ending!!!)."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I previewed this book, hoping to use it for my 5th grade class. Although it is a very gripping and interesting story, it is really not appropriate for 5th graders! There are many violent elements, such as a main character that gets killed by a blow to the head, and language. I was somewhat disappointed because I had read on other childrens literature sites that teachers had read it to their elementary classes. Again, I enjoyed it, but I'll have to just leave this one to parents who want to read and discuss it with their children at home."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine by Edward BloorThis is one of the best books I've read. Paul Fisher is a 12 year old boy whose family moves to Tangerine, FL, \\"a place where weird is normal\\" Paul is visualy impaired but an awesome soccor player. He has an older brother, Erik, who is a football star. Pual's parents are blinded by that, and do not realize that their is somthing seriously wrong with Erik. Also, in their house, secrets are commonplace. Paul's parents sincerly belive in \\"what you don't know can't hurt you\\"- but that has hurt Paul. His parents made up a lame cover story for how he lost his eyesight, while in reality, something much more sinester is going on. This book is dark, mysterious, and thought provoking. Bloor worked many twisting plots into the story, but very skillfully. There is plenty of suspense,and action. The characters are well developed, and you can easily feel for them. The book explores hard to talk about issues. The plot is unique and so are the characters. I would say, anyone over ten should enjoy this book. There are some distrubing events, so childern younger than ten should probably wait. This book makes my top five books ever, you should definatly read it!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Unlocking The PastHow would you feel if your own parents never told you about your true past, just to save your relationship with your older brother? Tangerine by Edward Bloor is where you will find it all out.Paul Fisher(main character) never knew that moving to a new home in Tangerine, Florida would help him to unlock his true past. While living in Tangerine, Paul has many obstacles to go through such as muck fires, sinkholes and mysterious murders. Paul soon finds out some shocking secrets about his brother, Erik. Paul unlocks the truth of his brother and finds out how his brother had such a role in Paul's life, but more importantly he finds out the truth about himself.The event at the end was my favorite part. I liked how Paul finally unlocked the secret to his past. As I was reading, I wasn't expecting Paul to just remember his true past out of nowhere. I like it when authors make events happen so suddenly, but they have to do it in the right way.I think that the two major themes could be self awareness and relationships. Self awareness is a theme because Paul has always had something missing from him, the memory of his past. Paul keeps trying to be himself and know who he really is, but has some trouble doing so. Relationships is a theme because Paul's friends are his world. His parents are mostly focused with the Erik Fisher football dream, especially his dad. His friends are a lot more supportive of him than his parents, although I think that if his parents had never had Erik, they would be a lot more supportive of Paul's dreams.Tangerine was worthwhile read, but it certainly wasn't the best or worst book I've ever read. I'm not a big fiction person, I'm more of a nonfiction person. It seems that I understand nonfiction a lot better because they are true events. I usually only like fiction if the book has plenty of really dramatic scenes here and there, otherwise it bores me. If I had a choice of Tangerine or a nonfiction book of my choice, I wouldn't have chosen Tangerine. I would have been more willing to read this book if it had more drama. Tangerine only had about 3 or 4 very dramatic scenes. If it had about 7 or 8 dramatic scenes, depending on what they were, I definetly ould have been more willing to read this book.I would recommend this book for 5th grade and up. It might be a little tough for someone under 5th grade to understand it because it was even challenging for me at some points. I would also recommend this book for soccer lovers, mostly because Paul is on a soccer team. There are not many violent scenes or any language, so I think that 5th grade and up would be a great age. For anybody who reads this book from now on, I hope that they have a great time doing so."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I want to thank Mrs. Elaine Sturgill, who read this intriguing book to our 8th grade class after I recommended it. Everyone loved it!Tangerine is a book that anyone can relate to. So many things go wrong for Paul Fisher and his family after they move from Houston,TX to Tangerine,FL. Sinkholes, constant thunderstorms, underground fires, termites, deaths, and a series of robberies make a great book. Paul is legally blind because of an incident that he can't remember. But he can see fine; in fact, he sees things his parents won't see, and not just things that are visible. His older brother Erik, whom Paul fears and loathes, is the placekicker for the high-school football team. His father is obsessed with what Paul calls the \\"Erik Fisher football dream.\\" Erik gets all of the glory and fame because he's the big jock. His father pays no attention to Paul or his soccer season. His mom is caught up in it all, sometimes sensing that something is wrong but not doing anything about it. She is too busy keeping up appearances and heading the subdivision's architectural commitee.After a disaster destroys Paul's school, he transfers to one that is very different. Whereas his old school was full of suburban kids, this one has more rural kids. He becomes friends with a family of tangerine growers. After a tragic incident, Paul knows that the truth will come together and his family might come apart.When Paul's mom discovers something that will rock the entire community, you are suddenly thrown into a wild series of twists and turns leading to and awesome and surprising conclusion.Tangerine is a well written and dramatic book that is so detailed that you fell like you are in the book and you know the characters. It is in the form of Paul's computer journal entries."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"In every book I read, I always look for some kind of deep meaning in the context. If a book is too shallow, then it does not quallify as a good book. This book is a literal eye opener to the cruelties that go on. There are too many neglected kids in this world who's parents sometimes don't see the pain behind the mask that their kids put on day after day. I highly recomend this to parents of teenagers, because their kids are drifting farther and farther away and this book can help them realize that. That's one of the reasons that Tangerine hit home for me. Me and my half sister don't get a long at all and I know secrets about her that would blow my parents minds if they knew. This book will help open parents minds to the cruelties going on between syblings, and so parents need to be aware of that. I know that when I become a parent, then I will not be totally in the dark about these things. Because of my own experiences, and this book. This is the most meaningful book that I have ever read. For the readers information, I'm not a shrink, I'm just a kid who WANTS their parents to ask a little more questions about why things are going on in their kids lives. And trust me, just because we walk away from our parents, doesn't mean that we don't want to be chased."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Edward Bloor has done a phenomenal job on this meaningful book. The book is about a boy named Paul Fisher who moves to Tangerine, Florida. He finds dark secrets about his past and about his brother, the high school football star, Erik Fisher.

But, when Paul was younger Erik did horrible things to him that may have affected his sight. Paul is just now remembering all of the bad acts his brother has committed, but Erik has done other things that may have affected Paul and his friends. I believe that no one under the ages of 9 or 10 should be reading this book because of some the content of the book.

His whole family is so wrapped up in Erik's football that his mother has only been to a couple of his games and his dad has not been to any. Paul starts his education in Tangerine at Lake Windsor Middle School. On the day he has a tour of the school he sees that there are no classrooms but just mobile portables. His mother fills out an EIP because he is visually impaired. When he tries out for the soccer team the coach says he can not play because he is handicapped. But, when disaster strikes at school, he decides him to change schools.Tangerine Middle is the rival of Lake Windsor. Paul has a hard time fitting in at first, but he gets a tour guide named Teresa Cruz. She has a twin brother, Tino, who is on the soccer team and can set him up with the coach.

With many characters, the impressions I got greatly changed as I found out more about their personality. I am definately going to try to find out more books the author, Edward Bloor, has written because I think he did an excellent job. The only thing I would change about this book is the ending...

It was so real it made me think for a bit of how cruel and evil some people can be. This book talked about the common issues having to do with a typical family, such as one kid feels left out or mistreated.

Erik may seem perfect to others, but Paul has a hunch he has something to do with his eyesight injuries. And when Paul witnesses Erik do a terrible thing to his friend, he is positive that Erik would have hurt his eyes if he had the chance. Even though he has proof, Paul keeps quiet because he is afraid. But when Paul finds the secret of his past, he gains new confidence. \\"The truth will set you free\\" is the quote that leads Paul to discover his past discover his past.Tangerine was a decent book. It had good parts and bad parts. One thing I didn't like was that the author made some events happen that wasn't necessary. Apart from that it is pretty good. This is a great underdog story.I do not think the author should have made a certain person die because his death was not necessary for the book to continue. He was a nice person and didn't deserve it. He was one of the few people who accepted Paul in the beginning. But at least Joey (Mike's younger brother who is the same age as Paul) is just as nice as him.I also think the beginning was pretty boring. Their was no action, just talking and figuring out what was going on. You should not give up on Tangerine at the beginning just because it is boring, it gets exciting after a while. I could not put it down, too bad I read it in a book group so I couldn't keep reading.If you like underdog stories or sports, this is the book for you. Ages 10 and under should not read Tangerine because younger children would not understand the significance of certain events. There is also murder and disaster."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"What would happen if you lived a life of only being able to see the lies around you? In Tangerine by Edward Bloor, he explains the tragic adventures that a visually impaired boy named Paul goes through. All he wanted was to live a normal life... Could You?Paul just moved to Tangerine, Florida with nothing to strive for in life. Living in shame, Paul has never done anything about growing up in the shadows of his older show-off brother, Erik. Being visually impaired limited his like a ton, by restricting him from his favorite sport, soccer. But after switching to a much tougher school, the kids turn is life around to never hold back on anything he ever does.Overall, Tangerine didn't catch any attention from me at first. But at about mid-way through the book the action really starts to kick in. On page 49, all of the action starts to really kick in...\\" Mike Costello is dead, mom. He got killed at practice today.\\" But after the book ended, the moral of the story is what really caught my attention. It kept me thinking about what it could impact on my life and others.Like I said before, at the beginning of the book, it was a bit boring with no action or drama. It didn't make me want to keep reading on or anything. It just made me want to abandon the book. I knew this because a reader really needs something that makes you think and never want to put the book down.Something that really through me off was the ending. It just ended. It didn't give you any reason to think on about Paul's new school. It just bored me. I knew this because for good books I try to think of what would happen if there could ever be a sequel. But for this book I just put it down and ended.The recommendation for this book is for anyone who is over 6th grade for some violence and weapon features!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Constant lightning, two dead, fires that never burn out. It doesn't seem like a very nice place in the small town of Tangerine, Florida.Tangerine, by Edward Bloor, is a book with many interesting characters and events. The main character is a visually impaired boy named Paul Fisher. He and his family move to Tangerine, Florida and as soon as they get there strange things occur. People are killed, schools are destroyed and there's all this buzz around Paul's mysterious older brother, Erik. His parent's are blinded by Erik's football talent. Paul may be visually challenged but he can see the real Erik, who seems to be filled with evil. When Paul was younger something happened to his eyes and now he's starting to remember all that happened.This book had its happy parts (like when Erik got caught) its sad part's (like when Luis died) and my favorite part which was when Erik got beaten up by Victor and Tino. It felt like long deserved justice was finally being served. Also, I thought it was kind of funny.I think that the one thing the author was trying to get across through the book was that; \\"The truth will set you free\\", exactly as they said it in the book. I don't think the author just said that to be cool. If he comes right out and says it, you know it's at least a theme.I thought that the book was pretty well written. It didn't really have to much voice but the action in it kept the book interesting. It seemed like every five pages someone would die or there's another crime committed, or a school gets eaten. All in all, I guess it was an \`'okay'' book.I recommend this book for people who like mystery or for ages ten through fourteen because there is some drama and strong themes. Also for people who just read to finish a book, this book could get boring very quickly. So, if you like mystery and action then read the book. If you don't, then do yourself a favor and don't read this book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"What happened to Paul's eyes? Is Erik really evil? Who is robbing the houses of Lake Windsor Down?

But when the Fishers move to Florida, Paul tries to solve the puzzle of what happened to his eyes.This book has many good qualities and parts. The ending is really good and it reveals everything. The mystery of Paul's eyes is solved. This book has action and catches you so that it is hard to put down. A suspenseful part is on pg 252-253, \\"Erik and Arthur opened their doors and got out, leaving the motor running and the headlights on. They stepped around in front, so that the lights were still on me while they remained in the shadow. Still, I could see that their faces were swollen and bloody. And I could see that Erik was holding a metal baseball bat in one hand. I understood that I was supposed to horrified by this spectacle-these two demonic creatures on this dark, lonely road. But for once in my life, I wasn't.\\" I think this part shows suspense because you can feel something big is about to happen.This book has two really interesting characters. Erik is like an older brother who likes to terrorize his littler sibling. He is a bully to other kids. He teases Joey about trying to take his brother's shoes of after he was dead. Paul, on the other hand, is frightened by Erik. He could never find the courage to speak out against him. Like when Erik hit Tino, Paul wanted to tell his parents about it but he couldn't find the courage. But after the accident in the alley with Arthur and Erik, Paul gains the courage. Paul also remembers thing when he sees or hears certain things. In the beginning, he remembers a black car speeding down the road and a baseball bat being extended out the window. When Erik says \\"Shut up Castor\\" Paul remembers what happened to his eyes.I like this book because it sucks you in, \\"And yet, when I search through our family photos, I can see I never wore glasses of any kind before that Summer. But right after the solar eclipse, I was wearing these thick lenses I now call my regular glasses.\\" .It was well written and interesting thing happen to keep the suspense. Like when the time Luis said that Erik and Arthur were going to get hurt on Monday when they turn in their football equipment, I wondered what was going to happen. But when you find out the unthinkable happens.This book has a dark mood in some places and deals with death in other places. Those parts might give little kids nightmares so I would recommend it to kids ages ten and over.

The trees have been burnt and plowed under, but the old town never really has gone away. Water still flows where it used to, lightning still strikes the spots where the highest trees once stood, and the burning trees that were plowed into the muck burn on - under the white sand.Paul's family is much like Tangerine. On the surface, the two boys, Paul and his brother Eric, are star athletes. Dad is the town's new civil engineer. Mom is leading the new Homeowners' Association within weeks of moving in. All very upper middle class, civic-minded, and successful. But a very ugly truth lurks beneath. They all know it to some degree or another.

There are so many diiferent things that happen. This book is for sports fans that like suspense and dont read much but need to read more. It is 90000000x better than Harry Potter, which i love H.P.

Paul was a well-drawn character, easy to sympathize with and easy to care about. However, I longed for a little ambiguity when it came to Eric. He was clearly an adolescent psychopath, yet having the line drawn between good and evil so clearly is dull; you can just turn on the TV or rent a movie. Books work when there's depth to more than the narrator: that way we have to think about what's going on rather than just going along for the ride.Also, I found it odd that there was no police investigation into the multiple deaths until the end, but then I don't live in a football-worshipping town. Tangerine made me very glad I didn't.Last, I also felt the author pulled the rug out from under us with the character of Joey - first he was a likeable guy, and then a racist jerk with an attitude. But you had to give Bloor credit there for not being predictable."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul Fisher is a normal kid except for one thing, he has huge glasses. He doesn't remember how he got them, maybe from staring at a solar eclipse, but all he knows is that he has them. He has just moved to Tangerine county, Florida. The thing that sets this book though is his brother, Erik Fisher, who can kick a 50-yard field goal with deadly accuracy, because of this he is one of the towns hero's. But what everybody else see's isn't the true Erik, only one person can see the truth about him and that happens to be his little brother Paul. Paul is also on his school's smash-mouth soccer team the Tangerine War Eagles. All in all it is a very good book and it sometimes can be almost impossible to set it down."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"When you think of tangerines, you think of fruit, in this book, you think of a severely messed up neighborhood.

I'm an eighth grade, and found this book so great, because, well, I suppose in some ways I can really relate to them, and it's so awesome because it's kind of like sort of changing sides throughout the book, and well, when you get to the part where it's the reason why Paul has to switch schools, well, it's an awesome book from there, and probably the climax of the story, in my oppinion.

He is told that he is blind because he looked into an eclipse when he was younger, but he doesn't really believe it. His older brother Erik is a popular football player, and throughout the book Paul keeps remembering some memories of something Erik did to him when they were younger. Paul starts making friends once he joins the soccer team and plays goalie, one of his talents, so he doesnt really feel like a misfit anymore. But later there are mysterious robbings of the houses that are being exterminated for pests and Paul thinks he knows who it is, could it be his brother?

The two main characters of the book are both in sports teams and their sport is important to them. As the main character changes schools, the sense of belonging developes slowly.

Paul's older brother Erik, the star football player, finds himself right at home in Tangerine because of the extreme passion for football in the area. Paul feels that his parents pay more attention to Erik than they do to him and his soccer career.

If you want to find out what happens to Paul and his family, read Tangerine by Edward Bloor.I would recommend this book very much to anyone looking for a good story full of rich imagery. This story shows people how it is to be visually impaired and tells a great story all the while. **** out of ***** stars. Also this book can be used in the classroom too. It is a good way to teach description and metaphor to your students.

The story is about his ife in Tangerine, Florida from Texas. Throughout this story you will notice the horrors and accomplishments he had to go through. For example, he will experience the horror of death and accomplishment of a new soccer career. Paul will also run into many family and school problems. This story has many surprising twists which will engross you in this story.My opinion of this book is that is it very surprising and has many interesting cliffhangers. The characters in this story will never cease to amaze you because the actions they take is much unsuspected. I personally recommend this book for any of thos young adults out there who are willing to take some time to read this excellent book. I also like how it is written in a point of view from an eight grader seventh grader so you young people can relate to the characters.Some possible classroom uses are that it will teach young adults to experience what some problems kids have to go through at home and school to be favored or noticed. Also, to help students notice the effects of their actions on other peole and how it feels to them. It is teaching students to appreciate some things in life that really matter."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Katie ChoContemporary/ Realistic fictionTangerineEdward Bloor7th-9th GradeWhen the Fishers moved from Houston, Texas to Tangerine, Florida, Paul was faced with new obstacles and had to adjust to life there.

What teenager doesn't know about trying to fit in, starting relationships, and craving attention? I sure do!Tangerine is a collection of journal entries, which is effective because the reader gets Paul's point of view on all the sticky situations he cannot avoid.Throughout the book the reader feels many emotions such as sympathy, satisfaction, joy, and apprehension as Paul goes through an odyssey for truth and in the process finds himself.Tangerine revolves around a mysterious vision disability and Paul's need to be accepted. On top of that, Paul has a sinister brother, Erik, who only makes matters worse. Additionally his parents are too caught up in the \\"Erik Fisher Football Dream\\" to realize what is really happening under their own roof.Tangerine doesn't compare to any other book. It's in a category totally its own! This book proved to me that I can always rely on my teacher to find a good book (she recommended it to me). However, you don't have to listen to a teacher. Listen to me!Later, if you think my opinion is worth your time, you should also read Maniac Magee and Walk Two Moons."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"TangerineTangerine is one of the most realistic books we have ever read. It's like we were part of the story. This totally awesome book is about a seventh grade student, Paul Fisher. He is a big pushover to everyone he knows and is too scared of the world to stand up for himself.Our teacher read this book aloud in class to us, and we are very grateful because we have never encountered a novel of this caliber.Tangerine was so funny that at times we were gasping for air and fell out of our seats laughing. But, in most parts of the story, the plot is very serious and requires careful reading to deduce certain clues that foreshadow what will happen later on in the story.Tangerine is uniquely written through Paul's eyes. We saw fights, freezes, lightening, and all sorts of other adventures in journal form from Paul's perspective.We suggest this book for 7th through 9th grade students. This book does not suit younger age groups because it would be too difficult to catch the themes of the story. This book would not suit older age groups because it has been so long since they have been in school that they couldn't relate!When we were reading Tangerine, we kept thinking of a character in Walk Two Moons who teaches a shared basic theme: just because you are blind does not mean you cannot see."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"At first, when our teacher told us we were reading the book Tangerine, we thought it was going to be SO boring! We mean who writes an interesting book about a fruit! Come on! WOW! We were wrong! We had to eat those words (or, rather, fruit)!Tangerine is about a seventh grader named Paul Fisher who moves from Houston, Texas to Tangerine, Florida. Paul has a brother, Erik, who gets praised even when he does dirty deeds, which is always. Paul, on the other hand, often gets overlooked! Paul is legally blind, but he can still see the truth about his evil brother Erik. Why can't everyone else?This book is written like a diary and has brief flashbacks, which shoot from Paul's present to his past. This storytelling format works because Paul becomes so real. We knew his thoughts, his feelings, his hopes, and his fears. We got to know Paul better than our own brothers!The characters in the story are very lifelike! We were astonished by how real the characters' lives were. We could relate to their familiar, ordinary problems. Paul struggles with his older brother, and he has parents who just don't understand!Tangerine's an extraordinary book, and you'll never find another like it! This book is the first on our list to recommend.If you like Tangerine (which you probably will), then you should also pick up Dangerzone. They are both incredible books full of sports!

Now Paul wasn't always blind but he doesn't know how or when he went legally blind.His brother Eric thinks he looked in to an Enclips but is something way deeper than that. Paul thinks he can see fine and even see what other people can't.When the Fishers move Paul starts to have flashbacks and other memories from Tangerine but the only thing is they have never been there before. Read Tangerine and find out what Tangerine,Flordia is really about.Why should you read Tangerine? I'll tell you why. First Tangerine is a page turner every page kept you wondering what would happen next like when he said \\"They started to ask who and what was said and I said...\\" this always would make me read at least ten more pages and he always had a cliffhanger at the end of a page. The whole story kept me interested the whole time but the time I remember the most is when Paul's school is about to sink and Paul is trying to save people from the portables before they sink in a skinkhole. I think alot of people would enjoy this book and have fun reading it. I think people ten to a hundred would fall in love with this book.

The main characters in this novel are, Paul, who is legally blind because of a mysterious eye injury, Erik, Paul's older brother and star football player, Dad, a civil engineer, and Mom, who is on the Home Owners Association. Later in the story, we meet Joey(Paul's friend,) Coach Walski, and Arthur Bauer, Erik's associate.Paul, although a great goalie, he is not allowed to play for his school because of his eyes.

There, he has no record of problems with his eyes, and is allowed to play soccer there. At this school, Paul becomes more confident in himself. He makes friends whith the toughest group around.Through out the story there is the nagging question of what this mysterious eye injury of Paul is.

When I first looked at the book, I thought the story was going to be about some kind of magic tangerine. After I read the book, I felt a connection to the main character of the book, Paul Fisher.Though it seems that the book is about a tangerine, I assure you that it tells of a story that is far more interesting. Tangerine is a story about boy who has just moved to a strange town in Florida called Tangerine. The boy's name is Paul fisher, and he is not a person that would normally have many friends. He has huge glasses, and is very nerdy. Paul's life is overshadowed by his brother's life. His brother Eric is a really good football player, and every one knows him. As you can see, Paul and Eric are completely opposite.When Paul first comes to Florida, he witnesses very strange things happening. For example, there is an underground fire that has been going on for a very long time. But, nobody in the town gives a second thought about it. Another strange happening is a lightning bolt striking the same place at the same time every day. The truth is that Paul can see things that other people cant see. In this way, many readers such as I relate to Paul Fisher. We have all been in situations where we were the only ones to witness an event occurring, and Tangerine is a book that tells of a boy who experienced a time like that.Every bit of the book Tangerine is engrossing and powerful. It sends a strong message to the reader that life is not always what it seems. With this in mind, Tangerine also shows readers how life is if you were a handicapped boy. Astonishingly, the author Edward Bloor adds in a variety of subjects to the story: race relations, child rearing, sports, class conflict, and more. With all of this added, tangerine is a great soup of a story. If you read this book, you will realize that although it has a funny name, it is really a great book to read."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This book is about a legally blind seventh grade soccer player with a malicious older brother.

The characters and the events are very unrealistic. It kept my attention while I was reading it, though. If you like books that keep you guessing but the truth is not revealed to the end, this is a book for you. I would have made a few changes to make it more realistic, like the events that went on when the story takes place.

This book has a very good and interesting subject that grabs the readers attention. But in the beginning of the book it is a bit slow but that gets better tward the middle of the book. It's a wonderful book that i would recommend to anyone the loves a good book that they would get hooked on! This books asks why no one can see what Erik is doing to him self and his family, why lightning strikes the same practice field everyday, why all the houses on one stret are being robbed and attacked by bugs at the same time, and why a sink hole swallows his school. So if you want a good book to read you'll love Tangerine by Edward Bloor!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I think this book is a pretty good . You will like it, if yousoccer fan. You will not like this book if you don't like violence anddon't like people being made fun of. It is about a family of a mother,father, and two brothers,' they move to Florida. and the brother [themain charicter] has to move to 3 different schools Lake Winstar MiddleTangerine Middle and... The other brother is a trouble maker does somenasty things to people! Give it a chance. Read it!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul Fisher maybe a geek with glass, but he can see a lot of stuff that his clueless parents seem to miss. Paul notices his brother, a local football hero, is torturing his classmates with his friend. Paul starts to see through the lies that his family tells him about his poor eyesight, and finally a crazy town like Tangerine (where giant sinkholes swallow schools, underground fires burn for years and lightning strikes everyday) brings into focus a lost memory. This novel has a &quot;gothic&quot; feel to it, and like a tangerine it is full of flavor and refreshing.What a surprising well crafted novel...despite the less than appealing covers on the hardback and the paperback this book is worthy of your time."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This was a good book. But, it was also sad for Paul who hadIEP because he got kicked off of the soccer team. This book had somedeaths and it was sad when the people died. Paul's brother was weird and mean. He laughed when the person died. When there was a sinkhole it was sad but Paul was brave because he saved people. Then he transfered to Tangerine Middle School and played soccer. That was a very happy part. Now I'm not going to give away any more of the book but it had some sad, happy, and funny parts. I would strongly reccomend this to people. If you have Eye Problems this book would make you feel better about yourself. I would read this book again beacuse it is soooooooo good! Read Tangerine. You won't regret it..."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"A lot of cardboard characters and racial/social stereotypes, a choppy plot-driven narrative, and tedious prose make this book difficult to read. The main character seems to have all the right answers while everybody else, especially adults, are out to lunch. He complains about the Eric Fisher Football Dream, while chasing the Paul Fisher Soccer Dream. The author tries to do too much, especially at the end when it's time to resolve all the loose ends."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine was definitely a different kind of book. Paul Fisher has weird nightmares dating from his childhood that are brought on by different experiences in a town that he just moved into. These experiences relate to the damage done to Paul's eyes when he was younger. Paul's parents told him that a solar ecclipse damaged his eyes but Paul thinks there is a dark secret that they're hiding from him. Because of the damage Paul has to wear extra thick glasses all the time. Paul isn't allowed to play soccer for the Lake Windsor High Team since he is legally blind. Paul decides to transfer to Tangerine Middle School in order to be able to play soccer.

There will be a few minor spoilers in this review, so be prepared.The protagonist in this book is Paul Fisher, a soccer-playing guy from Texas who moved to Florida. I don't know what the author was thinking when he decided what Paul was like. For example, in his new neighborhood, there is pond with Japanese fish in it called Koi. Paul was thinking he was only one in the entire world who could ever possibly think that birds would for some reason eat fish. Then at a meeting about the Koi, Paul says that birds are eating the Koi, and they ask him, \\"Why didn't you tell us this before?\\"And then he says, \\"No one asked me.\\" No one asked him then either, though.There are also some parts that don't make sense. For example, Paul's brother Erik and his friend Arthur indirectly kill someone, and are about to beat Paul up because his friends beat them up. So then Paul tells them he saw Arthur \\"kill\\" the person, and they get scared and run away, and that makes no sense either..Another glaring problem in this book is the lack of describing anything. There are about 3 or 4 places in the book that describe anything. The book is filled with lines like \\"So I entered the living room and sat down on the chair.\\" and \\"Blue and white tents were on the houses.\\"If you enjoy gaps in the plot, a bland setting, and idiots for characters, then you'll probably enjoy this book. If not, I'd recommend to steer clear of this disgrace to literature."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I didn't like this book. I'm not seven. I'm not even twelve.

Due to graphic content about how Paul became blinded, carefully screen this selection before presenting it to students.Page 12: Profanity.Page 52:A boy dies by being struck by lightning. The most disturbing part is that two teens, his peers are laughing and joking about it because he did not run with the so called popular kids.\\"Did you see his hair?

With fires that burn constently and daily afternoon lighting storms Paul finds things much more different than they were in Houstan.

Paul can see his brother Erik's true self, and not as just the wonderful football player who can kick 50-yard field goals as the star of the Erik Fisher Football Dream. The Fisher family moved to Tangerine County, Florida, and into a beautiful home in the Lake Windsor Downs development. With fake fish, an underground fire that burns non-stop, giant sinkholes, and thunder storms every afternoon, who could want anything more? But horrible things start happening in Lake Windsor Downs and neighboring Tangerine, and Paul starts finding out the terrible truth about his eyesight (supposedly he stared at an eclipse for too long when he was younger), and also about his brother, Erik. What is it that Paul just has to remember? And why is it that Paul can see things that others can't, or just won't, and is still called blind? Tangerine, Edward Bloor's first novel, is great for sports fans and avid readers alike. Though the incomplete ending leaves something to be desired, the book itself is wonderfully written with a good plot. Bloor starts with several different plot lines and manages to entangle them all for a sensational ending. Bloor also leaves himself wide open for a sequel; the characters in Tangerine are so well described that you feel as if you know them personally. When something happens to one of them, you feel the pain or joy, whichever the case might be. Written in diary format from Paul Fisher's point of view, Tangerine is a book you don't want to miss! Live for four months in the Fisher family, and then see if you agree with Paul about Erik, soccer, his schools, and more. It's a delicious book that you'll want to devour without stopping!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine is an on-the-edge-of-your-seat book. I could hardly ever put it down.

With many disadvantages for him moving to Tangerine, Florida to all of the good things that happened to him after transfering schools because of a sinkhole, this book had my attention the whole time. Most of the events in the story should be taken seriously because they are pretty real-life things. I reccomend this book to anyone looking for a nice short read."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This book shows the actual life that a 7th grader has, from stress of getting picked on to sitting in the principals office getting in trouble.

Paul can see Erick, his brother, for what he really is, not the perfect little football player everyone else sees. In the beginning Paul moves from Houston, Texas to Tangerine County, Florida. Paul's mom is making her last rounds around the house making sure not an once of dust is left from when they lived in there old, clearing away not only dirt, but memories also. Bad luck for Paul starts right away. He was the best goalie in his own league in Houston and seems the be the best here, too. He knows he is going to be a starter, but then the coach calls Paul to the sideline. and tells him he can't play because his mom filled out an IEP for Paul. A few days later after being kicked off the teams his school has a sink hole devoured some of the school. This tragedy turns out to be a miracle for Paul and his dad. Now Paul could go to a different school and play soccer. He gets on the team but as a backup instead of starter, but to him that's ok because he at least can be on the team at this school. Paul makes friends with the guys on his soccer team, and does a report on Tino, one of Paul's friends, brother,Luis's invention, the Golden Dawn Tangerine. Paul gets interested in the grove and comes out a couple times to help work. The rest of the book is the climax. Secrets to what the characters are really like are revealed in the exciting ending. The mystery in the book builds up which makes you not want to put it down until the end. It is a great book if you like mystery action. I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"We all thought that Tangerine was a good book. In Paul Fisher's interesting life he finds that he has a curious blindness.

I recommend it to anyone on this world"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine by Edward Bloor is a great book. It is about a boy named Paul who moves from Houston, Texas to tangerine county, Florida. This book is realistic fiction. The setting takes place in Florida around 1997.Paul is in the seventh grade. He is an excellent goalie and plays soccer for his school. Paul's most distinguishing feature is his big glasses. He wears the glasses because when he was young, his eyes got damaged. The main problem of this book is what damaged his eyes. One theory is he stared at a solar eclipse for to long. Everyone thinks he is blind, but he can see fine. In the book, he states, \\"but I can see. I can see everything. I can see things that mom or dad cant, or wont see.\\" It really annoys Paul when people talk about his eyesight badly. There are many other small mysteries within this book. Paul has an older brother named Erik. Erik is a senior in high school. Like Paul, Erik also has athletic ability. Erik is the place kicker for the high school football team. Paul's dad is obsessed with Erik's football ability and pays no attention to Paul's soccer. Paul even found scholarship offers to colleges with good football teams that his dad was hiding. In the book, Paul refers to it as the Erik Fisher football dream. Erik is often very mean to Paul. Later in the book, Paul finds out some very important things about Erik, but you'll have to read to find out.My favorite part in the book is when Paul plays his first soccer game. It is full of action and suspense. The referee loses control of the game in the first minute and it gets pretty wild after that. It's a tough game, but the other team has no teamwork and Paul's team wins in the end. The theme of this book is about a boy overcoming difficulties.This is a great book to read and enjoy. Once you get past the first few pages, it starts to entice you. You wont want to stop reading it because you'll want to find out what happens next. I think this book would make a great movie. As you are reading it, try to imagine what it would look like on the big screen and I think you'll agree with me. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries full of action and suspense."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I have the honor that mrs. bloor is my teacher.

I understand that this book is sometimes included in 7th grade GT reading lists. My review does not apply to that age. I don't yet have a child that age, and my opinion might be completely different for that age of child.The book has no language, sex, or drugs. However, I think the themes are to mature for a 5th grader. My daughter told me she didn't like this book and asked if I would check it out. She normally does not say things like that. SPOILERS!!! On the surface it is about a boy playing soccer who is pretty much overlooked by his parents. The parents focus on the older brother playing football. However, the older brother is abusive to the younger brother, and the parents do not believe him when he reports the behavior. The older brother also gets into a fight, doesn't intend to kill another person, but does. He then tries to hide his involvement. And the most disturbing part of the book to me is when another boy dies at football practice. The older brother and his friend laugh about how funny he looked while he was dieing and about how others react. They are happy because it means a starting position for a friend. And they tease the dead boy's younger brother about his death. All of that I think is way more than my daughter is ready to handle.I can see how for an older child this book would have lots of good discussion points.

I wondered if it really deserved all of those awards and decided to find out for myself if it was a great book.It is.In this unique, coming-of-age story, author Edward Bloor creates a realistic tale that is at once engaging, humorous and filled with great twists.Paul Fisher wants just one thing - to play soccer - and he's not about to let anything stop him. Not the fact that he is legally blind, not the fact that his father only supports older brother Erik's football dream (while all but ignoring Paul), and not even the fact that he must suddenly play on a team where the majority is the minority and his teammates are a rough bunch.Older brother Erik has always tormented Paul, but their parents don't see it . . . or they refuse to see it. As a reader, I was angered at what Erik gets away with, but Paul quietly accepts it - just as he quietly accepts the fact that he wears the Coke-bottle glasses that make him so different from everyone else. Another thing that only Paul seems to realize is that Tangerine County, Florida, (to where they have just moved) isn't well suited for human habitation. Not only do they now live in the lightning-strike capital of the United States, they are also plagued with sinkholes, muck fires and swarms of mosquitoes. As long as he's able to play soccer though, Paul will put up with a lot.Naturally, when Paul's opportunity to play soccer is yanked away, Paul is devastated, but then a sudden twist of fate presents Paul with a new chance to play - and a whole new set of challenges. As Paul bravely confronts the obstacles that come his way, his older brother's increasingly disturbing behavior causes events around Paul to slowly spiral out of control. Eventually Paul must find the courage to stop quietly accepting things and show others the truth that they have refused to see all along."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Haunted by a disturbing incident in his past, soccer player Paul Fisher begins to build a new life for himself when his family moves from Texas to Tangerine, Florida. Forever under the shadow of his older brother, a high school football star, Paul is forced to deal with his personal struggles and accomplishments all on his own. Tangerine is an unforgettable story with strong, believable characters and an interesting plot. Written by Edward Bloor.--Reviewed by Kristina Miranda"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"My son who is 12 read this book as part of his summer reading assignment from school - I also read it - what a great story! We especially enjoyed it because I grew up in Florida and the story was so true to how all the developers and transplants have tried to turn the state into one giant Disney and how nature thwarts them whenever it can - but anyone would enjoy this book. It is a great story with a really good message."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Let's just say I started this book at 10 pm, and didn't set it down again until I was finished - at 1 am, despite knowing I had to go to work very early in the morning. There was not only a slight air of mystery about the plot (what happened to Paul to make him nearly blind?) but also several twists and turns to the very fast-paced plot. The bit about the shoddy engineering and government corruption was also particularly interesting to me. I think it just showed that this book - like ogres and onions - had a lot of layers. There were underlying tensions and interesting backgrounds, along with some very interesting characters and plenty of those life lessons. It was fun, even as an adult, to watch Paul grow into himself. Sure, a bit of a coming-of-age story, but despite its over-the-top, dramatic settings and events, it was also quite sad and had a touch of realism. I think I've been reading too much \`happy' literature - the deaths in this book rather affected me. Or maybe it was just the sleep deprivation.I'd highly recommend this book from... whatever age kids can deal with the weightier issues in the book (crime and death) up to adulthood. A fun and exciting read. Seriously. Go read this one."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This book is outstanding.it talks about reletionships and tradgedy as well as disabilities and the truth. I gave this book a five star rating because of the apparent time, thought and effort put into the creative text. My absolute favorite part of this book is the very ending because it shows remembrance of a lost freind. I would recommend this book to people with interests such as soccer, and ages 11-14 because of the setting at a Tangerine Middle School and Lake Windsor Middle School."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This book has a great story and a good message. I think it has a good ending, too (unlike an earlier review), because it brings closure to many issues, and ends on a uplifting note. I think most teens would enjoy have trouble putting it down!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Psycho siblings and childhood trauma. I'm glad I decided to read this one before giving it to my son. The book has good character development and Mr. Bloor is clearly in touch with kids, but this book is definately for the older teen!! I was haunted by this one and would prefer to shield my kids while I still can."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul's family has always moved quite a bit. This time he is in seventh grade, his brother Erik is a senior in high school and they are moving to Tangerine, Florida. Erik is expected to be a star football player there, continuing the dream he and his parents have of a life of football. Paul has heard the dream so often that he is sick of it and the way his father, especially, never seems to focus on anything else.Paul is a great soccer player, although his parents don't seem to notice. His abilities are surprising, actually, since he's had a problem with his eyes for years and has to wear thick glasses to correct his vision. He was told that the damage was caused by looking at a solar eclipse, but Paul has fuzzy and fleeting memories of something else--something that involves his brother.Things go fairly badly for Paul until a disaster at his middle school causes him to be transferred to a more inner-city school nearby. There he is able to make the soccer team and to be accepted by the other members. For the first time in his life, he finds himself unafraid to stand up to his brother and to fight for what's right.I liked how Paul kept unraveling little bits of the mystery of his eyes throughout the story until he could finally remember what happened. I also liked the circumstances that brought Paul to his new school, and I liked the interaction between him and his group of friends.I found it hard to believe, though, that Paul's parents, knowing Erik's history and his personality, would have treated him like a king for so long. I also couldn't understand Joey's prejudice, and then I couldn't understand why Paul put up with it and continued to be his friend."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Do you like reading books that are filled from cover to cover with exciting information? If this is the case, I highly recommend you to read this book in particular. In the story, Paul Fisher is a kid whose main focus in life is soccer. He and his family have just moved from Texas to Tangerine, Florida and he's having a hard time fitting in. After the Fisher's had arrived, they began to realize that strange things were happening in Tangerine. First there were the fires that had been burning for years underground, and the mysterious amounts of thunder and lighting that occurred everyday at the exact same time. Strangely, even more weird things began to happen, as Paul attempted to uncover the secrets of his past, while remaining a normal teenager at the same time.As I said earlier, this book will keep you hooked the entire way through. Also, the author does a good job at describing what's going on really clearly with out giving away too much, so that the story keeps your interest. My favorite part was during Paul's first soccer game on his new team because I couldn't put the book down, and I was excited to find out what would happen next. After reading this book I learned that you have to stand up for what you believe in, and do what you know is the right. Also, I realized how important it is to persevere until you accomplish a task. I hope you choose to read this book because I know you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Bloor's in-depth look at each character is refreshing in the reality of cut-out characters inhabiting most young adult novels. Virtually every character has a life all their own; by the end of the novel I know everyone's history, motivations, and likely next move.However, Paul Fisher, the narrator of the story, seems too flawless. The only mistakes he make seem to be deliberately placed by the author, and hence out of his control. He also has more foresight than any other character and even corrects many of the adults about their mistakes throughout the novel.Besides communicating character, another Bloor writing style I like is his use of suspense. Throughout the last third of the novel, all the loose ends began tying into the central conflict. As more and more begins riding on the one issue, I wanted more and more to know how it would resolve."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"When was the last time a book made you want to keep reading? If you are like me it has been a long time.The book Tangerine by:Edward Bloor just might catch your attention, it did mine. Edward Bloor writes this book like it is the diary of Paul Fisher. When you are reading it doesn't seem like you are readingg chapters because you just what to find out what is going to happen the next day. believe me a lot of things happen. Paul is a 7th grader who hass just moved from Houston to lake Windser, Florda. Lake Windser is in Tangerine County. Paul is amazed at the way things are at Lake Windser. The school is in many buildings and lightening strikes the practice field every afternoon. When his school has to let some kids go to other schools because of a giant sinkhole, Paul gets to change to Tangerine Middle School. He wants to go there because no one will know he is vision impaired and because he wants to play soccer. At his new school paul makes new friends and gets to play soccer. There are alot of serious parts to the book like why Paul is afraid of his brother Erik. I almost everyone would like this book because it is quick moving and has funny, sad, and serious things all the way through."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"My class was forced to read this book, and let me tell you, it sucked. I would not reccomend this book to anyone. It is cliched and boring and elementary. Younger readers may enjoy this book a little, but anyone older than 10 will indefinitely hate it. If you are a family member shopping for books for a gift for your 10 year old or older, chose another book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I had to read this book for school in eighth grade and loved it. It has just enough twists and turns to keep a young easily distracted reader interested. I recommend this to anyone who like books that are slightly odd and a little bit out of the ordinary."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Saying that you have glasses as thick as a coke glass because you looked at a solar eclipse too long is a lame excuse. That's what Paul fisher thinks in Tangerine.When Paul moves to Tangerine Florida from Houston Texas he can only think of having the downside. He almost does. Muck fires, sinkholes, murders,etc. But nothing is as bad as the horrible truth that Paul finds out about himself and his brother.., murders,etc. But nothing is as bad as the horrible truth that Paul finds out about himself and his brother.I kind of liked this book. I felt this was a shocking, interesting novel. It had a smooth paragraph and then ... BAM!. A fight breaks out. The book was a little overwritten but it was worth reading. This novel has a lot o events that all eventually tie down to the main thing Paul learns. The truth about his brother.This book had a lot of drama in it. Like when Paul found out about Luis's death. Luis is a brother of a student whom Paul is friends with named Theresa. The book has some parts that will pull you in. Just like when Tino and Victor beat up Eric and Arthur. Eric is Paul's brother and Arthur is his\\" flunky\\". Tino and Victor are Paul's friends.But one thing I hated was the ending. It had no pizzazz, no excitement what so ever. It ends with the one thing I hate. School is the thing I hate. It's just one of those books that you think it will be a dream story. Nothing can be bad. Well your wrong. This book ends with Paul going to a private school. I won't tell you why.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and action all in one novel. This book is written like it was bunch of different stories. There are so many events in this book I can't name them all. Like I said, all the events eventually tie together. Also this is a good book for any of you who like to read adventure novels. There is some blood. Just like at the soccer game when Paul got a nose bleed. Ages 8-any age is okay. I think just because you are a certain age doesn't mean you can't read it. Unless your 5."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine is a book that most people will enjoy. This book is hard to put down because it is full of breathing action. Many people that I know have read this wonderful book. Edward Bloor is a wonderful author that has written this book for all people. I hope you will read this book like I have done."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Here's a blow by blow of my experiences while reading, \\"Tangerine\\". After twenty pages I said to myself, \\"Hm! The man can really write!\\". After fifty pages I said, \\"Wow! This book is as good as \`Holes'!\\". After one hundred and fifty pages I was fully engrossed. After two hundred and fifty pages I was bodily grabbing people off of the street, forcing copies into their hands while chanting something along the lines of, \\"One of the greatest kid's books ever written!\\", or words to that extent. Now that I've finished the book and given myself a little time to reflect I can clearly decide whether or not this initial euphoria was short lived or not. Ladies and gentlemen, I am more than a little pleased to report that I was right all along. \\"Tangerine\\" is one of the greatest children's books to be written in the last ten years. It is brilliant, socially conscious, filled to the brim with sympathetic (and uniquely unsympathetic) characters, and funny to boot.Paul Fisher is moving again. His father is a civil engineer by trade, so Paul's a little used to picking up and leaving for the next town. In this particular case, the family's moving to Florida to live in a gated community. Once there, each member will be able to start doing what they enjoy best. His brother, Erik, will continue to wow everyone with his football skills, his father will continue to worship those skills and spend all his time with his eldest, his mother will join the community's neighborhood association, and Paul will join his school's soccer team. Paul's a goalie by training, and despite his eye troubles (he has almost zero peripheral vision due to a mysterious accident in his youth) he's the best. Not like anyone notices, of course. The rest of the family is too caught up in what Paul has wryly dubbed the Erik Fisher Football Dream. The fact that Erik is a seriously disturbed individual seems to go entirely unseen by Paul's parents and it becomes clear that when his brother's activities go from threatening to criminal, Paul's the only one who can come out with the truth. Along the way he has to battle lightning storms, sinkholes, underground fires, flash frosts, and angry neighborhood associations.That's the plot in its barest form. As I've copied it down here, I haven't even begun to delve into the fact that Paul transfers himself from his local hoity-toity school in the suburbs to a far more rough and tumble public facility. He makes friends with the kids in that school, faces racism on the part of his old school chums, and begins to understand a little more about white privilege. What other school age novel deals with racism, classism, social consciousness, and environmental concerns and so well at that? The precarious nature of Paul's new home becomes clearer and clearer when expensive koi fish are eaten by the native ospreys, muck fires spring up regularly in the backyard, and termites start eating the houses. The more the humans attempt to bend nature to their will, the funnier the situations become. This would not be a bad book to pair with the similarly Florida set story, \\"Hoot\\".I was a little surprised at the psychopathic nature of Paul's brother. Having just finished reading Diana Wynne Jones's excellent, \\"Archer's Goon\\", which contains the most evil little sister in literature, I was amazed to find that my next book, \\"Tangerine\\", contains the world's worst elder brother. Erik and his brother have exactly one conversation in this entire novel. Beyond that, all we know of Erik comes from Paul's slowly clearing memories about the accident that damaged his sight and Erik's own actions. As Paul's parents strive to prove that they're a perfect family, things become worse and worse. I liked that Paul was as mature a kid as he was. Though he certainly says words and thoughts that are a little old for a seventh grader, you feel safe with him as your narrator. When he overreacts, you understand why. The same goes for when he doesn't react at all.I'll skip telling you about the symbolism that also went into this tale. Needless to say, if you've a kid that needs to read a book that's rife with it, just pick this one out. I'm still amazed that this was Edward Bloor's first novel. The level of the writing is not only impressive, but also intense. This is the first book I've read (outside, I'll admit, of Harry Potter) that actually made me interested in sports. I loved reading about Paul's soccer games and how he compares them to football. Best of all are the characters in this tale. Even Paul's parents, horribly flawed but earnest, are at least trying to be good people. The book is, above all, honest. And I appreciated that.The highest praise I can offer \\"Tangerine\\" is this: Long after I finished a chapter or two I would find myself puzzling over the multiple meanings and layers of the text. Whole sentences and ideas kept popping up to be reread and regurgitated. If you want a children's book that will make you think about a host of different ideas and points of view, read \\"Tangerine\\"."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"The book Tangerine was a very touching thriller. It is about a boy named Paul Fisher, an unpopular soccer player who lives in a family that aims just about all of their attention toward the older brother, Erik, a star football player in high school. Paul, Erik, and his mom and dad move from Houston TX to Tangerine FL when Paul is in 7th grade. Paul tries hard to fit in as he gets used to his new surroundings. He had grown up to be known as a geek because of the big, thick glasses he has had to wear. He would be called &quot;Eclipse boy&quot;, &quot;Mars man&quot;, and many other awful names. On the other hand, Erik is the star of the Tangerine High School football team right from the first game he plays for them. He gets in the local paper, and it tells how amazing it is that he can kick 45 to 50-yard field goal kicks. Paul's dad, who can't stop talking about Erik going on to the pros, gets on Paul's nerves. &quot;The Erik Fisher football dream&quot; is the name Paul gives it. In Paul's family, it never seems to be forgotten.I say this book is a thriller because of certain mysteries, such as how Paul and his family have become the way they are. I enjoyed the way every chapter drew you in and kept you wondering how events turned about, and what would happen next. The story builds to a climax where a mystery is revealed.Paul tells the story very well. Many of the things he says and thinks are very touching. I think Paul describes his point of view and what he thinks very well. I like the fact that he doesn't care if he isn't the star of the family or town, but still cares about playing hard in every soccer game and trying to do well for his team.I really enjoyed reading this, even with the sad parts. A reader would want things to turn out well for a person like Paul. This is a wonderful story about growing up, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul Fisher's family moves to Tangerine, Florida; he is nearly blind but cannot remember the incident which led to this condition. His older brother is a football star and his parents' favorite; eventually Paul realizes his dream of playing soccer and uncovering the cause of his near-blindness.Tangerine is an excellent book for teenage readers. The narrative is written in Paul's voice, which should appeal to young readers.Bloor brings a sensibility regarding race and ethnicity to the story that is rarely present in good books for teenagers. He also brought a ready enough eye and pen to critique the newness and artificiality of suburbia, particularly Florida's suburbia. From page 71-- &quot;It was strange to see an old packing plant, to see an old anything. But it was also comforting that something around here has a history. That something actually belongs here.&quot;I really enjoyed reading Tangerine. It's nice to read a book written for teenage readers that doesn't talk down to them in any way. Paul is a neat and well-drawn character. His problems are problems that people can understand.Tangerine is a great read. I'm 33 years old, and I loved it.ken32"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I'm a 46 year-old Mom and I bought this book because of the great reviews, but I didn't know which son to give it to. My 4th grader falls into the age-range mentioned here at amazon, but based on the plot synopses here I felt it was more a book my 7th grader would like.So I read it myself first. I LOVED it. What a great, moving, inspiring, different book. As stay-with-you as Hoot, or Terabithia, or Stargirl, or... to date myself ... as The Outsiders.It's well-written, it's gripping, it's multi-layered, and it manages to keep track of multiple story arcs within itself without dropping any or using any sort of deux ex machina to get out of any. It presents it's villains without caricature, and it's heroes without pandering. It surprises you at nearly every turn - but not in a forced we-need-a-plot-twist way.I won't describe the plot as it as been so well-described here. I'll just reiterate that this is an amazing young adult novel that I thoroughly enjoyed for myself as well.And I personally would not give this to my 4th grader. Not that the reading level is too difficult, but I think the content is too dark and the layers perhaps too subtle for a 10 year-old. I'm giving this book to my 7th grader tomorrow (I just finished it tonight!) and I know he'll devour it."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"If you like mystery, soccer, and sibling rivalry, then Tangerine by Edward Bloor, is the book for you. Paul Fisher is legally blind and he has to wear &quot;bottle-thick, bug-eyed glasses.&quot; Even though he is blind, he has an amazing ability to see people for what they really are. When Paul's family moved to Tangerine County, Florida, he got a chance to start over. Paul has grown up in the shadow of his self-obsorbed, football playing brother. His dad worships Paul's brother and never pays attention to him. Paul grows through his experiences at new schools, making friends, playing soccer, and tending a tangerine grove. This book is like many other books I have read. It is very straight forward and easy to understand. Bloor does an amazing job of drawing his reader's in. He hits that there is a secret in the Fisher family and you really want to read on to find out what it is. I read this entire 294 page book in a week. I couldn't put it down. This book was also appealing to me because I play soccer. It was very easy for me to relate to the stresses that come along with playing a sport. I could relate when Paul didn't make a starting position. I have always had to work to make the team. If you don't like soccer this book may not be for you. Soccer isn't the main point of the story, but it is something that Paul identifies with and it is something that he can really relate too. There is also a great deal of soccer &quot;lingo&quot; that may be hard to understand if you don't know about the sport. &quot;Henry D. lifted a beautiful corner kick to Victor, who leaped and headed it into the goal.&quot; This would be confusing to anyone who doesn't know much about soccer. Tangerine has some great description in it. &quot;The air had a gray tint to it, and a damp, foul smell like an ashtray.&quot; It was very easy to see this newly developed town. It was a great comparison of how Paul's family moving into a new house also represented a new beginning for Paul. It was his chance to make a name for himself. The way Bloor developed Paul was the best aspect of the story. He did a great job of showing how Paul changed through the story. Paul was nothing but the little brother of a great football player at the beginning of the story. But when Paul faced his fear, he learned how to be himself. &quot;When disaster struck, we all had to do something. In a way, we all had to become something.&quot; By the end of the story, Paul had become someone. Anyone could read this book, but I recommend it to younger readers. It is not a very challenging plot. It was not too difficult or confusing and it was easy to understand. If you really like exciting plots and plots that make you think about hidden meanings, this book is not for you. Tangerine explains everything out very well and it's easy to follow. I recommend this book because it makes you realize that you need to make the most of your life. That you have to face your fears before you can become who you really want to be."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"TangerineTwelve-year-old Paul, who lives in the shadow of his football hero brother Erik, fights for the right to play soccer despite his near blindness and slowly begins to remember the incident that damaged his eyesight.

Bloor does an amazing job sucking the reader into the story and keeping you interested with all the twists and turns in the book. Each character is unique and sometimes unpredictable, but I felt like I could connect with some of them and understand their feelings and motives.Paul Fisher and his family are moving from Houston, TX, to Tangerine, FL. Paul is forced to try and fit in at a new school while living in his brother's shadow. Erik Fisher, Paul's older brother, is becoming a football legend. The young star is a placekicker and hoping to get a scholarship for college and play in the NFL. Erik and Paul's dad is always wrapped up in the Erik Fisher Football Dream that he barely pays attention to Paul at all.Soccer was Paul's sport. He played goalie even though he had to wear goggles and thick glasses because of an accident that occurred when he was younger. His parents said he stared directly at a solar eclipse and was almost blinded. Paul doesn't believe this is what really happened, but his memory is blank. At his new school, Paul's mother files an EIP because Paul is visually impaired. I was really surprised that he couldn't play soccer when the coach saw his EIP because you expected soccer to be the thing to bring him out of his brother's shadow. Conveniently enough, half of Lake Windsor Middle School is swallowed by a sinkhole and Paul and his friend Joey were part of the rescue team that helped people get out and escape the disaster before it buried them. I think this shows Paul acts very mature for his age. When I was reading the book, I kept thinking he was older, but the book would always remind me that he was only in seventh grade. After the natural disaster, Paul is relocated to Tangerine Middle, his second chance.While attending Tangerine Middle, Paul joins the soccer team because his mom threw out the EIP. He quickly makes friends with his teammates after a rough start. Together they face school, soccer, and flash frosts. Through it all I feel Paul's relationship with his friends is strong. They do face many conflicts such as standing up for your friends against people who are hurting them.Meanwhile, Erik is gaining fame from his amazing kicks from as far as 50 yards. Unfortunately, the neighborhood has taken a turn for the worst. When they tried to put out the muck fires, they accidentally created a breeding ground for mosquitoes, and a lot of houses have a termite problem. There have also been mysterious robberies. Paul even witnesses a murder.Tangerine was an amazing book. The plot and characters make it an enticing story for teenagers, but I also recommend it to adults. The story contained family conflicts that may seem out of the ordinary but are completely realistic. I loved how quickly things happened and changed in the book. It made me want to keep reading until the very end.

However if you are like me, and you are a kid who only wants to get the Acelereated Reader points, be sure to pick it up. It is great for ages 10-17 and I think even teens would like this book. If you are doing a book report though, this is not a good choose. There are too many plots which is typical since the book is written like a diary. You can actually see what Paul sees and it is like you don't need to read because you feel you are him and this stuff is happening to you . I thought the characters were one of a kind and if you have any leisure time you should pick up this book and read it. You can't put it down.

I would recommend this book to all who enjoy a challenging read. This Fiction book was extraordinary from the first page to the last pageThe story is about Paul Fisher who had move to Tangerine, Florida and had started school at Lake Windsor Middle School. When the most unexpected thing happened and Paul had to change schools, he saw this as a second chance to be on the soccer team and to make new friends. As the months went by Paul discovered secrets about the town and himself. There are many themes in this book on of the ones that I find most interesting is suburban corruption. Many people move away from the city to live better lives in the suburbs, sometimes the suburbs are worse. Bloor does a great job in portraying the lives of those who live in the suburbs.This book is written in the perspective of Paul. Throughout the book there are many flashbacks to Paul's younger years. Paul's own account of his story shows us all how cruel family and friends can be. This story is much more powerful than it would have been if it had not been from Paul's perspective. What Paul discovers about his past and the town's past is disturbing, but on the other hand it was a very imaginative piece of writing.This book left me with a strong impression of Bloor's writing and I would like to read another one of his books. Tangerine was extremely articulate and I would recommend it to almost anyone. If all of the books in the world were this incredible then I would not be able to stop reading."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Book review of TangerineTangerine must be one of Edward Bloor's finest works. This fictional book gives you a vivid image of the hardships and emotional journeys a family can experience. The story feels like a mystery but is really about a kid who can rise above all others and see the situation clearly.The moral of this story is that even not the brightest kid can change his world. In this story a vision impaired, troubled and susceptible boy who changed many people's lives.Paul Fisher is a lonely kid who lived in Houston Texas. His family moved out to Florida. He tries out for the soccer team but gets rejected because he is visually impaired and cannot play on the team as a goalie. There is a weird accident that shuts the school down and forces him to go to a rough public school. He makes friends with the most popular kids who are on the soccer team which, he joins. Their greatest player is a girl named Maya. Their leader of the team is named Victor. He is the meanest to all the new kids in the beginning but then he becomes nicer. Paul's brother is a trouble maker gone most of the time, with his henchman Arthur. Paul's parents are reasonably good parents, but as the book progresses, they fall apart and Paul has to shoulder the responsibility of straightening out his family.This book reminds me of myself. I went through some of the same things he went through. My mean brother and my wacky parents, just the only difference is they didn't go to the extremes that Paul's did. Edward Bloor has a way with writing that enchants you so you look forward to reading the next suspenseful chapter. He had many climaxes which surprised me every time they occurred. But some things were predictable.I would definitely recommend this book to readers of all ages because it will capture their attention except for people who can't read. Edward Bloor is a great author and I would like to know how he came up with this great story. I was stunned at the end. It shocked and surprised me and I felt satisfied after finishing another great book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine, by Edward Bloor, is a gripping non-fiction novel about the good and the bad goings-on of Tangerine, Florida. In the middle of the chaos is Paul, a visually impaired soccer goalie, with a mischievous older brother and a shady past. Throughout the story, Paul learns new things about Tangerine, as well as himself, his friends, and his family. Edward Bloor incorporated many different themes in to the story, including disapiontment, sadness, satisfaction, peace, hope, sports, disaster, and love. Paul, from whose point of view the story is written, goes through many different emotions and copes with them all in different ways. As you are reading Tangerine, you feel like you are a part of Paul and are trying to solve the same mysteries and problems as he is.I think Tangerine is a very powerful book, in that it makes you think about yourself in a new light and what you would do in different scenarios. It is not difficult to read which keeps the plot moving along smoothly. I never found the book to be boring or dull. Don't judge this book by the first chapter, though, because it gets better. The soccer games are vivid and exciting. Edward Bloor uses so much imagery and detail that those scenes became some of my favorite parts in the story. This novel is filled with interesting conflicts and surprising facts. Everything seems to work out in the end, but the unexpected twists in the middle will make you want to keep reading Tangerine until the very last page."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"In the book Tangerine, a boy named Paul Fisher goes to a school at Lake Windsor Middle School.

This book has a little bit of everything in it. It has some mystery, sports, and some national disasters along the way. If you like any of these kinds of books, this is a great book for you to read.This book starts out when a boy named Paul is moving to his new home in Tangerine, Florida with his mom. His father and his big brother, Eric, are already there. Paul is visually impaired and cannot see much without his goggle-type glasses. Driving up to his new development, Paul notices an odd bonfire of citrus trees in a field near his new house. When he gets to his house, he goes straight to his room. The next morning Paul wakes up to a loud boom. He has trouble finding his glasses because he is not familiar with his new room. He finds his glasses, puts them on and then sees lightning outside of his window and then smoke.Paul and his mom run outside to see where the smoke is coming from. His mom goes to call the fire department. A man in a fire truck, named Wayne, told them there was nothing to worry about. He said it was just a muck fire. A muck fire is from dead citrus trees that have been buried underground. When lightning strikes these spots, they catch fire and only the smoke rises, not the flames. After his first day of school Paul goes to try out for his schools soccer team. After this happens, almost everything in Tangerine goes wrong for Paul and his family.I thought that Tangerine was a great book. My favorite part was at the end of the book, but I don't want to give it away. I really liked this book and usually I am picky about books. If I liked Tangerine you will probably like it too."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"The book Tangerine is one of my favorite books. It was suggested to me by many people so I thought that I would check it out. It was definitely worth it. I think that the author does a very good job with the characterization. I can make a picture in my head of exactly what happens in the book. I think that if you can picture the story and put yourself in the protagonist's place then it adds so much to the story. Another thing that I like about this book is that, as with most young adult books, it is in the first person. I would rather read books with that kind of dialogue as opposed to a narrative book. Something else that I really liked about this book was the plot. At any time throughout the book there was always more than one issue that needed to be solved. I think that that is good because then you are more interested in the book. The final thing that I really liked was how easy it was to relate to the main character. He is my age, he plays sports, and he is going through a life that is very similar to mine. I know that people in high school would rather read about people who are their age than someone who is fifty years old. As with any book there was some stuff that I didn't like so much. One thing and probably the biggest was the fact of how random the book could be at times. At one point you could be talking about the big mudslide, and only a few paragraphs later have a play by play of a soccer match. I think that the author should expand more on each subject, and make a better transition to the next issue. Other than that, this was a very good book. I would rate it four stars out of five. I would suggest Tangerine by Edward Bloor to anyone who wants a good read."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul Fisher is an ordinary seventh grade kid, but his brother Erik is a football star and a hero to everyone in Tangerine County Florida.

His problems aren't really noticed though, as his parents' lives revolve around the Erik Fisher Football Dream. Paul doesn't really know how to fit into his brother's football dream, and he doesn't even know if he really wants to.This novel is fantastic. Edward Bloor's writing just enthralled me. It is good for the young adult reader probably from sixth to eighth grade. Edward Bloor writes Paul's thoughts as a diary, so I had to really think about what was happening rather than just having it told outright to me.

The characters, which really represents the reader as Paul, there sibling as the readers sibling and so on. This book should be read by all people, whether you're ten or whether you're eighty. I give this book a perfect score of five out of five. It is my favorite book I have ever read yet, and that is a huge accomplishment. If you want a comedy that is also part of a real life situation, this is the book for you. The author delivered emotions to the reader and that is what his purpose was. My favorite character was Paul, only because, I felt for him, and no one focused on his best abilities. He is also nice and caring, that is why he is my favorite.

It also swerves between realistic and fantastic in its treatment of the characters and their world. Arguably the author tried to cram too many books into this one story --- it's a bit \\"jack-of-all-trades master of none.\\" On the other hand, the story has interesting characters and settings, more to it than many teen reads, and a fairly compelling narrative momentum.

I can teach many things through the book that relate to Florida such as; sinkholes, muck fires, lightning, and the citrus industry.

It was pretty interesting. Until the middle. It was kinda confusing. There were too many characters. I read back through and got it. Next, I find out the main character's brother is a killer who never get sin trouble and who's parents don't care. The reason Paul has glasses is because his brother Erik sprayed white paint into his eyes. Nice huh? And of course, his parents keep all of this a secret, telling him he looked up at the sun during an eclipse. Paul is good at soccer, so his parents care? NO. All they care about is Erik's football career. It was depressing. Then Erik steals $1,000s of dollars worth of stuff and is responsible for two murders. Guess what? His parents don't punish him! Paul finally tells the Sheriff the stuff Erik did, and finally, Erik is caught and arrested. I was disappointed, they didn't tell what kind of punishment the jerk got. The parents still don't seem to care. How abusive?! The summary seems to make it seem like a happy and silly type of book. Well, it's not. It's dark, and evil.

Paul Fisher is the main character in this story. He just moved to Tangerine, Florida from Houston. While he was in Houston, he played soccer in a league. The position he played was goalie. This would be normal for Paul if he was no visually impaired, he was told that he stared into an eclipse to long and almost went blind. But is it really the truth?

When Paul moves to Tangerine weird things start happening. There is a giant sinkhole that eats the school and one of his best friends get struck by lightning. Paul can tell that something is wrong with his brother who is evil but his parents can't see it because he is a great football player. When you read the book you find out how Paul discovers the truth about himself and his family.The writing in this book could have been more powerful. An example from the book when Paul's friend dies The dramatic parts in this book could have been said in a more spectacular way than the author presented it. Even though the book could have been more exciting, it had enough action to keep the reader interested. It's a good thing this book did have action or the reader would have been super bored.My favorite part In this book was when Erik and Arthur got caught for stealing because for all the things that they do in the book the law finally catches up with them.

Paul wants some answers and try's to make sense of it all and stands up against his older brother for answers and his past starts to reveal in flashbacks one at a time until his past is fully revealed to reveal the shocking truth...Tangerine was a good read because the book talks about a character that you can relate to actually has emotions unlike a character that's just there but a character that has feelings and acts like any normal kid would do and say and has a true purpose in the story unlike a unrealistic character that's just there.I also liked tangerine because of Paul's soccer life, I'm not a soccer fan myself but I can understand Paul and see why he's so dedicated to soccer, its like a life or death situation for Paul but he's always on task and trying to his best and usually doing better than his best trying to excel above and beyond of what he knows he can do.I would recommend the astounding book to everyone in middle school and up for some really emotional parts like when he is mourning Luis's death by the side of the pond wishing for revenge on his older brother Erik.

That is the premise behind Tangerine by Edward Bloor.Tangerine is a book about a boy named Paul who everyone thinks is near blindness.

Paul goes through the year trying to figure out what happened to his eyes when he was younger. Find out how the truth is revealed about his eyes and other creepy events.My favorite part of the book is when Tino and Victor break into the sports ceremony. \\"Tino brought up his right leg up and around in a vicious karate kick that doubled Erik over that filled the gym with a sickening Hooh!\\" That is my favorite part because it was filled with action. But some parts of the book were slow and boring and I think it needs more improvement.Throughout all its flaws the setting was good. Tangerine had fictional parts but that made you be pulled in. some of the fictional parts were that lightning strikes the same place every day, muck fires go on forever, and his school got swallowed in sinkhole. \\"The Tangerine Times printed a special pull-out section on the lake Windsor middle school sinkhole.\\"The interesting characters kept my interest. The story behind them has lots to do with the, well, story. Paul has lots of strange memories, Erik acts crazy, and his parents don't know about it. Paul really gets you into his feelings about Erik, his parents, and school. These characters are like Harry Potter characters because they have a history.This book was worthwhile to read because the setting and the characters all mesh together. The act that Erik and Paul have a history is interesting. This is a great book but best for pre-teens. Pre-teens can really understand what something's that Paul is going through.

He also trys not to get teased and be cool by being on the soccer team, scoring goals, and hanging out with Victor and his gang.

Once here, his parents mostly work on his brother, Erik's football rather than Paul's soccer. Paul joins two differnet soccer teams and goes to two differnet schools while learning about himself, his family, and his vision problems. Then Erik gets in trouble and his parents begin to understand moe about Paul, Erik, and themselves.Review:Personally, I didn't like this book. One reason I didn't like this book is because I am a fantasy person, but that aside, I still didn't like it. Tangerine also seemed a bit boring to me. This is because there were no really gripping or exciting parts to this book. The author, Edward Bloor, did a good job describing the characters and the plots, but it didn't hold my interest. I think that he had too many plot happenings that they were crowding each other out. I also thought that his book was a bit predictable, too predictable in some places.Teachers' uses: If teachers were to do a unit on character developement then I think that this book would be good for that. Edward Bloor worked a lot on showing how Paul changed, so that would be good for a character developement unit. Also this book would be a good, easy end of the year, wrap up book. This is because, even though it is an easier book to read, it gives you good questions for the students to answer. This book is predictable so the students can make inferences more easily and predict any thing that they think may happen later."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Book Category: Contemporary/Realistic FictionTangerine is unlike anywhere Paul Fisher has ever been. Moving to this small, Florida town where it rains at the exact same time everyday, koifish are being stolen from the residential pond, and football players are struck by lightening has introduced Paul to a whole new world. Attending Lake Windsor Downs Middle, he gets kicked off the soccer team and a sinkhole swallows his school. By a small miracle, Paul is sent to Tangerine Middle, where he joins the soccer team and once again stuggles to fit in. It doesn't help that he wears thick glasses for supposedly staring at an eclipse years earlier. Despite his vision impairment, Paul can see things that the rest of the world is oblivious to. He can see that his brother, Erik, may be a star on the football field, but in real life he is a disliked and cruel person. He can see his parents faithfully, yet blindly supporting Erik in his football dream, ignoring signs that something is going terribly wrong with their eldest child. He can see that despite the \\"tough gangsta\\" image his friends from Tangerine Middle have earned, they are kinder and more faithful than anyone he has ever known. As Paul begins to feel at home in this new world, he slowly starts piecing together his puzzling past in this coming of age story.In my opinion, Tangerine is an excellent book. Edward Bloor was very descriptive and made it seem like I was actually in Tangerine with the Fisher family. I felt that I could connect with the characters and would reccomend this book to any young adult in grades six to eight. I would also reccomend it to teachers to use for projects. Some activities such as creating a mini sinkhole, defining vocabulary, identifying literary devices, acting out scenes from the story, and comparing and contrasting the story to real life are great to use in the classroom."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Genre: Contemporary FictionAppropriate Reading Level: grades four to eightSummary:Paul Fisher is enveloped by the shadow of his big brother Erik's football dream.

There is something hidden in Erik's shadow about the mysterious past of Paul, and his alien-goggle glasses. Through courage, Paul must unveil the reason for his near blindness hidden in Erik's football dream, and the answer to all the riddles.Classroom Uses:The novel can be used to help students gain a better understanding of plot, and its various parts.

Paul gradually makes his way into a trusted and reliable position on the team and can't wait to come back next year.

It got me involved because it was so easy to relate to all of the characters due to Bloor's excelent writing. I really started to feel for the characters when they went through tough times, or laugh at them in some partsof the story.Teachers would be able to use this book in their own classrooms. There are many vocabulary words in there if you read carefully. They would also be able to have the kids research some of the things that happend in Tangerine's nature. They could research the causes and attributes of the muck fires that are so prevalent in Tangerine, or they could research why the lightning might constantly strike the same place over and over.

He has to wear a pair of thick glasses because of a mysterious eye injury that he cannot remember. When Paul moves to Tangerine, Florida, he notices many strange tings. For example, a muck fire burns underneath the ground all year round, and lightning continually strikes certain places. At Tangerine, Paul gets the chance to play on his school soccer team and for once, beats his big brother Erik, a champion football player, who always overshadows Paul. Throughout the course of the story, Paul becomes a much stronger and independent person.Several possible classroom uses for this book are character analysis, reading logs and summaries about the different parts of the book, and answering questions about the story.Overall, I thought Tangerine was a very good book. I would highly recommend it to children in fifth to eighth grade."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This is the story about a boy named paul who is living in the showdow of his brother Erik Fisher and the Erik Fisher football dream.

Then he moves to Tangerine he makes friends with the toughest group in school, the soccer team. It is here in Tangerine that he finds the strenghth to stand up for himself. H e is finnaly able to stand up to his evil brother when he witnesses him do something awful,and he finnaly uncovers the secret behind his vision. This book fallows the life of the underdog and fallows Paul as he grows as a character to be known as a very tough guy who was kicked out of two schools and to finnaly be seen as something that is great in his parents eyes. This book is good for any one wanting to read it for fun, but on an academic level it is probably best for fifth through seventh graders. There are many very different characters in this book and it can be used as a great charater analysis. It can also be turned into a creative project and have the kids develope There own kind of plant or food like luis in the book. this book can have many creative projects that go along with it and is a very enjoyable book I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Allison L.Contempory/Realistic FictionEdward Blooryoung adultPaul Fisher just moved away from his hometown in Texas to Tangerine, Flordia. Tangerine is a peculiar place where there is no definition of normal. Paul is having trouble adjusting to the new enviroment, not just because he is leagally blind, but because of all the weird events surrounding him. Paul sees lighting strike the same place everyday, a sinkhole destroys his school, and he hangs out with the toughest kids in around. At Tangerine Middle Paul is a good soccer player but is stuck playing back up. Also Erik, Paul's older brother, is hiding something and Paul knows it, but his parents ignore it. Erik is a football star who is the big shot guy and always seems to get his way. This makes and solves many problems. For instance, Paul finding out how he became blind instead of going by the rumor that he looked into a solar eclipse. Coming to Tangerine unlocks many mysterious secrets.I really enjoyed reading \\"Tangerine\\" for many reasons. Edward Bloor made all of the Charaters seem so life like, so the story was very believable. Also I liked how it was sort of a mystery because you are trying to solve and unlock unknown facts. Finally, I enjoyed how Paul wrote flashbacks to relate something that happened in the present to something that happended in the past.In the classroom you could incorperate this book in many ways. You could discuss and do an activity about blindness and how you get around. Also you could do an assignment on lighting and Paul's theroy about it. One activity that I did that was fun was making my own sinkhole. I liked desiging it with practical everyday ingredients and watching it open up."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"In every book I read, I always look for some kind of deep meaning in the context.

It is about a boy, Paul Fisher, who moved to Tangerine County in Florida where countless strange occurrences happen to him. Paul wonders why people live in this town where underground fires burn for years, a sinkhole swallows part of his school, and lightning strikes the same football field everyday around 4:00 PM. Paul does not understand why he has to wear thick glasses all the time because of a mysterious eye injury. Surprisingly, Paul fits in with the toughest group in school, which turns out to be his soccer team.

As story goes, his vision was damaged when he looked into an eclipse. The problem with the story was that Paul doesn't remember doing that. He felt that his brother, Erik, was somehow involved with the Eclipse story.Even before settling down in Tangerine County, Paul realized that his family had brought the same issue to their new home. Paul's brother Erik was a football star, and he hogged almost all of their parents' attention. On the other hand, Paul received little attention for his excellent soccer skills as a goalie.A series of bizarre events eventually led Paul to become a different person with a different lifestyle. But Paul still had a problem to solve. He needed to further change himself and his lifestyle - by finding out the truth. It had been kept from him all these years. And Paul had been looking for it ever since the Eclipse story. Will he find it this time?Join Paul on his quest for the truth.(...)I liked the book Tangerine. It was interesting because the author used many literary techniques to hold your interest and attention. One such literary technique used was suspense. This book was also funny, at times. Sometimes, a character would make a humorous remark.(...)Possible classroom uses are making a sinkhole, learning more about soccer (for those who have limited knowledge of it), vocabulary, questions, quiz/test, character analysis, book report(s), exit or entry slip(s), and project, among others.(...)"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Well first off the whole concept of Tangerine is incredibly cliche. I mean, a boy who's vision was seriously impaired in a tragic accident, yet he still sees better than most people. How touching. No actually I'm sure my view is slightly biased as I read it for school and that automatically makes it lower on my list. But overall it is most definetley a children's book. If you want something like this but MUCH better, try A Mango-Shaped space or Stargirl or even Dancing on the Edge or Born Blue by Han Nolan. If you are way beyond any of these type books I would recommend Perks of being a Wallflower and Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings. Sorry to be so irrelevant but seriously, i'm no crazy person who inexplicably hates good books. I just have high standards and this one did not measure up.

Although a story doesn't neccesarily NEED a climax, this book has so many little climaxes it almost becomes predictible. . . Theme is not well developed and unclear (in my opinon.) Bloor does a very good job of keeping the story exactly the way you would have imagined it. Read this book and you'll see what I mean. . ."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Paul Fisher, AKA Fisher Man, has a not so normal life. Living on top of muck fires and in a termite-infested house with a brother that has everything a child could want, he turned out pretty normal. In the book Tangerine by Edward Bloor, Paul finds a way of life in Tangerine County.I thought Paul's life was not very realistic because there was too much going on at once. His best friend's brother died, his school started melting into a sinkhole, and he gets bullied by everyone. This book needs to have more focus to it other than bullying. How could one kid get beat up by his brother and get teased by the almost the whole county without his parents knowing anything?I have to say it had great detail but I would only recommend it to readers that like soccer and for those who like intense stories."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"It all started one morning when young Paul Fisher was riding his bike home. He was almost home when he heard a car accelerating. When he looked back he saw a car coming straight at him and speeding up. Next he saw a baseball bat come out of the window. As the car got near Pal tried to speed up but his efforts were worthless. Next thing he remembered was the bat taking a swing directly at his head and him diving off of his bike and running home. Who could it have possibly been? Who had tried to kill young Paul Fisher? After a few years Paul and his family moved to Tangerine County, Florida. His father had gotten a new job, his mother had found a neighborhood community job, and his big brother Erik was expected to play a large role in the counties high school football team. While Paul was there he faced many challenges like a tangerine grove freeze and making the high school soccer team because he was legally blind.Later on many strange things started to happen in Paul's peaceful neighborhood like burglaries and deaths. Paul was convinced that his brother Erik had something to do with this. Ever since Erik started hanging out with his friend Arthur Bauer he had changed in a bad way. Through investigation and police involvement they found out that Erik and Arthur were the ones behind the robberies and the murder. I would recommend this exciting and interesting drama to anyone.I like the problem in the story. The main problem with the main character is having to switch schools and make new friends in this new town. But there are also other problems with his brother Erik, his friends, and his family. Erik is an undercover bully who always likes to have it his own way. Erik will do whatever he has to do to get his own way, which sometimes means bullying. Paul has to decide whether he wants to snitch on his brother or just hide his emotions about what Erik is doing to him and his friends. In the end the problems are resolved by Paul switching schools and Eric getting arrested.I also like the mysteries thrown into the story plot. One of them is how Paul became legally blind. His brother and his parents told Paul that he had looked into the sun but later in the story Paul remembers what really happened. While they were living in their old town Erik and his friend did something bad. Somehow Erik's friend got in trouble. So Erik and his friend thought it was Paul who had snitched and they sprayed paint into his eyes. This adds much mystery and suspense to the story.Other then that I also like the setting. The setting caused many problems. Because Paul and his family moved, meaning the setting also changed, Paul had to almost start all over again with school and friends causing a problem. Also because of the climate in the setting all of the groves would freeze once a year. This also caused a problem because Paul had to help by doing whatever he could to keep the trees from freezing to death. The setting intensifies the story making it interesting.I believe that this book is a very fine and entertaining drama. It is also mysterious and suspenseful. I would recommend this book to anyone because of the voice heard in this book. Paul Fisher has to undergo many changes making it hard to put this book down.B.

Erik, Paul's older brother, is wrapped up in his football dreams along with his parents. Despite Paul's blindness, he doesn't let anything get in his way. It seems like ever since the family moved from Houston to Tangerine, everyone and everything was against Paul, but he never gave up. Tangerine is a very weird place, very out of the ordinary. Everything that is weird is considered normal. Including underground fires, lightening everyday at the same time, sinkholes that gobble up schools, and much more. Anything could go wrong in Tangerine.Opinion: I thought this book was boring. It didn't capture my attention too well. Although it did describe every person/event thoroughly, it still wasn't exciting enough to keep me interested. This book is considered realistic-fiction, but it seemed a little too unrealistic. If you enjoy reading things that are not answered or solved until the very end, then this is a book for you. It keeps you guessing the whole way through. If you like more of a realistic book, this isn't a book for you. Most of the events that go on in this book would be unlikely to occur in real life. Tangerine is a book to read for leisure, not for a book report type thing.What are the possible classroom uses?: One thing my class and I did for this book, was a model of a sinkhole. We made it out of dirt, water, graham crackers, and sugar cubes. It was a neat way to see how a sinkhole begins and ends."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"If you are looking for a good book to read, read the book Tangerine.

His parents told the school that his eyes were bad because he looked at the sun.This book is great and a very fun read. Some parts are very funny and happy and others are sad and serious. There are many twists and turns that occur with this guy Paul. This book is very enjoyable. If u want to only ready for 5 minutes you will read for hours.Paul is a very smart and quite guy. He always thinks of flashbacks and what happened in the past. In the beginning of the book he is kind of not sure of him self, but at the end of the book he has changed a lot. He does not show a lot of emotion. For example if some one has passed away, he wouldn't say much.I would recommend this book to mostly every one.

The first half of the book is extremely different then the second half. The back is misleading altogether. It seems that the author wrote the back and the first half with some dark, magical, demonic conspericy going on. The second half gives no explenation to the phenominal events, such as underground fires and litening with a tendency to hit people, and his best friend becomes a jerk abruptly. In the second half, it becomes more of a mystery novel, with Paul trying to figure out why he lost his eyesight, and his friend returns to being a saint. It is a good book though, besides these flaws."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This book contains very disturbing scenes of violence between family members.

This book gave me nightmares."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Sports play a big part in the plot of TANGERINE as the legally blind progagonist, Paul, is a talented soccer player and his games are described in vivid detail. Paul's sinister older brother is a star football player and his adventures as a kicker are also integral to the tale. Yet the book examines many facets of modern suburban life beyond the sports field. The adults who are almost all well developed can be described as ambitious upwardly mobile people who populate pretentious new subdivisions, disdain the natural world on which their \\"mcmansions\\" are built and tend to live through their children. Conflicts between ethnic groups and socioeconomic groups are also well examined. The consequences of unacknowledged misdeeds is a strong theme. Though the individual characters are well drawn and Paul and his friends are very sympathetic the situations include several unlikely natural disasters and tragedies which makes the total story a bit surreal. The book is worth reading as it is well written and appealing to middle school aged students."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"My son is very selective about the books he reads, and does not get easily interested. Often he reads a few pages and then puts the book down. Tangerine grabbed him from the first page and kept him keenly intereseted until the very end.

It had a pretty neat cover and a very good summary. Then I remembered that my friend had recommened it to me. I sat down and read a couple of pages and saw right away that I will be reading and buying this book for sure. It seemed only like i was reading minutes as hours went by so fast.The character in this book is Paul Fisher. He and his family move to Tangerine Florida for buisness. He has a eye problem because he looked at a solar eclipse too long and have to wear thick glasses.His older brother Eric Fisher is a football superstar that could kick 50yard field goals easily. He's the star of his family and school. Paul is not made fun of his glasses because he is good at soccer and is on the soccer team. Paul is a very nice, smart, and kind person inside but has problems with his older brother outside. He knows secrets about his older brother and his friend read to find out more.If I was to recommend this book to anybody, I would. This book is one of the best book I ever read. It has lots of sports, tragedy, excitement, and sports. Boys would like it but, not girls.I recommended this book to all my friends and hoped they like it. This book is like all in one and i have to say that Edward Bloor is a good writer and this book will sell a lot of copies. It is so good it should win several awards. Read this great book, if you don't want to miss out."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW...There are redeeming qualities about this book (which I haven't listed), although I fail to see the exceptional literary aspects in the writing style, grammar, and so forth. There is a lot of interesting, dark foreshadowing, good finally triumphs over bad, people do face consequences of their actions- both good and bad.These redeeming qualities can't remove the impact of the following issues in the book, which are unnecessarily disturbing for children younger than those in 8th grade (where it might be a fairly good book if put in context by the teacher). While this book might be \\"rated\\" for 6th grade, child development experts would tell you a completely different opinion. Consider how the following images would be forever in the mind of your young son or daughter:p2-3: - a black car...man hanging way out...ski mask...holding a long metal baseball bat...like a murder weapon. I heard the roar of the car closing in on me, louder and louder, liked it had smelled its prey. The man in the ski mask leaned farther out the window. He pulled the bat back and up. Then he brought it forward in a mighty swing, right at my head... the baseball bat smashed the mailbox right off its pole. Voices inside the car screamed - animal fury screams - as the mailbox clattered across the street.p. 51-53: football player dies gets hit by lightning (the author makes a point of letting the reader know that this boy was a very good, smart kid)...\\"The whole left side of his hair was burned off. Singed right off...\\" His little brother freaked out and kept trying to take off his brother's shoes.\\" As the two older boys (one being the brother of the main character, Paul) are telling this story, they are having difficulty keeping from laughing about it. Later on (page 113) they make fun of the dead brother to his younger brother who was visiting their house - talking about his \\"mohawk\\" and needing his shoes off.p. 54: The school doesn't acknowledge the event. (note: this isn't even realistic and is the author trying to paint a picture of the school in contrast to the other, poorer school that comes into the story later. Which isn't bad except for the subject matter the author chooses to use.)p. 58: (Note: The amount of deaths due to lightning is frightening and also not realistic. I looked up the data on lightning in the Florida region; FL does get an extraordinary amount of lightning, but the author highly exaggerates the facts - again, very Stephen King-ish) Simple lightning rods, available and known since Ben Franklin, would solve the problem. This would be very frightening for the reader.)p. 80: Large sinkholes under several temporary school buildings. Kids almost die when they holes collapse and suck everything down into it. (Stephen King-ish, again.)p. 113: see above pgs 51-53, taunting younger brother about older brother's death.p. 158: two children in area die of encephalitis from the mosquitos in the area - the author just throws this into the story. Again, this many deaths in the area is absolutely an exaggeration and frightening for no purpose other than the author to continually paint an \\"evil\\" picture. (Stephen King, again.)p. 211: The friend of the older brother takes a weapon, called a Blackjack (which I learned about for the first time in this book), and proceeds to hit another kid from behind directly in the head. After a few days, the boy hit with the weapon dies of a brain hemorrhage and the two bad kids are eventually charged and put in jail for manslaughter.p. 263: Paul remembers his brother and his brother's friend who punished him when he was 5 years old for telling on them for spraying paint on a wall, \\"And I remembered Erik's fingers prying my eyelids open while Vincent Castor sprayed white paint into them. They left me screaming and rolling around on the floor of the garage.\\" Paul's mom and dad know what happened and keep it a secret from Paul, so he won't hate his brother. That is somewhat reasonable, except they go onto ignore the situation and not do anything to, or for, the older brother - no treatment, etc. In fact, the book makes it a point of the older brother being \\"favored\\" by the dad.p. 279: Parents find out older boy and friend have stolen many items from neighbors. The fathers state they will return items and have kids perform restitution, but want the neighbors to not press charges. The author frames the story in a way that the parents are putting the sport of \\"football\\" as a higher priority - even though the father knows about his son's tendencies and this behavior isn't an anomaly.End of book: Older brother is thrown in jail. Parent's feel bad about how they acted in favoring the older brother and keeping secrets from Paul. Paul's happy about how things are turning out for him - he's on his favorite soccer team with his friends and his mom buys him a bunch of new clothes. He has a new sense of courage and good feeling about himself.REALLY?

However, the further I read, the more intriguing it became. This book would be well-suited for young teens. Older readers will also enjoy reading this, especially if they remember themselves at the age of thirteen.What I most enjoyed about this story was 'watching' Paul grow from an awkward 'wuss' into a young man with strong character. It was also gratifying to see that the characters had to face consequences for their actions.My only criticism is of the unrealistic references to Paul's IEP. Being a special educator, I am well aware that there is more to an IEP than a piece of paper acknowledging an impairment."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"The Adventures of Paul Fisher in Tangerine\\"This is Florida? This is what it looks like?\\" Paul Fisher says as he enters Tangerine County, Florida, his new home. Paul Fisher is an eleven-year-old boy who is unaware of his what his \\"new\\" life in Tangerine County is going to be like. Paul is an amazing soccer player but never gets any attention from his parents, especially his dad, because they are obsessed with the \\"Eric Fisher Football Dream (the \\"dream\\" is that Eric will become a renowned pro football player and attend a good college).\\" Bloor introduces a character that's intelligent and eager to learn more. Sometimes Paul doesn't want to know the things that he finds out, but in the end Paul finds out the truth about his life and Eric's life.Edward Bloor is a great writer who has written a fabulous book for people with all interests! Tangerine is a phenomenal book that has many wonderful characteristics (it is very descriptive, informative, and interesting). I realized that I can relate to many characters in Tangerine, and you can too. Bloor mixes together sports, friendship troubles, rivalry, adaptation, and mystery to make the unforgettable story, Tangerine! I can not think of a single person who wouldn't enjoy Edward Bloor's amazing writing.Bloor has allowed kids to jump inside another person's life. Tangerine lets kids stop thinking about the world around them and escape into what they are reading. I know that I love reading, but Tangerine was the cherry on my ice cream sundae!- I. S.

He was not very descriptive and didn't keep my attention."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"This book was a required reading assignment for my 7th grade son. It gave him nightmares and every time he thinks about the book a year later it makes him physically shudder and hold his stomach. If books had a rating system like movies do the violence and intensity of this book should earn it an R rating.In addition to the violence and horror, the book has absolutely no literary value. It does not contain layers waiting to be peeled back. It does not include beautifully crafted language. There are no symbols to understand. It has no historical value. This book is graphic violence for the sake of graphic violence. It is engaging and will hold you captive to the end, but you will not come away from reading this book a better person. You will have learned nothing, nor will you have grown in any way. This book is repugnant, and should not be required reading at any level."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I was forced to read Tangerine when in 6th grade because of a reading compotation. I started out thinking this could be an interesting and good book to read. It started out weird and continued to get weirder the more I read. The idea to me was just plain stupid. What's with the lightning? I didn't get book even though I read it through. It was painful to finish no offense to the author but pick something else to write about in future. I was turned away from the book, after the first few chapters. Honestly, it took me two months to read this book when I took me a week to read each of the other books I had to read for the read-off, one of the books was over 300 pages and it took me, an avid reader, a few days to finish. This type of book could appeal to others but it was not my favorite book of all time. Actually, I hated it. The only part I liked was when the main character's brother fell onto his butt and I actually enjoyed the soccer games, and soccer is my least favorite sport. That takes a lot bad writing for me to like the soccer parts. Bleh, don't read it, tread lightly if you do and if you are thinking of purchasing it, don't. Get it out of the library and read it later.All and all, it's on my hate list."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I hated this book with all my hate. How I dicovered it, you ask? Well, it was in school Reading class, in the middle of the year. We were assigned for book clubs. My book club partner insisted a book about sports. I hate books about sports (or just sports in general, with the exception of baseball) , but he kept reccomending fictional sports books. I turned down all of the books, until one sparked my interest. That book was called 'Tangerine' by the author 'Edward Bloor'. It looked like my book at first, because the blurb was very pointed at mystery rather than sports. In fact, there was absolutely no mentions of sports whatsoever in the blurb, so I agreed, and took a crack at it.Big mistake.This awful excuse for a book was the most diabolical piece of garbage I have and most likely will ever read in my short life. How my partner had any idea that this was a sports book was and still is beyond my understanding. It just seems that he tricked me into reading a book with a topic I hate as the main topic itself. The book was too focused on sports rather than the mystery that is explained in the blurb. The characters were just plain bland, especially Erik. Who wants to read about an emotionless, talkless bafoon who does nothing but play football from 12:00 PM to 8:00 AM? No one I know, most likely, except for my book club partner, who shall remain unnamed throughout this review. There was almost no dialouge whatsoever in the book. None of the characers had a personality, not even the main character. The only decent characer in the book was probably Luis Cruz; He was possibly the only character that did anything in the entire book, and he sort of reminded me of myself. It's too bad that he had to *SPOILER ALERT* die in the book. My least favorite character was probably Dad, right up there with Erik. The Dad (just named Mr. Fisher, bland,) is an angry idiot with no personality whatsoever and only cares about Erik winning his football games. I have never seen a character as low as that in any work of fiction in my entire short years of life. Another decent characer was Joey Costello, and not because he has the same first name as me, but because he did anything it took to take care and stand up for he people he cared about. THAT is what I, and many oher people, call the work of a strong spirit and heart. I will say that the book had it's decent moments, when the time that Paul (the main character) thought up of something about 'a pissed off zombie' when he was lying in bed in the middle of the beggining of the book. The time were Erik *SPOILER ALERT* was accused of killing Luis Cruz was very suspensful. Other than that, the book was utter garbage. Not reccomended.2/5"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"i am an eighth grade student and we read this book together as a class. It was so boring and didn't have a catchy story-line. You couldn't relate to anything in this book because everything bad happened. Out of now where people would die and Paul would get the blame for it. I don't recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. Even if your teacher suggests this book to you, do not waste your time reading it."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Does his brother have the thrill to kill? While reading Tangerine by Edward Bloor you will wonder why a boy's twelth grade brother likes to have people killed.Paul Fisher is a well-behaved kid who has an eye disorder. When Paul's family moved from Texas to Florida, problems began to occur with Paul's older brother, Eric. Paul will soon learn about his past and what has happened to his eyes.After reading the whole book you will realize that it is a horrible book. It tells a good story but is written badly. When I say this I mean that the plot is not clearly explained and it's hard to follow. I think it's hard to follow because the story was written weirdly, and a lot of people could tell.I didn't like this book because I couldn't relate to the characters. To me, the characters weren't deep enough.Paul never really showed his emotion as far as when he was hurting on the inside. For example, the only time Paul showed his emotion was when Luis died I could tell that it hurt him. In other parts, Paul didn't show his emotion when things happened. It made you feel as if someone was reading the book to you from across the room.Another reason I didn't like this book was because it wasn't realistic. I say that because of how the characters were killing each other in high school. It does happen in the world but not that often.I highly recommend this book for younger children between the ages of 7&9 because they are easily influenced when it comes to fake things."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"Tangerine is one of my summer reading books.

But seriously, you cant expect the majority of your students to relate the Ed's story. Your student is a digital native, a gamer, a technophile with very little time. Get in touch with your students.

I would teach this in a middle school or high school reading class as it is written with a voice that would capture the readers of that age. It sure caught mine! I couldn't put it down. Bloor does a fantastic job of bringing his characters alive and giving them their own believable voice. He deals with racism, truth, fear, bravery, and normal school items that would hit home with many students. And, he does it in almost a haunting way. He almost made me afraid, not horrorlike, but afraid of being human, weak, an outsider. The way he writes about the affluent community and his mom's &quot;worries&quot;, such as the neighbor with too many lightning rods on his house, is splendid.The humor is sophisticated. There is a ton of stuff to talk about. The school gets sucked into a sinkhole, people are killed, the &quot;muck&quot; fires and mosquitoes plague the community and you love the protagonist.

At one of his brothers football practices a boy died from being struck. One day it was very rainy and there was a sinkhole right underneath the school. It swallowed the school and so Paul had to go to a different school called Tangerine Middle.

Paul Fisher, a legally blind seventh grader who excels at soccer moves to Tangerine, Florida, with his family. His father's life revolves around the football stardom of Paul's older brother Erik. His mother is mainly concerned with community standards in their upper-class housing development, which is plagued by daily lightning strikes, smoke from a perpetual fire, and mosquito swarms. After half of his suburban middle school is swallowed by a giant sinkhole, Paul finds his place at the more urban Tangerine Middle, where he makes the soccer team and becomes friends with its stars whose families work the citrus groves that are threatened by developments like the one in which he lives.

In the middle of the chaos is Paul, a visually impaired soccer goalie, with a mischievous older brother and a shady past. Throughout the story, Paul learns new things about Tangerine, as well as himself, his friends, and his family. Edward Bloor incorporated many different themes in to the story, including disapiontment, sadness, satisfaction, peace, hope, sports, disaster, and love. Paul, from whose point of view the story is written, goes through many different emotions and copes with them all in different ways. As you are reading Tangerine, you feel like you are a part of Paul and are trying to solve the same mysteries and problems as he is.I think Tangerine is a very powerful book, in that it makes you think about yourself in a new light and what you would do in different scenarios. It is not difficult to read which keeps the plot moving along smoothly. I never found the book to be boring or dull. Don't judge this book by the first chapter, though, because it gets better. The soccer games are vivid and exciting. Edward Bloor uses so much imagery and detail that those scenes became some of my favorite parts in the story.

I didn't read this story until just this past week and I finished it just this morning at 1:33 am in a hotel room in Milwaukee.This story is one I would recommend to anyone and everyone. Whether you're a girl, boy, kid, or parent, each and every scene in Tangerine is engaging and exciting. In the end, the finely tuned characters - complete with their own oddities and origins - help Paul Fisher (the aspiring soccer player who is both narrator and main character of Tangerine) piece together his past and make sense of his life.

Saving tangerines from a frost, making new friends he never thought he could get along with, and finding out the truth about his older brother, Paul begins to gain faith in himself. What else happens to Paul? Read this book to find out!This book was pretty good. The beginning was a little slow and hard to understand but once the story started I got sucked in. Edward Bloor has an interesting style of writing that includes the use of many literary devices. Most of the characters were people I could relate to. Paul had common problems with family and friends. All in all, I thought Tangerine was a good book.Our class did many experiments and projects with this book. We demonstrated what a sinkhole may look like using graham crackers, sugar cubes, soil, and water. Also we did character analysis' on some of the characters. You can do a lot with the character's because they are very realistic. Some other activities you could do are icing tangerines to keep them at a safe temparature, play a game of soccer or football, and playacting a scene from the book."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"TangerineEdward BloorScholastic publishingTangerine is by Edward Bloor.

The boys name is Paul and his brother is Erik. It is the mystery of why Paul has these thick lense glasses when his eyes were fine a little while ago. Plus there are a bunch of mini mysteries in between. This book is fiction.It takes place in Tangerine, Florida. Tangerine is a pretty weird place, there are always lighting storms at 4:00 p.m. every day and just behind their new house that they just moved into is a huge muck fire. A muck fire is where there is a field of coal that is on fire and the inferno never goes out. It also creates smoke year round so that can get annoying. During this part of the book Paul starts playing for the Lake Windsor Middle soccer team, and Erik starts his reign as star place kicker for Lake Windsor High.This book is about the rivalry of brothers (Erik and Paul). It also teaches you to never give up. But mostly it is about Paul who is nice, accepts others, and makes the right decisions. Then there's Erik who is mean, cruel, and doesn't care about the well being of others. Now Paul always wonders why he has these thick lense glasses when he knows he's not blind, even though that's what everyone thinks. So he's having these flashbacks getting closer and closer to the reason why he has these glasses, and finally he sees the answer but it doesn't suprise him.I think that it is a pretty good book for people that like slow moving mysteries. The beginning is slow but has lot's of details then the middle and end start to speed up. as Paul is having these flashbacks getting closer and closer to the main mystery, other things are happening such as robbery's and no one knows who is doing them."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"TANGERINELightening strikes more than once in Tangerine!Tangerine is the story of timid, twelve-year-old Paul Fisher and his family, which includes his evil older brother, who Paul loathes. Paul has just moved to Tangerine, Florida, where he must discover the horrible truth about his family. We can guarantee Paul's search will keep you guessing until the very end. Tangerine kept us on the edges of our seats for the entire novel.In addition to suspense, Tangerine is full of sidesplitting laughs, as well as morals and wisdom for young adults. Tangerine's themes include true friendship, brotherhood, loyalty, honesty, self-confidence, being who you are and being okay with who you are.Paul's story is written in journal entries from his seventh grade year. Therefore, it's really easy to understand the timeline and how the action fits together. Mr. Bloor, the author, also constructed the characters in such a way that we feel we see these characters every day. The setting is awesome for all the changes that occur in Tangerine. A citrus grove is a fitting place for growth both in nature and within yourself! The main conflict facing Paul in his raging battle for the truth (and all smaller conflicts) comes together so well in the novel's resolution that the end left us speechless. The pace is always fast and stirs up nonstop curiosity, which makes Tangerine impossible to put down.Our eighth grade communication skills teacher read aloud Tangerine in class and even though our class meets after lunch, Tangerine kept us awake.Tangerine is a must-read for ages eight to one hundred and eight. It's definitely on the top of our book list.Tangerine reminds us of Holes by Louis Sachar. Both Paul and Stanley must discover the truth about themselves and the deceitful people around them. If you like Holes, you'll absolutely love Tangerine!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"\\"The truth shall set you free\\"...That quote is at the center of this magnificent novel by Edward Bloor. The book tells the mysterious story of Paul Fisher, a teenaged soccer player who moves with his family to Tangerine, Florida so that his football-star brother, Erik, can receive more press attention. To everyone except Paul, Erik is the wonderboy of the family; the one who can do no wrong. Paul is the only one who sees what his brother really is- a monster. As the story progresses, more and more details are revealed. What is the real reason Paul is legally blind and is forced to wear thick glasses? What really happened to a local hero that would make him drop dead?

When I pulled it from the shelf, the cover immediately grabbed me and after reading the summary on its back, I was instantly intruiged. So, I bought it. I didn't read this story until just this past week and I finished it just this morning at 1:33 am in a hotel room in Milwaukee.This story is one I would recommend to anyone and everyone. Whether you're a girl, boy, kid, or parent, each and every scene in Tangerine is engaging and exciting. In the end, the finely tuned characters - complete with their own oddities and origins - help Paul Fisher (the aspiring soccer player who is both narrator and main character of Tangerine) piece together his past and make sense of his life. This calls for a number of exciting climaxes and revelations that make Edward Bloom's debut shine \\"like a golden dawn.\\"This was a fabulous find and an even more fabulous read.

His happiest times are spent on the field playing goalie. When he moves to Lake Windsor, Florida, and learns that his handicap may keep him off the school team, he is in despair.When a sinkhole swallows part of his new school, Paul has the opportunity to transfer to a school across town, where he can perhaps play for the soccer team. That school, Tangerine Middle, is quite different from the Lake Windsor school. The students are mostly from working-class families who live in Quonset huts, rather than upper-middle class families who populate the brand-new developments of Lake Windsor. At first, Paul is wary about fitting in, until he starts to realize the flaws in the world of his family and their friends.Paul begins to ask some tough questions: Why was the Lake Windsor school built on unstable ground? Why do the expensive Lake Windsor homes have so many problems? Why does his own family keep so many secrets, especially about his older brother, Erik, who is on his way to becoming a football star but has a worrisome mean streak?As Paul presses to find answers to these questions and others, he uncovers layers of deception and some terrible, wonderful truths.

It really made you think. It was a real page turner, and I finished the whole book in less than two days. My teacher later read the book to my class. Everyone really seemed to enjoy the book. I would recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"There were two story lines in the book. The first story involved Paul Fisher. Paul is a good soccer player but no one in his family seemed to notice. He really wanted to fit in and make friends at his new school. In his old school he was not popular and did not make goalie on his soccer team. In his new school he makes the soccer team but was then told by his coach he had to leave the team. The coach said that the schools insurance would not cover him because of his vision problems. Then the school was swallowed by a sinkhole, which allowed him to attend the Tangerine Middle School. He begged his mom to throw out the IEP paperwork when she transferred him. If the new school did not know about his IEP and he made the soccer team, he would be able to play. This is the only time his mom really listens to him and she does it. He did make the team and looked forward to playing. They even said that he could be the substitute goalie. Tangerine Middle School was a tough school, but he was able to make friends. He learned what it meant to stand up for yourself and your friends.The other part of the story was about his brother Eric and the \\"Eric Fisher Football Dream\\". Eric was a star football player and always had been. That was the biggest part of why they moved was to allow Eric to get scouted for college scholarships. Eric was not a nice person. He was very popular because he intimidated everyone. If he did not like you or if you did not like him, he or his friends would beat you up. As the book goes on you find out that Eric is why Paul has vision problems. You also find out that Eric and his best buddy Arthur Bauer get into some trouble. Things don't always appear, as they seem. On the outside Eric was a good football player, the all American kid. He also was a mean person with a very dark side and a thief.This was a good book it had some funny stories, and as you can see some sad. I liked this book a lot. There was always something happening a real page-turner. You really get to know the characters.

Read the book and I'm sure you'll agree, &quot;Tangerine&quot; is a book not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"TANGERINE is a surreal novel strong in pacing and character development. From the opening page to the very end, Edward Bloor takes the reader on a breakneck course through one family's conflict with the past and its devastating impact on the present. Paul Fisher's nightmare experiences in the shadow of his older brother come to a climax after the family moves from Houston to Tangerine, Florida, a fallen Eden of sorts. He narrates his experiences in the new community with intensity and passion regarding the problems they face. A tension remains until the very end.Paul is an outsider from the very beginning. He is the younger brother of teen football legend, Erik Fisher. Their father dotes on Erik, living out his own frustrated athletic dreams in a sad, pathetic manner. Their mother endures their father, holding the family together with equal parts denial, busy-ness, and critical intensity. She is hyper-involved in all of the family's business, a contrast to her husband, who is focused solely on Erik's success on the field. Both deliberately turn a blind eye to Erik's moral failings, which include a propensity for violence and a complete lack of empathy for others. He is a textbook sociopath and the world merely a gaggle of potential victims.Bloor guides the reader through the novel's 300-plus pages building upon each character with incident upon incident that reveals their true nature and failings. Paul and his parents are forced to face their own cowardice and complicity at several key junctures of the story, particularly during the break-ins and the events that led to the death of Luis Cruz. Facing their failings leaves them broken, but broken for potential rebirth as a better family unit.The novel's message builds upon itself through the evolution of each character: burying a wrong under a bushel of denial takes a terrible toll.Highly recommended. 5 Stars!Reviewed by: Mark Frye, author and reviewer"},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"I thought Tangerine was a weird book. The book started off very good, and I thought it would end up being one of my favorites, but the ending was lacking and incomplete. The plot was okay. The characters were well developed, which I liked. The setting played an important role in the so-so plot. I found it difficult to find a theme in this story. I thought, that overall this book was okay, but I definitly wouldn't bother to waste my time reading it again, nor do I really recommend you read it."},{"Title":"Tangerine","review":"The book Tangerine is about a new boy named Paul, who is new in the town of Tangerine.

This book is always full of action. Paul is either in an exciting soccer game, or is working and solving his problems, like his eyesight and friends. I think the reason I enjoyed this book so much is, I could relate to him. I play soccer, so I knew how he felt about pressure, and I also had to move to a new town, and understand how hard it is.

I'm glad I did because I'm moved. As adults we like to think our kids are acting out &#34;because they are just being kids.&#34; When do we stop accepting inappropriate and bad behavior and how can we best address it? That was the intense, but again moving comes into play. I am not ashamed to say I cried.

This book has it all--mystery, suspense, crime, natural phenomena (basically the 10 plagues), and family drama. It doesn't have a love story, which is just fine for boys reading YA novels. As a woman, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. It's action packed and I didn't want to put it down from the first page.

It was the most frightening place I'd ever lived, full of the same scary characters. This captures a lot of the low level psychopathy under the nice all-American boys, and the natural disasters that plague their housing development - well, we almost had rains of frogs where we moved from paving over their swamps, so I'm not sure it's an exaggeration.

She tells a good story. Yet, she states myth as well as many of her own personal opinions and theories as if they are facts, when they really aren't. This book is also highly misleading and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under the age of 18 since I think that the lessons in this book could be damaging to a younger person who hasn't developed their own beliefs and ethics yet.Conway seems to be very intolerant towards men. She also seems to be very intolerant towards Orthodox religion and even states that one cannot be both say Wiccan and Christian. Most of the book bashes on Christianity. I really think that people need to find what works for them and do what makes them feel comfortable and happy. Conway also condones using grey magick against evil entities and evil people, which I really don't agree with as it's not the Wiccan way.Why is Conway writing a book on Wicca when she's not even Wiccan? She describes herself on her online social media profiles and in interviews as Pagan, not Wiccan.I really am trying to read it cover to cover, but I find myself constantly being upset by how inaccurate this book is."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"This is now my fourth copy.

Conway is an interesting book, to say the least. If you are new to Wiccan studies and instruction books, please pick up a copy ofWicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner (Includes Author's Book of Shadows). There you will discover a much better and more accurate look at history as well as a less biased look at the role that the God and Goddess play.She has reduced the God to little more than a good lay for the Goddess, which is completely inaccurate. Her feminism would do well to duck its head when she works on an instructional text, to say the least.It is however, a handy reference material, offering nicely presented correspondence lists as well as alphabets in the back. To tell the truth, with the slim pickings of books in my area, it was a nice buy only to get the compilation of information in the back."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"This is by far the worst book I have ever read on the craft. With such falsities as wicca being an ancient matriachal religion, and that wicca is goddess based, it is a wonder this hasn't gotten worse reviews. I have read books by this author before and enjoyed them, but if you are looking for a good book about wicca I would suggest Cunningham's guide for a solitary practitioner. When you get past the intorduction about the craft and get into the rest of the book, such as nature spirits and other invisible helpers, and the book of spells the content is more barible, but not deffinatly not worth the price of this book. If you are still interested take a trip to you local book store and read a few sections before you buy it. I wish I would have."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"I have read many books on Wicca and Neo-Paganism over the past 3 years, so I am speaking from comparison. This book is very well-organized and a &quot;pretty&quot; looking book. It is encyclopedic in style in that things are organized by subject and if you're trying to look up a specific ritual or spell, it can be easily found, unlike many of the other books I've read on Wicca. However, I find the tone of it to be too dry and unfeeling. I can't get a clear impression about DJ Conway, nor her personal feelings about the Craft, so the book doesn't really move me. There is no humor about this book either, which leaves me feeling kind of dull. I have enjoyed her &quot;Moon Magic&quot; book, and use it again and again, mostly as a reference book as I'll probably use this book. Much of the information in &quot;Wicca&quot; can be found in other books that are written in a more amusing and interesting style."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"I believe the author, D. J. Conway has gotten a bad rap given some of the material she's put out in recent years. There were only two books by this author that I really wasn't disappointed in. Moon Magick and The Ancient Shining Ones. I am glad that Wicca, The Complete Craft is another one I can add on my shelf and not feel silly about. Even if one DOES dance with dragons, it's not something that should be written about if you ask me...but then that's my opinion.Wicca, The Complete Craft really IS comprehensive. The chapters are broken down in a formula of ascending importance. I found some of her references a bit frustrating because she doesn't list page numbers. While I found the material in this book digestible in theory and practice, I cannot in truth say if all her references are intact. That will take a bit of research on my part or on the part of any other serious practioner that doesn't want get caught in an 'oops!!' situation in quoting something that doesn't exist. Believe me, it's happened. There are no listed references for any of the stones or herbal correspondences, though most are well known enough that it no longer matters. Still, one would like to know just whom the author patronized for knowledge when SHE was learning enough to fill a book this size with. To be honest, though, I would recommend this book long before I would some of the other more popular books by authors who think ALL children should be measured by the manners, maturity, and aptitude their own children may possess. I agree with Ms. Conway that to teach teenagers magick cannot be ethical because most lack the emotional maturity to make sound decisions involving the practice of good manners let alone the practice of magick.A good all around reference guide, but by no means the be all and end all to Wicca or Witchcraft reference. Worth the money."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"I have many books and only a few that can be considered \\"complete guides.\\" This one tops my list for a reference.

This book covers the basics of Wicca for beginners. Like Ellen Dugan's books, it's written in a friendly tone. The material is helpful, but I didn't like think the order it was presented in was the most logical. I also thought some of the material needed to be discussed a little more in depth, though for beginners or for research material, this book is a good starting point."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"This book gives an introduction to a broad range of topics. The explanations are complete enough to provide a basic understanding of the topic, without being completely overwhelming. That said, it is not a good teaching tool by itself (I have a Bachelors in Music Education and have taught school K - 12, so I do have some expertise in this area). It seems as if would make a good reference guide, but as a book, it's rather, well, boring. I have little experience with Wicca, so I am not qualified to comment on the factual aspects of the book, but most of what Conway says fits in fairly well with the few other books I have read on the subject; however, certain other aspects of the book cast doubt upon her reliability.Her historical accuracy, for instance, leaves much to be desired. I am no historian, but many of the assertions the author makes prove to be untrue. For one example, she claims that all truly ancient civilizations were matriachies, but then evil patriarchies invaded and wiped those civilizations from history. To support this, she cites the work of Johann Jakob Bachofen. Bachofen was a sociologist/anthropologist who lived and worked in the nineteenth century, before the debut of modern anthropological tools and methods, and his work has since been refuted or debunked. Nevertheless, Conway uses him as the basis for some of her claims. This is analagous to claiming that the sun revolves around the earth on the basis that Aristotle believed it. This level of stretching for facts is the rule rather than the exception, at least in the historical section. The academic research in this book is a complete joke.This writing is also strongly biased against men in general and Christianity in particular. In her chapter, \\"The History of Wicca\\", she writes that patriarchy - and by extension, men - are responsible for all the ills of society in the entire history of the human race.When Christianity enters the picture, the book leaves Wicca entirely to spend most of the rest of the chapter blasting Christianity, a theme that continues throughout the rest of the book. This book will take any chance imaginable to blast Christianity - and only Christianity. It is clearly not horribly opposed to monotheism in general; in fact it avoids the subjects of Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam completely. Instead, it says such things as, \\"The deities and ideas of any ancient culture except Christianity can be grafted onto Wicca, thus forming a legitimate form of Witchcraft.\\" The book only ever refers to Christianity negatively, and never makes any other reference to other monotheistic faiths.Let me make it clear here that I am not a Christian, and that I bear the religion no love. It has caused more damage in my life than all other influences combined. Nevertheless, a bias like one shown by this book has no place in what claims to be an instructional guide for beginners.To the author's credit, she states at the beginning that this book reflects only her opinions of Wicca, and that other Witches will have differing opinions. However, while allowing for more flexibility than a book that claims to be complete, undeniable fact, this only grants a certain degree of latitude in the things that can be claimed without falling into the territory of academic dishonesty, and that is this book's major failing.In summary, this book has some good points, but there are better to be had for twenty bucks."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"I bought this after reading through one that my friend owned. I think that it is a good primer for anyone who wants to educate themselves on the beliefs and practices of Wicca. It touches on several areas of magic work and has a decent amount of depth. I would recommend this very strongly for anyone who is interesting in starting out, but needs a launching point. This is one of the best books out there."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"While this book certainly is not \\"the definitive\\" Wiccan book (as if there was such a thing), it certainly offers a wealth of information about this ancient religion. This book was mentioned to me as a great place to learn more about \\"the Craft,\\" in fact the person who first told me about it called it a \\"Wiccan textbook.\\" While someone not new to Wicca may find this book covers a lot of material mentioned elsewhere, someone new to this as I am will find this book fascinating.What I liked about this book was that it provides a very nice overall reference to Wicca, which as someone new to this religion is something very important to me. There is a tremendous amount of information in this book, in fact at times it was almost overwhelming. Among areas covered are examples of rituals for various Sabats, handfasting, and Drawing Down the Moon and Sun, herbs, essential oils, candles, words and terms used in Wicca, pantheons of Gods and Goddesses of different cultures, nature spirits, and so on. Reading through this book gave me a sense that the information contained within it can be a source of \\"great power\\" if used correctly.As I said before, this may not be \\"the one true Wiccan book,\\" and those with some knowledge may already know most of what in here, but still I found it to be an excellent guide to Wicca."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"I can't say enough about this super informative writing. Never before have I encountered all of the information that he has packed into one solid book before. It dispels myths and legends in all aspects, defines Wicca and Pagan Pantheons, and gives us new and incredible ideas to \\"conjure\\" into our own practices! It's written so it is easy to understand for those new to the subject, yet has the \\"Elders\\" of us riveted so we can't put the book down!!!! ..."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"Wicca: The Complete Craft covers the basics of Witchcraft but also deals with Advanced Topics such as elementals, the astral plane, and a little bit of astrology, albeit only briefly. As such, I don't think this is a good beginner's book, but it is definitely worth reading after you've advanced in the Craft a little bit (two beginner books would be a good guide)Though the main reason why you shouldn't read this first is because it subscribes to faulty Murray history of Witchcraft, even though it such \\"history\\" has already been disproven decades ago. Another annoying thing would be her radical feminism as shown by her blatant downplaying of the God and the elevation of the Goddess. While I do realize that Wicca is a Goddess-centric religion, I was nonetheless vexed by such tactlessness. And while not as pronounced, Ms Conway obviously has some beef with Christianity that she needs dealing with. Her biases make this book a little bit too opinionated for academic comfort.In light of all that, I was supposed to rate it a 2 or a 3, so you might be wondering why I gave it a 4. Simple, the book is worth reading. It is packed with information including, but not limited to: a diverse list of gods and goddesses (although I do wish she allotted some space for the Chinese & Japanese pantheons), a long herbal correspondence that lists common names, Wiccan names and scientific names, a planetary correspondence (complete with day & hour ephemeris), incense and oil correspondence, tables of magical script, and a very extensive list of rituals and spells which contains a lot of well designed material.Final Verdict. The book is packed with information. Some material may be dubitable(the history part obviously so), but this book serves as a nice supplemental reference, and it may serve as an introduction to more advanced topics."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"I picked up a copy of this because of the number of people telling me that this was so much better than Conway's other poorly-done books. After reading it, I strongly disagree!!Beginning in the introduction, when she incorrectly states that \\"the words Wicca, Witchcraft and the Craft are actually interchangeable\\", there is very little here that can't be found in dozens of other phoney McWicca-lite introductory texts.Her history is based on the myth that there was once a peaceful matriarchy, and everyone worshipped \\"the Goddess\\" until evil patriarchy came along and spoiled everything. She would do well to actually read some of the accurate archeological works listed in her bibliography!She then proceeds to confuse the term \\"Paganism\\". In spite of the way she misuses the word, \\"Paganism\\" is actually a large group of related, but highly dissimilar religious. It is not a single path \\"based on a specific pantheon of deities\\", and there are certainly more than \\"only a few differences between Wicca and Paganism, besides the difference in their ages\\". (And NO religion can be dated back to the Stone Age! NO ONE knows what beliefs existed then, what their 'religious' practices were, or even if they HAD any religious beliefs!) She also defines many Traditions within Wicca inaccurately, and shows little understanding of the history of Wicca, or the various practices that define it's many branches.When speaking of Deities, she first states that Wicca is polytheistic, then proceeds to \\"explain\\" that all Gods are a reflection of a single God archetype, and even the Gods are subservient to the Goddess. (That's not polytheism.) She also speaks of Triple aspects of Goddess, saying that this is a universal concept, and that it has been recognized \\"from the beginning of religion\\". This is untrue. (She has quite a habit of stating historical \\"facts\\" that are contrary to the archeological evidence, without saying where she is obtaining her \\"information\\". She also frequently speaks of conclusions of how found items were used or what they signify that are very different from what the scholars who are trained to interpret such finds conclude. Especially when the archeologists determine that NO conclusions can be made from the evidence available.)In my opinion, Ms Conway's version of \\"wicca\\" is a blend of New Age thought, Ceremonial Magic influence, and poor research. While I don't doubt that it could be used to create a viable and valid spiritual path, it bears little relation to actual Wicca. If one wishes to learn about Wicca, I would strongly suggest starting with A Witch Alone by Marian Green, then moving to books such as Gerald Gardner's recently republished classics. No, it won't be as easy as what Ms. Conway has written... but *real* Wicca cannot be condensed into a 400-page how-to manual."},{"Title":"Wicca: The Complete Craft","review":"This book is good for everything.

Unlike other medieval Arabic texts that are more or less straightforward -- hence translatable -- Ibn Arabi is an exception. The anti-systematic nature of his thought compounded by its deep interconnection with the Arabic language renders translations almost impossible.The Great Shaikh's hermeneutics of Islamic Scripture (the Koran and Prophetic traditions) is at once mystical and linguistic. Mystical through kashf, (lit. 'unveiling,' a type of spiritual opening to knowledge), and linguistic through retracing each Divinely revealed word to its etymological root. To a reader unfamiliar with either mystical philosophy or classical Arabic, understanding Ibn Arabi can be excrutiatingly difficult. A natural response is to question the source of Ibn Arabi's radically subversive worldview.Taking these factors into consideration, Chittick should be commended in undertaking a task so academically daunting that it prevented even an Orientalist of R.A. Nicholson's repute from publishing his own translations.Chittick is meticulous in his translations and tries to be loyal to both the literal and implied meanings of technical Arabic words. He introduces each translated section with a brief summary to acquaint the reader what s/he is about encounter, simplifying the complexity of the passage and contexualising it within the (fluid) framework of Ibn Arabi's nondualistic ontology.Finally, it should be noted that Chittick's other major work in the field of Akbarian scholarship, the Sufi Path of Knowledge: Ibn Arabi's Metaphysics of Imagination, makes an excellent introduction to this work. SDG is not easy reading, so preliminary works might be useful before jumping full fledge into Ibn Arabi's &quot;ocean without shore&quot; of mystical metaphysics. In strange and unfamiliar waters, the weight of ignorance can drown. But the ultimate ignorance, as Ibn Arabi would say, is not that of books written by the dead -- for &quot;the servant is nonexistent!&quot; -- but of the Living (al-Hayy) who reveals Himself through the cosmos around us, through His Self-Disclosure."},{"Title":"SELF-DISCLOSURE OF GOD : PRINCIPLES OF IBN AL-'ARABI'S COSMOLOGY","review":"The 40 page introduction is a good summary overview of Ibn Arabi's metaphysics.

I don't think God meant for the religion to be as serious as we have taken it. Surely if this thing was supposed to be serious we would have had more guidelines. We keep saying that Quran is a Light, last I checked light meant clarity and lack of confusion. Quran has generated anything but clarity and lack of confusion. It is said that this book is guide for all eternity, it has layers and layers of meaning, etc. Ok, that is fine but what use is it to us? If one studies the history of Islamic thoughts , one discovers that almost everyone disagrees with everyone else. Everyone is ex-communicating everyone else. There is so much commentary written on this book and each one is nothing but a best &quot;guess&quot; as to what the intention or meaning of a certain verse is. Sufis say one thing, philosophers say another, jurisprudents say something else and each condemn the other ones for misleading people and not understanding the true intention of the word of god. This is a clear proof that religion wasn't meant to be taken seriously, maybe god is messing up with our heads or maybe he is running an experiment on human stupidity. But one thing is clear, if this book and this business of religion was serious he would have provided us with better guidelines. So lets not make a big deal out of something that is by its very nature ambiguous and &quot;Dark&quot;."},{"Title":"SELF-DISCLOSURE OF GOD : PRINCIPLES OF IBN AL-'ARABI'S COSMOLOGY","review":"I have never been an admirer of sufis and sufism. To me they played little or no positive role in Islamic world's social, political advancement. If these guys were so smart and so intelligent, surly they must have had some insight into the road the Moslem countries were taking which as we know now very well, lead to a total collapse of Islamic world and made us the most backward and miserable nations on this planet. What use is there for a mixture of old philosophy and self induced hallucination, and to top it off, a touch of Shiism. Chitic and others such as Chodkeiwicz try to tell us that Ibne Arabi was a &quot;Sunni&quot; Moslem who even was hostile towards Shia people. They rely on a few passages from him here and there to convince us. But for many great moslem scholars who are intimately familiar with Islamic history, the Shia promotion of men like Ibne Arabi is more than self evident. Those western scholar who think Ibne Arabi was &quot; anti-Shia&quot; because of a couple of rhetoric here and there, are apparently unfamiliar with middle east's culture and way of life. In middle east, things are never so simple. Chitic and Chodkeiwicz may know &quot;Arabic&quot; but don't speak nor understand middle east's &quot; language&quot;. Ibne Arabi claims to have seen&quot; Al-Mahdi&quot;, a distinctly Shia belief in that they believe in him as a hidden Imam, then he talks about the &quot;12&quot; being the poles and many other such non-sense which great shia implication. I must say I find Ibne Arabi very clever. But in my opinion, if it smells, taste, and feels like a Shia, then it is a Shia. It is apparent that the author thinks highly of this man, and as a Sunni Moslem, obviously he wants to make him a 100% Sunni Moslem, but if you truly accept many of Arabi's doctrines then you are definitly not a Sunni moslem, which pretty much means you are not a Moslem."},{"Title":"In A Heartbeat (Faith Parenting Guide.)","review":"I myself, have not suffered the death of a child, but I do know a number of women who have been through this very traumatic experience.

The puzzles really challenge them, although some are a bit more than they can handle. While the solutions are given in the book, they are not allowed to look at them until I am completely convinced that they will not get the answer. However, I do give them plenty of clues before that option is exercised.Some of the problems are classics, for example selecting socks until you have a matching pair and drawing figures without lifting a pencil are problems that I did in grade school many years ago. My favorite problem in this book is the one that is illustrative of the growth of powers. It involves a million sugar cubes each a half inch in width. Making a cube out of them would create a cube approximately four feet wide, a rectangle would cover a tennis court but a stack would be higher than Everest. Since the first involves the cube root of a million and the second the square root, this demonstrates the significance of squares and cubes in a unique and educational way.This book is an excellent source of mathematical puzzles for students at the level of fourth or fifth grade. While none of them is really new, they are well-suited for children of that age and all three of mine enjoy them greatly, although they do get frustrated."},{"Title":"Amazing Math Puzzles","review":"This book is upto my expecations.

Onwards.The book starts in the alternate world first seen in TERRAPLANE, in 1968. Walter Bullitt is a pharmaceutical expert who puts his knowledge to nefarious use for the government, and spends his spare time collecting 78 RPM blues discs. While trying to avoid accepting his latest assignment, he starts seeing ghosts that he can't ascribe to his extracurricular chemistry experiments. Then he bumps into two females who have been sent by Dryco to...well, buy the book and find out!What can I say, like all the Dryco books, it starts out weird and then just keeps turning corners that you don't see coming until your head starts to spin. Walter Bullitt is now one of my favorite characters from the whole Dryco mythology; his hipster narration makes GOING, GOING, GONE perhaps the most enjoyable read in the entire series.A few recurring characters from previous books appear. It took me a moment to figure out who the ghosts were, but when I did I had to put the book down, I was so pleased. Amazing.The ending of the book was so very unexpected and satisfying. The last chapter, &quot;In the New World,&quot; won't make sense to anyone who hasn't read the five previous Dryco novels, but to those who have, you're in for such a treat. ( The bit about ALICE had me fall out of my chair laughing. ) The last sentence of the book -I won't tell you who it is about, but it redeems their life in the simplest of ways. I almost started crying. ( But geeks don't cry, dammit! )So. That's that. Thank you, Jack Womack, for sharing this twisted universe of yours with us.And if you haven't read any of his books, get cracking.

Do it."},{"Title":"Going Going Gone","review":"Jack Womack's \\"Ambient\\" series of alternative history/time travel science fiction novels may be unknown to many unfamiliar with science fiction and fantasy, but to those in the know, like his friend William Gibson, Womack's definitely a first-class high-wire literary act, carving out his own niche as one of the most distinctive voices in contemporary American science fiction literature. He's blessed with an economy of style and a keen ear for dialogue that, in lesser hands, would be mediocre pulp fiction, not the subversively serious literature that's been his oeuvre. Womack's \\"Ambient\\" novels are a notable addition to the alternative history science fiction genre; an often subversive exploration of class and racial tensions set in an America whose destiny is being shaped by the enigmatic Dryco corporation; with a most resounding note, this great series closes with \\"Going Going Gone\\". In 1968, Walter Bullitt, a part-time Federal employee, is recruited to sabotage Bobby Kennedy's Presidential campaign. Instead, he finds himself joining forces with two mysterious women who want him to save his New York City - and theirs - plunging into a fast-paced odyssey run amok in guns, drugs and time travel. Readers beware. Hold onto your hats, since this is a journey where Womack truly takes you where no one has gone before."},{"Title":"Going Going Gone","review":"Sort of...Womack's style is so unique, I might suggest re-reading each book upon completion. His &quot;vernacular&quot; is so compelling, I actually find myself emulating it in e-mails to my friends (and perhaps his prophetic truncated style of speaking is an extrapolation of &quot;e-mail-speak&quot;). This book (or any of the books in the series, for that matter) are not suggested reading for the optimistic sort. He has as bleak an outlook of post-apocolyptic Earth as any author I've read, yet his vision also seems to be the most realistic. His works reap the seeds that our society is presently sowing, and he does it with STYLE.While our government was fooling around with MK Ultra, Womack's more perverse parallel universe finds an accelerated plan far more sinister, even if it isn't fully explained. No need! He leaves enough room for you to plug in your own worst fears.Sadly, I picked up &quot;Random Acts&quot; for a buck at a book surplus store (It was also, incidentally, an ideal place to start the Ambient series). While it was a great value for me, I find it unfathomable that Womack isn't as widely accepted as Frank Herbert. His vision is just as lucid, and, like Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; series, I envy anyone who gets to experience it for the first time themselves..."},{"Title":"Going Going Gone","review":"This novel demonstrates again Jack Womack's amazing talents, especially with language. One of the strongest aspects of the novel is the clash of the protagonist's hip talk with the Dryco-speak of his visitors.However, I did not quite like this novel as much as the others in the series, and I definitely would ot recommend it as the first Womack novel to read."},{"Title":"Going Going Gone","review":"I never would have thought that I would enjoy a book that contains abundant drug use to the degree that I enjoyed Jack Womack's newest novel. _Going, Going, Gone_ is a witty and psychedelic alternate history/time travel/parallel universe/ghost story all-in-one. The narrative flows easily once the reader becomes accustomed to Womack's out-there jargon.The protagonist, Walter, is a counterculture government freelancer who's hired by the Kennedy family (indirectly) to convince Jim Kennedy to assassinate Bobby. Walter is perplexed by the ghosts floating in his living room and moaning his name. And he's not quite sure what to make of the gorgeous woman and her muscular companion that speak in bizarrely mangled English and who appear and disappear with regularity.As the story progresses the various threads weave together in a surprisingly coherent (given the disparate threads)narrative. This is Book 5 in Womack's 'Ambient' series. It's not necessary to have read the previous 4 to enjoy this one but you'll soon find yourself searching for the other books in the series. Highly enjoyable throughout. Recommended."},{"Title":"Going Going Gone","review":"Please, tell me you've been keeping up with all the books in the Amibient series! If you haven't you're just going to have to hurry to catch up with the rest of us.This is a world as unlike ours as it is a carbon-copy. The year is 1968, but it's not the same 1968 you remember (or read about, youngsters.)Walter Bullitt is just another luckless schmoe, trying to survive without having to try too hard. Sure, he's had a good career being a pharmaceutical guinea pig for the government and taking on the occasional assignment. But, this is a job offer he desperately wants to turn down. Too bad things don't work that way.Follow Bullitt on a wild, psychedelic ride through the club scene, encounters with the afterlife, and maybe some brushes with another time. Womack's vision is unlike anyone else's and you don't want to miss your chance to hop on the sometimes deadly conga line."},{"Title":"Going Going Gone","review":"In 1968 independent researcher Walter Bullit tests new psychotropics mostly experimenting on himself as the guinea pig. At times, Walter accepts a job from the Feds to test one of his products on selected individuals. Perhaps because he is stoned so often, Walter has no remorse about what happens to his subjects.His latest assignment is to insure Robert Kennedy does not run for the presidency, currently encumbered by Henry Cabot Lodge. However, this time Walter runs into problems as ghosts suddenly share his apartment and two strange females (Big Girl and Little Mod) literally abduct him from a concert. Eulie and Chlojo need Walter who is the nexus between two dimensions to save New York City that is two cities of New York, one in his world and the other in the home realm of the two weird women.This book is not for everyone as the hip language will sound foreign to some readers even as it sets the tone and ambiance of the plot in a clockwork rose colored way. The story line is amusing as Jack Womack slices and dices society. Readers who enjoy offbeat alternate history will want to read this novel and the previous &quot;Ambient&quot; series books as Mr. Womack ends his wild ride with a stickball hit that is GOING GOING GONE over the tenement building roof.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Going Going Gone","review":"My name is Whitney and I have three words to describe the book. Waste of time. This book was by far the worst piece of literature that I have ever read. The dialog was well written but the descriptions went on forever and half the time was using 1960/70s lingo and not being from that era made it rather difficult to decode. I would not recommend this book to anyone and I advise you to pick another."},{"Title":"As the Sparks Fly Upward: Jimmy and Johnny Adventure Stories","review":"'AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARD' is an excellent addition to any family library. The stories present very good lessons in values and can be easily read by youngsters. Too many of our children are growing up in an environment of uncertainty, in single parent homes, most likely in a state of poverty, and in many cases live with violence on a daily basis. The long range forecast by national researches and pollsters, tell us that by the year 2010 we can expect an enormous increase in juvenile 'super' predators unless we do more now to combat this very serious problem. 'AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARD' is another excellent way to teach family values and a belief in God and patriotism, that are the cornerstones, not only of our society but of the Boy Scout movement. I think this book, along with other supplemental programs, can be powerful tools in helping a young person face an ever growing array of decisions from their choice of friends and role models to their career path. This book is definitely a great way to teach value and ethics."},{"Title":"As the Sparks Fly Upward: Jimmy and Johnny Adventure Stories","review":"I planned to read only a few pages at first, but I could not stop until I had read the entire book! It is so easy to read, very, very interesting, and full of surprises. It reminded me of my young boyhood days and the Hardy Boys series. As an adult, I enjoyed the book as though I was still a young boy. Anyone can be entertained, encouraged, and grow spiritually by reading these stories.There are many examples in the book that 'point boys in the right directions'. One in the first story teaches a boy to keep his word, even if he really doesn't understand all the circumstances. In the second story, you realize that someone whom you have a reason to dislike, can become a 'Gem' instead of a 'Jerk'. In the third story, there is help when you look up.As a Sunday School teacher and Bible student for many years, I recognize the need to keep boys involved. We are to let their imaginations grow, and at the same time, teach them strong lessons about \`what is the right thing to do'. The author has accomplished that in 'AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARD'."},{"Title":"As the Sparks Fly Upward: Jimmy and Johnny Adventure Stories","review":"If you are looking for some exciting stories for children intertwined with positive spiritual and moral values then look no further than \\"AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARDS\\". As a father and a youth minister, I appreciate David deGruy's writing style that captivates children in terms they can easily understand.In addition, the prayers at the end of each chapter reinforce our need to pursue our Heavenly Father for wisdom and strength to face all circumstances in life.

If we existed in a world where society was guided by the latest efforts of sharp thinkers (rather than cost/benefit analysis) then we should be seeing major changes in the existing insitutions that provide care for people with 'mental health problems'. The book begins with the following thesis: Intentional (meaningful) mental states are causal as they can be used in the explanation / prediction of action. They attend to this thesis in the first part of the book. These mental states are not reducible to physical states, rather they are 'encoded' in physical states in the brain, something akin to how information for producing a particular phenotype is encoded in the DNA molecule. Their account solves the following problem: Ever since Karl Jaspers set the limits of understanding, 'true madness' has been excluded from the domain of meaning and relegated to that of biological dysfunction. Thoughout this book Bolton and Hill show how in biology as well as in psychology there are many possiblities for disorder in the absence of any physical dysruption. Disorder can be envisaged as occuring from the intentional stance only if intentional mental states can be construed as having causal power. Their account drives meaning back into previously 'meaningless' phenomena."},{"Title":"I was Castro's prisoner: An American tells his story","review":"Facts proven through timeMartino, John and Nathaniel Weyl 1963 I Was Castro's Prisoner. The Devin-Adair Company, New York. Republished in 2008 by JFK Lancer, Southlake, TX ISBN-10: 0977465764 ISBN-13 978-0977465767First and foremost, one should take the charge that John V. Martino was involved in the JFK assassination (as is suggested in one of the editorial reviews) with a grain of salt. Instead, let the book speak for itself. What struck me, as having been in a rebel in the mountains with Castro and later marginally involved in the Cuban resistance to Castro from 1959-1961 (manuscript in progress \\"Love in War in Cuba\\"), is the wealth of useful detail on Cuban history rarely found elsewhere that is presented in this book (1963 edition, here cited pages refer to that edition).These details have become more and more accepted as collaborating evidence has appeared through the years. Some of the details of interest include a description of Captain Jos&eacute; de Jes&uacute;s Casta&ntilde;o y Quevedo, the man who was left in charge of the Bureau of Repression of Communist Activities (BRAC), whose files were burnt (not found mentioned in book) and who was summarily executed by Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara March 7, 1959 very early in the Castro's ascension to power. What is less commonly know and described here (pages 2-3, 9-11) is that Captain Casta&ntilde;o was a long standing and clean handed military officer working to control anti-democratic Nazi and communist operatives since 1940, through both democratic and Batista controlled governments. And that he was killed clearly to help smooth the path for Castro's communist coup from power (circa 1959-1961).Another and very serious point that the authors of this book make clear is that Castro had help in this coup not only, as is widely known in the U.S. State Department, but also in the CIA. Starting on page 15, the author discusses the background of \\"Efiginio\\" Ameijeiras Delgado, and his charge that Ameijeiras was gay, which at the time sounded just a smear. With time, this charge turned factual, as the highly probable reason that Castro had Ameijeiras marginalized and demoted for \\"immorality\\" despite his loyal service, especially at the Bay of Pigs. What interested me most about this book was the naming of one of the informers whose actions most probably lead to my own arrest in April of 1961. Pedro Cuella, the double agent who deceived the CIA and who betrayed much of the Cuban underground preparing to support the Bay of Pigs invasion, is mentioned on pages 196-200. The callus disregard held by Castro for those who helped him is illuminated by his order of execution for Cuella, after he no longer was useful to his leader.Other details of interest to me were the description of the arrest of Andres Vargas G&oacute;mez (pages 247-248) stepfather to my putative cousin Calixto S&aacute;nchez Whyte (see Professor Antonio de la Cova's academic web site the very richly documented latinamericanstudies.com). The description of Humberto Sor&iacute; Mar&iacute;n (11, 165-177), his life and brave death, is an example of precise and accurate writing; only quibble I have are my doubts as to the extent of the collusion with the Castro regime of Sor&iacute; Mar&iacute;n's twin brother. The author's mention of British Ambassador (Sr. Herbert Stanley Marchant name not given in book) saving the life of a British subject (page 199, page 175 in paperback edition) pleased me greatly since Sir Herbert also saved my sister and me."},{"Title":"Discourses on the sober life: How to live 100 years","review":"it is short and to the point : it doesn't really matter what you eat as long as you eat very little."},{"Title":"The family of Pascual Duarte","review":"Second only to the inestimable Don Quixote in the pantheon of Spanish Literature, Cela's Family of Pascual Duarte was published in the same year as The Stranger (Albert Camus) and, treating the same themes, is its superior. Cela was for many years denied the recognition he deserved due to his membership in the Falangist party and his service on Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War, but finally, in 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.Pascual Duarte is a brutal Spanish peasant, shaped by poverty, ignorance and hatred. The book recounts his mounting depravity as he goes from killing his dog to knifing a romantic rival to final horrific matricide. Duarte falls prey to the type of alienation and world weariness described by the Existentialists. He describes himself prior to killing his mother:The day I decided I would have to use my knife on her, I was so weary of it all, so convinced in my bones that bloodletting was the only cure, that the thought of her dying didn't even quicken my pulse. It was something fated, it had to be and would be.And even as he writes this account of his life as he sits in prison, awaiting death, he acknowledges:...there are moments when the telling of my own story gives me the most honest of honest pleasures, perhaps because I feel so far removed from what I am telling that I seem to be repeating a story from hearsay about some unknown person.But Cela, unlike Camus, seems to trace Duarte's pathologies to his environment, to the circumstances of his life, rather than trying to make a universal statement about the human condition. Duarte is a distinct type, but one that has been all too familiar in the Century. His alienation, amorality and brutality are summed up in a chilling assertion of his own inhumanity:...I'm not made to philosophize, I don't have the heart for it. My heart is more like a machine for making blood to be spilt in a knife fight....Nor does Cela offer much philosophical elaboration, neither to explain Duarte nor to offer a cure for the world's Duartes. Instead, what is really noticeable here is the absence of any institutions to inculcate values or venues in which to express individual aspirations. Missing are the Church, an open economy and participatory democratic structures, the triune basis of modern Western civil society. In this sense, the novel sounds a cautionary note about the sorts of men that arise in this kind of moral vacuum.The novel is raw and powerful and compulsively readable. It's outrageous that it is not currently in print in English translation, but it is available through used booksellers and many libraries may stock copies from when he won the Nobel. Either way, it is well worth your effort to track it down.GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"The family of Pascual Duarte","review":"This is a fabulous book. It is a grim but fast-paced tale with the kind of tongue-in-cheek humor I have come to love Cela for. It may seem dimimutive, and the writing style is spare enough to be deceiving in that it hardly seems likely that within so few pages, a monument could emerge. The scope of this book is staggering; only a master like Cela could have pulled it off. Go to a used bookstore to find it."},{"Title":"The family of Pascual Duarte","review":"This book was riveting. The plot is dark, and the main character nothing to be admired. But there is a struggle between his irredeemable, murderous ways, and an occasionally bulging (at best) conscience, and (at worst) paranoia that gives him a hint or whiff of something better than he is. The writing style is very vivid. Cela has a great command of expression, yet you can almost imagine this story being told to you orally on the front porch of a house in the evening. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The family of Pascual Duarte","review":"I first came across Cela in a dual-language book of short stories and I found his description of everyday life in Spain quite entertaining and I loved his sense of humor.The life of Pascual Duarte is very different from that however, definitely not a light hearted read. Like another reviewer said there is no sense of redemption in it, it is very fatalistic and I guess if you are used to fairytale endings, you could consider it disappointing.What struck me about this book was the sense of futility that Pascual had when it came to dealing with situations around him. It was as if he had no part to play in his own life, that he was just a victim of fate.Cela's descriptions of the motivations that drove Pascual draws the reader in and makes him a witness to this man's demise. There are some parts in the book where you know he is going to do the wrong thing but you hope and hope that somehow he will come to his senses and avoid disaster.Although this is no \\"Crime and Punishment\\" it is an interesting study into the psychology of a killer. Unlike Crime and Punishment however, do not expect to come away from this with a sense of having being cleansed.Recommended to those who can put up with pain and disappointment, probably not for everyone."},{"Title":"The family of Pascual Duarte","review":"Pascual Duarte grew up in brutal and brutalizing poverty, hatred, depravity, and despair. From his prison cell where he is awaiting execution for a series of murders he has committed, Duarte writes down his confessions and in doing so, depicts the horrors of his life, foremost among which are a despicable mother, an unfaithful wife, and a lifetime of savage crimes. Duarte's account (written with a hauntingly childlike sense of the world) portrays a man twisted by the cruel hand of fate into a source of contributing evil. Strongly recommended reading, The Family Of Pascual Duarte is a unique and flawlessly written novel by the late Camilo Jose Cela (1916-2002) and will admirably serve to introduce a new generation to the work of this deftly talented author of more than fifty books during his lifetime."},{"Title":"The family of Pascual Duarte","review":"This book, published in 1942, was Cela's first novel. The bulk of it comprised the memoirs of a man in his 50s who was in prison and about to be executed for his last crime, the killing of his village's local landowner during the turmoil of the Spanish Civil War, ca. 1936-7.The memoirs didn't focus on that crime or the Civil War era, but covered the man's childhood, adolescence and early adulthood, a marriage, a murder, a second marriage and a second murder, all of which had occurred years before, in the 1910s and early 20s.The man was born to poor, squabbling, alcoholic parents, and lived a dreary life. He enjoyed a few periods of happiness -- first love, marriage to a loving wife and their honeymoon, his wife's pregnancy, and later a marriage to a second loving wife. But each time, he felt misfortune was impending. His nerves and contrary nature -- and fate, or what seemed like the author's grim determination to destroy him -- intervened to change things for the worse. Rage at the injustice of circumstances found a target in his next victim.This book has been compared to The Stranger, by Camus, but for me the two novels were different. In The Stranger, the narrator murdered -- once, randomly -- but eventually accepted personal responsibility for his action, though he remained indifferent to society's condemnation. And he reached a certain level of self-awareness before going to face death squarely.In Cela's book, the narrator seemed irrational and trapped in a pattern of doomed behavior he couldn't begin to understand, let alone take responsibility for. Eventually, others reported that he felt his fate was God's will, but he couldn't face the end bravely. His outlook couldn't be described as existentialist, if that means choosing one's actions and accepting full responsibility for them. Mainly he seemed like a blind instrument of the author's own naturalism.To me, in this book Cela succeeded best in communicating the atmosphere of dreariness and doom, the narrator's moody resentment leading to outbursts of violence, and in creating sympathy for the narrator's first wife. If only more of the writing in the book had been like this, toward the end:\\"I wanted to put ground between my shadow and myself, between my name and me, between the memory of my name and the rest of me, between my flesh and me myself, that me myself who, without shadow and name and memory and flesh would be almost nothing.\\"And there were occasional flashes of very dark humor. But with such a violent, unattractive main character, it was hard in the end to identify with his circumstances and behavior. Nor was I engaged by the book's overall style, since as communicated through the narrator's limited perspective it was bleak much of the way through. The narrator's motive for his second murder wasn't convincing, and the description of place in the book, after the beginning, was often schematic.Because of such things, unlike with Camus' work, I sympathized less and less with the narrator's actions as the novel continued. And unlike with, say, a writer like Malaparte, I wasn't fascinated by haunting images that accompanied the narrative. Or with later writers like Selby and Jim Thompson from the democratic, open-economy U.S., by the horror of the main character's descent.Reading Cela's novel, I couldn't help wondering whether the writing had a political dimension. The narrator was described as killing a landowner during the Civil War, so was a political position implied that made him not only a criminal but also an opponent of the conservative Franco regime that took power? Yet the narrator was also shown to believe in God and in God's punishment for his sins, so his politics, if any, remained unclear. There seemed to be little else related potentially to the political situation of the time. It was also unclear why the final murder, at the time of the Civil War, took place off stage, so to speak, as if the author didn't need to describe it, or was unable to."},{"Title":"The family of Pascual Duarte","review":"IN CAMILO Jos&eacute; Cela's The Family of Pascual Duarte, people, plants, animals and other natural forces take on shimmering qualities when a murderous madman projects his imagination over a gray and barren landscape.His nameless and impoverished agrarian village is located, Pascual tells us, \\"some two leagues from Almendralejo, squatting athwart a road as empty and endless as a day without bread...\\"He works only rarely, and his account reads like one of a low-rent bon vivant flitting about indulging self-generated paranoias and fears that might hold less sway were he out tending fields with more consistency.His personal poverty is a relative thing. He enjoys a modicum of economic independence and the ability to make a pleasure trip with his bride to the provincial capital. The house he describes is clean and appointed for basic necessities, even if the family burro occupies the room adjacent.Yet, for all the poverty Pascual claims to suffer, he does not seek exculpation for his serial murders by invoking a drab past or rotten luck. More important than poverty in the formation and motivation of Pascual lurks the shadow of his religion.Compounding the grayness of the narrator's environment are the proscriptions of Spanish Catholicism, more severe and reliant on penitence than its gentler, more charitable Italian cousin.Spanish philosopher and author Miguel de Unamuno defined this social order as \\"One faith, one shepherd, one flock, unity before anything else, unity imposed from on-high, repose, submission and obedience.\\"The Catholic and Castilian code, Unamuno wrote, implied two worlds: \\"A God and a devil over each, hell to fear and a heaven to conquer through liberty and grace, gaining a merciful and just God.\\"Indeed, God and proper convention are never far from our murderer's mind. After his mare kicks an old lady he stops to check on her \\"...for it would not be in the nature of a well-born person to ride on.\\"Pascual's relationship to the Church marks the real boundaries to his actions and perceptions. Its laws lend an otherworldly allure to what they forbid. Eve, after all, was naked and she gave Adam an apple to eat, not a bar of soap.While visiting the local friar to discuss his intentions of marrying the village maiden Lola, \\"Don Manuel opened the door of the sacristy and pointed to a bench in church, a bench like any bench in any church, made of unpainted wood, hard and cold as stone, but a place where sometimes wonderful moments are possible.\\"The Lord clearly taketh in Pascual's life, but giveth on occasion as well. To the considerable extent that Pascual has faith in God, he has faith in the devil and the archangels and demons as a result.While out spending a placid day in the country with his hunting dog Chispa, the animal (he says) turns to gaze on him with \\"the look of a confessor, coldly scrutinizing, the eyes of a lynx, the look they say a lynx fixes on you.\\"Pascual is unable to shake the resulting shudder that wracks his body and overcomes him.\\"It was hot, the heat was stifling, and my eyes began to close under the animal's stare, which was sharp as flint.\\"I picked up my gun and fired. I reloaded and fired again. The bitch's blood was dark and sticky and it spread slowly along the dry earth.\\"It appears, then, to be Pascual's destiny to kill; to that end, his assignment becomes one he fulfills consistently. Along the way, he also slashes a man in a barroom brawl and stabs to death a mare that has thrown Lola and killed the baby she carried inside.Pascual becomes a fugutive for a number of years, but returns to kill his tormentor, Estirao (Stretch), who first abused his sister and later impregnated Lola in Pascual's absence.Pascual eventually lands in jail, where the peasant from Extremadura (meaning \\"extreme\\" and \\"hard\\" in Spanish) pens his memoirs from death row. These memoirs constitute the story of Pascual Duarte throughout the majority of the book.No madman on a self-destructive binge, Pascual does manage to be released on good behavior. At that moment he begins, earnest as ever, to rebuild a life, this time marrying Esperanza. But his demons get the worst of him and his mother pays the ultimate price.Of course,the story is about Pascual's family, the most important social unit in agrarian settings such as this. His father is Portugese and an explosive madman who has a heart attack at the news of being cuckolded.His sister Rosario, whom Pascual adores, is cursed with a similar, if less violent, destiny because \\"God did not wish any of us to be distinguished by good deeds...\\" She is a prostitute, which can be shameful and painful before the sacred community, not to mention fatal to her as a practitioner.His brother, Mario, sired by a man other than Pascual's father, is born deformed.\\"The poor fellow never got beyond dragging himself along the floor as is he were a snake and making some squeaking sounds in his throat. It was all he ever learned.\\"The unfortunate Mario even suffers the indignity of having a pig chew off his ears. Eventually he relieves the family of his oppressive sadness by drowning in a vat of olive oil at 10 years old:\\"When we lifted him out, a thin trickle of oil poured from his mouth, like a gold thread being unwound from a spool in his belly. His hair, which in life had always been the dim color of ash, shone with such lively luster that one would have thought it had resurrected in death. Such were the wonders associated with the death of little Mario.\\"Pascual's mother is conniving and untrustworthy, giving birth to children not her husband's and encouraging her daughter-in-law Lola to do the same.Back in that hornets' nest after his term in prison, Pascual threatens the old woman so that she removes herself as instigator, none of which escapes Pascual, who observes: \\"It's sad to think that in order to gain a little peace a man has to make use of fear!\\"But fear is not retribution enough and, in the novel's dramatic highpoint, Pascual kills his mother and records his first impressions...\\"Her blood spurted all over my face. It was warm as a soft belly and tasted like the blood of a lamb.\\"True to form, Pascual flees the scene. At this point his personal narration ends and outside voices, introduced by Cela in the form of public testimony and private missive, fill in the rest.The dispassionate diaries Pascual pens to divulge his murders have prompted comparisons with Albert Camus' The Stranger. Both books were published in 1943; Cela's went on to become the most polemic and most prolifically translated of Spain's 20th Century literary output. Camus did as much for French letters.But Pascual is not empty of soul in the way of Camus' feckless anti-hero; rather he is driven by the customs and practices of a pervasive moral code. He fears the Holy Ghost.His narration of events is not relayed in any linear way because, as Pascual explains, \\"Following the footsteps of people involved rather than the order of events, I jump from beginning to end and from the end back to the beginning. Like a grasshopper being swatted.\\"The memoirs tell his version of events, of a good man driven by intermittent and irrational forces to kill. Pascual admits it freely in his opening.\\"I am not, sir, a bad person, though in all truth I am not lacking in reasons for being one. We are all born naked, and yet, as we begin to grow up, it pleases Destiny to vary us, as if we were made of wax.\\"Recollections from his confessor (\\"the transcriber\\" of his testimony introduced at the beginning of the book) and the warden make clear that, following Pascual's release from jail, the murderer had more killing to do.We learn that at the Spanish Civil War's outset, Pascual engaged in \\"revolutionary activities\\" that led him to kill the richest man in the town. The memoirs were sent, at Pascual's request, to the only friend of his victim \\"whose address he can remember.\\"The date of Pascual's eventual execution makes it likely, and the book works to suggest, that he was not shot in the end for his serial murdering, but, ironically, for his politics. Posted to a moral social code, Pascual is ultimately killed by the forces of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, keepers of that very same code.Adding contrast to Pascual's atrocities are the peasant village life and style that unfold in what Unamuno called the \\"intra-historical\\" cycle of birth, marriage, procreation and death, or \\"the world of silences.\\"Pascual chooses a wife at his brother's funeral:\\"When Lola went down on her knees she showed the smooth whiteness of her legs above her black stockings, tight as blood sausage. I blush to say what I must, and may God apply the effort it cost me to say it toward the salvation of my soul, for the truth is in that moment I was glad my brother had died...Lola's legs shone like silverplate, the blood pounded in my temples, and my heart seemed ready to burst from my chest.\\"Here, Cela is superimposing rituals of passage to accentuate the eventless existence of agrarian life. These rites provide the only signposts for direction and action in an otherwise mundane universe.Pascual gains Lola, but the imprimatur of the church robs her of allure, for \\"that first kiss given with permission didn't taste half as good as the kisses in the cemetery, so long ago now.\\"Sexual pleasure and death are also coupled in the aforementioned stabbing of the mare. \\"When I quit the stable my arm was aching. I was covered with blood up to my elbow. The mare hadn't made a sound. She only breathed deeper, and faster, like when we put her to stud.\\"And the flow of blood is often swathed in an inviting metaphor of rejuvenation and cleansing: \\"When they carried him off to Don Raimundo's pharmacy the blood was flowing from him like water from a spring...\\"Cela marks a life-rhythm in Pascual's pueblo using a trance-like dirge from a single, mournful drum. \\"The years passed over our heads as they do all the world. Life in our house went down the same drains as always...\\"When Pascual's son dies, he is tortured by the endless chatter of the women in his family.\\" \`Oh, the agony, the death throes!'\`I held him gasping in my arms!' [they cry:]It sounded like a litany, as slow and weary as a night filled with wine, as languid and heavy as the pace of an ass. And they went on in this way day after day, week after week...It was frightful, dreadful, and the curse of God, vengeance from on high.\\"Pascual's is the superstition of a provincial haunted by ill-fortune, relieved only by splashes of momentary magic.Happy in a family life, he and Lola seemingly conjure the boy's death, inviting an ill-wind that kills him:\\"\`Did you hear that?'\`What?'\`The window.'\`The window?'\`Yes. It creaked as if the wind, as if a draft were trying to get through...'The creaking of the window, moved as it was by the wind. Came to be mingled with a moan.\\"The modern mind scoffs at the individual's dark power to conjure death, but Pascual's mind does not. He leaves his future \\"in God's hands\\" along with responsibility for his past transgressions, for the lamb of God takes away the sins of the earth. His very understanding of things is woven with the Catholic iconography of sacrifice and suffering.The surrounding universe corroborates the place he sees for himself there. Lola tells him before she dies, \\"It's just that blood seems like a kind of fertilizer in your life...\\"When his sister Rosario asks why he says he is damned, Pascual responds, \\"I'm not the one who says it.\\"Such is the \\"real magicalism\\" of Cela, who paints the everyday gray, then drapes it in golden thread and lively luster.In magical realism, the extraordinary is invited to accompany the ordinary on its daily rounds; in the real magicalism of Pascual's mind, the very ordinary takes on the cast of something extraordinary by the projection of his fevered mind on the contrasting drabness and boredom of his surroundingsCamilo Jos&eacute; Cela's inspiration to write The Family of Pascual Duarte might be seen as having an intrinsic connection to his own colorful political life in Spain. Cela was born in May 1916 in Iria Flavia, Galicia; a province steeped in fog, drizzle and a black magic mythology to match them.In 1934, he began the study of medicine, but soon wound up under the tutelage of Pedro Salinas, a poet and member of the legendary \\"Generation of 1927\\" which counted, among its numbers, one of Spain's most triumphant literary exports, Federico Garcia Lorca.Set up in Madrid's well-heeled Barrio Salamanca at the outset of the Civil War, Cela signed on with the Fascist fighting units of General Millan Ashtray whose war cry was \\"Long Live Death!\\" This experience could explain Pascual's righteous obsession with death and murder.Later, Cela would serve for a time as a censor to the Franco regime only to see his own work receive the same rough treatment later. In 1974, he resigned his post as president of the prestigious Madrid Atheneum over the anarchist Salvador Puig Antich's execution. It seems Cela was always living at odds with the power brokers of his time. In 1962, he dedicated the 13th edition of The Family of Pascual Duarte to his \\"enemies, who have been of such help to me in my career.\\"Cela, by all accounts, was a man who planned to be famous, and to be so as a writer. He was prolific throughout his life, crafting internationally acclaimed novels, less critically adored plays, countless essays and articles.He won the Nobel Prize in 1989 and quickly turned it to his commercial advantage, developing what he himself considered \\"the business of Camilo Jos&eacute; Cela.\\" Until his death in 2002 he roamed the streets and bars of Madrid with his youngish wife, living the old-style literary life in a European capital, collecting caviar prizes and stipends, expounding in electronic and print media on any number of topics, contemporary and otherwise.In the years following Franco's death he was disdained by the political right over his criticism of the Franco regime and reviled by the reigning cultural elites of the ruling Socialist Party.He could have cared less and if moved to, gave as good as he got. None of it could dent his hard-earned triumph, rooted more firmly in the quality and variety of his work than the meticulously crafted public persona he employed in shadowboxing the world around him."},{"Title":"The family of Pascual Duarte","review":"Book was a good read.

Larks creatively mixes her heartfelt poetry and deeply personal thoughts, in the form of her journal affectionately named &quot;Di,&quot; to reflect the inner turmoil that results from a tumultuous relationship. Did I add that the relationship the book is based on is that of herself and a man living with another woman?The most interesting aspect of this compilation is how Larks manages to make the reader feel sympathy for all the people involved. Despite the fact that this relationship is more of a love triangle based on lies and deception, Larks' candid exploration into the way this man makes her feel is very good for a first time author. The reader follows Larks as she goes through the ferris wheel cycle of loving someone who loves someone else. Will Larks ever get off this ride?I recommend this book to any woman, or even man, who's leaving or ever left a &quot;Jerry Springer Show,&quot; worthy relationship. Readers who like to read true accounts of other people's lives may enjoy this book as well. Even with the numerous typos and grammar errors, this book has the power to reach any person who has a heart.AnnaR.E.A.L.

It should have been called &quot;The Films of Francois Truffaut.&quot; Professor Insdorf makes clear the connections among Truffaut's films. Many of those connections are quite surprising, and will deepen your appreciation of the films. Also, this book is the last word on Truffaut's influences. Professor Insdorf's description of the director's marriage of the Hitchcock sensibility with the lyricism of Jean Renoir is magnificent. This is a fine companion to the director's films, but the biographical data -- about Truffaut's youth and film criticism -- is perfunctory. And there is precious little on Truffaut's interaction with other French and world filmmakers."},{"Title":"The cooking of Scandinavia","review":"How I would wish that Time-Life could revamp this series and rerelease it for anyone foodie who would want this classic series!Cooking of Scandinavia is like all the other books in this series- full of the food history of the region, filled with basic and classic recipes and willing to take the reader on an armchair tour of the whole country.

All are highly recommended for information on Dumas and his age and for entertainment value.We know him best as author of The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers, but Alexandre Dumas' greatest creation was his own life. He had a saying: \\"Old age begins when daring dies\\". Like Oscar Wilde, Dumas put his genius into his life and his talent into his work.Dumas was a larger than life character. A six foot three (1.9m) part negro, he was an expert swordsman, superb calligrapher, fluent linguist, brilliant conversationalist, ardent Republican, collector of medals and Royal orders, organiser of his infamous 'fiction factory', outrageous plagiarist, spendthrift whose complex financial affairs might have inspired his contemporary Balzac, world traveller, gourmet cook, lover whose series of affairs scandalised all of Paris till he was well into his sixties, world famous playwright, yet more famous novelist, and possessed the dramatic instinct to a most perfect degree, both in his life and his works. Despite his defects and excesses he possessed the ability to inspire affection in all whom he met.He was involved in most of the political events of his time. Dumas as a boy of thirteen saw Napoleon arrive, and leave, France during the Hundred Days; in the July Revolution of 1830, in a musketeer like flourish, he single-handedly took the garrison at Soissons Arsenal ; he bankrupted himself in support of the 1848 revolution; in a red shirt he marched into Naples at the head of Garibaldi's volunteers in September 1860.Dumas disseminated the ideas of the Romantic revolution to millions throughout the world. This was a man who assimilated the influences of Byron, Scott, Fenimore Cooper and Schiller, counted Victor Hugo, Berlioz, Liszt, Rossini and Delacroix as his friends, knew G&eacute;rard de Nerval, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rick Lematre, Musset, Vigny and the Goncourts well and for three amazing years, 1844-47, was the 'King of Paris', with a worldwide reputation which made him one of the most popular authors who ever lived.Michael Ross' biography does a good job of sketching in most of this. It is a frustrating aspect of Ross' book that much of Dumas' relations with contemporaries is glossed over. Correspondingly more detail is given of his early life which occupies a large part of the text: Ross follows Dumas' own Mes Memoires for much of this. He concentrates on seminal dates, and illustrates them with lively anecdotes. Dumas attending his first play in Paris and meeting the critic Nodier, who was subsequently thrown out of the theatre for booing his own play. The first night of Henri III in 1829, the popularity of which changed Dumas' life. The year of 1844, which saw the publication of both Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers. Ross doesn't attempt to deal in depth with Dumas' approximately 600 novels, plays, autobiography, travel books, essays, tracts and cookbooks.Andre Maurois' The Titans covers the lives of three Alexandre Dumas: grandfather, one of Napoleon's generals; father; and son, author of the novel and play Lady of the Camellias or Camille (inspiration for Verdi's La Traviata) . One of the remarkable things about Maurois' book is how fascinating the part about Alexandre the father is, and how dull the part about Alexandre the son. The former was a good, great and entertaining man, and his personality comes vividly through. The son was a frigid, unhappy man who covered a badly scarred soul with misogyny and pomposity. He lived a sad life despite his fame and prestige. It is clear that Dumas the father - with his prodigality, his egotism, his generosity, his impulsiveness, his energy, his disorder, passions, idealism, self-deceit, power, charm, wit and intelligence - did blight his son's life, did create the frightened, arrogant, moral poseur that son became.Endore's The King of Paris takes a leaf from Dumas' own book. It is written in the style of a Dumas romance, full of imagined anecdote and vivid conversations that should have taken place: it goes beyond relaying facts, and attempts to create the character Dumas, and does so successfully. Endore tells the story of the omelette competition with Delacroix, who won by making a painting from the ingredients, and another of Dumas standing guard, covered most completely by his collection of medals: the ones on the seat of his trousers he explained had been given him by monarchs since deposed. We learn that after squandering more than one fortune, Dumas died with exactly the same amount in his pocket with which he arrived in Paris as a poor young man, and boasted: \\"I'm just as rich as when I started out: how can anyone accuse me of extravagance!\\"Dumas seems to jump right off the page, 120 years after his death, in all these books, so great was his vitality then. It is this vitality which gives to his books, and his greatest work, his life, their enduring interest."},{"Title":"Land of Lost Monsters: Man Against Beast--The Prehistoric Battle for the Planet","review":"\\"Land of Lost Monsters: Man Against Beast - The Prehistoric Battle for the Planet\\" written by Ted Oakes with Amanda Kear, Annie Bates, and Kathryn Holmes is a book the chronicals the BBC series of the same name and has some brilliant photography work associated with it. This chronilogical narrative takes us on a jouney as to what our ancestors must have seen as they began to migrate from Africa to all parts of the Earth.\\"Land of Lost Monsters\\" takes us on a prehistoric journey throughout the world as man moves to find different parts of the globe through exploration and the animals that they met along the way. The book is divided into sections or chapters covering man's exploration as follows:AfricaAustraliaEuropeNew WorldIslandsEach of these sections reveals to the reader what early man found upon landing in these areas, and whether man was the hunter or were they prey according to what was found in these different areas. I found the book to be a very easy read and it is geared toward the young reader with inherent knowledge toward exploration and the dangers that accompany it. The book is appointed with very well placed photographic illustrations annotating and emphasizing and evoking interest to the subject matter at hand.But during the last stages of the Pleistocene epoch, the most amazing creatures started to disappear, victims of a mysterious extinction. The scale of the vanishing is startling: South America lost 80 percent of its large animal genera, North America lost 73 percent, Eurasia 30 percent, Australia lost 86 percent, and the oceanic islands lost a staggering 95 percent of their large birds and animals. So what happened to the Earth's monsters? The answers are within the pages of this book and they make sense, but imagine this... killer plagues, climate changes, and human arrival all played a part and you'll read as to what extent each played.\\"Land of Lost Monsters\\" is a solid 4 star book and is written for the lay-person to easily understand and keep your interest. There is an adequate further reading index if you want to learn more about this subject and the index is comprehensive. I liked the book for it's readability and it's logical presentation with plausible answers to the questions posed making this book a fast and interesting evocative read."},{"Title":"Land of Lost Monsters: Man Against Beast--The Prehistoric Battle for the Planet","review":"Not only a companion to the BBC series of the same name, the book contains plenty of extra information about prehistoric animals not found on the show, as well as extra illustrations and charts. Though it is certainly not a comprehensive lists of ice age animals (or even so-called \\"monsters\\") contemporaneous with man, it does touch on perhaps the most significant of them, and contains detailed descriptions of many creatures not usually explored by books with similar themes.Especially recommended for illustrators of prehistoric themed art and for the layperson who is looking for an enjoyable read to learn about man's early interaction with extinct (and often terrifying) animals."},{"Title":"Land of Lost Monsters: Man Against Beast--The Prehistoric Battle for the Planet","review":"Phew!

One thing I like about this book is it goes into the nitty-gritty details about the megafauna our own species, Homo sapiens sapiens, met. From 65,000 years ago in Australia to as little as 1200 AD (about 700 years ago) in New Zeaand, Land of Lost Monsters covers the whole Ice Age period when Homo sapiens travelled aorund the world.

For this one, they're not erring on the side of making it too young! Here is the entire text (I will put in a / to show the page breaks):Many Dutch people left Holland and came to America. They hoped to make money./The Dutch bought furs from the Native Americans./ The Dutch shipped the furs to Holland. There, the furs sold for a high price./ In 1626, the Dutch bought the island of Manhattan. The Dutch paid the Native Americans with trinkets worth about 24 dollars. It was a low price. / The Dutch built the town of New Amsterdam on the island. In 1664, English ships of war came to town. / \\"Give up or we will attack,\\" the English said. / The people wanted peace. They asked the governor to give up. / The Dutch gave it up without a fight. New Amsterdam became English. / It also got a new name ... New Amsterdam is now called New York City.That's it, folks! Plus some equally simple captions on the color illustrations, and at the back, a \\"word list\\", \\"books to read\\" (which are all more advanced), \\"websites to visit,\\" and an Index. I suppose for a first or maybe second-grade class that's learning about non-fiction conventions, this book might be useful, but for a class that's learning about New Amsterdam, it really doesn't give much information."},{"Title":"Hebrew (Berlitz Phrase Book & Dictionary: Arabic) (Hebrew Edition)","review":"Berlitz has an older edition of this book with a different ISBN number (283150872X.... also available here on Amazon) which is superior to this edition. Unlike its predecessor, this book does not include a Hebrew index or even the vowels. Also unlike the earlier edition, there is no expanded section on how to pronounce the letters and letter combinations and there are no references to the script/cursive letters - only the block/printed letters. People in Israel do not write in block - they write in script. The script looks nothing like the block in most cases, so if someone writes you a note in Hebrew, it might as well be in cuneiform, because you won't be able to decipher it with this book!This book does add some fun features - some exploded drawings of a car and a motorcycle, with Hebrew names for all parts of a car (brake pads, clutch, gasket, etc.)... but if you are just travelling to Israel, is this information you're ever going to need?There is a truncated section on feminine numbers, but not on masculine numbers - the complete opposite of what they did in the previous edition.While the book is color coded by section, the Hebrew labels for these sections are no longer present, and without even a Hebrew index, a confused traveller can't even hand the book to an Israeli to ask for help when communicating.Why Berlitz would do this is beyond me - they had already done all the hard work in the earlier edition and only needed to add the few missing items in the new edition - but instead stripped it down into a flashier, yet useless shell of its previous existence.There are worse books to get, but why get this one when you can have a much more useful book by getting a slightly older model.This newer edition has a few extra &quot;modern&quot; words like &quot;e-mail,&quot; but the additions are few and far between and as a whole, this newer edition borders on useless because of the critical pieces that are missing."},{"Title":"Hebrew (Berlitz Phrase Book & Dictionary: Arabic) (Hebrew Edition)","review":"I found the cassette and phrase book well organized and easy to use, and especially appreciated the fact that the people on the cassette speak everyday Hebrew. It is a &quot;phrase book,&quot; but I would have liked a little more in the way of grammar, and a more extensive dictionary, but overall I found it to be very useful. A word of caution: if you don't know any Hebrew at all, you need to put in a bit of time familiarizing yourself with the pronunciation guide and the way the book works, and memorizing the most common phrases, rather than just taking it with you and expecting to be able to use it in Israel with no preparation."},{"Title":"Hebrew (Berlitz Phrase Book & Dictionary: Arabic) (Hebrew Edition)","review":"I have the 2004 edition of the phrase book and I find that it has a few features that are nicer than other phrasebooks currently on the market, but that is lacking some important ones - especially if you want to use it to help you learn Hebrew while in Israel. Since the other main publisher of phrase books is Lonely Planet, I will specifically compare these two.On the plus side, this Berlitz phrase book has:- Color-coded sections for some ease in finding topics (with icons on the top that can be helpful in locating a topic)- Uses American English (with British English in brackets)- Has a more extensive section if you plan on doing a lot of driving or renting a car (which younger travellers probably will not use)- Emergency numbers and phrases conviently located on the last page for quick access- A reference section for reading signs in Hebrew- A Hebrew menu reader section (with food groups) with the Hebrew in a large print- A dictionary that lists the gender of the Hebrew words- Conversions for clothing sizes and distances between US-standard to metric (but no temperature conversions!)- Larger Hebrew print than the Lonely Planet phrase book (though neither uses vowels - so you must rely on the English transliteration if you are not at least somewhat fluent in Hebrew)The cons of this phrase book include:- The dictionary only goes from English to Hebrew (the section icons and Hebrew sub-headings may make it possible for a Hebrew speaker to find a phrase or word to show to you, but it would take some time)- There is very little grammer given (so you will have trouble creating your own phrases, if you do not already have a basis in Hebrew grammer)- The numbers are only shown in the masculine form (so you will be incorrect when telling time, counting, or referring to feminine items)- The phrases are only in the masculine form (so you will be incorrect if you are a woman speaking, or if you are speaking to a woman) and there is insufficient grammer for you to say it correctly if you do not have a background in HebrewOverall, because of the usefulness of the American-Hebrew phrases, (slightly) larger Hebrew print, larger-print sign and menu readers and a better section on driving terms and phrases, this may be a better choice for older Americans planning only to use this for emergencies and occassionally in Israel. For everyone else, I would recommend the Lonely Planet phrasebook."},{"Title":"The theory of capitalist development: Principles of Marxian political economy","review":"Even the marxist economic theory is viewed with some prejudice after the 20th century, is always interesting to an Economics student read about the Karl Marx's works. And, if &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, his most famous and influent book is very extensive and hard to be read in original, you have a great alternative in Sweezy's book.Sweezy is graduated in Harvard, and dedicated all his academic life to become the marxism an &quot;integral and respected part of intellectual life of the USA&quot;. His &quot;Theory of Capitalist Development&quot; brings the Marx's ideas in an easy and very didactic way, and more: includes the discussion of another marxists, like Bortkiewicz, Bukharin and Rosa Luxemburg.It's wrong to think about this book as pamphlet of marxism. Sweezy is extremely analytic and critical, comparing the marxist theory with the classic and neo-classic theories, with academic rigor and respect. &quot;Theory of Capitalist Development&quot; is an excellent work, and should be a must-read for everyone who wants to understand the fundaments of a theory which changed the life of million of people."},{"Title":"The theory of capitalist development: Principles of Marxian political economy","review":"\\"The Theory of Capitalist Development\\" is a straightforward, non-jargon-laden introduction to Marxist economics, written at an undergraduate level. Although Sweezy wrote in the 1940s, his book holds up well, and brings out the basic points of difference between Marxist and neo-classical economics. Sweezy was always ready to go beyond the strict Marxist canon, as, for example, in his clear and still relevant analysis of monopoly. The prospective reader should know, however, that the book reflects the concerns of mid-20th century Marxists: it's heavy on intra-Marxist debates about underconsumption theory, chronic stagnation, and fascism, but there's nothing on modern topics such as gender or the environment. The reader should also know that the argument of the book is largely theoretical and abstract: the paucity of empirical or historical data is astounding, as if Sweezy saw economics as an a priori science -- which would be a very non-Marxist perspective!"},{"Title":"The theory of capitalist development: Principles of Marxian political economy","review":"I have been reading through Capital volume I and wondered if there were any good books (in English) on Marxian economics. Two of Paul Sweezy's works, Monopoly Capital and this book, Theory of Capitalist Development were recommended. This book is an explanation of Marxian economics - the economic theories of Marx and the work of his followers up until the 1940s when this book was written, and the various debates over his theories.It is a good book. One should know however that there are various schools of Marxian thought, and not every Marxist economist thinks Ladislaus Bortkiewicz solved the \\"transformation problem\\", if there is a transformation problem in the first place. In other words, this is a good book, but you should read other views of these ideas as well."},{"Title":"The theory of capitalist development: Principles of Marxian political economy","review":"This is a rare book for two reasons. First, it qualitatively AND quantitatively discusses the economics behind communism. Second, the author does such a great job that even those with a minimum economics education can gain a lot from reading the book. Sweezy was a well known economist; if you took an economics course you would have probably heard of the Sweezy or 'kinked demand' model. Well, this is the guy. The book starts with a discussion of price and works its way through the entire economic system until it finally reaches globalization. The ideas of many communist economists are discussed and even critiqued (including some of Marx's ideas). The mathematical models used are very simple but they do a great job of explaining the main ideas to the reader. I am amazed how one reviewer wrote that there is no empirical data to back up the author's claims. This is certainly not true. One of the best chapter of the book talked about how the capitalist system seems to lead to a monopoly. For example look at the car and computer industry. There are only 6 or 7 laptop manufacturers around the world and the number is constantly decreasing. Companies are always being advised to merge in order to compete on a global scale. I did several strategic management case studies during my MBA and the conclusion always seemed the same: merge. In order for companies to compete they will have to grow bigger. At some point organic growth wont be enough and this is when the mergers start. HP managed to overtake Dell by buying Compaq for example. Also, production capacity is a huge issue in the car industry today and those companies that are not seeking to merge with someone else are trying to go into joint ventures. Anyway, Sweey clearly highlights the problem in this book and pays much attention to it. The part which most intrigued me was when Sweey actually said that Keyne's theory was mathematically unassailable. After reading more than 300 pages of calculated arguments against the capitalist system, it was really interesting to read that. However, Sweezy went on to criticize Keyne's theory qualitatively and in my opinion that was one of the highlights of the book. This is an amazing book, but what is even more amazing is that few people seem to have read it. Capitalists are busy criticizing Marx's character, while communists and leftists seem to think that they have all the education and enlightenment that anyone can need. If you are neither of those, please read this book."},{"Title":"The troubled midnight,","review":"Leslie Corcoran, just shy of 30, has already endured a failed marriage, the death of a child, and go no where affair with a rich and powerful married man.

This is a book about morals, or the lack of them; but coming from a man who all-but-assaulted his estranged wife with &quot;notions&quot; one ought not to expect a rousing defense of bourgeois morality. Rather an unstinting defense of some other way of life (such as is provided in his impossibly rare *Instinct of Workmanship*) what we have here is a Grand-Guignol treatment of the &quot;life-lie&quot; Veblen calls conspicuous consumption, which just might happen to exclude Symbolist &quot;vitalism&quot; (and as to the provenance of the concept &quot;dolicho-blond&quot;, consult Veblen's essay on the American small town).

So it was with Einstien and theoretical physics, and so it is with economics and Thorstein Veblen as described in this book. Mr. Veblen descended from Norwegian immigrants to the US, and lived in the Midwest from the late 1800s to early 1900s. With a keen eye and insightful mind, he took in the huge economic growth of the US and the beginnings of mass consumerism and corporate advertising in the American population. What he saw was the formation of a middle and upper class that had both idle time and money to spare. Together, this created a leisure class that defined respect, social standing, and self-worth in terms of \\"pecuniary emulation\\", i.e. spending money on stuff and entertainment just because one could. Like a zoologist examining wild animals, Veblen picks apart the rituals, clothing, speech, and consumption habits of this newly rich. All of this is recorded and explained in extraordinary and sometimes comical detail in this book. Upon publication, this book became the first great work of economics by an American author, and made Veblen famous. Along with the Great Gatsby, this book provides one of the best description of the American upper class at the beginning of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"Excellent.

No doubt he did see ' social phenomenom' that were emerging and succeeded in finding the 'name ' for them. 'Leisure class' and ' conspicuous consumption' are part of the everyday vocabulary of the description and analysis of 'social life'. I know that Veblen was particularly hard upon the nouveau riche, those trying to prove by buying and having more that they were as good or better than ' old money'. However I wonder if in ' work ethic' America there is not also another kind of phenomenom, of people of great wealth feeling a special social obligation, as multibillionaires Gates and whether for good purposes or not, Ted Turner have displayed in recent years. I also have a problem with making the concept of ' leisure' an entirely pejorative one. What about those ' surpluses' at the state of the agricultural age which Lewis Mumford said were so key in creating civilization? Isn't it true that in many societies those who do not have to do productive work were freed for higher work of mind and spirit? I wonder then that is whether Veblen's condemnation of the 'leisure class ' is too ' blanket' a one in many ways. And this without denying the truths that great wealth often corrupts, leads to arrogance, and indolence, folly and waste. For years the conception of the US was of a society in which the middle class element was predominant, a society reflecting an equality of opportunity and the fact that the majority of people had been able to in time and through work raise themselves to a good level of life. The decline of the middle class in the sense of the growing gap between very rich and very poor is a fact of life in America. Perhaps this makes Veblen's analysis of a certain part of American society more pertinent. But again I think that there is a counter- tradition emerging in which many of the very wealthy assume that the way to real respect in the eyes of the public is in doing good for others."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"Conspicuous consumption describes the phenomenon of buying a product or service not for its utility or necessity but because of its prestige factor or impressive social value. Mr. Veblen's book is described as a satire, pointing out the hypocrisy and shallowness of the leisure or wealthy class. I am only partly through this book but I am finding it very thought provoking.If Mr. Veblen thought that consumption had a negative conspicuousness, indicative of a hypocritical nature among the wealthy of his day, I can only imagine what he would think of our entire culture today. It seems to me in our present society we have taken conspicuous consumption, beyond the hypocritical and the satirical and into the realm of the obnoxious, the immoral and even the criminal. This really isn't an economics book, nor would I say that it is scientific or academic in nature.It is more the thoughtful extrapolation of an intelligent, thoughtful and educated individual. Thorstein Veblen is more academic than Mark Twain and not quite as humorous. But he is very entertaining and extremely thought provoking. His style is much like Galbraith's - wordy, circular and humor so subtle that if you are not paying attention you could easily miss it. I am enjoying this book.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"I have found it quite amusing to read Veblen's book is depicted as a classic by those who like it (you know, considering that he, more than once, states that the appeal of classics is due largely to the leisure class scheme). Perhaps the unique, brilliant, at times repetitive and dull, at times invariably amusing, and always surprising tone and ideas Veblen has made their indelible mark, but I think that perhaps he would have said that those who admire his book solely as a classic cannot properly understand its message.From his anthropological analysis of the rise of the predatory and peaceable instincts to his ridicule of contemporary (ca. 1900) institutions and customs (I think his theories on clothing apparel, sports, and religion stand out) to his very serious critique of waste and exploit, Veblen wrote an incredibly interesting, unconventional theory. Undoubtedly, to my apprehension, direct and vicarious conspicuous waste (the most famous variant being direct conspicuous consumption) is the most interesting concept presented in the book, yet this is exclusively associated with the rich and what they do. No doubt, the rich's excesses must have been what prompted Veblen to write the book in the first place, but I think the more universal message is overlooked. He repeats this over and over: the leisure class scheme of life pervades society.I do not know if those who appreciate the book see that Veblen makes the case that conspicuous waste is EVERYWHERE. Those who command the scheme are those who we might identify to be the rich, sure, but how can we deny we are not all part of it? Veblen says that \\"any consumer who might, Diogenes-like, insist on the elimination of all honorific or wasteful elements from his consumption, would be unable to supply his most trivial wants in the modern market.\\" To him, I am sure, stripes on a shirt would have seemed wasteful, and a regrettable vestige of some eccentric attempt at invidious pecuniary emulation. Veblen's notion of waste is constructed to be universal, but in varying gradations (which is why he identifies waste most prominently with the leisure class).All this being said, Veblen is quite far from being perfect. The book does consider that there are motives and actions that are not guided by the leisure class' predatory instinct, but is at times vague in dealing with such things. Moreover, some of his explanations are on occasion convoluted or simplified so as to make them fit his general framework. Notwithstanding, anyone who has any interest in reading a great theory about how the rich ultimately dictate many of society's customs and institutions by inciting the lesser instincts that make consumerism possible, or in being amused by a sardonic critique of how wasteful our society can be, should turn to this book.A word of caution: To make a point, Veblen uses a language that would be today considered tedious and cumbersome, perhaps needless and excessively verbose at times, so be ready to deal with that. (I think that, unless pointed out, the fact that it is inferable that Veblen does this to make a point might go unnoticed. At the end of the book he states that usage of proper, preferably archaic language is observed precisely because it is useful and not up to date; this language is preferred because they \\"argue waste of time and exemption from the use and the need of direct and forcible speech.\\" The way in which he writes his book is the last, perhaps most subtle, sardonic bit of satire he offers us.)"},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"Some of the most influential and important studies of America and American life have been authored by visitors from other lands. One such example is this political study of economic man, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Authored by Thorstein Veblen, an immigrant from Scandinavia who settled in the Eastern US, this book examines the behavior of the rich and wanna-be rich in the US at the end of the 19th century.Defining the growing upper class of Americans who owned land, dressed nicely, showered daily and read the latest gossip as the \\"leisure class\\", Veblen proceeds to dissect their behaviors and actions and its causes and effects. The author shows how much of this behavior had no practical economic benefit, but instead served to advertise social success instead. As such, this is one of the first major works to apply Darwinian thought to social evolution and human behavior. Terms such as conspicious consumption and consumerism would spring forth from this book and those that followed in its wake.The book itself is quite easy to read for an economics treatise. Few are the numbers, fewer are the equations. Instead the reader gets wit, sarcasm, and lots of dry humor as the author recounts episodes of rich people acting dumb in the name of showing of their wealth status. The book is good reading, and recommended for those studying history, economics, sociology, or any other social science."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"This is a great classic book even if the writing style is a bit dense.

This book will give you the psychological and sociological understanding of why the wealthy act as they do and why the rest of the population suffers from their excesses over and over again. It will also give you good reasons for knowing why their intense desire to control all the resources must be actively managed if the middle class is to survive in any way shape or form in this country."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"Just read this after years of thinking I knew what it was, based on college professors years ago telling me what they thought Veblen was about. Turns out the guy was from Wisconsin, not Sweden, and that he was a master satirist, not an economist or sociologist, and that he died in 1929 at the ripe old age of 72. He gets a special award for using the word &quot;honorific&quot; over and over, and another commendation for making breathtakingly sweeping generalizations about human history and social development, and about contemporary (circa early 1900s) industrial relationships with ZERO (!) reference to data, and a dismissal of any need for any empirical verification of his conclusions. The conclusions themselves loop around themselves like a biplane seriously out of control, and in the end this mainly entertains. And in the propwash, we get new terms that have joined the English language: Conspicuous consumption, conspicuous waste, canons of respectability, and even skiing terms like &quot;traverse&quot; which could also, in our &quot;post-predatory&quot; culture, be a legal term from common law pleading. I think Veblen was mainly having fun here, and am surprised that my professors of yore saw this as a serious critique of capitalism. I thought they were smarter than that."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"I'd been to led to expect this book was an account of rather silly snobberies by the rich. And that it was exquisite in scholarship, writing style, and detail. Wrong.Thorstein Veblen - 1857-1929 - and I only checked these details after reading this book - was one of many children of Norwegian immigrants into the USA. They were, or may have been, ripped off, though his father seems to have made money afterwards - I'd guess via a gift of land from the US governement, though if so he seems to have been ungrateful. 'The Theory of the Leisure Class', published in 1899 when he was about 42, caused a stir - or at least that's the story. It precedes Ida Tarbell on Standard Oil by a couple of years.Veblen's writing style is agonisingly plodding, repetitive and dull. He includes a few Latin and other tags. This must have been a deliberate attempt to project an educated image. He took time to explain his use of some English terms (e.g. 'invidious'). Part of his effect is achieved by using words in slightly the wrong sense. He used 'evolution' rather than 'change' - it sounded more up to date. His typescript (or MS) must have been the sort publishers' readers dreaded. I can't quote a sample here for space reasons.----His model of human history is very simple indeed. There *WERE* two types of people and societies:[1] The sedentary village, low on force and fraud. He calls this 'quasi-peaceful'. There's a law of status. (pp 215 & 236). 'Savages' (undefined) have this sort of lifestyle.[2] Barbarians, who hate manual work, and prefer 'exploits'. They are ferocious, self-seeking, clannish, disingenuous. They like hunting. A predatory type. Veblen often calls them 'peace-distubing dolicho-blonds'. (He himself had very dark hair - remember Norway and Sweden separated at about this time.)---------However, *NOW* (about 1900) there is industry.[3] Veblen takes progress as given: 'as populations grow denser..', '.. stage of society..', '.. as the community advances in wealth and culture', are typical phrases. These days, the collective interests of modern industry work against the ferocious or selfish aristocrat type (p 227).4] There is a 'hierarchical gradation of reputability. Ownership on a large scale [is]... the most reputable of economic interests. [then] banking .. law.. the lawyer is exclusively occupied with the details of predatory fraud..' (p.231).-----------Veblen means by the 'Leisure Class' property and company owners, financiers, bankers, lawyers. In other words, anyone not concerned with direct manufacturing. Much of his book is concerned with the way they spend or waste money, and the way other people attempt to follow or imitate their behaviour.What is of value in Veblen?I have to say I was struck by the small number of piquant examples of oddities in spending and consumption; I'd expected more. Dogs as useless deferential mouths to feed; clean clothes uncontaimnated by evidence of work; William Morris's Kelmscott Press. Of men - walking stick, and powdered wig (from Alexander Pope?) On women, bodices, bound feet in China, and general feebleness, were signs of wealth in the husband. He has an odd passage about public parks - men keep the grass tidy, and this is an example of conspicuous consumption, because they are more expensive than cows.He doesn't seem to know about Chinese mandarins' fingernails, British sumptuary laws, rose gardens and knot gardens and huge country houses as statements of things which are attractive, but unnecessary. He doesn't know about follies, or for example the Hell Fire Club and the Parthenon, both of which in their ways offered employment. Moreover he doesn't seem to understand the economics: a US department store would not stock very cheap items - there's not enough money in them and will reduce other sales. They will cater preferentially for richer custiomers - and offer, say, sherry, wine, champagne, brandy and other glasses, just to make more money. Veblen's examples are a mostly natural outcome of normal economics. As further evidence, consider that, if Veblen was right, any conspicuous waste might happen: burning of notes, buying of things just to destroy them.As to the 'leisure class', Veblen, surprisingly, barely considers inherited wealth. New England had many sons and daughters waiting to inherit and the 'leisure class' would seem to fit them perfectly. But Veblen concentrates on other targets. Like Marx, he assumes factory owners just sit back and collect loot - he doesn't seem to realise such people *may* work extremely hard. Similarly, many younger sons of British wealthy families went off to die in various white man's grave parts of the world. For that matter, the 'wolfish earls' in 'Shakespeare' weren't exactly leisurely.Veblen comes across as a man who moved directly from a peasant society into a much more technologically advanced one. (This must be common now, with uncontrolled mass third world immigration into some modern societies.) It's not surprising such people gawp, and feel fear, and boost their egos with cautious contempt. But I don't think ultimately this book delivers very much."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"It's true to say that Veblen's book is one of the great classics of economic theory; however, such a description suggests (at least to non-economists like myself) that the book will be either dull or remorselessly technical. On the contrary, &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; is stylishly written, endlessly startling (for example, Veblen analyses religion as an outgrowth of the gambling instinct), and very, very funny. Its expose of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; (yes, Veblen was the one who invented this famous concept) is as relevant today as it was in 1899, if not more so. Whether or not you agree with all that he says, it's thought-provoking and exciting stuff."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"This opus by Veblen exposes the real meaning of the pecuniary advancement of the working and merchant classes, and the formation of elites based mostly upon money and asset valuation. The transfiguration of the traditional social and individual ethical values that this phenomenon produced, is portraited with clarity and sarcastic intelligence by the author in the book, first published in 1899.Now a classic of economic theory, as well as a text book of social science, it describes the tendencies of consumerism, leisure and the &quot;materialization&quot; of the ideals of the aspiring new princes (or noveau rich) of society. Veblen's vibrant satire of the tendency of the modern individual to believe that real accomplishment is all about aquiring a condition of ostentatious wealth and status, and his analisis of the inception of modern class structure in America, still stand, a century after, as recommended reading for historians and economists.If you are a fervent follower of advertisement, fashion, &quot;glamour&quot; and other modern expressions of consumerism , then you will find a surprisingly fresh portrait of yourself in this book. It worries me that the leisure class and its shallow views and values as described by Veblen, may still today represent elites in America and their religion, as analyzed by professor Lash in his last book &quot;The Revolt of the Elites&quot;. I highly recommend Veblen's best book, to scholars and sociologists at large."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"Known by his contemporaries as the only social theorist to apply Darwin critically, in 1899 Thorstein Veblen published The Theory of the Leisure Class: A Economic Study of Institutions, which was to become the basis from which all further American leisure history and theory stemmed. In his study, Veblen is primarily concerned with the &quot;new rich,&quot; whom he regards as social parasites that retard the growth of modern life. Thorstein Veblen wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class from a perspective that was largely isolated from his own culture, which either aided in his understanding of the Leisure Class or perhaps negatively influenced his opinions due to his exclusion from it. In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen essentially confines man and woman's existence on the planet as a struggle to change and adapt with the growth of their communities. Through this belief, Veblen develops a theme that amounts to the idea of a certain &quot;dominant&quot; type of individual. This individual develops a social structure through dominance in which social advance is sought by others. She/he will feel the discrepancy between the modern life and traditional life during the process. Though Veblen's rhetoric is sometimes anxious, sometimes negative, he actively pursues a specific account of the origins of the Leisure Class through individuals. The struggle for individual advancement eventually expands to include society, and the more individual struggle for advancement in society leads to the accumulation of surplus goods.Surplus of conspicuous consumption by the Leisure Class gives the class license to indulge shamefully in pure conspicuous consumption, where their occupations eventually become leisure itself. These &quot;professions&quot; of the Leisure Class by nature render it closed, and impenetrable by outsiders.Thorstein Veblen wrote the Leisure Class represented the new phenomena of conspicuous consumption compared to pre-Industrialized wealthy communities as well as contemporary working-class ones. But as intellectual inquiry into the topic of leisure has progressed over the past one hundred years, leisure has come to hold a number of definitions and meanings."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"The basic premise of this book is that modern humans have inherited an instinct to compete with each other for material resources. This competition takes place within the context of a small groups that share the spoils of the competition amongst themselves. (Other primates essentially do the same thing). The theory hinges on the question of what happens when a group of people have access to essentially unlimited resources, but still have the competitive urge. Veblen's answer is that they simply compete amongst themselves to see who can afford to be the most wasteful (like the scene in that Woody Allen movie in which two guys start ripping up dollar bills to impress each other). He refers to such waste as \\"conspicuous consumption\\".According to Veblen, the urge to consume conspicuously explains a lot of human behavior, including fashion, sports, and religion. In all cases the consumer wants to demonstrate to his peers that he can't possibly be involved in doing anything useful. A particularly funny consequence of the urge to consume is the notion of \\"vicarious consumption,\\" in which really rich people acquire other people (essentially servants and wives) to do their consuming for them. To emphasize the point they dress up their vicarious consumers in preposterous outfits and require them to perform pointless tasks with high precision (think of a butler in a tuxedo serving a 12-course meal or some such).In this vein, anthropomorphic religions essentially worship the richest guy of all. God is imagined to be so rich that he sits on a throne all day while people in silly clothes (clergy) do nothing but tend to his fabulous mansions (churches). It's an intentionally funny image, although Veblen is careful to say that he's not poking fun at the spiritual aspects of religion, just the form in which modern humans choose to express them.An interesting subtheme is the alliance between the \\"leisure class\\" and the poor, something we see happening today in American politics. In Veblen's theory the alliance occurs because the two classes essentially share the same mindset (obsession with status).Overall the book is fun to read, except for the writing style, which is reminiscent of essays written by high school students who are studying for the SATs."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"This may not be a book to read for recreation, unless you like 1890s verbal locutions, but there are other reasons to read it. The emergence of the economic analysis of Western society might intrigue you. You might discover the origins of such still useful terms as 'leisure class' and 'conspicuous consumption,' among others. You might be curious about author Thorstein Veblen's status-conscious, anachronistic world of working men and idle wives, which reflects upper-class society in his day. Published in 1899, this is a classic in sociology and economic literature, although it is a veritable dreadnought of density. It discusses property, ownership, status and leisure in a turn-of-the-last-century American context. Though scholars call it a 'satire,' the book is neither witty nor ironic. Instead, it is a stolid analytical daguerreotype of a world long gone. We suggest that if you tackle Veblen's old-fashioned, slow-flowing prose, you should do it for the background you may glean and the scholarly satisfaction you may feel when you are done.

His theory of the leisure class reachs significance when compared to the rationality which some economists, classics and neo-classics, ascribe to the human being as an economic agent. I was quite surprised by the elegant style of Mr.Veblen and the fine irony (which he does not admit) with which he treats the rich and noble of his time. Sure, this is a book which could be also serve well times ahead and before Veblen's time."},{"Title":"The theory of the leisure class: An economic study of institutions","review":"I was extremely pleased with this book. It reduces the notion of society to a popularity contest in which fashion becomes the perfect expression of everyone's desire to be praised and noticed. As the American economy shifts from being a breadbasket to being the entertainment capital of a devil in blue jeans world, this book, from a much earlier historical period, shows how America always had the potential to achieve this kind of greatness. More than any other book, this one allows total enjoyment of the thoughts which it expresses. When a mind has been trained to blossom in this way, the greatest danger might be that it could be considered grandiose for daring to make such comments."},{"Title":"The Younger Edda: Also called Snorre's Edda, or the Prose Edda","review":"This seems to be an accurate translation of one of the few books that the old Norse wrote. If you want an idea why they did what they did and how they thought, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Younger Edda: Also called Snorre's Edda, or the Prose Edda","review":"This is our source of most our knowledge on Norse mythology. It is separated into three larger parts...The first is basically an explanation to Christian authorities. Unfortunately, this was written AFTER this mythology was the mainstream religion of the Norse. By the time it was recorded by Snorri (Snorre) Christianity had been spread to this area and to write this book would have been blasphemous without the explanation at the beginning. this is why people may see it as odd, as Andrew, a previous reviewer noted.The second part is the source of the best content, with the stories of the Norse that we have all become so fond of.The third part is a sad effort by Snorri to tell the king of Norway (I think that was it) how awesome he was. It didn't work, as Snorri was killed under commands of that king later on. Because of this bad writing, many believe Snorri didn't write the second part, and that he just compiled information provided by others. If you are familiar with the Poetic Edda, or the Older Edda, you will see that Snorri directly quoted from it's text.These are great stories. Pick it up, and skip to the second part if you can."},{"Title":"The Younger Edda: Also called Snorre's Edda, or the Prose Edda","review":"Great stuff, hard to read but the basic in Norhtend Europe Mitology.

I haven't read any other or more recent editions, but this one was more notes and explanation by volume than original text.If you're seriously interested in the mythology, then I would suggest another edition. I was a little shocked when the notes started out with Adam and Even and gave a hasty summary of biblical and then mythological characters from the ancient Greeks and Romans to explain that Odin and his kin were \\"real\\" mythological people. It was a bit disjointed and confusing at times.If, however, you're just generally curious and cheap like me, then I suppose it's kind of worth it to get a flavor for the original text."},{"Title":"The Big Fall: Living With Hair Loss","review":"If you have any form of hair loss, this is a helpful book.

It includes men, somewhat, but not much. But it's information is valuable for people with all types of hair loss, which is nice.

The book also touches on some of the myths and legends behind the story and gives their resources as well. What I believe to be the main theme of the book, and, quite possibly, the most important, is at the end of the book when the author tells us exactly what the three gifts represent. In a nutshell, Gold is for Kings, Frankincense is for a God, and Myrrh is for man.

This boxed set is perfect for the blessing of the three gifts, which can be combined with the special Epiphany blessing of houses, since the priest can use the Frankincense for incense during the house blessing. Part of the blessing states &quot;From the East the Magi came to Bethlehem to adore the Lord; and opening their teasures, they offered costly gifts: gold to the great King, incense to the true God, and myrrh in symbol of His burial.

I bought one for a gift, and when it arrived I absolutely loved it. So, I ordered another one for myself! The samples of gold, frankinscence and myrrh are very tiny. It is enough that you can examine/smell/experience them, but I did not have to worry about giving it to a friend that was taking an international flight. It is a great gift for those who need to travel; it won't take up too much baggage space.

Thompson Island is one of these. Jenkins has managed to fuse the political crime/terrrorism aspect with this phenomenon and craft a highly taut, well developed techno-thriller. It is a bit slow to develop at first because he has his protagonist get into some academic discussion with his seagoing companion about antarctic currents and plankton fields, but the reader soon gets the gist of its import for the plot. Briefly, Thompson Island was said to have rich deposits of caesium (not really attributed, but since its a lost island, who knows?). Caesium is an extremely rare metal used in Field-emission electric propulsion, a key component for interplanetary spacecraft. His characters are deftly drawn and not mere Bondian caricatures. A good read, informative as well as entertaining."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Miller's The Crucible","review":"This was purchased for a high school sophomore to help with reading and understanding the play.

Yes, it shows us how narrow-minded the Puritans were. It's also an allegory for McCarthyism, for those of you who don't know.

Czech has seven cases that may call for variations in spelling of nouns depending on usage. Adjectives change to follow gender. Conjugation of verbs is critical as the verb form variations substitute for pronouns.When it is no longer enough to be able to ask, &quot;How far to the Charles Bridge,&quot; you must tackle the grammar. There is no better textbook. Students should take classes, if possible, as well.

It's a bit different from the typical grammar resource and I am sure that is related to the fact that it is not so 'modern' in 2010 as it was when it was first published. That's part of the charm I think. As anyone that is attempting this challenging language has learned, resources are not abundant and good resources are even more scarce. I highly recommend purchasing and working through this book. The used price is reasonable.

It is not comprehensive, but it contains most of the words a traveler will need.

After all, if you want to know the Italian word for &quot;left&quot;, you'll very likely want to know the words for &quot;right&quot;, &quot;front&quot;, &quot;back&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, etc. So the book's organization makes it very easy to find a related group of words.There is also an &quot;English-Italian Wordfinder&quot; section that is more like a convention dictionary: look up an English word and find its Italian equivalent.The same author has written a book called &quot;Italian Grammar&quot; that may be of interest.The book is rather small, so it easily fits into a backpack or suitcase.

I am haunted by the despair and terrible things written in these letters. One letter, in particular, outlining the abuse of little girls by the SS, makes one think that Germany will--and should--be forever stained by its past deeds. I am surprised that few people know about this book.The letters were hidden, dropped from trains, left with others--most of the writers died and this is their last testament.This book is the reality, the truth of this time.

I was unprepared for the emotional impact these letters had on me! Many of them were filled with such pain and sorrow that I could not help crying thinking of the deep anguish these hapless victims must have felt during those terrible years, the period of the Holocaust.Some of the letters were written by parents separated from their children (who had found safe refuge far away from the Nazi-controlled territories); some were mere scribbles on post cards by people who had no idea of the horrors that awaited them (those being deported to extermination camps like Auschwitz) - was it better for them not to know of their ultimate fate? There is at times a note of optimism and hope in these letters and postcards;some are final missives written by those who were arrested and convicted of resistance against the Nazis, who were awaiting execution and one notable person is a Wehrmacht sergeant who was executed for rescuing Jews; there are testaments that are much darker in nature - accounts of horrific crimes committed by the Nazis and their collaborators against the Jews, including innocent children.

She acquired her knowledge of French cooking whilst living in the South of France and in this book, Julia Childs was brought in as a consultant.The book was created in 1968 and the photography within the book is fantastic; it shows the French sourcing and enjoying their provisions in a typical French way of life that is sadly missing from today's society.

In fact, the remaining inhabitants of the planet refer to it as Old Earth, which is governed by one man, The Archon Dezendah VII and his heir Filidor Vesh. Last Year (See FOOLS ERRANT) Filidor saved his uncle&#65533;s life and rescued the world from an ancient evil that slithered in from another dimension.Since then Filidor has reverted to his dandified ways because he feels like he&#65533;s not understanding anything that an Archon needs to do. When a pretty woman who had a temper tantrum steals two valuable objects of his, he is sent by his uncle to fetch them back. Accompanying him is his tutor Bassariot who tries to kill him at the first opportunity. Although he fails to do the job, Filidor winds up at the mercy of pirates and it takes all his intelligence (along with the uses of his ear) to get him and his fellow prisoners out of their predicament. The adventures aren&#65533;t over for Filidor who must remain in hiding from his would be killer who had declared him an outlaw. While all this is going on the Archon has mysteriously vanished.FOOL ME Twice is an irreverent book that doesn&#65533;t take itself seriously yet is nevertheless is very entertaining. MATTHEW HUGHES has a distinctive comedic voice that blends well with the action packed story line. The social structure of Earth in the far distant future is very interesting and is one of the reasons this fantasy novel is going to be as successful as its predecessor was.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fool Me Twice","review":"This book was amazing. I had a slight bit of difficulty picking up on the verbose style, but once i'd picked it up, the book was incredible. The book's charm is the author's manner of saying very simple things in a ridiculously complicated way, marking it all the while with nearly slapstick comedy. It's a little bit like the result of the Three Stooges as written by Shakespeare while he was drunk. It's an epic plot, run through with events made funny by how they're presented, along with some parts that are just STRANGE. All in all, a great story, but not for you if you don't like this sort of thing. If you like Douglas Adams, you'll probably like this."},{"Title":"Fool Me Twice","review":"Matthew Hughes's novels Fools Errant, Fool Me Twice, and Black Brillion are set in the far future of Earth, just prior to the era of Jack Vance's Dying Earth. Hughes has captured Vance's style pretty well, and has done a pretty good job of imagining odd societies in the Vancean manner as well. His first novel, while quite enjoyable, was probably a bit too overtly a Vance pastiche. However his own voice has become increasingly developed in his more recent work.Fool Me Twice is a direct sequel to Fools Errant. In the first novel, the hero, Filidor Vesh, nephew to the Archon of Old Earth, was brought to some understanding of his potential responsibilities, and his capabilities. In this novel, he has become the Archon's apprentice, but despite some additional duties, he does not really seem to have fully taken up his role. Indeed, he seems all to willing to let his aide direct his actions, saving all the more time for his favored pursuits: eating, drinking, chasing women.As the novel opens, he more or less simultaneously makes a careless decision to allow exploitation of a remote rural area by some local nobles (named, transparently, Maguffyne); and falls in love with a girl he sees out his window. Not at all surprisingly, upon tracking down the girl he learns that she had come to petition him to protect her land from exploitation by the very nobles he has just supported. Soon he find himself stripped of his seal of office and effectively without an identity.He ends up chasing the girl in an attempt to make amends (and recover his sigil). He falls in with a travelling acting troupe, and later ends up thrown off a ship in the middle of an ocean. Luckily -- to an extent -- he is rescued by a sea creature -- unluckily the creature tows him to slavery on a remote island. Filidor is once again forced to take real responsibility for his life, and for the good of others as well ...The end is never in real doubt, but the journey is very enjoyable. The influence of Vance is very much in view -- fortunately Vance is an author well worth being influenced by. Fool Me Twice isn't a great book, but it's a very diverting read."},{"Title":"Fool Me Twice","review":"Do you like Jack Vance? You'll like M Hughes. Very inventive and entertaining.

I expected something a little more insightful from this sequel, but as its title implies, it's just, well, more of the same. Unfortunately it takes her 400 pages to cover some very basic information in how casino marketing, players clubs, and hosts work.

It is historically known that Rashi's daughters were unusually learned for the time; now Maggie Anton has imagined their stories in a trilogy of novels. The first centers around the oldest daughter, Joheved, who loves learning with her father and dreads the possibility of an arranged marriage to someone who will make her stop studying.Anton brings the medieval world to life in this novel, portraying a time when life was pretty good for the Jews of France, in their valued economic role in the larger community and their part in the feudal political system. The novel shows the family going from a status of impoverished but respected for Rashi's scholarship, to prosperous proprietors of a renowned vineyard as well as a yeshiva, a school for Jewish study.Anton has obviously done a lot of research, and the book is interesting for its portrayal of daily life and the cycle of Jewish holidays in the Middle Ages as for its plot, which sometimes takes a back seat to the didactic portion of the book. Joheved's coming of age and movement into marriage and motherhood provide moments of drama (and yes, romance but the point isn't so much the portrayal of hot medieval sex as it is the earthly delights that are as much a part of Jewish practice as Yom Kippur and eating kosher foods) but what kept me turning the pages wasn't so much a suspenseful plot as the fascinating portrait of a long ago world where religious practice was embedded into every moment of every day. The plot enables one to see every important Jewish holiday of the year as well as all the life cycle events from bris to burial.I enjoyed the book and look forward to the other two books in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"this novel captured the details of day to day life , with a great deal of enlightening comments.

The emphasis on the religious part of her life was a welcome addition to the typical historical novel."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I loved this book. I purchased additional copies to give to family members and friends.This tale is about a family with amazingly modern family dynamics: how they live, love, and learn 1000 years ago. Set during a brief period just before the crusades, when except for roving unaligned bandits, violence is not a part of the every day lives of these French vintners. The family patriarch just happens to be one of the greatest thinkers and teachers in Jewish history--yet he still has to contend with the most modern of issues: being a member of the \\"sandwich generation\\", with an ailing (Alzheimers) parent and precocious children.The fact that there is no war to take center stage allows us the luxury of learning how the everyday populace of rural France lived---the logistics of a very low technological and hygienically challenged society; the tolerance of people with different beliefs and cultures; the blossoming of Jewish traditions many of us think (apparently mistakenly) have existed always---yet were really one man's answer to how to remain observant, and yet still exist in a non-Jewish world.A fast read to enjoy the storyline. The book deserves more attention so you can absorb (painlessly) the history and anthropology it offers. It IS historical FICTION, so a bit of license/imagination in explaining the discovery/naming of champagne can be enjoyed and forgiven.The only thing lacking was a map of the area from and around Troyes to Worms, to put distance in context. Easily fixed by picking up an historical atlas. I intend to read some real history of the era (including the crusades which have yet to occur) so that I'm better prepared to read the next two volumes. I can hardly wait---but apparently I have a year or more in which to delve into the history, as books don't just appear overnight."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I loved this book.

The characters in the story are what keeps this book a page turner though,as the joys and tragedies in their everyday lives and their family relationships develop and grow. This book is educational too, one learns some Torah, Mishnah and Gamara as a side bonus. Couldn't wait to read the next two books in the series, and I was very sad to finish the 3rd and last book.

I knew nothing about medieval French Jews, but having recently read about medieval Spanish Jews, and Byzantine Jews, the subject was of particular interest to me. What's more, for people who know little about Jewish thought and the Talmud it provides a glimpse of the logic of this kind of thinking, which to me was interesting, because it represents a long period of Jewish life which is now over. Of course I imagine that one should have some interest in the subject in order to find this book entertaining."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I would rank Rashi's Daughters with Milton Steinberg's As a Driven Leaf or Donna Cross' Pope Joan as engaging stories of historical figures living in ages past, whose lives were, in important ways, at odds with the prevailing expectations of their day.In Rashi's Daughters, we learn about life in the Champaigne country of 11th Century France -- and Jewish life in particular -- through the lives of a young woman who, while bound by the conventions of her day, was able to use her great intelligence and abilities to a remarkable extent.This was a golden age of Jewish scholarship, and Rashi was a leading light. This was also a great center of the French wine growing industry. How many great scholars today know how to tend vinyards and make wine? To learn something of daily life in Troyes, France, to learn something of Talmud with references to Worms and Mayence (Mainz), important seats of Jewish learning, and to learn so much about viticulture and winemaking to boot in the context of a page-turner of a story was a joy! Ms. Anton has given us a great gift in this book!"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Rashi's Daughter: Johebed by Maggie AntonBook Review by Arthur L. FinkleSolving the Puzzle of Talmud from a Woman's ViewpointAs a long-time educator, I am always on the lookout for the better mousetrap. If you want to learn the rudiments and then some, Rashi's Daughter is just the right fit. A historical novel, Ms. Anton demonstrates many cultural understandings of one of the most famous of the Jewish commentators of the Bible and Talmud.The background is 11th century France, where Rabbi Shlomo ben Yitzchak (Rashi) lives, interprets and acts in his role of father to three daughters. Not having sons, he indulges his daughters, the oldest of whom (Johebed) wants to make the most of her inquiring mind. She knows Bible. Now, unlike the preponderance of women of her day, she wants to learn Talmud.Rashi, seeing that Johebed truly thirsts for knowledge of Talmud, begins to teach her in a Tractate in which she is interested. Thereupon, he builds upon this start.The reaction of his other daughters and his wife is interesting but probably true. Rashi's wife believes that Johebed ought to learn the domestic side of womanhood rather than \\"wasting\\" her time building upon a mind that will not be used in Jewish scholarship. So attuned is the medieval culture, that Johebed sisters also do not see what use such scholarship is. Moreover, they fear that a stigma will attached to their own marriage prospects.Ms. Anton develops Johebed's character in small increments, including the ambivalence she experiences in disappointing the female side of her immediate family and yet reveling in the study of Talmud. This study is generally not about the content of the tractate; rather, it is the process of Rabbinical thinking in order to make rulings about Jewish law, which, generally, governs Jewish life. Such scholarship requires not only a retentive mind but also a reasoning ability not possessed by all. Indeed, although there was universal education in the Jewish communities since the 1st century BCE, fewer than ten of one hundred went on to study Talmud. Johebed is not only in this classification but, in helping other students with their Talmud studies, is actually mentoring male students of Rashi.My Novel Group found that the amount of superstition played a great part in the French Jewish community. They also were impressed that the roles of men and women were so defined by the 11th century. Moreover, the comity between Jewish and Christian was an unexpected benefit. Even the local Christian scholars asked Rashi to interpret the Hebrew Scriptures for them.Maggie Anton has published a superior book. To be followed by the stories Johebed's two other sisters. Reading such entertaining prose demonstrates the Talmudic process; French medieval living conditions; the role of women; and the special role of the eldest daughter of this Jewish intellectual giant.As a teacher, I found that Rashi's Daughter: Johebed, explained the Talmudic process in a way that most people could understand. The explanation of the Hebrew Scriptures in terms of law, values, adages and cultural habits appear in the Mishnah, codified in 200 CE. Then, the scholar studies commentary on the Mishnah, i.e., the Talmud.Then there is something that is extremely difficult to explain to the laity, that is, that process is more important than the content. Further, there has to be total rationality for all 63 Talmudic tractates. And the lesson preparation is often difficult."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Weaving wonderful aaspects of jewish and non-Jewish life into the story of Johaved, Ms. Anton manages to entertain while invisibly educating.For readers who might not be Jewish, it might be helpful to know that Rashi is a revered figure in Judaism - the author of the first comprehensive commentary on the Torah (Jewish bible) and Talmud (Jewish law/history/customs). To this day, Rashi's comments and explanations are printed in most Jewish \\"bibles\\".The magic of this book, in my opinion, is the way that it manages to convey the life of Rashi and his household \\"invisibly\\" - ie. the reader becomes so engrossed in the character of Johaved and the goings-on and relationships of the household that the reader does not notice the incredible amount of historical information that is being absorbed. After reading this book, I feel as if I have a much greater understanding of medieval life - but while reading it, I was simply engrossed in what was going to happen with Johaved and her intended next!This book should definitely not be considered a \\"Jewish\\" book - no prior understanding of Jewish customs is necessary to enjoy such a well-written historical fiction. While Jews may appreciate the texture it gives to a famous but \\"impersonal\\" figure, non-Jews will find themselves enjoying a lovely story, well-written and complex characters and family relationships and a very deft portrayal of life in the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Set in 1068, Rashi's Daughters: A Novel of Life, Love and Talmud in Medieval France is a novel about a winemaker and Talmud scholar, who undertakes an action that would be viewed negatively by the community if it became known - he dares to teach the Talmud to his three daughters.

A forceful novel of the power of learning, faith, and the two sides of love."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"This novel is an excellent encapsulation of Jewish thought. For non-Jews who might be tempted to think that Judaism is just Christianity without Jesus, for literate Jews who have not studied Talmud and want to know what it's all about, and for anyone who wants to understand the evolution of Jewish intellectual history and observation practices, this book is recommended reading.Traditional Jewish Bible scholars weren't merely engaged in hermeneutics -- they were also part lawyer and part judge. And women in traditional Judaism took a strong role in business and commerce because the ideal man was a Torah scholar.Jocheved wants to study Talmud, but Anton did not simply take a woman from 2004 and stick her into 1070 like an extra candle on a birthday cake. Jocheved is not a modern woman ahead of her time, she is a woman of 1070, with all that that implies about world-view.I gave the book four stars and not five because -- although Anton does in an afterward indicate which characters are fictional and roughly summarizes what's true and what's not, she does not go far enough in that regard. She does give the cites for the passages of Talmud that she uses. And her explications of Talmud are concise and approachable. It's interesting that they use moss in a privy, and it's interesting that they hung their clothes on poles. I'd like to see more of this kind of thing. It would be interesting to see, since she's planning a sequel, what she might come up with if she consulted discarded parchments from old synagogues, old coroner's records, and any business communications from the time that are still extant. Maybe she did consult these things, but she quotes from the Talmud -- I'd love to see quotes from these other sources because it would allow the reader to know how much is fact and how much is fiction.Connie Willis in the Domesday Book accomplishes this very well. Or perhaps it's that there are a lot of written sources about 1348 and the plague, and after quoting Agnolo di Tura, a lot less needs to be said:Father abandoned child, wife husband, one brother another; for this illness seemed to strike through the breath and sight. And so they died. And none could be found to bury the dead for money or friendship. Members of a household brought their dead to a ditch as best they could, without priest, without divine offices ... great pits were dug and piled deep with the multitude of dead. And they died by the hundreds both day and night... And as soon as those ditches were filled more were dug ... And I, Agnolo di Tura, called the Fat, buried my five children with my own hands. And there were also those who were so sparsely covered with earth that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured many bodies throughout the city. There was no one who wept for any death, for all awaited death. And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world.As far as plot in Rashi's Daughters, there is very little conflict and suspense. The book is not a thriller or a romance in the strict sense of the term, but these are selling points. \\"Will Jocheved convince Meir that she can study Talmud and still be a Real Woman?\\" would make it a tiresome formulaic romance, not an historical novel. I'm glad there are no heaving bodices, or ripping bodices, or whatever bodices are supposed to do. Instead the real questions are, \\"How does this family survive?\\" and \\"How do other families survive?\\" and \\"What obstacles are there to survival in this Jewish community?\\"To the extent that ordinary events happen to these extraordinary intellects, that is a plus, because it allows the reader to concentrate on the intellectual events of the day.Some people may be put off by the graphic sexual passages, but they aren't stuck in there for prurience's sake: they demonstrate Jewish attitudes toward marital sex, toward men and women, that are extant today, and not merely in 1070. The fact that mainstream traditional Judaism puts such a high premium on passion between married couples -- and not just for procreation -- is an important intellectual and religious distinction (and a surprising one, for folks who have been brought up to believe that religion is repressive to sexuality)."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"As a grad student of Jewish Women's studies and Jewish history I absolutely loved this book.

ALL the villainous characters were Christians; ALL the nice characters were Jews or hoped to be converts to Judaism. Choosing to make two characters midwives is a good idea: this opens discussions of conditions for women in a natural way, and assures that some of the characters, because of their skills, circulate at many levels in the society, from low to high. I would have liked more discussion of the contradictions in Judaism between the literate, Torah reading men (that could never have been all men, though) and their illiterate women counterparts, who believed (in common with pagans) in all manner of demons--which would be at odds with the first commandment.a retired English teacher"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I loved this book!

However, it did not live up to my expectations. In the description on the back, it talks about how Joheved must basically choose between her love of the Talmud and martial happiness. That didn't play out at all in the book. In fact, it was pretty minor. She really didn't keep her studies all that hidden. I was kind of annoyed by the style of writing. It seemed to jump from character to character or event to event without me even realizing where we were going. There was a lot of sex that almost bordered on the ridiculous side.

It describes some of the life of the scholar Rashi but is primarily about the early years of his daughter Yochoved, the details of which must be fictional. Customs of the times are given and raise many questions. Hidden in its pages is an appeal for early feminism. While it was good reading, in retrospect I think it is rather shallow. Much is glossed over or skipped entirely. For example, the role of Rashi's wife, and of other women, is almost entirely as child bearers. There is only one reference to the Crusades, occurring at that time. Some of Rashi's interpretations and decisions are given but not with the background for his reasoning. Another volume about his second daughter, Miriam, is about to be released. I was left with no desire to pursue it."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"The order was received in a very timely fashion.It was as described and I am well pleased with the purchase"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Maggie,Thank you so much for the wonderful trilogy of Rashi's Daughters. I have read the first two and am anxiously awaiting arrival of the third book. My background: I have been a male nurse for over 30 years, have many Jewish friends and I am Catholic. Your books have provided me a greater understanding of the beautiful Jewish faith. Without appearing vain, in our discussion my Jewish friends have been impressed with my knowledge of holidays, Torah, Talmud, and various interpretations of each. On some occasions I have even been able to answer their questions! We have a wonderful tradition of at each meeting taking time to discuss and debate elements of Torah and Talmud. Some were concerned or confused that I might be violating my faith and I explained that as children of Abraham we also embrace and hold sacred all Torah. We have agreed that it is profitable to discuss and debate what we share and embrace in common, rather than to argue differences. I thank you for the wonderful books you have written which not only cover the religious aspects but also the social, political, economic, and cultural ones as well. Of course I study Scripture as well but your books have brought to life the seasons of both faith and life in a manner that has allowed me to retain and understand as opposed to mere rote memorization of facts.Baruch atah Adonai ha-po-race sukkat shalom a-leynu v'al-kol a-mo yisrael v'al YerushalayimShalom,Donald"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I enjoyed this book very much! The historical aspect of where and when the story is written added to the cultural information. I can hardly wait for the next book!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I thought the book was a bit draggy. But as a Jewish conservative woman. I thought it was interesting in the everyday life,in medieval France. How traditional woman were treated in Judiasm, but this is historical fiction so who knows where the history ends and the fiction begins and visa versa.It did make me want to know about jewish law.I did think it was interesting how the Jews and the gentiles got along. How well the french jews were treated during that time. What I found interesting is I never realized how much supersticion there was in the jewish faith, unless it came from the secular world and intertwined. I did enjoy the book on these few points. I did enjoy how Rashi's daughter may have been treated as a talmud scholar. When the mother argued with Rashi that something terrible would happen if they became scholars. Also, How Joheved was treated by the husband and how they were treated by the husband, and it had to be kept secret."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"With historical fiction being one of my favorites I was intrigued at the title and book description of Rashi's Daughters. The book hooked me from the start--but steadily and rapidly declined from there. By the end I was only skimming and no longer interested in the strong libidos of the main characters. I am also unconvinced that the dynamics and relationships were representative of the time period."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Set in 1068, Rashi's Daughters: A Novel of Life, Love and Talmud in Medieval France is a novel about a winemaker and Talmud scholar, who undertakes an action that would be viewed negatively by the community if it became known - he dares to teach the Talmud to his three daughters. The eldest daughter finds her mind and spirit awakened with her learning, yet knows she must keep her knowledge hidden, even from her betrothed. Yet when she and her husband encounter their first crisis, the eldest daughter must make the fateful choice between marital happiness and her true self. A forceful novel of the power of learning, faith, and the two sides of love."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I became interested in this book through a friend. I was fascinated by how the author made these medieval times come alive. Her discussions of medical care, herbology, and most important Talmud and studying were a wonderful backdrop for this entrancing tale.Not being Jewish, I don't really understand the discussions of Talmud; I have not studied them. But, I do, through this book, understand their importance and meaning to Johoved. The author has somehow shared that in her book.I look forward to her next book. If it is as well-written as this, it should be a \\"best-seller\\"."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I am an Orthodox Jew who happens to deeply enjoy history and well-written historic fiction. I have strongly mixed feelings about this book. I am deeply impressed with the research that went into this book as well as Anton's ability to compile an enjoyable story from her research.Unfortunately, it is clear that Anton does not know enough about living the type of authentically observant life that Rashi and his family enjoyed to write about these people without over-laying them with a 21st century mentality.Those of us who follow the traditions given down from parent to child over the generations know that Rashi's daughters did not wear tefillin and learn Talmud because they were rebels. On the contrary, they were very holy women who followed the law to the letter. Judaism is, at its authentic pure level, NOT a sexist religion.Further, those of us who live the observant lifestyle are aware at a bone-deep level the benefits of abstaining from prohibited activites. E.g., the prohibition against mature, unmarried men and women touching at all (not to mention \\"making out\\" or \\"snogging\\" or what have you), along with the observance of the laws of married life, create an intense, passionate bond between husband and wife. No intelligent woman (or man) who has lived this lifestyle and learned significant amounts of Torah (the term Torah is often used to include the Talmud, Mishnah, Midrashim, etc. - basically all of the accumulated studies) would be foolish enough to put themselves in a position such as the female characters in this book found themselves with their \\"beaux.\\"To clarify what one of the other reviewers stated, yes, Jewish women at that time were mostly illiterate - especially as regards to Judaic studies. But so were most of the Jewish men. Only the special few - those with outstanding mental abilities or those with the finances to pay for an education - were able to learn enough to read and/or write Hebrew. And learning more than that was even harder to accomplish.On the other hand, Anton's portrayal of Rashi's mother as an active, educated intelligent woman who ran her own business is strikingly accurate. Plus, I enjoyed learning about the lifestyle and history of Jews living during the time of Rashi.I really would have preferred to give the book 3 1/2 stars or even 3.75 stars, because I do think it is very well-written and interesting. Unfortunately, books which do not portray Torah true Judaism accurately tend to do more harm than good. From the other reviews I have read, this already seems to be the case."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Rashi's Daughters quickly draws the reader into a well- researched, brilliantly-nuanced medieval world rich with timely details that are fascinating to us today. Hygiene and herbal remedies of the time -- remedies that could well be relevant to our needs today -- share space with subtle treatments of timeless life issues such as sexist and non-sexist traditions, premarital sex, respect for others, and details of viticulture and winemaking, all with a Jewish perspective.We REALLY care about the characters, both because Maggie Anton is a marvelous writer, and also because we know that many were real people who were important to Jewish history, law, letters and culture.I loved reading this book out loud with my 86 year old mother, who loved it! If I had a daughter over the age of perhaps 15, I'd read it out loud with her, too! This book could well be appropriate, as well -- and a great \\"ice-breaker\\"-- for groups discussing Jewish orthodox sex issues. While certain explicit sexual descriptions may not be appropriate for younger children under the age of 15, other chapters and sections of the book are perfect for reading out loud to children of any age, and may well initiate interest in Talmudic study, history, and current events. This book is a true tour de force of historical fiction, and I can't wait to read the next books of the trilogy and bury my nose in Maggie Anton's words and worlds. Mazal Tov to writer and readers alike! This book is a major gift to the greater Jewish library, although non-Jews will also love it and find it fascinating. Parental discretion is advised for chidren under 15 reading certain parts of the book. The rest of us can dig in and relish it all!"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"How often do you encounter the situation that you start a new book, and all you need is a cup of tea and limitless time to feel like you're in paradise? Well, that's what it was like when I opened \\"Joheved\\", the description of Rashi's oldest daughter's life. Maggie Anton succeeds in painting a lively picture of the times, including their way of making a living, gender roles and limitations, family life and - last not least the religious life. All is interwoven into a colorful dynamic presentation plus - from a woman's perspective. From time to time I forgot that it was fiction; historic fact and Anton's fantasy blend easily. The reading pleasure was well worth the 2 very short nights of sleep, and I only wished she could write the second book as fast as I read!"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"This is an interesting and compelling book. I have enjoyed reading it very much. It could almost act as a text book for the Jewish year of festivals and how they were celebrated in medieval France. The characters are alive and clear, none of them too black none of them too white - but realistic, even poor Rivka whose attributes still live amongst us today i am afraid.I loved this book, it is the best book I have read since the Kite Runner. It opens a door into the past and into Jewish culture which is not going to fade from my mind. I can't wait to read Miriam especially after the tantalizing glimpse of the first chapter. An unfair tidbit ! When will it be done ?"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I appreciate all the research that Ms. Anton compiled into such a wonderful story of family challanges as well as everyday life.I love the way that Ms. Anton incorporated so much history (with Talmud quotations throughout the novel) as well as how to make wine in 11th Century France. At a time when teaching Talmud to a daughter was forbidden, I was able to see a human side of a father who made a decision to teach his daughters and go against what was \\"law\\" of the time. The story pulled me into a time where people got along with each other and respected each others differences. Women of all cultures can learn from Joheved, the eldest daughter. She discovered that she didnt have to hide her true self from her husband in order to be married.I cant wait for Book II. A quick read that is hard to put down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Maggie Anton not only makes you feel as if you are living during Rashi's time it teaches so much. I really enjoyed the book and can't wait for Book Two!"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"This book is a marvel! With amazing research, it gives apanoramic view of Jewish life in Medieval France. Superstitions,technical innovations and historical events are experienceddelightfully through the characters' eyes, and the wisdom ofRashi is priceless. Fast-paced and engrossing, Rashi'sDaughters is hard to put down. I can't wait for Book 2!This is a story that was waiting to be told. Many, many kudos to Ms Anton. She has written a classic!"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"This novel transported me to another time. I felt as if I were there. Rashi's Daughters gives such an intimate portrayal of family life, of growing up, of first love, and of Jewish traditions from long ago, that it feels real. Even the ways the characters tend Rashi's vineyard and produce wine or turn skins into parchment are fascinating. Anton brilliantly weaves in quotes from Mishnah and Talmud about everything from the Sabbath to sex and exposes a thousand years of Jewish thinking in the process. It was hard to put the book down. I highly recommend this book for people who love novels that bring characters alive and tell engaging stories about real life. If you liked the Red Tent, you'll love Rashi's Daughters. I'm glad to see that a sequel is in the works."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"First of Three Novels by Maggie Anton regarding the three daughters of Rashi, a Jewish teacher and philosopher in 11th century France. The author's extensive research is evident on almost every page. Beautifully written with wonderfully descriptive narratives; it is the story of the oldest daughter, Joheved. She loved watching her father teach and wanted to learn along his male only students.I didn't think I would necessarily like an historical novel, but it felt so good; it was easy to become part of the culture of the day. While it is a novel, I believe much of it is based upon real events.Really enjoyed this book; can't wait to read Books II and III."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Historical fiction is my favorite genre of books. I especially like stories involving strong women. This was very interesting to me. I learned that at that period, many average middle class Jewish men and many women were educated. Culturally, the holy scriptures shaped all aspects of daily life, and worship in addition to being spiritual, was a big part of social life and entertainment at the time. The book examines many talmudic passages which becomes tiring, but I think worth the effort in understanding the characters. If you enjoy learning about historical cultures, this would be for you. For those looking for action, they probably would not like it. I for one found it a good read and will read the next books in the series."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I have read all the volumes, but I will start here. It was a wonderfully told story, giving insight to the 11th Century lives of those who lived in Troyes, mostly and France. Its descriptions are vivid and it give us women with brains and a great father, that fostered those brains. Her poetic license gives us interest and a view of what women of this ilk would do, perhaps, if allowed to flourish. Beautifully, written. Well presented."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"By far, it is one of the best historical novels I've read in a long time. Actually, it is the kind of story that I started in the morning and finished a couple of hours later in the night, due to the author's fascinating art of writing. As a reader, you are part not only of the life story of the oldest Rashi's daughter, Joheved, but also of the Medieval Jewish France and of the daily life of Rashi himself. The merit of the story is that you can go far beyond the circumstances of the reality and you enter the particular universe created by the author. Now, I am looking curiously forward to read the next two volumes of the trilogy!"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down. It was fascinating to learn about Talmud, Medieval Jewish life in France and the characters came alive. This made it a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I loved the book because I learned so much about the Jewish faith and the life of people, in particular women, of that period. The inclusion of the words from Rashi, the Talmud, and the Tractates made it seem even more real and informed me. I recommend this book and the other 2 in the series very highly."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Full of historical detail, providing insights into Jewish life in a time period not often read about, and in situations that were practically unheard of, Joheved was a lovely character to follow. I fully enjoyed this book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"This series is worth reading if only to gain an understanding of Jewish life during Rashi's time. The sections explaining Talmudic interpretation are well researched and unique to this genre. There is a surprising amount of sexual content. The plot lines become redundant and a bit predictable with each book in the trilogy. This however does not detract from the enjoyment of the series and I would recommend all three books."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Already ordered Book II in the 3 book series and can't wait to read it. Not only a great read, but learned a lot of things I was not aware of."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"The commingling of the topics of love and the Talmud I found intriguing and I was not disappointed. I think it would be helpful to know who Rashi was--and I did--before reading the book, but it is not essential as one learns much about him as well as this daughter. The details about Jewish life in medieval France provide an aura of truth to the story, but much of it had to be imagined by the author as very few records are available to support the biography of Joheved.Anton's knowledge of the period and the common practices of Jews at the time enabled the author to project a verisimilitude that enhanced the tale. Somewhat surprising facts--or what appear to be revelations about the emotional life of the protagonists and others--are interspersed with other intimate details. Insights helpful to understanding the characters are the result.I would recommend this little book for people who are interested in life in medieval times and for those who have a special interest in the life of Jews in that period, as well as for women--and men--who enjoy an unusual romance. I would suggest that the book serves as an excellent entry to the next two books about the two other daughters."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I am a fan of historic fiction and recently purchased both Books I and II to take on a vacation. While the first 100 pages of Book I held my interest, it deteriorated into little more than a trashy romance novel with little historical value. Book II, however, was AWFUL. Anton makes baseless accusations about loveless marriages and sexual proclivities of real people, without regard for the truth. She admits, in a note at the end, that there is NO BASIS for her allegations. This goes way beyond mere \\"artistic license\\". It is irresponsible and thoughtless for Anton to treat her subjects this way. I urge the publisher to be more careful with regard to subsequent books by this author."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I loved this book and became so mezmerized with life and expectations of these times that it was difficult to put down. The characters were believable and thoroughly enchanting. Not only did I enjoy being transported to Medieval past, I gained fascinating incite into the Talmud and Talmudic argument. A special delight for me was learning about the vineyards and intricacies making of wine at that time. I can't wait for Miriam's novel to be published!"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I couldn't put down this book, it is one of the greatest historical fiction works I ever read. I surely hope that Maggie writes the other books in this series for I cannot wait to hear the rest of Rashi's daughter's stories."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Both interesting and entertaining, this book kept me reading late into the night and forgoing my normal tv routine so I could find out what would happen next."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I love historical fiction and being Orthodox I was excited to read this book. Well.. this book is well researched and thorough in historical dates and some details, but also entirely unbelievable in many ways. First of all, Rashi's daughter's would never, ever have touched a man, even their betrothed before marriage. All the secret \\"rendezvous\\" and sexual descriptives are highly unbelievable and quite frankly, a slap in the face to all of the religious beliefs and morals that these young woman believed in. Just a warning I wish I had before I wasted my time reading half of this book: this book is not kosher."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I bought this after reading all those great five-star reviews. Huge disappointment. An avid reader and Jewish community professional, I'm always wanting to find ways to understand Jewish history and culture in deeper ways.Barely made it through this thinly disguised catalog of family situations that, admittedly, reflects a lot of significant research by the author. We hear about betrothal, marriage, childbirth, miscarriage, death in childbirth, a breach birth, impotence, circumcision, death, mourning etc etc. Plus a lot of material about relations between Christians and Jews and between popes and royalty / nobility. And of course, a vast amount of Talmud, herbalism, and wine-making lore being shown off. Most not very enlightening or well integrated.If the prose were more compelling, the pacing more exciting, we could have a novel here... but instead it's a mishmash of uninspired ideas, not a pleasant turn of phrase, a thought-provoking metaphor, or a fascinating character in view.Who might like this book? The Sisterhood reading club of an orthodox synagogue, one that secretly wants to read bad-porn-quality descriptions of sexual intercourse? A re-enactors club about to branch out into early medieval herbal cures?But I did like the scene where they \\"invented\\" champagne. Amazingly, the author does not give a clue on what basis she makes the claim that Rashi's family can be credited with this most significant of human advances."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"I love the book! I think Maggie Anton did a great research on this subject."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"This was a difficult book to review. Several times I started to put it down but I kept reading right through to the end. This has nothing to do with it being a good book, but that this is just not the type of book I normally prefer. I found the book a bit tedious but one thing kept me going. The one thing that kept me going was the way the book ties everyday life to the Talmud. As a matter of fact, this may be the best introduction yet to Talmud since it provides little snippets of Talmud weaving it into everyday life. That was a nice touch and as far as I know a unique one. If you would like to have a taste of what the Talmud is all about then this might be the place to start."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"While interesting and chock full of historic detail, I was disappointed with the whole series. Rashi's daughters are bourgeois Jewish ladies in 11th Century France. I was hoping to read about the experience of the whole community in this era, but bourgeois is all I got. I also got the distinct impression that I was not the intended audience for this series, and that's an unpleasant feeling. Get it from the library, don't buy it."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Maggie Anton writes well and infuses her knowledge of Jewish history throughout the novel. I found the setting of 11th century village life immensely interesting, along with the religious practices involving the Talmud and the role of women at this time. I will eventually pick up the sequels to this book."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"As has been mentioned above, I really wanted to like this book. We chose it for our Jewish book discussion club. I found it very disappointing. It was plotless and focused on such silly pointless things (the details of sexual encounters) instead of the rich historical surroundings. At least it did not engage me at all and I'm astonished to read so many glowing reviews. I learned nothing from the book. Every time it verged upon a great story it veered back to the plodding go-nowhere writing. Sorry. Didn't like it."},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"the philosophical and talmudical discussions are very shallow - this could have been a great book"},{"Title":"Rashi's Daughters, Book 1: Joheved","review":"Rashi was one of the Jewish religion's holiest men of the Middle Ages. His daughters were known for their piety and generous natures. They are held up in many places as the prime example of how a Jewish woman should live.The disgusting distortion of the truth that appears in this book portrays them as sexual perverts and low-lives. The author admits that she made up most of the book, and only based it loosely on historical fact.Why on earth did anyone see fit to publish such an insult to these inspiring women? What a disgrace that this book ever saw the light of day.I have bought the book, and have thrown it into the bin. Even that was being kind on it. Don't waste your money on this rubbish.If you want cheap sexual stimulation, buy yourself some pulp fiction. If you want a historically accurate account of great women, but something based on the truth.On no account buy this appalling book."},{"Title":"Of God Who Comes to Mind (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics)","review":"&quot;The Infinite concerns me and encircles me, speaking to me through my own mouth. And there is no pure witnessing except of the Infinite. This is not a psychological wonder, but the modality according to which the Infinite comes to pass, signifying through him to whom it signifies, understood insofar as, before any engagement, I respond for the other (p.75)&quot; Thus spoke Emmanuel Levinas. Provocative, illuminating, largely inaccessible as only Levinas can be, this text considers the relationship of the self to the other through the epistemological lens of the a priori existence of a God to whom we respond before understanding the nature of the order. Levinas asserts that, in responding for the other - in taking our neighbor as our brother - we become, in fact, his hostage. For Levinas, this is the necessary trauma of awakening. Some portions of the text are totally incomprehensible, but this is to be expected, and is part of the labor of understanding his philosophy.

Deals with the ins and outs of island hotel ownership in a quirky fun manner. It is easy to understand Jimmy Buffet's obsession with the book."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Really fun book... I highly recommend it if you are contemplating a move to the islands... comical, really."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Even at 400 pages, I was still sorry when this one ended. It moves along swiftly from one incident to the next with a wonderful flow. It's stuffed with memorable scenes and characters. Yes, Norman has a rough time of it, but there's enough success and triumph over the odds that it stays fun. The finale brings several plot threads together, then adds a couple of surprises. (It was surprising to me, anyway.) The only jarring notes were pretty casual strains of homophobia and racism, but that's probably more a by-product of its time and setting than anything else.Certainly worthwhile."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I read DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL a long time ago, right after Vesta and I sailed into the Caribbean, where we lived for several years, sailing between St. Martin in the North and Venezuela in the South. This book seemed to be a must read for cruising sailors (people who live on sailboats). At least once every other month Vesta and I were somehow roped into a discussion or an argument about Mr. Paperman in a sailor's bar somewhere about just what island Mr. Wouk was writing about when he created the fictional place called Amerigo. Trinidad was my pick, Vesta liked Grenada, St. Lucia was a favorite among many cruisers as was Dominica. I never, in all the time I lived on a boat in the Caribbean, met anyone who did not love this book, who did not think that Herman Wouk was dead on accurate in his portrayal of the island life or the island people.Norman Paperman quits his PR job in New York and buys a hotel on the island of Amerigo in the West Indies. This was supposed to be an easier, more laid lifestyle. However, as poor Norman soon learns, things are done differently in the islands and they are done in Island Time. They have a saying in the Trinidad that goes something like this, \\"In America they live to work, in Trinidad we work to live.\\" A job is what you do to pay the rent, put food on the table, buy rum, maybe ganja if you're into that, pay for a night out, the movies, a car. And that pretty much sums up how many Islanders think. You are not, as you are in America, defined by what you do for money and what you do for money isn't taken very seriously, so, as Norman finds out, if someone says they are going to show up at your hotel and fix something at 9:00, don't be too upset if you don't see him till noon, or maybe not till the next day.Mr. Wouk has delivered a funny story here and if you are thinking about a Caribbean vacation, a must read book. You can hear the pan music, feel the hot breeze as you look over the cool blue Caribbean Sea while you page through this magnificent book. I can't say enough good about DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Some of the other reviews give a synopsis, so I won't repeat that effort. I read this book during and around some south Florida vacationing and enjoyed it (the book AND the vacations) immensely. The story is good, the writing is tight and engrossing.In a nutshell. I have Island fever and a friend recommended that I read this book before I did anything crazy. It helped with the fever, I guess. The book made very clear that the ... professionalism and ... \\"sense of urgency\\", yes, those are the right words, of workmen in the islands ain't all that. So, any plans to buy some dirt and have a home built should be approached with great caution.A real telling point was when Atlas called the banker (I think those are the right folks) a \\"croupier\\" because people come to the island, build for a while, go broke, and go away. The bank ends up owning the partially built homesteads and then spins 'em out to the next influx of investors. I must be careful.As I reflect back on the story, I think that I, like Norman Paperman, am wound a little to tightly for more than island vacations."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"If anyone is interested in working in the hotel business, this is a must read. It was written as fiction, but it could be a textbook for the hospitality industry. As a hotelier, if anyone says to me, &quot;What is it like doing what you do?&quot;, I tell them to read this book. If you work in a hotel, you will experience all that Norman does, and probably then some. Of course, some of us psycho's thrive on this stuff."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Readers might think this is all a bit fantastic as written down by Herman Wouk. It is not. I am living on such a small tropical island and the situation is so similair that I am convinced that it is situated here on this island. I see it happen every day, people coming here from the civilized world, falling in love with the beautiful place, and seeing thousands of great business opportunities. Until they actually start, and see that things are going wrong, one by one, or all at the same time, the latter more likely. For some reason things simply do not work out, and they happen exactly like descibed in this book. It is written in a wonderful style, and raise signs of recognition all the time. And it is a fair warning to all those who want to flee from the urban world to a tropical paradise."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Don't stop the Carnival is a vacation without the travel. Although some of the language is dated, the story is great and the characters seem so real. It really allows the reader to escape their current place and take a trip with Norman to the tropics. Fans of fiction and fun should enjoy this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Herman Wouk's &quot;Don't Stop the Carnival&quot; is a great joyride from the first page to it's unexpected ending. I would suggest it to any serious reader in the mood for a good tale..."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"This is one of very few 5 star books in my opinion. It certainly transcends time and its sense of place is so inviting. A philosophy of life that states &quot;in the end you are who you are.&quot;Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I read this adventuresome tale after hearing Buffett's soundtrack. I was expecting a predictable yet descriptive 'Buffettesque' tale of the tropics. I was pleasantly surprised and extremely taken back by this novel. It is very descriptive, Herman Wouk's way not Buffett's, but what made it an absolute masterpiece was Wouk's ability to introduce and familiarize the reader with so many unique characters. Although written in the 60's, an attentive reader can sense that Wouk has generalized the storyline enough to fit ANY time."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"If you have ever dreamt of leaving the rat race and moving to the Caribbean to retire, this book will make you think twice. Tourists to the Caribbean often fall in love with the beauty of the island, but seldom experience life on the island. This book will make you respect and understand the natives' popular saying, &quot;No problem, Mon.&quot;"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Wouk has captured the spirit of the islands, but in a simpler time unfortunately long past. While many of the frustrations of life in paradise are amusingly presented, the serpent has been in the garden and the apple has been tasted. There are few instances of &quot;quaint and gentle island culture&quot; remaining today. There are quite too many demagogues and modern politicians here now. It was refreshing to read how it once was and to be able to see around us the remnants of a kinder and gentler time past. Wouk has remarkable ability to make us laugh at our foibles and see ourselves in his characters. Thorougly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"There are novelists, writers, natural story tellers and alas, people who scribble. Fortunately for us we are blessed with individuals like Herman Wouk who is not only a novelist, but a true story teller who leaves the scribblers to their own little corner of the world. On the other hand, unfortunately for us, we readers tend to have the attention span of ferrets after 10 cups of strong coffee and so many of us leap to the latest and the greatest in the world of publishing, and seemingly forget that which was good several years ago, is still as good and fresh as the date it was written. Don't Stop the Carnival is one of those works that is becoming lost in the scramble and is being consigned to the bottom shelves of libraries and used book stores, as the literally hundreds of new books are being published each day...what a pity! We need to slow down a bit and give many of these older works a reread now and then. We are missing so much!Not only is Herman Wouk a good story teller; I was first hooked on his work with The Caine Mutiny and Marjorie Morningstar years ago, but he is also a very funny man, and probably one of the best builders of fictional characters we have been fortunate enough to have had amongst us for the past fifty years or so.I note in the reviews here that the plot of this story has been done to death and there are quite a number of very nicely done reviews that give us a great overview. Briefly though, we have a rather tired New York PR man who has absolutely had it with his life and does what most of us have wanted to do at some point in our lives; some of us have had several of these episodes, and at the same time is going through major big time midlife crises. He does what many dream of and few actually do...he packs up and heads for the Islands! Always keep in mind that Norman Paperman, or antagonist, is a very, very flawed man! I ask though, who of us in not?Through an odd set of circumstances, Norman Paperman ends up running a hotel on the island of Amerigo (a fictional island) in the West Indies. Sounds like the novels we read where a rich Englishman dumps it all for a hotel or home in Tuscany doesn't it? Well, Wouk is not only a great writer, but he is also a very, very funny man and if you couple this with his sheer genius for character development, you have a very potent combination of a wonderful read. This work is simply dripping with realistic, funny and quirky individuals who make up a rather unique island society...we get a glimpse of the good, the bad and the ugly but for the most part all hilarious.Now the reader or potential reader needs to keep a couple of things in mind when picking this work from the shelf. First is that the setting is in the very late 1950s and very early 1960s. Indeed much has changed since then. We as a people have done our best to muck about a mess things up; but to state that this book is invalid due to being \\"dated\\" boarders on ludicrous. That is like saying that Pride and Prejudice, Emma and books of that time and ilk are no longer valid because they are \\"dated.\\" Give me a break! Secondly, the silly claim that the book contains a note of racism is equally ridiculous. We in this country tend to take great offense if an author portrays our region as being anything but East Coast or West Coast sophisticated urban. Silly, silly, silly. Most of use to not have the accents of the talking heads we see on T.V. each night on the evening news (boring, boring, boring) and the majority of us have certain regional traits, ideas and beliefs. This is a good thing. I live in the hills of the Missouri Ozarks. For me to run around an pretend that I have the same attitude, social background and outlook on life as some upper crust Bostonian is simply unrealistic and not being true to what I am...for better or for worse. Also, keep in mind that this is a FICTIONAL WORK, and not a study of indigenous people and non-indigenous tourists, scallywags abound, loveable and unlovable people inhabit this story and are mixed together in a fictional setting.Enough editorializing...This is one fine read. Wouk is able to pull off what many writers simply would be unable to make believable. Just when you think that things could not get worse and cannot figure out how the author could possible make it worse or funnier, Wouk does and does it with class. It is funny, has great characters and will keep you turning pages way past the time when you should be in bed sleeping; for the most part chuckling while doing so. Like many, I was not overly fond of the ending, but hey, it was not my book and if I want a book with an ending I personally want, then I figure I should go out and write my own book.For a entertaining read, I can hardly name a better work nor can I name a better work that will stick with you for quite some time after its completion.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"A must for anyone who ever even thought of purchasing property out of the US.Enamored of the bucolic locale and tropical breezes of your island vacation?

(any one who includes West With The Night is Ok with me) I have lived in the tropics. I found the book to be a dated cliche ridden piece. I know it was written to reflect 1959 but it does not translate in to the present.

Book presents nicely"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Our book club didn't enjoy this book. We expected more out of it and were disappointed. We didn't enjoy the characters, or even the setting. We prefer page turner books where you get hooked after the first 50 pages, this one wasn't like that."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"If the first 23 pages of this book gives any indication as to the rest of it, I would never buy this book. Aside from being boring, it reads like a typical racist and ethnocentric account of a so called &quot;third world&quot; country -from a white man's view. Why can these accounts never be balanced? From reading the excerpt, you get the idea that the Caribbean is nothing but sand and surf, beautiful, but filled with ignorant, lazy natives who need the benefit of the white man and his ways. If this what Herman Wouk really thinks of the Caribbean and his people, he really doesn't know a thing about us!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"None of the female characters in this book fare well. The only beautiful, cultured, deeply intelligent woman, Iris, is villanized for being a beautiful, cultured, deeply intelligent woman, who drinks heavily and can only find true love with married men. Iris's biggest crime is that she's not Jewish. She has a love affair with Norman Paperman, then conveniently dies after a binge that reveals puffy eyes, and a mean temper. (The only other casualty is a gay man, killed by a police officer simply for being gay). The other women include Norman's wife Henny, who tolerates his affairs and spends most of the book in bed with a mysterious malady, leaving Norm free game for Iris. When Henny recovers she's appealingly thin, in contrast to Iris's alcoholic bloat, a lively do-gooder always ready to forgive her husband's indiscretions. In a modern film adaptation, she'd be re-named Hillary, her slim ankles a miracle of liposuction. Their daughter Hazel, pretty enough to make her own father drool, is a fool. The African/Caribbean women (and men) are either ethnic stereotypes or poseurs. Shame on you, Herman. Did you hate your mother? Did a tall blonde woman spank you in nursery school? I'd like to read your analyst's review of this book."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager in the late 60s and really loved it. My mother bought it from the Doubleday Book Club for $1.00. I kept the book on my bookshelf until recently when I went on a trip to New York and then to the Caribbean. I don't remember any of the book because it was so long ago that I originally read it. It was fun going from New York and then on to a cruise in the Caribbean while reading this story. Herman Wouk is a wonderful storyteller. I read the Winds of War years ago and loved that too. But for an entirely different \\"flavor\\" please read this book. Then buy Jimmy Buffett's musical, Don't Stop the Carnival. It's quite wonderful too!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Very entertaining and humorous book. Provides real insight into the lifestyle and psychology of the black Caribbean islanders."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Wouk published this lighter-than-his-usual story more than 40 years ago, but it is not dated. A New York agent, recovering from a heart attack, visits a small (fictional) Caribbean island, is swept away by its beauty and apparent tranquility and buys a resort, to run himself. And then the fun begins. As one might imagine, all kinds of problems with building maintenance and eccentric local help underlie the image of paradise. Wouk is a masterful story-teller, easy to read, and not as superficial as the premise might suggest."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"This is the book for anyone who has considered throwing it all in and running away to the Caribbean. Wouk paints a hilarious picture of a mainlander trying to make it as a resort operator in \\"paradise.\\" We soon learn that swaying palms and stunning sunsets aren't always what they're cracked up to be. Although \\"Don't Stop the Carnival\\" is fiction (right down to the name of island where it takes place) it's a wonderful behind the scenes look at what could be going on while you're basking on the beach sipping your rum punch on vacation. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I just read this after a trip to the US Virgin Islands and it certainly helped prolong the vacation for me. Anyone who has ever unsuccessfully tried to superimpose our northern sense of urgency into any minor crisis in the tropics, such as lost luggage, missing captains, etc., can relate to this book. Set in 1959 (and written in '65 I believe), the book treats such hot topics as inter-racial romances, non-traditional families and ethnic stereotypes with a respect that our society has yet to catch up to, in my opinion.My only two beefs are 1) at times it was too over-the-top in comic misery - like one of those action scenes that goes on longer than you can even pretend possible, and 2) the very ending is simply out of place and almost a cruel trick - I can't say any more without revealing it.Fans of Jimmy Buffett's novels will see a likely source of inspiration for Jimmy's writing style in this book."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"If you are looking for an easy, fun quick read this is your book. There were some serious moments, but a great escape book for the beach. I have to admit that I cannot see it as a musical, but with Jimmy Buffett anything can happen."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I read \\"Don't Stop the Carnival\\" after a short vacation on St. Croix. I could actually visualize the places described as I was reading, and it made the story all the more enjoyable and believable. Wouk's descriptions of the local inhabitants of \\"Kinja\\" was right on the money. I couldn't help but cringe at some of the situations the main character found himself in. It was a funny page turner with a touch of drama."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I first read this novel about 35 years ago. Since then I have enjoyably re-read it several times, each time finding something new. It is probably one of the most absorbing tales I have read and helps me enormously to relax and enter into the story. I sometimes 'feel' as if I am on the island with the characters! My daughter is reading it now - after badgering her for some years to give it a go. Needless to say she is enjoying it too. Very witty and so very well written."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I've read some reviews on Wouk's \\"A Hole in Texas\\" of people who were surprised that he can write \\"light.\\"I read \\"Don't Stop the Carnival\\" many years ago and I remember laughing out loud as I was reading it. Let me tell you, Mr. Wouk DOES have a sense of humor! Don't be afraid to try something different from this master storyteller."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Despite the fact that this book was set in 1960's Caribbean, its elements are essentially true and startlingly current. I live and work in and around the Caribbean and have read this book at least twice over the years. Have also read it in parts as it suits me or as it suits my mood. It is almost required reading for any expatriate who is lured to the laid back nature of the Caribbean during a vacation trip and who ventures to think that (s)he might like to carve out a piece of it for peaceful retirement and &quot;do some survival business&quot; at the same time. Have often mused that travel planners and agents should offer a copy to those would-be paradise seekers. It's timeless Caribbean with all of its subtleties and raucousness! Don't think anyone has done a better job since...except perhaps Margaret Atwood's Bodily Harm."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"&quot;Don't Stop the Carnival&quot;, a rare comedy by the always talented Herman Wouk, chronicles the travails of a middle-aged Jewish man who wants to start his life afresh as the owner of a hotel on a (ficticious) sleepy West Indies island. Everything seems to go wrong, but eventually through ingenuity and luck (and the &quot;carnival spirit&quot;) all turns out well in the end. Wouk observes the island lifestyle, warts and all, with great accuracy. A very enjoyable read: comedy and pathos are well-blended.However the book has its quirks. Firstly, it is rather dated. You can tell when he refers to JFK airport as Idlewild airport. Also, Herman Wouk takes great effort to tell the reader that the leading character is Jewish ... and is seemingly paranoid about it. While perhaps this is somewhat characteristic of Jewish Americans back then, I suspect this is more of a personal trait of the author being expressed into this character (..Herman Wouk is a noted author on Judaism and Zionism). I found it to be a bit over the top, but not really bothersome.Bottom line: a well-observed comic novel. And as always, Herman Wouk writes the most readable prose."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"This book has everything. It is full of the hot, crazy island plot that you can only imagine. It is a wonderful story that is very entertaining and really a vividly written book with good character development. It will keep you entertained as well as make you think of buying that Gull Reef Club and try your hand at the islands."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Herman Wouk lived in St Thomas back in the 50's and it is generally believed that Don't Stop the Carnival was based (in part) on real people who were living on the island at that time. In fact when the novel was published he became a persona non grata in some circles. New arrivals to the Caribbean are always advised to read this book, which provides a most insightful look into how things worked down there - and still do. A very funny yet ultimately sad story, this is a story that is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I was so inspired by Jimmy to read and I did. I absolutely loved it. It told about a man who did what everyone wants to do, live on a beutiful tropical island. But what don't think about is that how much of a nightmare it can become. If you read this book, be sure to get the CD by Jimmy Buffet to listen to while reading."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I had to hear Jimmy Buffet's take on this book before I was pursuaded to buy it.The first word that comes to mind is,CUTE.Mr.Paperman had to be a moron,so thank god it is a story.So,so good,typical of Mr.Wouk,vivid and poiniant.He takes you on a journey to fairy land,sets you up then,pop,reality check.One of thoes authors who grabs you and will not let you put the book down until you are finished reading it.Excelent read."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I also got &quot;into&quot; this book after buying Buffett's recent album of the same name. When I bought the book I didn't pay attention to when it was written. Given the time when Wouk authored the story, it's not a bad read. I had hoped for a more &quot;modern&quot; story though. I laughed at several of the mishaps that befall Norman (the main character), but after a while, I was tired of everything &quot;having&quot; to go wrong. Perhaps I am naive of life in the tropics, or am overly optimistic, but it's difficult to believe that many things would go wrong simultaneously. Overall, I'd have given the book 3.5 stars if possible, but rounded to four based on the relation to the Buffett album."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I read this book as a teenager when it first was published in 1965 and, frankly, I didn't think much of it. Now in my mid 40s, I decided to reread it and, predictably, found new meaning in what Wouk's Norman Paperman went through. Beside being fast and fun reading, this is a must for anyone of any age who thinks moving away from &quot;the grind&quot; to some fantasy locale is the answer to all of life's many pressures and problems. In fact, on two recent vacations to island settings (much like the book's fictional Amerigo), I ran into a few Norman Papermans who all had A STORY. Once back home, I fondly remembered this book and was happy to be back in the smog and traffic!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I read this book before deciding I was cut out to move to the caribbean. I thought \\"surely he exaggerates.\\" He does not :) Excellent, entertaining, zany fun."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"As I sit here in my Caribbean condo, after a 25 year absence (I lived here for 10 years during the time period of the book) I am amazed at how this place has not changed!! I can imagine anyone loving this book, but ESPECIALLY anyone who lived in, or spent more than a few weeks on any Caribbean Island, but especially the US territories. Every beautiful scene, every strange person, every rude comment, every abandoned building, every power outage or any other inconvenience reminds me of some page of Don't Stop the Carnival. It is truly one of my favorite books. I could not put it down and it had me laughing on almost every page. Wouk lived here in the islands for awhile and his insight and rendition of life here is nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I loved this book. I have read a few of Herman Wouk's books and enjoyed his style in each of them. I originally purchased Jimmy Buffett's Don't Stop the Carnival, which is how I learned about this book. I had not seen it or heard of it before. I couldn't find the book here in my area so I ordered it from Amazon. It was great, very funny and had many twists with a touch of mystery to keep you hooked. You can see yourself getting into some the same fixes Norman Paperman stumbles into. This book is a very fun read and I highly recommend it to anyone that needs a good laugh."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I, too, read Mr. Buffett's stage adaptation before seeking out this novel, and have to say I was somewhat dissapointed. The strength of the play had been its rapid pace: the main character, Norman Paperman, spent much of his time spinning in place as things collapsed around him, and the audience was kept on ther toes as situations developed and concluded themselves in rapidity. This very pace is lacking in the novel, however. The story is a simple one: a man from New York buys a tropical resort and desperately tries to keep it under control as one disaster after another occurs around him. But the tale of Mr. Paperman does not warrant the near four hundred pages alloted to it. The story tends to plod along between disasters, which happen so often that the reader soon becomes desensitized to them. At about two hundred pages, my patience for the character's activities bottomed out, and it was all I could do to finish the novel. The saving grace here is the characters themselves, who, in the odd scene where they're allowed to actually develop without the intrusion of a flood, water shortage, or car accident, are colorful and entertaining, with dialogue that is often far more clever than the story itself.That story is one wrought with inconsistencies, and plagued by trivialities. It jumps through some sections too quickly, yet goes into puzzling detail at others. The story seems, at points, more like an anecdote than a novel, with bits left in that don't advance the plot, but seem to exist for completeness of a historical account. I found myself wondering at times whether some events here did happen, and if not, why did Mr Wauk bother to create them? To top things off, the end is astonishingly abrupt, and seems in a way to offset the very meaning of the rest of the novel. The story screams for a final chapter."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Totally entertaining for those who listen to and love Jimmy's CD of the same title. A great book to &quot;lose&quot; yourself in."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Don't stop the carnival is a very funny book. I read about 2 books a month and laughed out loud at this book at least six times in the first half of the book.While I am a very big parrott head, this book is amusing in its own right.The interesting thing is Herman Wouk wrote some very serious books(Winds of War, et al)yet, this book is a great word picture with humor.It also fills in several major gaps in Jimmy's latest attempt(can anyone say mid life crisis or writers cramp). Thank god he has talented back up singers.Regards, Alan BossletPS: This is dedicated to Emily Audrey!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Any book recommended by Jimmy Buffett shouldn't be bad, should it? The follies of Norman Paperman, a New York PR guy running a hotel and bar in the Carribean, captures the dangers of chasing an obsessive dream. The writing is solid, if stretched, but you find youself hoping everything works out for the best.The book is at it's strongest when Wouk describes interpersonal relations. He colorfully describes New York society at it's finest (at worst) as well as the society life down on the islands. Capturing the protagonist at his failings makes for a deeper novel.The downside of the book is the extended existance of Murphy's Law. After the first hundred pages or so, each mistake or folly becomes predictable. In that sense, I really wish the book had been shorter."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Started out OK but the ending was too abrupt, and predictable. We spend alot of time in the Bahamas and many of the situations Wauk created rang true!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"The book is realistic in describing trying to build a hotel in a third world setting. Author even admits the same in the preface, as the book is based on a composite of real stories.The book is a snapshot of life in the 1950s/early 60s, when segregation was in full swing in the US. The book does character sketches well and develops themes by suggestion, like a good writer is supposed to, rather than just mechanically describing something.The book fails miserably in the ending--a completely contrived, \\"Duex Ex Machina\\" ending, where characters die or conveniently disappear. Thus the ending a cliche that sours the whole book. Seems like the writer got tired, killed off some characters, and finished. I would have given the book a five but for the ending.As for humour, it is simply 50s style realism with a sickening sugar coating to make it more easy to swallow. I didn't think it was all that funny, as the racial typecasting and moral preaching is grating. But it also is consistent with the mindset of the characters, who are essentially hypocritical racists.Have fun."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Unlike many, I found this book not quite living up to expectations. It's ongoing comments about coloreds and whites mingling date the material (ok, it was written a while back) and the ending is a bit strange based on the character development and what you assume their interpersonal relationships. It left me not feeling satisfied when I turned the last page. Additionally, I found much of the book predictable. Something bad happens, it gets fixed - Something bad happens, it gets fixed. Over and over until you feel like you could skip a few chapters and not be any worse off. Rather than building on each mishap, they simply repeat. Additionally, the ending simply drops characters. Whatever happened to the pregnant housemaid? Why simply... well I don't want to ruin it for you if you haven't read it. Let's just say the book finds a simple (though trite) solution for getting characters out of the book. And that left me disappointed."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"This is a hateful, toxic book. I cannot fathom the positive reviews. The main characters are so dissolute and debauched that it is impossible to care about them. Worse, the author has the egregious habit of \\"type-ing\\" every character, no matter how fleeting, in a most debasing manner: Negro, Jew, gentile, whore, Turk -- and just about every homophobic deprecation he can think of. Whatever skill the author may have as a storyteller is completely undone by his bigoted, blighted world view. It would be charitable to say that this is a book written and published before conventions of political correctness could moderate Wouk's mordancy, or to say that the cruel callousness that permeates the narrative belongs more to the protagonist than to the author. However, \\"Don't Stop the Carnival\\" is just too relentlessly and gratuitously crass to concede Wouk that courtesy: the book is utterly poisonous, and not nearly funny enough to palliate its venom. Moreover, as another reviewer here points out, the author imperiously assumes a White male (and very narrow-minded) reader -- and even THAT finite demographic will likely find many passages offensive. I was eager to read this book because I once lived in St. Croix, and know well the places, and the quirks of Caribbean life, that inspire the story. Instead of kindling my nostalgia for the Virgin Islands' natural beauty and the spirit of the Cruzan people, though, it brought back wince-worthy memories of the strident, gluttonous, pi&ntilde;a colada-swilling scumbags who swanned around in sports cars and speedboats, indulging their Master-race status on the island to distract from midlife crises and sundry failures back in the States. Nothing redeeming in that exercise. In his 1998 forward to \\"Don't Stop the Carnival\\" Wouk writes, \\"My m&eacute;tier is social portraiture.\\" Spiteful caricature is more like it; peppered with snide stereotyping and imprecation that veers toward flat-out hate speech. He also states that while writing this novel he, \\"had in mind the feel of a Chaplin movie.\\" Well, the slapstick is certainly there -- minus Chaplin's sparkling humanity. This one belongs in the dustbin. Or better still, the fireplace. Don't read the horrible \\"Don't Stop the Carnival\\"."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Having lived in the Caribbean for many years I can only say that Wouk's rather childish view of the US Virgins was the result of a shallow look at Caribbean island life. The storyline is quite good and some of the 'island style', 'island time' happenings show accurately the frustrations that are a fact in almost every kind of meaningful endeavour that one tries to accomplish in the islands. But Wouk didn't get into the heart of the Caribbean people or their culture (well, a steel band, I suppose) and the fact that the book is set amongst tropical islands. He could have made much more of the water, the beaches, the yachting, the sport fishing that give the islands their vibrancy. The problems that he encountered with the renovating of 'The Gull Reef Club' are accurate and sometimes amusing in a corny sort of way but the ending was weak. Altogther disappointing"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Being a Parrothead, I dearly wanted to enjoy this book, I tried to enjoy this book, but I found Wouk's writing style to be dull and lifeless. The story concept was good, but was quickly slaughtered by Wouk's amateurish ramblings. Norman Paperman came off as a shallow, light-handed yuppie, better suited for a Harlequin novella."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I too was captured by Jimmy Buffetts' Musical score of this Carribean Adventure, and wanted to read his inspiration. Herman Wauk is now one of my favorite authors. I could really sympathize with Norman Paperman, and I found myself falling in love with Iris as the story went on. Hats off to you Mr. Wauk I will pursue the rest of your works and read them all!!!!!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"This book is characteristic of the people of the Caribbean.

I too would pick this as one of only 10 books if stranded on a desert island.(Along with anything that Carl Hiaasen has ever written!) Very readable. As with any good writer, Wouk has a way of transporting the reader to the Island of &quot;Amerigo&quot; and to the Resort known as the &quot;Gull Reef Club&quot;. I loved &quot;Atlas&quot; as well as &quot;Iris&quot;. And of course mine host, the Jack Lemmonish &quot;Norman Paperman&quot;. I found the book's ending fitting. I can't believe that more people haven't read this book! I can't wait to buy Jimmy Buffett's Soundtrack to this novel."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Outstanding book for any Jimmy Buffet fan or simply a fan of the carribean.

Don't Stop the Carnival is reality based! We think we have found paradise, and then... The local's attitude that all Americans are to be fleeced hasn't changed. Being in this atmosphere is an amazing adventure that takes all you have to give. Don't invest more in the tropics than you are willing to lose. The book is an excellent statement of how it still is."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I love to read in the evening, and this book transports me to a tropical paradise.

The amusing tale of New York public relations man Norman Paperman centers on a universal dream---quitting the rat race, escaping to the sunny Caribbean to loll about in the sunshine amidst scantily-clad beauties, and be the King of one's own alcohol-induced domain.Norman is swept into the realization of his mid-life crisis when exuberant Lester Atlas presents him with a fait accompli---money to become an island innkeeper, supervising one of the most charming money-makers on the fictional island of Amerigo. Norman soon discovers being an innkeeper is fraught with peril, but his misadventures will leave you laughing and longing for a quick trip to sunny Paradise.Many characters propel this book, each charmingly depicted as only a great storyteller like Wouk can. From the reclusive Iris Tramm, to the all-forgiving Henny Paperman and her nubile daughter Hazel, to the outrageous Hippolyte, and most especially the native Kinjans who give this novel a charm most realistic yet alarming, the reader is swept into life on an island paradise that is at once heaven and hell.Can Norman forget his successful New York career and make the transition to a change in latitude and attitude? Will phrases like &quot;We be jammin', mon&quot; erase the bitter cold of a New York winter and the thousand indignities a pr man must suffer? Will his penchant for extra-marital affairs be his undoing? Will a long-ago girlfriend's dark secret shock him? Put on the suntan oil and read while you bake for an experience everyone should have at least once.By the way, the book is not complete until you also listen to the CD from the musical that Jimmy Buffett and Herman Wouk collaborated on. It may not have been the toast of Broadway but it is the perfect accompaniment to a reading of this book."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"For a book that had its first printing about 40 years ago, DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL remains both fresh and plausible. The premise of a harried New Yorker dropping out of life in the Big Apple to take up inn-keeping on a tiny Caribbean island is virtually a universal fantasy in Manhattan, where everyone seems to want to do exactly that--if they're not heading up to the Berkshires instead.As hilarious as the adventures here are, they never actually cross that fine line into the implausible, quite a balance when writing fiction.DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL is a change of pace for Mr. Wouk, who usually writes more serious books. He probably is best known for MARJORIE MORNINGSTAR, but his versatility is evident in works ranging from THE CAINE MUTINY to THIS IS MY GOD, as well as the important Holocaust work, THE WINDS OF WAR and its sequel, WAR AND REMEMBRANCE. It is this versatility, combined with his elegant prose, that makes him my favorite author.For years now, it's been rumored that Herman Wouk and Jimmy Buffet are working together on a Broadway musical based on DON'T STOP THE CARNIVAL. Personally, I can't wait!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read and I like to consider myself somewhat well-read. Herman Wouk has developed characters that truly come to life. You will not be able to put this book down. You will be compelled to keep reading wondering to yourself &quot;What else could possibly go wrong?&quot;. Despite the moral of the story, you'll want to run right out and purchase a Carribean hotel. When you're done reading, listen to Don't Stop the Carnival by Jimmy Buffett. The CD doesn't make any sense until you read this book."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I read this book as a teenager when it first came out in 1965, and then picked up a copy of it a while ago and reread it. Amazing what a few decades can do to one's perspective. How many mid-life crises have many of us gone through in which we dreamed of leaving big city stress to find the perfect, ideal life in some remote, exotic place? (This book, if you will, turns up the lights at closing time and lets you see what people really look like!) So, Carnival's Norman Paperman goes though his mid-life fantasy on a Caribbean island, and, predictably, things are not as perfect or as ideal as expected. That's why this book holds up so well after 40 years: it's entertaining and has a message. At nearly 400 pages, it moves amazingly fast, thanks to Herman Wouk's skill as a writer. Definitely worth the time, especially if you harbor any of the main character's desires for the perfect escape."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"This was certainly what the doctor ordered since I just returned from 10 days sailing and diving in the BVI and the sweetness of the tropics was just something I wanted to hold on to and not dissipate upon returning to the Rockies.Having spent years exploring the Caribbean, particularly the US Virgins, I could not help but laugh at the seemingly improbable but totally believable events and characters that one may easily find there, from escapist ex-patriots to the disappearing Mr. Church-type men to the completely annoying and in this case, deadly custom of stopping cars in the middle of the road to chat up a friend.I became completely enthralled with this book and had trouble putting it down. During the 5 days in which I read it, I became bedridden with a nasty virus and actually welcomed my time in bed eager to find out what next would happen to Mr. Paperman.Well-written and quick-reading, I highly recommend this to anyone who has experienced life in our neighboring tropics! But do keep in mind, it was written in the 60's and has some dated language. But it is a truly enjoyable read!!!!!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Jimmy Buffett's CD attracted me to this book. The book is highly entertaining the entire way through-there are no slow parts to be found. Mr. Wouk paints a picture of life on a Carribean island that is funny, amusing and engaging, all the while being completely believable. From the ever-present difficulties at the Club to the host of interesting characters Norman Paperman meets along the way, the story is great. For anyone who has travelled to similar islands or even less developed countries, this story is, in a strange way, very believable. This is certainly required reading for the Beach. But even if you're just looking for a great novel to transplant you to another world-this is a perfect choice. Anyone who reads this book will find himself, at least once, wishing he were the one running the Gull Reef Club."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I read through a lot of the other reviews posted here before deciding to post my own. For most of the readers who enjoyed Wouk's portrayal of island time and the incredible-but-realistic workings of Murphy's Law, I must nod in agreement. I found myself moving up and down with Norman, aggravating as he could be, but enjoying his triumphs and laughing at his downfalls.In the end, regardless of lessons learned, the characters still seemed somewhat static. Even Norman, for all his experiences that should have led to growth, seemed to have learned nothing. By moving back to New York, he stayed in place. That's the book's biggest weakness in my opinion. The rest of it was awesome!I saw a lot of reviews by folks who had a certain expectation of the book based on Jimmy Buffett's &quot;recommendation&quot;. To readers coming from this perspective, please bear in mind that Wouk wrote this book a long time before Buffett even picked up a guitar. It is dated, because it should be. It's an old book. I mean, geez, how many people complain because Twain's &quot;Following the Equator&quot; is &quot;dated&quot;?Keep this in mind as you set expectations. Then appreciate the timelessness of the idea even as you enjoy the portrayal of 1959 American expatriate life. All of the things that were happening in the 50s flavor this tale, political, social, and racial. Things were different then, and to judge by modern standards is an injustice to the writer and his work.Bottom line, I hated for this book to end. For the hours it took me to read it, I was transported to tropical fantasyland...Margaritaville, if you would. I've lived in the tropics, and this book put me right back there. When it ended, I was dumped harshly back into the grey California winter."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I love this book. This book has a great story on the surface. Also, there are a lot of underlying messages that will be picked up on a closer read. This book shows us that we could live out our &quot;ID&quot; if we wanted. What's to stop us? I also believe that this book hits the nail on the head as far as descibing islanders. Islanders do not act the same as people who live on the mainland. Mr. Wouk paints a picture so well that I felt I was there at the hotel watching what was going on. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"This book is a must for anyone visiting the Caribbean! Norman Paperman decides to leave New York to start running a small hotel in the Caribbean. The ideal turns to strife when the layed-back attitude of the Caribbean starts to cause him problems; his bartender runs away, the cistern runs out of water (and then collapses after a heavy rainfall), the chamber maids run away, his builder leaves him half-way through construction of some new rooms, but Norman manages to overcome all these hurdles and more!The book highlights the attitudes and dificulties of living and working in the tropics; just because you are used to things working in civilisation, doesn't mean they will work the same way here!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I loved this book! It is a very humorous story about a Jewish New Yorker who finds himself running a Caribbean hotel with no experience and no idea of the financial commitment he has made with his partner. Naturally, he meets a cast of eccentric characters on the island (fictionally named Amerigo) and craziness ensues. Although some of the references are dated, it's a great read and real page-turner.I highly recommend this book for all Caribbean lovers!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I finally got around to reading this after years of listening to the Jimmy Buffett musical (which, contrary to what some earlier reviewers seem to think, already exists). I therefore already knew how the story ended, but with a hundred or so pages left to go I was involved enough to hope they'd changed it from the book. No dice, unfortunately, but it's still a far more engaging story than I was expecting.If you're wondering - as I was - how a story of a guy who buys a hotel could possibly be entertaining, don't worry. I don't know quite how Wouk did it, but he did. The sequence of events sometimes does seem a bit Hollywood-ish, in the sense that you think things can't possibly get any worse for Norman Paperman and friends, but oh look, they just did. For that matter, they sometimes also get better faster than you'd ever expect in real life. Still, the story does draw you in and make you root for Norman to tough it out regardless of what the island and its cast of loony characters throw at him next. Speaking of which, Wouk is a genius when it comes to original yet strangely convincing characters. Even if the action dragged (which it doesn't), the book would be a fun read for them alone.Through it all, you just might find yourself wanting to run off to the tropics and start life over again too. Perhaps unintentionally on Wouk's part, the Papermans' lifestyle back in New York comes across as so dreary that it's easy to believe Norman would rather cope with disaster after disaster than go home! It is, of course, easier to say that when we're only reading about the big adventure rather than living it. But it does make for a fun read."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"A very funny and entertaining novel. It slightly recalls the above British TV comedy, but with a self-exiled NYC Jewish Theatre man dealing with a new world for him- a fish out of water. He finds himself among other exiles from America and Europe but who seem to float through their lives there while he is buffeted by constant ups and downs. The story has the feel of the late 50s, and does reference 'the new year' of 1960 at one point. One of the charaters, Iris Tramm, is a failed Californian movie star who, it is implied, may have been a casualty of the blacklisting craze of the early 50s. If they had ever made a movie of this, she could have been played at one time by Sally Kellerman. The comedy turns to tragedy by the end of the story."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Granted, this book may be condescending and dated, but it deals with a dream that is timeless...doesn't everyone want to &quot;escape&quot; to an island in the Caribbean while only envisioning sun and fun? Well, as Herman Wouk so eloquently points out, paradise sometimes comes with a price. Although the events in this book take place decades ago, the same situations could just as easily occur today. This book made me both laugh and cry. I sometimes feel like I am &quot;Norma&quot; Paperman myself after living down here for almost five years!! In reality, Herman Wouk only stayed here for eight years, but I think I am here for the long term. Only time will tell."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"I had to keep in mind that this book was copywritten in 1965.The book had a strong, offensive undertone to it - the constant reference to a person was clearly written. Everyone was simply a person but for those characters that were termed &quot;negro.&quot; There was a banker, a realtor, a lawyer. That was all the reader needed to know. Then there was a negro banker, a negro realtor, a negro lawyer. The constant reminding of which characters were and weren't was tiresome. Some of the social commentary and the exaggerations of island dialects were also deplorable.The story followed interesting developments and turns. I spent a short time in the USVI and made friends who have homes in these islands and found much that familiar in this book. So while it is true that island time is different than mainland, that attitudes are different and can be frustrating when you are fresh from a hurry-up-rush-rush-rush environment... it is still a strange book to read and seems to have a definite and antiquated feel to it.I did take time to look up singing star Maxine Sullivan and order a &quot;greatest hits&quot; CD of her tunes circa 1937. And I am always impressed by Edna St. Vincent Millay whose poetry is quoted within the book...Worth a read, but keep your perspective firmly in the present."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"Herman Woulk's creation of the island of Amerigo captures the essence of island life very vividly. Mr. Paperman's experiences are sometimes tragically funny, and the characters that surround him are odd and frustrating and completely bizarre at times. As a resident of the Virgin Islands, I can say that Herman Woulk has painted a very clear picture of what it is to live here, just as perfectly as &quot;A Year in Provence&quot; portrays the people of that region. This book is thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end, but if it makes you itch to pack your bags, read it again! This is like a handbook of what to expect when you arrive, and although some scenes may be very funny, imagine them happening to you!"},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"This book was not only entertaining, it teaches many lessons about life that can't be found in most of today's novels. I highly recommend this book to anyone searching for an adventure that just can't afford to drop his or her whole life like Norman did."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"...to quote the Buffett Musical that popularized the story with many Parrot Heads. A terrific tale that keeps your attention from cover to cover, I read it while in the Outer Banks of North Carolina and it made me reconsider the urge to relocate and become a permanent beach bum!

It has a deep theme, but you don't have to read deep into it to get it. Sometimes, sadly enough, there are no extreme measures you can take to make your life better. I identified with Norman Paperman, and got a laugh out of all his mishaps (thinking, &quot;that sort of thing would happen to me&quot;). Despite the theme, it is not a pessimistic book at all. Wouk also tells us that we have to make the best out of what we have, or &quot;roll with the punches&quot;. The lively characters and tragic ending reminded me of Hemingway (Whom I am also a fan of)."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"On target at capturing the nuances of life in the islands. What some may not know is that Wouk wrote the novel while he was living in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. It was not well received there by locals as his characters may have resembled some. Later he moved. It is a cult classic there among many who live or lived (self) there for awhile."},{"Title":"Don't Stop the Carnival","review":"After traveling the Carribean, yourealize those folks march to a differentbeat.

Unfortunately the story is predictable and shallow. The novel reads more like a long short story with a lack of depth and a difficulty in identifying with the characters.

At first I was disappointed with what appeared to be a shallow story line. However, after some reflection, I realized that Herman Wouk wasn't just telling a story, he was narrating a psychological transformation in Norman Paperman. Norman Paperman goes off to the Caribbean in search of dreams escaping the mundane life he had worked so hard to create. After living the dream for a short time, he realized that his prior life and family wasn't so bad after all. The book ends with Norman Paperman selling his hotel to another seeking his life's dream.

The only negative aspect is that there are some gaps in terms of what the listeners get to participate in. The sound quality is perfect, but occasionally Steven will reference group processes that just are not included in the tapes. That said, what is included fits together in a way that the listener can enjoy without feeling necessary information is left out.Gilligan is a poet and brings a beautiful asthetic component to each idea he utters. He is also very human and, therefore, does much to shrug off the inevitable 'guru' status that he could easily take on. His stories are compelling and highly instructive. He examples are thourough and specific. And the hynotic inductions are delightful to 'get into'...But more than anything, I was most impressed by the general picture of therapeutic healing that Gilligan presents. The main picture being that of learning to recognize the healing activity that is trying to be expressed in our symtomology, and how to develop and focused tenderness around the complex so that we can help what is trying to awaken to AWAKEN.Steven's model of psychotherapy is also recommended because it can move in a brief or long-term direction, depending on the needs and resources of the client.

This is simply the best of its kind, and I find myself using this regularly in my own writing.It's impossible to be an expert on everything, or to remember every word that you've ever heard in your life. With this book, you'll be able to find and identify the words that are germane to the topic you're writing on, even if you won't know how to use them. For example, under Technology|Computers|Hardware and Peripherals, the acronym IRQ is listed. It's defined as an \\"Interrupt Request Line, a setting that controls communication of peripheral devices with the CPU\\". Now, that's one of the clearest definitions of an IRQ that I've ever come across in such few words, but seeing it there doesn't tell you how to use it. You'll still have some homework to do.HOWEVER, if you need something like a title of rank, and are wondering what the proper term for the prime minister of an East Indian state is, you'll not only find it here, but be able to use it immediately.

Nothing else comes close to this grand work. Words are associated according to predominant use (yes, a tricky proposition at best), but amazingly, for the most part, it works. Words are categorized like Linnaean taxonomy, such as \\"science, arts, economics,\\" etc. Systematic thinkers will have no difficulty finding associated words and concepts, while those who prefer a more direct route can simply consult the \\"index\\" at the end, which leads to the place it has been categorized in the front. Either way, everyone wins.But the associations are magisterial, not just \\"related\\" or similar, but the whole constellation of likely associated words, acronyms, synonyms, and hierarchies of genus, species, and sub-species. There are more \\"linked\\" words than anyone can possibly imagine, or if one can imagine them, Word Menu has too. Short of an unabridged edition of the English language, nothing compares to this compilation.Two observations. (1) Don't waste money on the \\"pocket-book\\" edition, it's too tiny and too microscopic to be as useful as this reference will be. (2) The only \\"oddity\\" is that all biological terms and concepts are under \\"Living Things,\\" not under \\"Science,\\" much less \\"Biology.\\" No matter how many times I tell myself of this odd feature, I always default to \\"Science > Biology\\" and then find nothing. All those biological concepts and words are under \\"Living Things\\" apart from the section \\"Sciences.\\" Odd. Very odd. Who conceived \\"Living Things\\" as a category of Human Thought along a Linnean taxonomy distinct from \\"Science?\\" Even so, why not just move \\"Living Things\\" to Science, and then to \\"Biology,\\" rather than leaving \\"Biology\\" an empty (indeed, an \\"unmentioned\\" set)? Well, there's always the index for these situations.Unfortunately, at time of review, no hardbound copy is in print (shame on Random House). And aside from the \\"Living Things\\" oddity, I find this reference so intuitive, so helpful, associating associations I would have to think long and hard to recall, that are here in an instant, plus a treasury un-thought or unconsidered too. Thesauruses are great references (assuming one finds a good one), but this reference has riches that even the best Thesaurus cannot match. And best of all, both systematic and direct thinkers can access the same work from different directions and both achieve their desired ends. A \\"must\\" reference for all of us who seek associations we weren't even sure were associated, and then some!"},{"Title":"Random House Word Menu","review":"As a writer, there are times you have a picture of a thing in your head: you know what it does...you can feel it...you can touch it...and you can taste it, but no matter how clearly you see it in your mind's eye, you still have no clue as to what that thing is. This is when Word Menu becomes indespensible. Even if that situation occurs only once a year, the time saved is well worth the cost. My only criticism -- I wish it was longer."},{"Title":"Random House Word Menu","review":"The &quot;Random House Word Menu&quot; defines words, but it is not a dictionary. It is arranged by subject, not alphabetically, and lacks word etymology and pronunciation. Unlike a thesaurus, it doesn't provide synonyms or antonyms, but words related by subject. The &quot;Word Menu&quot; is the product of 20 years of research by writer Stephen Glazier, whose diverse career with words includes writing novels, screenplays, copywriting, and editing. It started as lists of words organized by subject for use in writing novels, and it ended up a widely useful reference book featuring 75,000 words. The words are divided into 7 major categories: The Human Body, Living Things, Science and Technology, Domestic Life, Institutions, Arts and Leisure, Language, and The Human Condition. Each category in turn has 3 or 4 subcategories, and there are two more levels of categorization within those, constituting 800 divisions in all. Once you find the subcategory that you want, you are presented with a literal &quot;menu&quot; of words pertaining to the subject along with their definitions. You can find the subcategory you seek by looking at the table of contents, by using the Guide Words that tell you what category and subcategory you are in at the top of each page, or by using the index. All of the words are indexed alphabetically, so if you can think of a word related to what you need, you can locate the appropriate category easily. The &quot;Word Menu&quot; is most useful for finding the correct word when describing a topic in detail and for gaining familiarity with the vocabulary of a particular subject. Because the words have been selected by subject, the &quot;Word Menu&quot; contains far more nouns than adjectives or verbs. I found that the book's organization took a bit of getting used to before I could locate words efficiently. But the &quot;Word Menu&quot; is a unique and helpful writer's tool that has a place alongside my dictionary and thesaurus."},{"Title":"Random House Word Menu","review":"This book belongs on the reference shelf of every serious author. It is extremely easy to navigate through and can help you come up with the appropriate word or phrase that you are searching your brain for.

I can't stress enough how useful this book is."},{"Title":"Random House Word Menu","review":"I translate literary texts and rely on a shelf of reference books to get them right.

Not only can this ignorant city slicker find the word for &quot;a wooded valley&quot; by looking in the Menu under Landscapes: Hills, Hollows, and Valleys to find &quot;Dell&quot;,and &quot;Dingle&quot;, but when I need to find out the name of &quot;that thick rope they throw out to pull the boat to dock&quot;, I look up Transportation: Ships and Boats: Parts of Ships, Sails, and Equipment to find &quot;hawser&quot;.

The way this dictionary-like book is indexed is terrific. You can look up topics to find related words. This is a great addition to a word reference library.

A must for writers!"},{"Title":"Random House Word Menu","review":"I am obsessed with words and with lists, so this book is my Bible. You can do so much with Word Menu if you enjoy word play and writing. Sometimes I randomly pick a word and start brainstorming around it until I have material for a short story or the beginnings of a poem. Sometimes I just pair adjectives and nouns, getting a kick out of what comes up.I think this is a really great book to give a kid who is getting into writing. It is arranged in such a way that a person can just page through it and get lost in the world of words. It's so much more than a thesaurus-- if I had had this as a kid, I would have filled many more notebooks with my writing; I just know it."},{"Title":"Random House Word Menu","review":"This is a great source for any translator or interpreter. Here you'll find lots of terms on any subject, carefully categorized. The sections go from very general to quite specific or technical. Even if you don't find exactly what you're looking for, there probably is a section that will serve as starting point for your search. Also this is a great tool to enrich your vocabulary."},{"Title":"Random House Word Menu","review":"\\"Word Menu\\" is the richest vocabulary book I've encountered with. The book contains an endless list of terms I've never heard before nor did I know they existed, as:\\"hebephrenia: a form of schizophrenia involving disintegration of personality, giggling and grinning and childish behavior\\". Yet another one \\"snuff film (flick): movie that supports to record an actual killing\\"; Shocking. Just in a single volume the whole universe of human knowledge is encapsulated. I can't think of a subject that isn't included.Students may benefit by using this book as a memory refresher before exams since most of science categories are arranged as a textbook that contains in addition to terms definitions , the basic laws of (e.g.) Physic : Newton's law of motion (all three), electricity, optics mechanics, Archimedes principle, Einstein's equation of energy-matter relationship etc. Astronomy, Meteorology, Chemistry, do not fall behind. The basic laws are compiled in just few pages and ready to be used. One does not need to browse endless books to dig these laws and terms out. Definitions are concise and clear.The \\"Word Menu\\" book was originally intended for the writer, it is based on finding a word through an idea and associations. But It turns out the search task is not as easy as expected, I faced the following inconveniences:Let's say you are looking for words that convey fear. The trivial word \\"fear\\" is not listed in the index, (neither are \\"sad\\", \\"sadness\\" and others). One needs to think of the word \\"phobias\\" (page 401) in order to get all the listed possibilities of human's fears. As it stands now the searcher has to go through a time consuming process consists of several stages: Choose the relevant chapter # 13 \\"Social sciences\\", go to categories that according to one's understanding may have the word he searches for, in this case \\"Psychology\\" (page 398) then you may hesitate between two sub-categories: \\"Phobias\\" and \\"Manias\\" you have to check both; bottom line, a long time is invested for search of one word. These cumbersome manipulations could have been avoided by adding simple usable daily words; serving as \\"keywords\\" with cross reference leading to the relevant sub-category. I'm almost sure that after repeated usages one may find his shortcuts.Another problem is the definition of terms which are sometimes too short therefore incomplete .For instance as the word \\"discovery\\" in the Law category (p. 316) , defined as:\\"pretrial fact finding through interrogatories, dispositions and other investigation procedure\\". This definition is incomplete. \\"Black's Law Dictionary\\" 9th edition ISBN #978-031419942 (p. 533) states: \\"Compulsory disclosure at party's request of information that relates to the litigation\\". Black's also contain the paraphrased Glazer's definition. The word \\"discovery\\" is listed only in one sub-category \\"laws, procedures and court proceedings\\", but is relevant in more than one as in \\"decisions, judgments, and conditions\\". Had the word been listed under all the relevant sub-categories, or had a cross reference, it would save search time. I'll end with the author's resolution of adopting definition according to the sub-category in which the word is listed . Adoption would be a good practice if a term has numerous different meanings (e.g. \\"love\\" convey affection, but in tennis \\"love\\" means a zero score). Limiting the definition of \\"centerfold\\" (p. 584) to the porno sub-category:\\"photo of nude woman or man featured in magazine\\", the reader doesn't get a complete understanding of the term, one might think that \\"centerfold\\" relates only to the definition as stated in porno sub-category. This term is also listed under the category of journalism (p. 326) with a border definition:\\"foldout double page at center of magazine usually containing illustration sometime featuring nude photo\\", which would be a better choice also under the porno category.I'm using this book mainly to enrich my vocabulary, with the unique , uncommon and unfamiliar words that the book is rich with."},{"Title":"Random House Word Menu","review":"And we have a winner ! Back around 1991, a brainy friend of mine showed me a book and said, \\"This is a thesaurus, a sort of backward thesaurus.\\" And I said, \\"Oh.\\" and flipped through it a little bit. I saw a term for clearing a field for crops by burning it and thought, \\"Hm. How would I ever remember that word?\\" Well, ever since then, every time I see any non-alphabetical thesauri that claim to be novel in format and complete in content, I promptly follow the steps and try to re-find that lost word.On and off, of course, this wasn't an obsession, but I would say I've tried around 10 different resources including any \\"backwards thesaurus\\" I see including McCutcheons \\"Descriptionary\\" which is a lot of fun anyway.For those wondering how this book works, it is basically lists of sublists, and sub-sublists to a final list of one or two hundred words that you scan a brief 10 word (or so) definition to see if it is what you need. For example, I see a foot rest in my mind, but can't remember the word \\"ottoman\\"... I'd go to the biggest chunk, \\"Domestic Life\\", and under that list find, \\"Home\\" and then to \\"Furnishings\\" and then to \\"Chairs and Sofas\\" and there would find many many words I scan one of which is ottoman. By the way, apparently, all of reality can be categorized in 7 big chunks : Nature, Science and Technology, Domestic Life, Institutions, Arts and Leisure, Language, and The Human Condition. So for my \\"foot rest\\" example, once you choose \\"Domestic Life\\" as your first 'chunk' you are only 3 hops away (Home, Furnishings, Chairs) and you are scanning for your word 'ottoman'.Only 2 small complaints: One is the possibility of blind alleys / dead ends that I'm sure all books of this type are subject to. For instance, I would probably have put the sub-list \\"Agriculture\\" under science and technology and not under economics. Not really a problem though since you can go to the back and find not only every word that's in the book, in the index, but all of the list headings. Boom! There's 'Agriculture' and I'm back on track.The only other complaint is that the \\"Brief Table of Contents\\" which comprise the 1st 2 'chunking' or 'drilling down steps' (Domestic Life and Home, in our example) is separated by 11 pages from the complete Table of Contents thereby separating the first two largest general category lists from the 2 finer more specific lists. You find yourself using multiple fingers to hold pages and flip back and forth trying different routes. Why separate them? What is on the intervening pages breaking up my flow? Oddly : the Acknowledgements, Staff and Consultants, The Preface, the Biography of the Author, and the User's Guide. These are minor irritations and in no way daunting. The only thing daunting about this book is the notion of compiling it.So here we are, 2007, and this book did what none other could do. Isolate the word I'd been looking for for so long. Is it fair to give a book a good review based on its ability to retrieve one word? Is this fair and scientific? Didn't I base this review well enough on the overall structure and efficiency of its format ? Was the \\"Random House Word Menu\\" that very book my friend handed me in ca. 1991? Should I reveal my secret word ? How about a hint? That's what the windsed to do. W-I-N-D-S-E-D.

The authors have thoroughly researched their subject matter, and obviously greatly enjoy their collecting hobby. The only down side, (if there is one) is that once you become hooked on collecting Shorter's product, you realise that not only is the range so diversified and vast, but to capture the full output of this interesting company, would entail 3 or more books of this size. Values of Shorter items are increasing rapidly, especially due to the fact that many styles of items were sent to different countries around the world during the WW2 export drive, and one would like to hope that because of the current interest of collectors, volume 2 is not too far away."},{"Title":"A Field Guide to North American Birders: A Parody","review":"Margaret Harmon's new book is fun and informative, and helped this birder finally identify himself (and add himself to his own Life List!).

I am NOT a tab reader, the title did not indicate that the book was in Tab, so take the layout comments with a grain of salt. There are 9 very popular Croce songs in this collection, and they are the ones you would expect to be there. In back of the front cover is a key to the more arcane Tab notations found later in the book. Some of the basic stuff wasn't covered, but seems to be pretty obvious to anyone who does chording and can sight read a melody line. The chord names are printed above the music, without chord boxes, as the fingering is covered by the Tab notation. Tab looks like the strings of a guitar streched horizontally under the lines of music. Numbers on the strings indicate which fret position you are supposed to cover (but not which finger to do it with.) There is a second G clef stanza with the chorded notes indicated on it. The melody line also includes the harmony parts, and notes on when to use them, such as 'second verse only', etc. The arrangements are very rich, and sometimes include alternate guitar parts for different verses. Any guitar solo spots are also detailed, making this an excellent book to learn songs from. Since there are so many lines of performance information with each line of melody, they only get 2-4 lines of music on a page. That means the book is much bigger than you would assume from the number of songs included. It also means there is a LOT of page turning going on. This book is geared at teaching you the songs, and is not suited to performing from. The lyrics for all verses are included under the musical notation, with none of those annoying blocks of text for extra verses at the ends of the music. I don't do Tab, but I would rate this book an 8."},{"Title":"Jim Croce -- The Greatest Hits: Authentic Guitar TAB","review":"I have bought and thrown away too many guitar tab books to remember but I have to say that this is one of the best ones that I've ever encountered. The book binding is done well enough so that the pages don't come apart easily despite frequent use. I know because I have committed tunes like \\"Photographs and Memories\\" and \\"These Dreams\\" to memory using this very well and accurately transcribed collection of songs with little trouble. Kudos to you, Yoichi Arakawa, for an excellent job of transcribing. Arakawa even indicates for you the tracks that are capoed and I like his manner of transcribing capoed pieces which makes it easy for me to understand unlike other versions where the transcriber inexplicably decides to tab as if the capo is already on. This confuses me and I much prefer the tab shown as if the capo is not on and then I can work my way up the fret myself once I put the capo on. In any case, mostly it's Guitar 2 that uses the capo on the tracks here with Guitar 1 only concerned for the track \\"I Got A Name\\" which is probably because Jim didn't write this one and so needed to adjust to his singing voice. The other tracks that he himself wrote only had Maury on Guitar 2 with the lead and harmony work using the capo.It is indeed rare to find such accuracy in tab books like this and so I have to give credit where credit is due. Playing the Guitar 1 part along with the cd for \\"Photographs and Memories\\" was a breeze because of this for example. For tracks like \\"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\\" the piano part is thoughtfully transcribed for guitar. All tracks come in both Tab and standard notation which is useful as I use the tab to know the fingering and I use the standard notation at the same time to learn the timing of the notes. Maury's guitar solos and harmonic playing along with Jim's is also very accurately transcribed. The tracks transcribed are:1) Bad, Bad Leroy Brown2) These Dreams3) Time In A Bottle4) Dreamin' Again (love those natural harmonics on the 12th fret)5) I Got A Name6) I'll Have To Say I Love You In a Song7) It Doesn't Have To Be That Way8) Operator9) Photographs and Memories10)You Don't Mess Around With Jimin that order. These represent a very good sampling of Jim's best ever work and so this authentic guitar-tab edition is a real treat for fans of folk music who want to expand their repertoire.Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Jim Croce -- The Greatest Hits: Authentic Guitar TAB","review":"This book has every last note of the songs..

I was astonished by the high quality of the concepts explored, clear prose, wonderful character development, and the unfolding tragedy of the plot. I was also amazed at how Jack London weaves the philosophical currents of the time with a frank appraisal of the realities of class divisions of East Bay (Oakland, California) society, together with their intellectual limitations, which clearly echoed those more often associated with the eastern United States.One should know, fairly early on, where this novel is ultimately headed. But what holds our interest is the deeply insightful study of the consciousness of this aspiring intellect, aesthete, and writer in the process of becoming inspired, going through the darkness, ultimately finding empty triumph, paired exactly with his choice of an end.While reading this book I thought a good deal of other works that explore the consciousness of writers and societal studies, such as those of more highly touted contemporaries in Joyce's Ulysses and Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, and even the often derided Henry Miller, who was a later master of the genre. I would imagine Miller was influenced by Martin Eden, but I have no evidence of that.This book is well worth reading for anyone who wants to experience a young American novelist at the height of his powers. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"Although many of Jack London's books incorporate facts from his life, this is by far the most intimate.

A definite must read, for anybody attracted to great works of literature."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"One of the great things about older, established literature is its ability to remind you that there's nothing new under the sun. Even though technology changes, human nature reamins the same. Martin Eden certainly reminds a modern reader of this fact. This is a cautionary tale of \\"be careful what you wish for\\" as well as a commentary about class envy in America. This is such a well-known novel that you can certainly find a concise synopsis elsewhere, so I'll just add this: in Martin Eden, London reminds us that success...and fame, in particular, looks great from the outside, but often leads to disillusionment for those that attain them. It's not a new theme, but his take on it is very engaging. He also makes a devastataing indictment of the American upper class by pointing out the hypocricy of their \\"learned\\" status, in which they learn many facts but are intelectually lazy, unable to construct their own original insights or posess true cuirosity about the way the world works. Martin's life is forever changed when he realizes that everything he's nobly struggled for -- education, social poise, recognition -- is simply a grand illusion."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"A wonderful book!

By sheer coincidence, I was a struggling writer, working to earn my daily bread in a dry cleaning shop. The book had been given to me as a gift by the father of a friend before I headed off for Montreal to pursue my dreams.So, maybe it was the fact that I had steam blowing in my face at the cleaner's (much like Eden in the book), maybe it was the fact that I wasn't eating very much those days (much like Eden in the book), or maybe it was because of the fact that this book got right under my skin - but it's the book that convinced me that writing is hard work.As a work of fiction, I admit that it has its flaws, but I'm still giving it five stars for London's absolute courage in shifting gears in his career as a writer and putting out a book he believed in and that is absolutely believable. The reader could have done without the political aspsects of London's philosophy, but then again - maybe not."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"While living for a year in the former Soviet Union, I was often told that a favorite professor's or respected friend's most-admired author was -- Jack London. When I responded that he was known only vaguely by my generation as an adventurer and a ruffian, my Soviet friends gently shook their heads and regarded me as an ignoramus.My spotty education aside, I did recall London only carelessly through some snaggly-toothed wolf in a novel of his, read in junior high and not afterwards. Nearly a year after I'd returned to the states, I still hadn't re-read London, and had left my comrades' advice somewhere to rot in a long mental list of &quot;Authors I Must Some Day Read.&quot;On my birthday, then, I was strolling through book-store aisles with my boyfriend, trying helplessly to choose just one tome for a special gift. Hillman? Oh, no. I'll buy that myself, regardless. Nietzshce's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra?&quot; As a birthday gift? Too silly.London's name cropped up into my mind, only half-so, and I dug vigorously through the L's until I came up with his &quot;Martin Eden.&quot;&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a beautiful book -- not granted its proper throne in history.I'm not sure if London was pre-judged as an adventurer, if readers really didn't challenge themselves to dip below his surface - I'm no literary historian - or if, perhaps, if his politics played a role...it's silly to speculate.Regardless, &quot;Eden&quot; is a daring - if not entirely successful - critique of modern philosophy's most potent force: Nietzshce. It's also a historical novel, a coming-of-age, and a wealth of human insight. His big finish is, yes, overstated. Perhaps because he didsn't ultimately triumph over Nietzsche. But he gives a good right hook and a terrific read.Editor's note: Enough to rouse a former student and former reader back to a voracious love affair with words.Here's to Jack London! Cast aside by my generation, may his wild socialist self rise again!"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"I was forced into reading this book for a research paper, but now I am so glad that I got the chance to experience such a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"Everyone should read this book.

I had never heard of the book so I found it at the library and discovered thatit is a semi-autobiographical novel. It's about a sailor from the working class in San Francisco at the turnof the century who becomes exposed to the way of life of wealthy, educated, upper class people and decideshe wants to be like them. He falls in love with the daughter of awealthy man and decides he wants to become a famous writer, partly to impress her.Martin Eden suffers a lot in the book. All of his literary efforts are rejected by publishers and fail to impressthe woman he loves. He becomes very disillusioned and very poor. The account of how difficult it is to becomea great writer as opposed to a popular, published author rings true. I enjoyed London's writing style. There's a lot in the bookabout individualism versus socialism that didn't interest me. Overall, I would say it is a very worthwhile book with a lot of depth. Martin Eden does achieve success as a writer finally. Many readers will find the ending disappointing. I didn't really care what happened to the character at that point.

It doesn't rise to the realm of high art, although the writing is splendid in parts. The philosophy displayed through most of the novel comes across as sophomoric and meretricious. As autobiography it is dubious at best, as anyone who has read a biography of London knows. On all these accunts, London's other semi-autobiographical work, John Barleycorn, is much better and well-grounded......And yet, any one who has ever been in love or thirsted for beauty and knowledge, or has had ambition thwarted, or had it fulfilled and found that its reward led to emptiness can not help saying that this is the stuff of life.The book has Nietzsche's influence written all over it. Indeed, the closing lines of Chapter XXVIII are directly lifted from Nietzsche. This influence doesn't, to my mind, detract from the novel though. Quite to the contrary, it's what holds the book thematically and artistically together.The best part of the book by far is the ending, wherein London remains artistically and thematically true to himself and to his readers, and thereby renders the book unpalatable for mass consumption. As Nietzsche puts it, &quot;I love him who is abashed when the dice fall to make his fortune, and asks, 'Am I then a crooked gambler?' For he wants to perish&quot; There is also the influence and theme of that most anomolous of the books of The Bible, Ecclesiastes, which is, again, more overtly evident in London's John Barleycorn: &quot;Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?&quot;This book has its faults, but indiffence to the very pulse of life and to the vagaries of the human condition is not one of them.

Think about life, think about love and think about people. I can't say that this book answered any questions, but the important part was that it made me ask myself questions."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"Jack London called MARTIN EDEN his greatest book. That's right: MARTIN EDEN, not THE CALL OF THE WILD or THE SEA-WOLF. He also said that THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS gave him the greatest satisfaction as an artist and THE IRON HEEL was his \\"gift to socialism.\\"Hm... that's not what we are taught in school, is it? Why has MATIN EDEN been so slow to emerge as a great American classic? There are two reason for this: one literary and the other historic.When first confronted by the character of Martin Eden, most readers are overwhelmed by his mental and physical strength, by his monumental drive to succeed as a writer and in so doing capture the woman of his dreams: Ruth Morse. Martin's meteoric rise comes across as not only heroic but downright inhuman, something that could only happen in the wildest of novels. But therein lies the trap. It really isn't a piece of fiction. For all intents and purposes Martin Eden is Jack London and the wraith-like Ruth Morse is Mabel Applegarth, the young woman he loved and aspired to marry and mate with.Contrary to popular opinion, the book is not the glorification of the individual but just the opposite: a warning of what can happen to the strongest of men when he foregoes societal consciousness. Martin's ultimate suicide is proof-positive that human beings are first and foremost societal creatures, that we need each other's love and affection in order to have complete and happy lives. In a word, Jack London and Ayn Rand would not have gotten along.Then there's the historic angle to MATIN EDEN. Unlike his great predecessor Herman Melville, Jack London is never given much credit for spending his artistic capital. But oddly the facts of his life show just the opposite. We must remember that London was writing at a time when the\\"robber barons\\" reigned supreme and the American worker had no protection whatsoever. There was no forty-hour work week, no child-labor laws, no workmen's compensation, no pension plans, no social security, and no safe working conditions. American workers were cogs in the great machine called the factory system. And as a child Jack London was one of those very cogs. He therefore detested the injustice he saw everywhere, especially the way the rich exploited the poor. THE IRON HEEL, his brilliant and direct assault on capitalism, was justifiably dubbed \\"the first negative Utopia.\\" But it was much more than that. It was a critique on the entire economic and social fabric of the day and was viciously and unfairly panned by the press. Nor did the criticism end there. London's next book - yes, you guessed it MARTIN EDEN - was panned too. London took his lumps and never wrote another great novel.So how do I end all this? Perhaps on a personal note. In 1962 my father said to me, \\"You know, son, Jack London is not properly understood in the United States. To my mind MARTIN EDEN was his best effort and it might do you some good to read it.\\" I took Dad's advice and did so. It blew me away. Then, at age forty, I said to myself: \\"I bet MARTIN EDEN does not pack the punch it had twenty-two years ago.\\" I was wrong. It hit me stronger than before. Now, at age sixty-six, I plan to read it a third and final time. Only this time I know it was not disappoint. Of that I am certain. Just like the last two times it will spin its magic and make me a better human being."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"This is Jack London's fictionalized story, a Paul Bunyonesque tale of the power and strength of the spirit. More than anything, this book is about individualism: a man's life-and-death attempt to overcome his working class background and launch himself into what he thinks will be the culture and rationality of the upper class. Martin Eden wants to write so as to impress the dainty, middle-class girl of his dreams: her of the frail and conformist nature. In this quest, no barrier is to large, no pain too great, but in the end, as he triumphs as a writer, he finds the results empty and barren, the people he meets at the top, as shallow and vacant as those he sought to escape. &quot;Where are all the great giants?&quot; he asks himself. Together with London's hard-hitting and powerful prose, the book is a masterpiece for the ages: the bold, fearless individual pursuing the inner vision of a different life. Although set around the turn of the century, the message of this book is as relevant today as it was the day it was published."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"In reward for an act of good samaritanism, Martin Eden, an uneducated working-class sailor, is invited to dinner at the home of the bourgeois Morse family. Upon first sight of lovely young Ruth Morse, he immediately falls in love with her. Over the course of the evening, Martin becomes enamored with the family's luxurious home, refined lifestyle, and cultured education, and aspires to raise himself to their level. With the intention of transforming himself into a man worthy of marrying Ruth, he sets upon a rigorous course of self-education. Soon he develops a passion for writing, and resolves to make his fortune as a man of letters.What follows is the long, arduous journey of Martin's ascent. His struggles as an aspiring writer are totally captivating; one can't help but rejoice in his successes and agonize over his failures. The portions of the book devoted to his literary exploits are so engrossing, the romance between Martin and Ruth often seems a cumbersome distraction. Though a realist and radical in his political and philosophical writings, London was often a hopeless romantic and downright puritanical in his depictions of male/female relations. In his works women are often set on pedestals, and no one gets a higher pedestal than Ruth Morse. Even so, as Mr. and Mrs. Morse deliberate over whether Martin is worthy of their daughter, the reader finds himself wondering whether Ruth is really worthy of Martin. Thankfully, as the book progresses and the characters gain a little maturity, the relationship between Martin and Ruth becomes less idyllic and much more firmly grounded in reality. As Martin's superheroic quest for self-transformation lurches toward fruition, he comes to realize that the result of his metamorphosis is not the paradise he envisioned.Whether you come to admire Martin or abhor him, this is an exceptionally thought-provoking novel that calls into question the inherent value of social status and intellectual achievement. What begins as a simple boy-meets-girl, rags-to-riches tale gradually progresses into a profound investigation into the complex conflicts of man vs. society, class vs. intellect, artistic integrity vs. exploitation, individualism vs. conformity, and ambition vs. complacency. This semi-autobiographical novel was Jack London's greatest attempt to break free from the ghetto of adventure fiction to which he was so often undeservedly confined, and to write the sort of philosophical literary novel one might expect from a Dickens or a Balzac. To this end he was extremely successful. Martin Eden is a life-changing read that deserves a place on any bookshelf alongside the great classics of literature."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"Say Jack London and most literate persons would ring up \\"Snow, Dog Stories and nature tooth and nail set in the context of gold rush Alaska of the 1890s. Ironically, Jack London was a San Francisco native in which he sets his 1909 novel \\"Martin Eden\\" which is his fictional autobiography.Martin Eden is a young, virile bright sailor who resuces a middle class man from thugs. He is invited to the man's home where he meets his sister Ruth. Martin and Ruth fall in love. Ruth and her family seek to help Martin obtain a good job but he insists on becoming a published author. Years pass and his work is rejected. Martin takes such jobs as working in a laundry and going to sea as he ekes out a living on a near starvation diet. Martin is a voracious reader of fiction, essays and novels. He is influenced by Darwinian social evolutionsim and becomes a disciple of Herbert Spencer. Martin also subscribes to the Nietzchian concept of a superman who is above the herd of ordinary people. Martin is a lonely soul who is befriended by the moribund poet Brissende an alcoholic. Both of these writers have soured on life. Martin has moved from Eden to Hell in his thinking and prospects for the future.Martin eventually becomes rich through his writings but it is too late for him to have a good life. He grows to despise Ruth and her smug suburban middle class family. He hates businessmen and philistinism and pretence in society and the literary community. He befriends a former girlfriend but his autodidadic education and fame have separated him forever from his working class pals.Martin rejects a plea for love from Ruth and sails away from the dull life of middle class respectability and conformity.The novel is bitter and brutal in its depiction of the American dream turned into a nightmarish vision of a man sickened with life. The Horatio Alger rags to riches tale is given a wry twist by Jack London. The novel failed to win applause upon its publication. Since then the novel has grown in readership and literary stature.

If you are not used to London's word usage, you might be caught off guard. Despite his word usage the reader can still get the main points of the story. This story is one that touches on many topics such as self discovery, tragedy, trust, and the evolution of one's being. As you read Martin Eden you cannot help but identify with the main character in some way. By connnecting with the main character you will find yourself suppporting him in every way. You will celebrate his achievements and console him in his many failures. All of which make for an engaging novel.

Essentially, don't go pullin a Martin Eden over what a pen of swine agree upon.And his speech to the socialists at the rally - lol!This was in 1908?

After I got out of the Army, I went to grad school on G.I. bill and for 37 years taught literature in college, including Jack London's fiction.I've often thought that the overall plot of MARTIN EDEN was VERY similar to that of Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY--both books are about a man who puts a woman on a pedestal and becomes a huge financial success in order to impress and win that woman--and then he finds out that she is not really the person he'd built her up to be in his mind--and so he has nothing to live for.SPOILER ALERT: Instead of being able to \\"grow up\\" or at least \\"suck it up\\" and move on, both men are destroyed when they are disillusioned about the object of their adolescent romantic fantasies.Read both of these novels and see for yourself. Maybe they will also help you to learn some things about the pitfalls of adolescent fantasies that often can give folks a false idea of love and a thousand other things.Then, for an encore, you might try reading Flaubert's MADAME BOVARY or Tolstoy's ANNA KARENINA."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"This book affected me more than any book I've ever read except the Bible. I read it at 17 and didn't notice the flaws, but then read it again at 33 and saw how bad some of the sections were. I haven't looked up how old Jack was when he wrote this, but I assume he was still a kid. Some of the sections really made me dislike him personally because I assume that the hot-headed behavior and ignorance of the main character was really how the author himself felt and acted.However, Jack London did make it clear what life and existence would really be about if there was no God. The main character begins by having never really thought about life. Then he begins to get to the bottom of things and sees that we are animals and nothing more, and that everything is meaningless. I believe the Bible, but Jack is the is the only author I've ever read, or person I've ever heard that was a real atheist and didn't try to hide himself from the implications of that belief. I respect that. He doesn't paint a rosy picture and he doesn't try to keep from seeing the horrible truth of a universe without meaning; he looks directly at it. He did this a little bit in \\"The Sea Wolf\\" but his best expression occurred here in \\"Martin Eden.\\""},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"It has taken me thirty years to realize what this novel is really about. I believe, like every talented wordsmith, Jack London instinctively went for the most natural ending for his book. You see, the way I look at it, Martin Eden's only goal in life was to become a writer. And he did it. He achieved his only goal. And then what? In a way, his life cycle was finished after that: been there, done it, nothing else to look forward to. That's the mechanism behind his depression I think. I'm sorry if it sounds as if I'm rambling and I'm not sure if I can explain it, but in a way, this book shows the danger of going for one's dream. Once the dream comes true - that's it, end of story, there's nothing else worth living for. Had Martin found a new profound goal for himself, he could have overcome his depression. But he didn't. I was never happy with the ending: Martin helps everyone by making everybody else's dreams come true and still can't help himself. But his life was over because he replaced living with striving for one goal. Once he achieved it, life lost all meaning. I love this book and I thought I knew every word in it but I never thought it was this deep and realistic."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"I have read several of Jack London's works and I consider this as my favourite. The struggle of the main charater (Martin) to get an education and become a writer is narrated so well by the author that I really had a hard time putting this book down. The plot is very simple: Martin Eden is a sailor who lives in Oakland California at the end of the ninteenth century. When he meet Ruth through her brother, he falls in love with her at once, eventhough she is a rich university student while he is an uneducated orphan that lives with his step sister and her husband. Martin deciedes to get an education so that he can get closer to Ruth. He starts to study grammar and to read heaps of books. eventually he decides to become a writer.

Period."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"I'm fairly new to Jack London's work, first hearing of him through his science fiction contributions. After reading his excellent novella &quot;The Scarlet Plague&quot;, I then read some of his short stories about the Alaskan wilderness before coming across &quot;Martin Eden&quot;.This is an autobiographical novel describing a young man, Martin Eden, and his long struggle to improve his standing in society. At the beginning of the story Martin is inarticulate, rough around the edges, and awkward in the presence of those he initially believes to be socially superior. When he meets Ruth Morse, a young lady of elegance and education, Martin's life changes. Impressed by Ruth's knowledge and apparent wisdom, Martin decides he wants to &quot;make good&quot;. It turns out Martin has a hard road to hoe.This is an inspiring novel of a man who, while experiencing intellectual growth, endures poverty, hunger, rejection, and all manner of hardship in his efforts to succeed as a writer. Fame and fortune seem a long way off. Because we know the story is based on Jack London's life, we can be certain that Martin's persistence will eventually be rewarded. But what comes after success? And what's it all worth?&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a long journey of hope, bitterness and triumph. This is about a man who doesn't give in to adversity or yield to the conventions that society imposes on us. That makes Martin something rare. Most of us do get forced into that traditional pattern of drudgery and routine, of being slotted into a safe, sensible job with a comfortable salary, because that's what society expects of us. The pressure is hard to resist. It will be a long time before any of this changes. I think this book also says something about society's shallowness.&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a fine novel. I may be stating the obvious, but stories about people who started with nothing are much more interesting than stories about heirs to a fortune."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"Anyone who has written a novel and wants to see it in print should read this novel. Seriously. Poor Martin pinches pennies for postage money, types up his manuscripts, dispatches them in the mail and waits. When he inevitably gets them back, he mails them off to the next publisher on his list. Martin Eden is the perfect example of what it means to write for the public today. This tenancious, and realistic, routine eventually pays off, but the ordeal, as well as some difficulties in his love-life, has taken its toll. Martin becomes one of the bitterest cynics in all literature. The story moves at a fast clip and culminates in a shocking and heart breaking end. Unlike many of London's superb novels, this one will appeal mostly to adults--not that it is particularly racy; it just deals with adult problems and situations. Word has it that this is the most autobiographical of all London's novels."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"In recent months, I've been reading the works of Jack London.

Various others here have given a description of the story but I'm glad that I didn't read those too closely prior to opening the pages. I wanted the story to be fresh and just as I don't want to watch new movie trailers, I don't want to know the plot of a book beforehand.

Now that I've read the book, I happily returned to this page to see what others before me had to say and to add my 5 stars.Spoiler alert: Please stop reading now if you'd also like to read this book with no preconceived notions.I'm glad this wasn't the first of Jack London's works that I read because I was able to see autobiographical parallels of the real Jack London to the fictionalized Martin Eden as the story went on. Certainly some of the very works I read by him in recent months had to have been snapped up for publication, just as Martin Eden's works were, regardless of their merit. Certainly threads of his other tales and life story overlap in this book. I would have been more disappointed by some of the other works I read by him after this powerful piece, too. His depiction of Martin's struggles to better himself to become worthy of his love interest, but which developed into a crazed study and work schedule with only 4 hours of nightly sleep; later deepening into anger and serious depression just when his dreams were finally coming to fruition; and finally an unpremeditated suicide wish, seem to lay out symptoms of a young man developing manic-depression (bipolar disorder). At the start, I never imagined that it would veer off into such a dark and tragic ending. I ached for him to find peace and happiness from the start of this tale to the finish! This was a very engaging work that one can probably not help to think deeply and long about well after the final page has been read.I'm glad that Amazon offers many classics for free on the Kindle as I probably would have hesitated to break the spine of this book if I chanced an old volume on my shelves. Also, I'm thankful that my Kindle is loaded with 2 dictionaries as I found frequent need to consult them when happening upon somewhat archaic vocabulary I was unfamiliar with. I look forward to finding more works by Jack London to read in the future."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"\\"Limited minds can recognize limitations only in others.\\"What if life, after working so hard and being misunderstood and laughed at by all you care for, gives you everything you have been dreaming of?Martin is a boy. A poor boy struggling to survive. He knows deep down that he's someone different, better. Due to a fortunate event he is granted admittance to the upper class. Hence he starts to learn. He is positively craving for knowledge and with the help of Ruth, a young upper class woman, he slowly starts to read books, but mostly he starts to think.When the love he feels for her grows strong and is returned, it is also met with defiance and rejection by her family.

Jack London incorporates a lot of his incredible life story into this book.-Ian Holzhauer"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"Jack London, a writer, journalist, adventurer; a tough man and a hopeless romantic. Although he is primarily known for his stories of adventure dealing with the Gold Rush, the Wild West and North, and of course for his marvelous novels with animals rather than people at the center of attention - he was also a great writer in many other respects, his &quot;Martin Eden&quot; being the best example. Slightly autobiographical, &quot;Martin Eden&quot; remains the single grand achievement of Jack London, one of the saddest books ever written, which made me notice that although most books end well, it's not always the case. How I wished the ending was different! And then I realized that some stories simply cannot end well, just like in real life events are more apt to destroy us rather than strengthen us, not to mention the fact that happy ends seem as real as fairies. Many people read books to escape from reality, to find that one place in the world where things turn out how we wish them to turn out. While I cannot deny this inherent human need, and I myself am not free from such wishful thinking, I seem to need brutal realism as much as I need consolation, among other things. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; shook me terribly when I was just a young moose, and since then I have read this novel several times, including the original English version, and it firmly remains among my favorites.Realistic this novel is, as are many books dating from that period, where the XIX century trends were still firmly instituted in the imagination of the turn-of-the-century generation, despite numerous efforts to revolutionize literature undertaken at about that time. Published in 1909, &quot;Martin Eden&quot; offers a wide array of topics and themes, all convoluted in a compelling, classical narrative. Firmly set in the aforementioned realism, depicting the society with brutal, unforgiving eye of the commentator, at the same time the novel is an apotheosis of idealism, as romantic, naive and detached as any other idealism out there. A young man serves at the sea, and at one point he meets a young lady from the &quot;upper middle class&quot;. In time, their relationship deteriorates from brute force attraction based on instinct, from cheerfulness and spontaneity to a grave series of misunderstandings based on the divergence of expectations one holds with respect to another, the more they know each other, the more so, to finally loathe in their lover what attracted them in the first place. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; is one of the most beautiful and touching love stories ever written, the more so because of its frankness which never borders on postmodern exhibitionism which plagued literature of the XX century.&quot;Martin Eden&quot; served London as a tool of social commentary, and thusly he expressed his disappointment and disapproval for the social class divisions, and as many before and after him, painted the bourgeois black with a fervor worth of any young radical. Nevertheless, as much as this sensitive socialism dated since then, it's a pleasure to read compared to what goes for literature almost a hundred years later, the journalistic socrealism of ideologues who imagine that they are writers. More generally, it's a sad fact that the XIX century essentially ended in 1914 with the outburst of the World War I, in all dimensions, including literature. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; thus may be considered as the last breath of the good old times that are never going to return."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"While living for a year in the former Soviet Union, I was often told that a favorite professor's or respected friend's most-admired author was -- Jack London. When I responded that he was known only vaguely by my generation as an adventurer and a ruffian, my Soviet friends gently shook their heads and regarded me as an ignoramus.My spotty education aside, I did recall London only carelessly through some snaggly-toothed wolf in a novel of his, read in junior high and not afterwards. Nearly a year after I'd returned to the states, I still hadn't re-read London, and had left my comrades' advice somewhere to rot in a long mental list of &quot;Authors I Must Some Day Read.&quot;On my birthday, then, I was strolling through book-store aisles with my boyfriend, trying helplessly to choose just one tome for a special gift. Hillman? Oh, no. I'll buy that myself, regardless. Nietzshce's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra?&quot; As a birthday gift? Too silly.London's name cropped up into my mind, only half-so, and I dug vigorously through the L's until I came up with his &quot;Martin Eden.&quot;&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a beautiful book -- not granted its proper throne in history.I'm not sure if London was pre-judged as an adventurer, if readers really didn't challenge themselves to dip below his surface - I'm no literary historian - or if, perhaps, if his politics played a role...it's silly to speculate.Regardless, &quot;Eden&quot; is a daring - if not entirely successful - critique of modern philosophy's most potent force: Nietzshce. It's also a historical novel, a coming-of-age, and a wealth of human insight. His big finish is, yes, overstated. Perhaps because he didsn't ultimately triumph over Nietzsche. But he gives a good right hook and a terrific read.Editor's note: Enough to rouse a former student and former reader back to a voracious love affair with words.Here's to Jack London! Cast aside by my generation, may his wild socialist self rise again!"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"I loved \\"sea wolf\\" but didn't really understand why until I read Martin Eden a few weeks later; then instantly, at the unwanted ending of Martin Eden, I saw the dying of Wolf Larsen as the necessary end of a life of transformation. I can't think of this book without seeing the enforced slavery and punitive changes in the \\"second critic of America\\" on the sealing ship as an allegory for Jack London's own painful and wilful revolution into an author, and so as a variant of Martin Eden.As Larsen and his first mate struggle for life on the deck of the derelict Ghost, it is a foregone conclusion that the writer and critic will triumph, since Wolf is really trying to kill himself and cannot, even after passing the best of himself and his knowledge and experience into these alien hands.In \\"sea wolf\\" Jack London triumphs as a writer only by destroying his primitive self and uniting with a female alter ego. In Martin Eden, Jack shows that he really is only Wolf Larsen at heart, and cannot under any circumstances break away from his past without destroying himself.Ah, some things are not worth their price.Read these two books together, in any order, and preferrably in several orders to discover America and yourself, if you had to give up anything to grow up ..."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"I picked this up out of curiosity after a male co-worker raved about it being one of his favorite books in high school. The love story is extremely moving, as is Martin's determination to succeed, however at times London seems a little self-absorbed (the image of Cher slapping Nicolas Cage in &quot;Moonstruck&quot; comes to mind: SNAP OUT OF IT!!!); this did get a bit tiresome toward the end. It is definitely NOT the same Jack London I remember from school (Call of the Wild, etc), and that in itself makes it well worth the read."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"In MARTIN EDEN Jack London used his own life as as plot and cast about for its wider significance. Jack London died by overdose of morphine in 1916. He had suicidal impulses. MARTIN EDEN was Jack London's attempt to deal seriously and vigorously with important ideas. The forward notes that the novel is realistic but the metaphysics of the book are predominantly naturalistic.Martin Eden thought of himself as a wild man-- a wild man brought home to dinner. He had defended Ruth Morse's brother from bullies. He borrowed Swinburne and Browning from Ruth to read. Ruth felt that Swinburne was not quite correct. He lived with his sister and brother-in-law. He thought the man, Bernard Higginbotham, a brute. The many books he read served to whet his unrest. He felt an enormous distance separated him from Ruth Morse.He had always led a secret life in his thoughts. Martin saw Ruth at the theater. In his reading he was baffled by a lack of preparation. He attempted to read books that were beyond him. When he returned the books, Ruth noticed his pants were pressed and he seemed less rough. She wondered how to help him. His speech was uncouth.In compliance with her desires he studied grammar and etiquette. His swift development was a source of surprise and interest. The remodelling of Martin's life became a passion with her. Then he shipped out and read Shakespeare and did not even contact her right away when he came back into port.Martin planned to write. He wrote three thousand words a day and at the end of the week contacted Ruth. He bought a bicycle to accompany her on excursions. He heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times by orators and philosophers at City Hall Park and commenced to read his books. Martin was surprised that Spencer was very little read.He came to see his rejected manuscripts as pitiable children and hired on to work at a laundry in a resort. The description of the work in the laundry is admirable. Martin returned and began work again on his writing. Ruth's mother considered him an inappropriate beau.Ruth thought Martin's poverty was Lincolnesque. His landlady, Maria Silva, poor herself, knew better. Ruth appeared at the Silva house. He had been reckless enough to write to her to tell her that he had pawned his suit. Ruth saw the sordid face of poverty.Martin began to have some small sucess. He still suffered and starved and his behavior at a gathering at Ruth's house reflected his state of overwork and under-nourishment. He lost Ruth. His family did not support him. Eventually he had great success and Ruth came back to him, but he said it was too late. He said he was the same person her family had disliked. He left for the South Seas.Reading Jack London is akin to reading good science fiction. He portrays an entire separate parallel universe."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"This is an autobiography, as Martin Eden's initials M.E. clearly indicate. It's about the artistic work ethic, and all true artists should read it."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"As an individual ages from adolesence to retirement age, Martin Eden and other works of Jack London, though unchanged from the original printing, bring different meaning and worth to the individual. Jack London and other great authors of the period such as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, share unparalleled triumph in their individual genre and a shared tragic consequence of death. As a teenager, Martin Eden served as that triumphant underdog that nestles in many teenagers of some 50 years ago. Yet those teenagers, many of who grew up before, during and after World War II, have come to know personal tragedy. The tragedy of Martin Eden (autobiographically speaking)takes on more of reality to those past generations than perhaps the present generation. Nevertheless, the story is timeless albeit bittersweet. Martin Eden could well serve as a primer for those individuals who have yet to read his more classical tales of Sea Witch and Call of the Wild. Those were raw boned and sometimes brutal times he described. A reader may be surprised at the reality in the novels but should accept there is more fact than fiction as Jack London did indeed experience or witness much of these tales"},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"And being an angry young man is not a completely bad thing.

London captures the paradoxical pursuit of human life and happiness with Eden's story."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"MARTIN EDEN follows the rise and fall of a young sailor who by sheer force of will educates himself and succeeds in becoming a famous writer (this is London's autobiographical novel, published in 1909, when he was thirty-three and the most popular living writer in the world). Few readers liked it then, they found it dark and depressing after a certain point; they wanted the entertainment they were used to from London (&quot;Come on, Jack, give us another story with dogs and snow in it!&quot;). Not as many read it now as should, and London himself disdained the fact that it inspired many young writers without talent to follow Martin Eden's example. But it is also a valuable story about a young man maturing in his conception of love as regards the opposite sex:\\"Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw himself climbing the heights with her, pleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her. It was a soul-possession he dreamed, refined beyond any grossness, a free comradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought.\\" -- The youth becomes a man.London's prose is straightforward and vibrant, much like the author at his best. Martin Eden falls victim to the vicissitudes of his fame and fortune, much like the author at his worst (too much hard living is often given as the reason for London's death at forty). London spends a lot of time in this book criticizing American materialism in the way that materialism ought to be criticized. He also displays a certain kind of American work ethic (five hours of sleep a night, perseverance through failure, etc.) that sometimes doesn't know what to do with itself once it achieves success. We should all have that problem--just hope that we deal with it better than young Martin Eden does. A very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"\\"Martin Eden\\" is my fifth foray into the works of Jack London. Although I don't find the excitement within that was apparent in \\"Sea Wolf,\\" the passion is certainly evident. I have read that \\"Martin Eden\\" inspired more bad writers to sequester themselves with paper and pencil in unheated attics than any other book, and it is easy to determine why. Eden's obsession with learning and then creating the immortal printed word -- after falling for a woman above his class in society/socialist-conscious San Francisco -- is a powerful force that London expounds convincingly. Then, without warning, the sage advice \\"be careful what you wish for, it may come true,\\" rears its ugly head. London also includes a line about ghosts that should be a classic, but isn't, and his description of a suicide ranks as the best of its kind. A WORD OF WARNING: Do not read the foreward until after. It tells too much of the story and robs some of the author's intended suprises. This is unforgivable. May the publisher rot in hell."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"If you are looking for pleasant summer reading, pass this one by. It ain't pretty and it ain't pleasant, but it ranks as one of the Great American novels of all time. Was it autobiographical? You betcha. More so than most airbrushed autobiographies of our time. Jack London was the first author to awaken in me the love of the printed word. I was 9 years old. The title that awakened me was Call of the Wild. I, like Marcia and everyone else, thought that Jack London was just an aborigine, wandering around in the vast metropolis and utterly lost. Years later I read The Sea Wolf, and my opinion changed.I no longer thought of Jack as an aborigine, but as a refined young man, rudely abducted from the civilized world and forced to accept the law of the strongest. Later still, I read Martin Eden, and I was devastated by the tortured visions of that same young man who was tranfigured by that experience and who was no longer acceptable as a member of civilized society. There's a whole lot of bitterness in Martin Eden, folks! And, the more I read of Jack's life, the more I am convinced that it is autobiographical. The fact is that Jack became a monster. At the same time, he became the most successul novelist of his time. In terms of money, we can only gasp at the financial success he enjoyed. He turned out novel after novel, and each of them was gobbled up by a hungry public. In the end, the SAME PEOPLE who had rejected him because of his crude mannerisms and calloused knuckles sought him out because of his MONEY. Do you really want the brutal truth about Jack London? And are you really prepared to weep for one of America's great sons? If so, then read Martin Eden. Otherwise, pass it by."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"In Martin Eden, Jack London provides the portrait of a young man who thirsts for knowledge, for self-improvement, to join the upper ranks of the intelligent and cultured within his society. We seem to be setting off in a \\"Jude the Obscure\\" direction. Martin loves a young woman from this society, and strives to make himself worthy. His chosen vehicle from his class and station to hers is self-education, and then the writing of serious and important work. Along the way, Martain has to swallow the unpleasant truth that those he believed to be so intelligent were actually entirely superficial in understanding. Pieces of London from other novels come through. London's belief in the \\"superman\\" comes through, as well as his disdain for the oligarchs, for example. What is most striking, however, is the dead-on skewering of celebrity worship. \\"Where were you when I needed you\\" might be Martin's refrain. The same people who ignored and derided him suddenly can't get enough of him. Why? He was the same person he was before. It was simply because other people told them so. They all just want a piece of the celebirty, to be associated with him somehow. While in real life London of course courted celebrity, the stupidity of this is blindingly apparent and even more important nearly a century later. London readers may miss the absence of the \\"Charmian\\" strong female counterpart in this book (unlike in the Sea Wolf or The Abysmal Brute or Mutiny on the Elsinore, for example). The \\"classy\\" love interest doesn't measure up in terms of independent intelligence or strength of will, and her last appearance is particularly troubling. Lizzie, from the lower socioeconomic classes, has the spark but is too held back by her upbringing. This is truly an important book."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"This definitely isn't the type of a book I would expect from Jack London but in my opinion should be regarded higher in achievement of his work, even more than &quot;Call of The Wild.&quot; While &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; is just concerned with the Spencerian and Darwinian 'Survival Of The Fittest' side of Jack London; &quot;Martin Eden&quot; represents the many sides of London: The poet, lover, seaman, self-willed individualist, philosopher, socialist and tormented writer. After reading &quot;Martin Eden,&quot; all I can say I am angered that this book isn't considered an American classic. I would say it is in rival with Eugene O'Neill's finest moments.I do not want to dwell so much on the plot because I do admit the plot is nothing new but it is the writing that counts. Simply put it, it is about a seaman who gets turned onto the world of class and literature and rigorously fights for mastering both worlds by spending all hours of the day and being frugal with money to achieve his dreams. As we later see, Martin Eden realizes the falsehoods of The American Dream and Individualism. While the back of the book claims that this book is an attack on Individualism, that is very curious because Jack London himself aside from being a Socialist, was an individualist and adapted the Nietzchean idea of Will to Power. This book was written around the time of &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; so I suspect London was going through his socialist days. This is such great writing that I would never consider myself an individualist but I felt myself throughout the book inspired of Martin Eden's will power and ambition. As a writer, I wanted to send my work to magazines after reading &quot;Martin Eden.&quot;&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is truly an American masterpiece of Literature and should be more widely read. Anyone who still thinks Jack London is a writer for kids and Darwinists must read &quot;Martin Eden&quot; and you shall see that his was an indispensable writer in all regards."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"This is the American version of \\"Hunger\\" - an author striving to succeed despite background and social status. There is desolation within this text, a longing fraught with energy unbound. The pulse of desires roars here. Eden is the near-transparent mask of the young Jack London himself. Reading it, the educated reader will be reminded of the philosophies of Nietzsche, Herbert Spencer and Schopenhauer. Social Darwinism, the Will-to-Live, the Will-to-Power all resonate here.But in the long run, the philosophies are just part and parcel of the story. \\"White Fang\\" and \\"Call of the Wild\\" are excellent books, easily accessible. London, in my mind, is the Great American Author because his writing doesn't exclude readers, young and old can enjoy him. As for this work, \\"Martin Eden\\", it is a dark horse compared to his earlier works, perhaps prophetic of Jack London's later life.If anything, this novel is about success, its consequences, and what we sacrifice to achieve it. It also concerns the inner madness of attaining a goal, how nothing else seems important. Books will come go, but this book continually moves with me, a perennial home on my library shelf."},{"Title":"Martin Eden (French Edition)","review":"I think that every book falls into one of a few different catagories. It either sucks, is entertaining, or changes your perspective. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; ranks in the highest of all posible catagories for changing my perspective. I tried to read Jack London on a number of occasions and just couldn't get into him. His stories would rate as entertaining at best. I don't know why I picked up Martin Eden, but will forever be grateful to the forgotten soul who recommended it. Martin Eden is different because of what is barely under the surface. In my opinion, it's less a story than a philosophy. After I read it for the first time, I was struck by the parallel to Plato's &quot;Allegory of the Cave.&quot; In it, Plato warns of the price of enlightenment. Once you have seen the light, you can never go back to seeing things the was you did before. You will isolate yourself from everyone. Plato seems to say that ignorance is bliss, and London seems to agree. In the novel, Martin is stricken with the desire to ascend in class stature after meeting a high-class, late 19th Century San Fransisco family. He is enamored with the ease with which they debate social politics and wants to attain what he first sees as their level of intelligence. His vehicle for attaining their acceptance is to become a writer. To enrich his meager knowledge of these subjects he becomes an arduous reader of everything that he can get his hands on. In the process, he comes to realize that he has gained a true understanding of liturature and social philosophy, whereas everyone else merely talks with a false air of understanding. At one point he realizes that, in his quest to become an intellectual equal, he has surpassed them. It is after his meteoric climb in intellect that he realizes that he is alone. He also realizes that the people he so eagerly sought to emmulate did not shun him because of his lack of intellect (for their own intellect was merely a thin veneer), but because of his lack of money. In his separate but related quest to become a successful writer, he is frustrated by every publisher's inability to &quot;get&quot; his ideas. His inability to publish, despite his hard work, leads his love interest, high-born and condescending, to abandon him. She has no faith in his ability to achieve fame as a writer and he has no disire to settle down into a 9 to 5 job to placate her socialite parents. After some time apart, he does succeed in getting published, and not unlike the breaking of a dam, fame and fortume follow soon after. Upon learning of his fame, she comes running back, ready to make him the centerpiece for conversation at her family's socialite dinner parties. He rejects her and tries to return to the companionship of his earlier days as a sailor. Like in Plato's story, he finds that he cannot rekindle the bond that he once had with old friends, and is alone.While the story is an interesting case study into the nature of intellect and society, it is also a looking glass into the social scene in a major city during the turn of the century. The reader learns that the beat poets were around long before Kerouac and Ginsburg. This story is full of information -- social, political, historical, and intellectual.

He's the one, but wait!, this book is like nothing else Jack London has ever written, and bears scant semblance to his Sea Wolf or Call of the Wild. In short, this is serious literature (advance apologies to Call of the Wild and Sea Wolf fans), and it's worth reading.This book reminded me a lot of Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome (another wonderful book). Both begin with hope, engage in change, and end in pathos. Martin Eden is a self-educated, self-made man (see why I say it should be in the American canon?) who attempts to garner the love of a young college student who pushes him out of what she sees to be his stifling chrysalis and become more like her and her fellow intelligentsia. The plot thickens when he does not only this, but surpasses them all in erudition with a passionate, eager mind, a more eager heart, and lots of hard work, all in the name of love. And then in the book's climax, he decides to ... oh, I can't tell you that. You'll hate me, and I'll ruin the book for you.What I can tell you, however, is that if you go to a bookstore, and pay full price for this book, you'll love it and feel that you've gotten a good bang for your buck.

Here London shows that he is equally adept at setting a story in an urban landscape by chronicling a landed sailor's attempt to become a self-taught writer, no easy task for a man who has lived the rough and vulgar life of a sailor. But Martin is extremely persistent in spite of all the obstacles he faces. Everyone including his friends, family, and classy girlfriend question his ability to make such a transformation from a nobody to a somebody. It's hard to imagine anyone being as devoted as Martin is to improving himself, and it's a bit intimidating seeing how much devotion it can take to achieve your dreams. Knowing that London used his own life story as a strong inspiration for Martin Eden, you expect that Martin will someday be successful, yet the results of all his work are still unexpected. With enough reading, learning, and life experiences, do we all eventually take Martin Eden's point of view?

Young or old, if you appreciate words and think they're kind of neat -- heck, even if you don't -- this book will turn you into a full-blown word lover. It introduces uncommon, fantastic words (and their etymology) in such a surprisingly readable, enjoyable and memorable way, you soon find they're like old friends. The words within this book will stay with you for a lifetime (and you may experience a sense of pride and unabashed glee whenever you find or create a chance to use them)."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Bride's Soul: Stories of Love, Laughter and Commitment to Last a Lifetime (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"I saw this book advertised online and I bought it at our local book store when I became engaged.

The stories in \\"Bride's Soul\\" consistently serve to regenereate and reinforce the fact that a lifelong love becomes a relationship in which the importance of the individual's existence gladly takes a back seat to the value of the couple's happiness together.Love is a matter of respect, understanding, admiration, loyalty, strength, honor and commitment; and this book exemplifies all of these grand qualities in a language anyone could understand.

One of the sections was all about women writing about how they were proposed to. And they weren't out of the ordinary proposals either. If you like sappy, romantic stuff, then this book is for you. I like these books because a lot of the stories are either totally amazing, or they teach you a lesson. This one didn't really teach me any lessons and I didn't learn anything.But then again...I'm not married,so maybe I just couldn't relate. If you're not into romance, then obviously, skip this one.

The text is very complete, yet the author's style makes it a delight to read through. Particular attention has been paid to BMW's turbo-diesel engines, including the latest generation of common-rail engines and the magnificent 530d.The author displays exceptional technical knowledge and highlights the salient points. I was very disappointed by James Taylor's \\"BMW 5 Series - the complete story\\", but Mr Cranswick's latest work is well worth getting, in spite of the fairly high purchase price."},{"Title":"BMW 5 Series (Car & Motorcycle Marque/Model)","review":"I have been a long time 3 series fan, right back to the days of the e21, but after buying a 2002 530i I have started taking more interest in 5 series models. It was this move that caused me to buy this title. Echoing the views of the person from Denver the book would be better if it adhered to model chronology more closely. However, I found the coverage of my 530i, and the various 5 series versions in general to be good.The book doesn't favor one model generation over another. In some books they tend to be pro younger models, but this title seems to give each its fair due. In addition there are some very nice e39 color pictures, including exotic Alpina e39s.In conclusion a nice book which confirmed my belief that these cars are indeed the ultimate driving machines."},{"Title":"BMW 5 Series (Car & Motorcycle Marque/Model)","review":"Has the best coverage of the eta 528e, an e28 I happen to own. Unlike the James Taylor book which is mostly b/w, this one is almost full color.

I love the older style of the E-12 and the E-28 models to the all-too-common look of recent 5 series, which look way too much like Toyota Camry's. \\"Not that there is anything wrong with that\\"! (an homage to the millions of Camry owners). So, I had great interest in this book as a recent convert to the marquee.Sadly, there was no mention of my particular model, the US 1987 535is. Despite this disappointment, the book is excellent and the photos of rare and European models not often seen here in the States are wonderful. The text is also quite interesting as were the unexpected photos of US cars like the Camero and the Pacer, shown as examples of what was \\"also\\" being produced in those years.My only complaint about the book is that it is not laid out quite right. While loosely chronological, the book does skip around a bit, and would be improved greatly by back-to-back photos of all 5 series models to show the change and development of the series over the last 30 years. Also rarely mentioned was the precursor to the 5 series model - the Bavaria. Like all things BMW, the book is more expensive than it needs to be. Nonetheless, a good book for the enthusiast."},{"Title":"BMW 5 Series (Car & Motorcycle Marque/Model)","review":"A well researched and written book on the history of the e12, e28, e34 &amp; e39 5 series generations.

The author seems very knowledgeable about the mechanics of these cars, but he drones on endlessly about pollution control and the oil crisis. Granted, important topics to understand the history of these cars, but it would have been a better use of print to cover the high performace versions instead.Also as others mention, the photography is aweful. Not only are the often grainy and out of focus but the subject car is often dirty, under poor lighting, or are heavily customized (the author says 'tastefully', I disagree.) Not the type of thing you should see in a fine book. Also, do we need really need to see a full color spread of the Pontiac Firebird (pg 29) or the AMC Pacer (pg 20)?I summary, knowledgeable author, decent writing, but horrible packaging."},{"Title":"Song for a Night Season","review":"very useful for people suffering from loss, beautifully presented. too bad this book is out of print as I would order several other copies for friends and family."},{"Title":"Clamp School Detectives, Book 3","review":"This is so funny and whoever is in need of a good laugh read this, you won't be able to stop. My friend who hates manga read this and couldn't stop, she was so sad when she found out there were only three books in the series.

But in this after the first story, it actually gets serious as it goes into a back story about how Suog and Nokoura met. This is probably the best story in the whole series. While it is still pretty light and fun, it has serious and dark overtones to it as well. It was nice to see a bit of a change of pace, and a little more depth to the characters as well.It makes me wish that this series was longer. I found that with each volume I enjoyed it more and more, and cared about the characters more and more. That is a very impressive feat. I never cared much for Clamp either, but I have come to enjoy several of their other works including:X, Vol. 1: 3-in-1.So, get this volume, it is 100% worth if you even REMOTELY enjoyed the last two volumes. :DGod Bles & *enjoy* ~Amy"},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"After building up a stack of books to take with me on my summer holiday, I saved Escape for Bridezilla for last as I am a fan of the author. As expected, I came away with a fantastic experience.Emily Briggs is a girl in the big city who is about to start the wedding process. Meeting her fiance, Henry Phillips, in the first novel, we quickly learn that his deplorable qualities are not at rest.Emily Briggs treats her mishaps with a light-hearted humor that's infectious. Her character is pushed into a new realm of maturity, making decisions that may or may not allow true love to slip through the cracks."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"As a fan of Demontravel's The Fabuous Emily Briggs she still maintains a distinct voice with Escape from Bridezilla, which is more of an account of a young woman approaching the next phase of adulthood than trying not to become a Bridezilla manic bride. We learn of love gone sour, friendships, finding yourself and, in the process, finding love the right way.The novel centers around Emily Brigg's life as a city girl. How she tries to get on track with her career and family in the quirky way she does (which was what made The Fabulous Emily Briggs such a hit with me).Readers will also appreciate Emily's eye for details, in everything from throwing a loft party to assembling an outfit when bidding her loved one farewell.The book touches on so many issues an ambitious woman encounters, it really takes you away."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"As much as I loved the first novel in this series \\"The Fabulous Life of Emily Briggs\\" was as disappointed as I was with this book \\"Escape from Bridzella.\\" The author tries too hard to make the book as fun as the first, but fails to give the characters any emotions or depth. I found myself skipping passages just to get to the end. I was incredibly let down as I ordered \\"Bridzella\\" while I was enthralled in reading \\"Emily Briggs.\\""},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I loved the first Emily Briggs book and couldn't wait for the follow up.

It's a story with many adventures. Demontravel perfectly blends laughter, modern dilemmas and a great story."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"As a big city girl that just made the move to Green Acres (yes, call it a testimony to the love of my new husband), Escape from Bridezilla was just the postcard to keep Manhattan alive in my thoughts.I loved Emily Briggs' infectious personality.

Her insights and accounts of New York dead-on.This is the first book that topped my summer reading pile, and it was a joy to read--finished in less than a weekend.The character is intelligent and quirky.

Can't wait!"},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I went through a period where I was completely hooked on chick lit, snatching up such writers as Jane Green, Marian Keyes and Anna Maxted. After a few years I began to lose interest as the genre seems as marketed as a Paris Hilton venture.Escape from Bridezilla has brought me back. The novel is about a bride who has questions about her fiance, and really sees potential in their roommate. Her refelctions are clever, funny and, at times, the character reveals her flaws, which makes her relatable.The author's command of dialogue is superb--her descriptions first-rate. This is a book if you want a fun read that goes by quickly but doesn't insult the intelligence of seasoned readers. Bring it on!"},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Just in time for the summer season, Escape from Bridezilla is the book to pack to the beach. As fun and quick as riding an occean wave.I loved the silly heroine, her escapades and trying to keep it real in the mayhem of her life.Though the book wasn't so much about becoming a \\"Bridezilla,\\" I found the book to be an extraordinary insight on today's culture--delving into relationship issues, career and staying on track to your focus. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Bravo! deMontravel delivers another success. This is a book that unearths the caddy social world of New York with humor and wit. Emily Briggs, the heroine, tackles her challenges with her silly brand of not taking things to seriously.Again, she has an acute perception of her love life and career."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Mustering though one challenging marriage proposal, Emily Briggs uses her bon vivant personality to make something of her love life and career.Through many twists and turns, she becomes less focused on creating the perfect wedding and decides that she needs to make things right in her own life. The character wisens up, and it's a joy to watch her development and route for her all the way."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This is a beautiful book, a hybrid of a hysterical read to a study of a smart character who has legitimate questions about her future with the man she has chosen to marry.What separates Escape from Bridezilla is the portrayal of Emily Briggs. She is a character with a sense of style, humor and the people she shares the fantastic town of New York with.Her adventures are hilarious. Her problems are real. Emily's manners in treating her obstacles with humor was a delight to read."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This is the perfect summer reading, just in time for the wedding season.It's a story about finding love but possibly wanting to make a refund. What's a girl to do when the wedding--and groom--of her dreams isn't coming together?I really enjoyed reading about Emily Briggs' fabulous life in New York. The humor was non-stop, the characters well-developed.Whether on the beach or during a summer night, I really enjoyed slipping into this book that put a smile on my face."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This is one of my favorite beach reads (along with anything Helen Fielding and The Nanny Diaries). The character is hysterical--slightly villainous but has a true heart. This is a modern and over the top look at how the opposite sexes interact with one another.It's a joy to see how Emily Briggs handles her wedding in an uptighty, stuffy world--along with her struggle to become an artist and relating to all the chi chi personalities she encounters.The scene where she meets a talented architect who clearly encroaches on her territory is one of the most hysterical scenes I've ever read. The voice is distintive and never relents.This is a book for readers who appreciate wit, clever writing and amusing storytelling."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I really tried, I swear I did. Picked this up out of a bargain cart in Borders and sat down to read it last night. Got through about 4 chapters and fell asleep. Picked up this morning to try and read again? I couldn't get past chapter 6. The worst thing about the book was the nonexisitent plot and characters. Emily Briggs was a confusing chracter, and was spoiled, selfish and vain with no redeeming qualities. Her fiance seemed to be a cad and boring person. Whoever said this book wasn't fluff or about shopping was wrong. Emily spent all her time going on numerous shopping trips around town and wasted chapters doing nothing but complaining loudly. This book was obviously made up of filler material to meet a contract deadline.As others have said, the grammar is appallingly bad in this novel, which made an otherwise bad novel simply terrible.I'm disappointed and will not read anything else from this author. I'm sorry."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This book was terrible. Tried to read it on a plane trip and couldn't finish. Not sure how so many people could like it.

I really felt like I was a third party in the dialogue with a group of friends. It also strayed from the regular \\"chick lit\\" crutches of girls \\"hissing\\" and always \\"shopping.\\""},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Britgrrl's right---this is just a horribly written book. I picked it up because I was newly engaged and wanted a good read about a character who also didn't want to become a Bridezilla. Well, there's hardly any talk of weddings at all, and Emily turns out to be completely self-centered and is someone I definitely wouldn't want to know. The author spends far too much time talking about products and things, which totally overwhelms any semblance of plot. Also annoying are the \\"profound\\" paragraphs written about topics like 9/11 that seem to either be reactions of the author (not the character) or vain attempts to make Emily have some dimension...until, of course, she goes to get her 2nd Birkin bag (which she can't afford) and pines for another LV bag (which she also can't afford, but isn't it cute and funny that she can't?) Don't waste your time and money on this one!"},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I picked this up in a bookshop, read a page or so and thought it seemed ok. I was desparate for something to while away the hours on a long distance flight. I read a lot of chicklit, and have been very impressed by some of it. And I've been unimpressed but still enjoyed most of it. And then there's this book. It's terrible. The story is poorly plotted, the character seems to be a Bridget Jones rip-off but without having the courage to go the whole hog. But my biggest complaint is that it is so appallingly badly written. In many places I had to read sentences three or four times just to see if it was me or if it was really this badly written. Who knows what the editor was doing.Don't waste your money. Go buy something by Jennifer Weiner, or Wendy Holden if you must. But this isn't going to fill your craving."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Great heroine, great glimpse of New York life.I cared about the heroine's quest to figure things out, and found myself staying up late to finish chapters.There appears to be an earlier novel, which I am looking forward to delving into."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I can't believe someone agreed to publish this junk! The \\"heroine\\" is so disgusting. It took me forever to read because I had to keep looking up and rolling my eyes. We get it - you're better than everyone else. But not nearly as clever as you think you are."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I could not get into this book AT ALL. I can't relate to the character and I swear if the author uses one more high school english sentence I'm going to scream. I'm not going to waste my time with this one."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I don't usually write reviews but in this case it was mandatory. My best girlfriend passed this book on to me with much disgust and I soon found out why. There are actual words spelled wrong in this book, something which I have never seen in a published novel. When I was about to chapter 3, I began getting extremely bored because there was no plot whatsoever. Emily Briggs seems to be a spoiled and selfish character and her fiance is the most ridiculously boring person I have ever encountered in a novel. After forcing myself through more chapters it was much of the same meaningless nonsense and soon I gave up and threw the book across the room.I do not recommend or encourage anyone to read this unless you can find it in a local library FOR FREE. My friend found this in a bargain bin priced at $5.99 and clearly this was still a ripoff."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Emily Briggs is set to marry Henry Phillips. When you are about to marry the guy you love, buy a loft together and know who will order what from a diner menu--plans seem interchangeable.Emily begins to realize things. She has a half-baked career, her mother treats a family dog like its a sweater that can be returned (but the dog gets more attention than Emily).For anyone that has experienced life in New York, with love and challenges at every corner, they will appreciate this tale.I found the dialogue snappy and fun, at times more clever than the category of lit this is promoted in.Emily's tirades are numerous, sometimes over the top, but I guess that's why you keep turning those pages.Back to Henry and Emily, I didn't read the first book so I don't know their full history. You can tell that they had something once, and it's a sad moment when love is lost. Without revealing too much, a girl like Emily, with her numerous quirks, humor and talent, will land the right guy."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Escape from Bridezilla is just the thing if you want to laugh and cheer. I thought the charcters were great. The portraits are very real, amusing and almost a little too known. The scenes with the heroine and her boyfriend, parents and best friends show that sometimes your favorite people can be a little irritating, which is completely normal, genuine.This is a modern day Austen that takes a glimpse of New York's satire and makes it relatable."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Whether you like sharp dialogue, developed characters or amusing references (you're like Trump, you get older but you're women keep staying the same age) this book is a perfect escape from those Bridezillas who should feel ashamed, or the perfect escape from a not so nice day.Great book."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Emily Briggs- the bride who SWORE she would not become the monster that she has seen so many times before. I love this character- and I am so glad I get to have a visit with her again. Usually sequels are just sequels, and they do not live up to the original.... I am happy to say that was not the case here- read it in a weekend. She is honest- her self-deprecating humor is hysterical, and um, a little familiar. Loved this - a great read."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"YEAH!! The fabulous Emily Briggs is back and she's more fabulous than ever. The good natured humor, exhausting fun and downright Valentine's romance is a pot boiler that will keep you up until sunrise...with laughter and happiness to propel you through the day.So you want a taste of New York but with the edge taken off, here it is, personified by Emily in delectable exhuberance. Grab this book since Emily comes with it. Is she a budding movie character or what?One big caveat! \\"Britgrrl's\\" review is laughable but probably laudable in London; perhaps the wonderful British humor and wit has been dampened by... I think she gave \\"Post-Dykes\\" 5 stars. Go figure."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I had a hard time getting into this book as well and it never seemed to get exciting. Pretty level throughout and that does not make for a great book. Also, very predictable. I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"So don't let the silly cover fool you, this book is better than love triangles, credit cards debts and irresponsible characters avoiding their problems by ending the evening with a glass of bubbly.Emily Briggs is very much a single urban girl. She has relationship issues, not only wiht her fiance, but with her friends and family.Her interaction with those who enter her world is hysterical. I love that she is an artist and weaves her creative vision into her contact with those closest to her.Emily deliberately makes herself face tough questions. She struggles to make sense of her career and lifestyle choices. I found the romantic thread to be a sizzler, and really finsihed this book coming away with more than another campy read."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Sometimes you need to shake things up to realize what may or may not be good for you.Emily Briggs is planning to get married to Henry Phillips. They are able to swing a great Soho loft by securing a roommate--the charming J3.While Emily's focus remains closer on her career as an artist and j3's amazing qualities, she starts to have doubts about her own fiance.The book is always on a fast track, from one zany episode to the next, Emily Briggs is both funny and real.I especially liked her interaction with J3's beautiful but self-righteous girlfriend and her caddy cousin.This was an extremely enjoyable book that I will always refer to as a great read when you want to get lost in a silly adventure."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I just finished Escape from Bridezilla, which was a gift from my soon-to-be mother-in-law (and not the monster-in-law kind!)The novel begins with a proposal to Emily Briggs that had a lot to be desired. It was a great set-up as immediately you learn of how she treats the proposal with her mark of irreverent humor and the personality of her fiance.The novel takes off from there and pages are turned very quickly. Whlie the jacket blurb is mis-leading, the book is more than just choosing china patterns and driving everyone crazy in the manner of a self-absorbed bride. In fact it's more of an exploration of relationships, finding romance and making yourself complete without the need for matching gold rings and joint checking accounts. I especially loved the non-stop humor and witty mentions."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"For those who haven't read The Fabulous Emily Briggs, not to worry, Escape for Bridezilla is just as smart, witty and fun but you won't miss out from knowing the first book's details.The book begins with Emily receiving a lame proposal from her boyfriend. She handles it with humor (as she does with most of her New York tirades).However the book is more than a romp on fun city terrain. deMontravel explores the struggles of city life beautifully. The laughs are constant, serious relationship issues are exposed.Overall the read is light but truly entertains. I understood the character and enjoyed her sense of humor and adventure."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"If they are actually publishing garbage like this, anyone can write a book. How come a book can get through the editing process and still come out so full of grammatical and spelling errors that one wants to tear their hair out?It's a story that has been done again and again, and much better by everyone else. This book is a waste of money."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This book is an unabashed fluff piece: the perfect beach read. As such, the plot was satisfying even though character development was quite thin.That being said, this book is rife with errors, which are so irritating as to detract from its delightfulness. Words are misspelled throughout the book (e.g. \\"vocal chords\\" instead of the correct \\"vocal cords\\"), which is annoying. Even more annoying, however, is that many of the author's pop-culture references are misspelled (e.g. \\"Alicia Keyes\\" instead of the correct \\"Alicia Keys\\"). It's difficult to believe that the protagonist is as plugged-in to pop culture as the writer wants to imply, when she can't spell the references correctly. The grammar in the book is atrocious as well--\\"that\\" is used where \\"who\\" would be proper and \\"who\\" used instead of the proper \\"whom\\" consistently throughout the book. There is a glut of sentence fragments. While it's apparent that de Montravel is trying to use an informal writing style, the fragments come across as confusing and just plain wrong, rather than as informal and stream-of-consciousness. Further, de Montravel has a bad habit of using \\"1,800\\" as her stock \\"very large number.\\" Instead of switching among \\"about a zillion,\\" \\"a lot,\\" \\"so many,\\" etc. phrases meaning \\"very many,\\" de Montravel uses \\"about 1,800\\" every single time. Sometimes the number appears on back-to-back pages. It comes across as very strange: does this number have some special meaning? On the whole, then de Montravel's writing style leaves a lot ot be desired: her efforts to be informal don't work because there's no \\"flow.\\" Maybe a two-week writing class could help?The designer name-dropping will be fun for an avid fashion follower, but it remains unclear to me how the protagonist can wear multi-thousand dollar outfits every day and still have money concerns. In the \\"Shopaholic\\" series, Kinsella solves this dilemma by giving the protagonist massive credit-card debt; in \\"Escape from Bridezilla,\\" however, Emily only has an AmEx, which is a card that must be paid off each month--debt cannot accrue. So who is paying these AmEx bills each month? And since *someone* is paying for Emily's lavish lifestyle, why is she so concerned about money? Very confusing. Further, the designer name-dropping isn't useful as a device in the book. Other authors use name-dropping to illustrate what Park Avenue Princesses certain characters are; de Montravel, by contrast, is trying to portray Emily as something other than a \\"rich girl\\" caricature--so what part does the name-dropping play?My major substantive disappointment however, is that the description on the book jacket described a descent into Bridezilla behavior (something like \\"Shopaholic Ties the Knot\\"). However, wedding-related madness takes a minor role, at best, in this book. On average, it's only mentioned every once in a while--and then except for one trip to Vera Wang that is mostly glossed over, it's only mentioned in passing, as in \\"how is the wedding planning coming?\\" I was hoping for a delicious glimpse into the mind of a Bridezilla; instead, I got another generic \\"Sex & the City\\"-wannabe chick-lit tome. Yawn."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Escape from Bridezilla, or Escape from that odd, diverse breed of people you find in Manhattan.The book tops my reading list because the character was identifiable. Her attitude not only to relationships with boyfriend, family and friends but her struggle with career and life changes. It all comes together.The moments with the people she meets in New York (the loony Mrs. Hallingby who lives in her apartment building, the model with the distinctive marking on her butt, the cousin that treats her sons like they are step children, the Fed Ex guy that becomes a regular part of your life). Most colorful indeed, and Demontravel's ability to make a serious moment humorous is first rate."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"So absolutely refreshing to read a book that really explores the turmoil that a young woman goes through in the 30's trying to find oneself and true love dealing with the pressures of society and even worse, the family circle. Emily does it all with a sense of humor that we all should embrace!"},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This book was a delight to read.

The reader can appreciate (and relate to) the character's attempt to find balance between life, love and career...A must read!"},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This is a story about a girl who is about to get married and does not get what she's signed up for. The author combines the light-heartedness of a comedy with the measured exploration of human nature more associated with an Elizebethan chick lit novel. Sprinkled throughout are wonderful scenes of urban life, funny characterizations and an ode to the modern day struggles of a heroine that just doesn't see it as fit to settle."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"deMontravel has an ear for dialogue, an eye for detail. It's as if she is a guest at the best New York parties and arbiter of the latest styles, where the reader can tag along for the ride.Escape from Bridezilla exposes the life of a young New York woman with a fresh perspective that's a joy to read."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I am very unhappy that I spent the money on this book. Poorly written and boring are what I would use to describe this novel. I do not know where the editor was at with this one. And why was this book entitled the way it was? There was nothing about a bride, only a girl shopping and being carelessly rude to everyone that she came in contact with. I can go on for hours about the grammar and word usage in this book, but I will not waste my time. It is enough to say I was very unhappy."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I could not get past page 20 in this book and even that was a tremendous effort. Don't waste your time unless you like a spoiled selfish character and a boring plot.Wasn't worth the money it was printed on."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This is one of the most hysterical books I've ever read.As a New York City publicist, I felt like I was tagging along with one witty girl, who has a line for everything. In fact, it reminded me of those great bygone films (not in The Gone with the Wind vein, I'm thinking Chevy Chase before he had all the weird plastic surgery).The story begins with Emily Briggs being proposed to by her boyfriend. The proposal is pretty bad, in a diner with \\"coffee with free refills.\\" Emily warns herself not to obsess about the wedding--to not become one of those girls who plans the wedding and just expects her fiance to show up at the altar.The timing of the proposal shifts her life into high gear. Suddenly she and her fiance are bidding on a pricey Soho apartments, enlisting a roommate to help defray costs and she is undergoing a career change to work on her art full time. In the process I love her New York adventures. The wacky Mrs. Hallingby who lives in her apartment that has an obsession with frogs. Emily's continual musings about woodland sprites and where she could find one. Her silly analysis of those she meets--you see the city through an artist's perception while she also is versed in New York's caddy social scene.I loved this book, can't wait to read more by the author."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This write-up is coming from a reviewer who has a lot of time on her hands. I've currently had foot surgery and taking a needed holiday from the demands of my career and a long-distance relationship I, unfortunately, have to question.Plowing through a newstand worht of magazines and tons of books, Escape from Bridezilla has been the best esape yet. The heroine is fantastic (or is she fabulous?) She is real because she faces hard issues with intelligence and humor, not with an extra glass of wine or another frivilous expense. (She manages a new career, sucessfully breaking into her own as an artist, and makes some savvy investments).I nodded knowngly to the ups and downs of a relationship that needs to be re-considered, the handling of overly-involved friends and relations, and skirting a wedding for all of the right reasons.I found some references hysterical, laughing and smiling to some great pop nostalgia. The dialogue is snappy and sharp. The accounts of New York make me want to buy a plane ticket (when the weather warms up and I am on my feet again, literally)."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Emily Briggs finally has her turn down the aisle. Unfortunately she has to deal with many odd family members, a self-absorbed fiance, challenging work deadline and, yes, a blonde stalker.The book is more than clashing personalities and wedding registeries, it's an adventure of a young, witty woman who follows an itinerary she never intended to evaluate. Her escapades are a delight to read. The dialogue is straight from a reality comedy, and I found myself chuckling at all the clever references. The pages turn quickly."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"What can I say, this is a book that really does allow you \\"escape.\\" Emily Briggs is a fantastic character.

(There's even a stalker with a famous derriere).What makes the book so great is the clever observations and heroine's definite brand of humor. I am hooked."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Escape from Bridezilla is a fun book, a spectacular romantic journey with many laughs and twists along the way. All this has a welcoming flavor of an old film set in a modern context."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"Emily Briggs, our main heroine, has just been proposed to by boyfriend Henry. Although Emily has always promised herself she wouldn't become \\"one of those horrible, obsessive brides-to-be\\", she starts showing signs of it right away. Her annoying mother adds into the fray, trying to take over many of the details. Throw in an attractive guy that Emily seems to have a thing for, moving into a new apartment with Henry, and more - things don't seem to be going the way she planned. Since I was truly confused at what was going on half of the time in the story, I really can't give a better plot synopsis.This book had some amusing moments. The entire novel is filled with Emily's sporadic and jumbled thoughts that get thrown in the midst of paragraphs where things are happening to characters. Some of her thoughts are funny, as Emily seems to be a vibrant and odd character.Unfortunately, that is about all the entertainment I gleaned from this novel.The downfalls of this book unfortunately are numerous. The writing of this book is truly horrible. There were too many run-on sentences where the author started to say one thing, then suddenly, in the same sentence, went into the character's thought process, which was truly bizzare most of the time. For the most part, I had no clue what what this book was supposed to be about. (I initially read the back cover, but it didn't at all seem to match up with what was going on in the book). I couldn't figure out why Emily even wanted to marry Henry - he was lifeless as the male love interest, and he got stranger as the book went on. Emily generally makes her way around Manhattan on seemingly needless trips pertaining to her upcoming wedding that usually resulted in some kind of disaster or mishap.Overall, I cannot with good intention recommend this novel at all. Chick lit fans - steer clear unless you are in the mood for 379 pages of confusion."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I left New York for LA almost ten years ago and found that Escape from Bridezilla may influence me to stay where I am, or perhaps go back?

I really enjoyed reading about Emily and her life experiences. The book is able to bridge the gap between a smart essay on relationships and a light, enjoyable story.

A fun...funny...and smart read!!"},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"I recently left the city and found this wonderful novel to capture everything about New York that I love and don't miss.I love the shopping, energy and electricity. I don't miss the caddy social scene, which deMontravel portrays so well.It really is an if you-can't-make-it-there, you-can't-make-it-anywhere city, and to survive you have to play the game of maintaining a strong skin to swan with the most ruthless in society's honored court. In many respects you have moments of not being \\"nice,\\" which Emily Briggs continually catches herself doing. A perfect setting for a book to show the many human sides and layers to an ambitious, interesting character. Hence why New York provides the backdrop for so many fabulous novels.The humor is top notch. The silly little anecdotes and mental tirades hysterical. Loved the lines about the character's delusional qualities. I look forward to reading this book again during the summer bridal season."},{"Title":"Escape From Bridezilla","review":"This is the book that started my Memorial Day weekend, which I finished well before the holiday was over. I couldn't stop turning those pages--the writing is smart--the character has a mind of her own and her situations are real. The novel is crafted with thought and humor. The author has a clear understanding of today's woman and the challenges she faces. My favorite part of the book was Emily Brigg's vivacious spirit, how she tries to remained focus with all of the obstacles a city like New York throws at you. (Yes, this reviewer hails from the Big Apple).The story begins with Emily Briggs recieving a disappointing proposal from her boyfriend, Henry Phillips. She promises herself not to become a dreaded \\"Bridezilla\\" and, in the process, learns a great deal about herself. She is also thoghtful--in a funny way--and learns a great deal through the challenges she creates for herself.After truly focusing on what matters--her career as an artist, trying to remain healthy when you are in unhealthy relationships--Emily starts to figure things out.

For readers of the author's novel, The Fabulous Emily Briggs, Henry appears to be Emily's ideal match. Enter J3, a media mogul who has Emily's attention.The scenes in New York are as detailed as a Woody Allen movie, the dialogue as witty and fun.Also, the book is less about a bride's manic wedding planning, more of an account on relationships.

Cary are like buses. There I was blissfully unaware of their existence and then two come along at the same time.My current research projects include a number of the world's great passenger ships and cruise liners. There were huge gaps in that research until I found two books from the 1930's by this author and snapped them up. They contain stunning original photographs from that time. The other book being called Giant Liners of the World.With ships like the Empress of Canada, Laconia, President Lincoln and Minnewaska, (to name just three of the 62 ships included) the reader will find a wealth of information about some of the greatest passenger-carrying ships of yesteryear. Written in a style which has, sadly, long disappeared, the reader really must study this book in order to gain a full appreciation of its true worth.Most of the ships are afforded 2 pages with one being devoted to facts and statists and the other being a full page photo.Ordinarily, I would have paid far more for any one of the photographs than I paid for the entire book.NM"},{"Title":"The Oragean version,","review":"Only 100 copies of this book were produced, so if you see an original copy, pick it up!

By Takamichi Ninomiya and D. J. Enright","review":"At 104 pages, this thin, unassuming book may not look like much, but it's probably the first presentation in English of some of modern Japan's great poets, many of whom were still alive when this was published in 1957. And it's a fine presentation at that. First of all, it gives the reader a good cross-section of modern Japanese poetry regardless of school, approach, or political orientation. As long as they don't write in the traditional forms of tanka or haiku, everyone gets a moment on the stage here. But only a moment. As you can imagine, such an inclusive attitude over such a short number of pages means that you only get a few poems from each poet (sometimes only one, five or so at the very most), which is not a lot to go on. The miracle is that the selections are so well-chosen and representative, the reader does actually get some vague sense of each poet's distinctiveness with what little's there. The translators have also succeeded in rendering each in a somewhat different poetic voice, which helps immensely--and is very hard to accomplish. The translation method is collaborative, with Ninomiya crafting literal versions and then working with Enright to get them sounding like poetry in the target language--oftentimes this can create clunky and/or misleading translations, but it surprisingly works extremely well here, walking that fine line between deadly prosaic literalness and deceitfully interpretative looseness.The book also includes helpful little extras like an introduction putting all the poems and poets in context and short biographical notes on each poet. Speaking of which, the poets included here are: Shimazaki Toson, Tsuchii Bansui, Susukida Kyukin, Kambara Ariake, Kitahara Hakushu, Miki Rofu, Kinosita Mokutaro, Takamura Kotaro, Yamamura Bocho, Hagiwara Sakutaro, Muro Saisei, Sato Haruo, Miyazawa Kenji, Takahashi Shinkichi, Nakano Shigeharu, Ono Tosaburo, Anzai Fuyue, Kitagawa Fuyuhiko, Takenaka Iku, Yamamura Jun, Miyoshi Tatsuji, Nishiwaki Junzaburo, Kusano Shimpei, Hishiyama Shuzo, Fukao Sumako, Maruyama Kaoru, Tanaka Fuyuji, Ito Shizuo, Tanaka Katsumi, and Tachihara Michizo."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"This book was a gem, and, had I not known that he did some minor revisions (see preface to book) at a mature age, I would have been bewildered by the insights this young writer had into the middle-age mindset. The dry humour that is N.'s forte is blooming on every page, and the characters themselves are not the twisted demons found in Lolita or Pale Fire (Humbert or Kinbote) that we have to laugh or marvel AT lest we embrace the insanity of the character; rather, the sentiments of each character, especially Dreyer, are ones we can laugh WITH. The reader of this book is blessed with Nabokov's unquestionable gift for language and wit. It is one of his only novels that lets its guard down, allowing the reader to do likewise. What &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is for the Coen brothers, this work must have been for Nabokov in that it is a romp which Nabokov must have enjoyed writing from start to finish. Not a single character is left undeveloped, and not a single character is remotely univalent. The complexity of the work is consumate; not twisted to any point of non-reality or perversion. There is no such thing as a light read in N.'s works. This is the closest thing we'll get. (Also, very rewarding for well-read N. fans; later works cross reference it in subtle ways). Read this book!"},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"This novel, also one of the Nab's earliest, shows him as a maturing writer. While the plot is a bit banal, the Nab brings great vividness and such well-drawn characters to it that I remember some of them from first reading it 20 years ago. THe lives in this are unremittingly dreary, mediocre, and only briefly tinged by passion. I expected more, but it isn't a complete dud."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"Franz has come to Berlin for a job. His mother's wealthy cousin (Dreyer) has kindly agreed to take him on in his department store. What neither Dreyer nor Franz has considered is that Mrs. Martha Dreyer would also kindly consent to take him on as her lover. It takes a little planning on her part, but finally the shy, lanky Franz becomes her secret lover, her ticket to a world without Dreyer.King, Queen, Knave is a typical triangle love story. And yet, it's not. Nabokov, even in this early novel, has an excellent feel for human beings, what makes them do what they do and just how much they can stand. Franz and Martha's relationship moves from the sublime to the detestable for Franz, while he becomes a lifeline to Martha. Dreyer, seeing good in all the world, is easily duped--though easily duping Martha on the side.As with Lolita, the plot is not all that great, and I can't truly say I \\"enjoyed\\" the book. But nonetheless, I couldn't stop reading it. I had to continue watching the dynamics change between the King, the Queen and the Knave and see just how the hand was played out."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"Odd how a simple story involving simple people can be anything but simple. As usual, Nabokov renders the world exuberantly and memorably, down to the smallest detail. I read this book decades ago and have just finished reading it now, 25 years on. I thought I would not like it as much the second time round. I was wrong. I like it even more."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"King, Queen, Knave is Nabokov's second novel, and a better-than-decent one, but all the more fun because you can see the amazing genius that is evident, but not yet come to fruition.The book's story is an old one - older man supplanted in bed by younger - but the universality of the topic may simply attest to the potent psychological resonance of the storyline. Where this book stands out, (and how,) is in the wording, which is simply, literally, early Nabokovian. The work of an early master may not be as masterful, but sometimes is all the more interesting for being able to see the brushstrokes."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"It has taken me a long time, but I have finally found what I consider to be a mediocre piece of writing by Nabokov. Apparently he partially wrote it languidly sprawled on a beach sometime during an idle period in his late twenties, and it shows. It is a bright piece of fiction, but lazily put together. The characters do not sparkle, the love traingle plot is tiresome, and even the style seems somewhat deadened - there are some highlights, such as country boy Franz blundering myopically through Berlin without his glasses - but too much of this novel attempts whimsical virtuousity but ends up coming across as sterile. Witness the terrible innuendos to describe orgasms - you can spot them..."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"Wonderful writing, meandering plot, and characters who were hollow at the core. In fact, they were almost caricatures: the cold, scheming wife, the callow, easily-manipulated youth, and the jolly, blustering, unseeing husband. I won't give away the ending, but my basic reaction was &quot;so what?&quot; I struggled to finish this, since I had absolutely no interest in what happened to any of them.However, the journey is the destination, so to speak, and perhaps I should have paid more heed to the first chapter; it takes place on a train--a message to the reader? The sights, smells, and sensations of this novel were entrancing. In the end, however, I was no more moved than if I had observed the action of this novel through a train window."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"Oh, the style certainly is sweet, and I agree with the previous assessment that Martha is a wonderful invention, and the mastery of language already displayed in Mary crackles with pyrotechnics. This was a field day that got a little bit carried away by an author confirming his genius to himself. In other words, the joyous display of lingual gymnastics contained in the vague and rather eventless story comes off a mite bit swaggering. Of course Vladie had something to swagger about. He sadly was never given the opportunity to re-invigorate Russian prose (banned and everything in the Mother Land), but the first play could outshine the re-telling like the glow of heavenly magic.The story goes from A to B in an offhanded manner and certain passages of gorgeous prose don't really need to be there. Four stars out of five for the enjoyment of the language."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"Many think this is a lightweight novel, but it was one of Nabokov's favorite - according to the book jacket - and I agree with his choice. It is a bit similar to Laughter in the Dark, but more humorous. Most of the enjoyment with this book is the discovery of Nabokov's creation. Frankly, I suggest that you skip the reviews here, close your eyes for the moment and simply read the book - the same recommendation that I make for most of his books. Read the comments later.Vladimir Nabokov (1899 to 1977) is a Russian born writer who went to Cambridge, then lived in western Europe, the US, and finally retired in Switzerland. He has a medium sized body of work with numerous novels, short works, and non-fiction. Most know him for his 1955 creation of Lolita, which he wrote and re-wrote for over twenty years before the final product. It was based on a real life French story, but set in America. He has 20 novels, and I have read about half.Eleven of Nabokov's novels come from his early European period when he could write in many languages but he wrote his first 11 novels in Russian. This is from that period. It was his second novel and it was published in 1928 as a book, then translated years later.The story is a love triangle set in Berlin. It is about the 34 year old wife of a 50 year old store owner, and the owner's young nephew. Beyond that, the reader can discover the plot.It is a very humorous and entertaining a book. Having read many of his novels and most of his best sellers, I thought it was excellent and either a touch short of his best or among the best. It is a matter of taste, but I liked \\"King, Queen, Knave\\" and \\"Laughter in the Dark\\" as his best works, notwithstanding \\"Pale Fire\\" and \\"Lolita.\\" That latter show more creativity as does \\"Transparent Things\\" - as do a few of his other works.I think it is an excellent and an entertaining read. Some might not think it is among his best novels, but I liked it."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"Nabokov's second novel, his brightest and lightest of the lot, is regarded by some as being one of the weaker links in the author's ouvre.The plot here is pretty banal (a bland, country boy Franz falls in love with the wife of his rich uncle who lives in Berlin and before you know it Franz and his aunt are pathetically planning the murder of the middle-man). Nabokov pokes some fun at the story of Madame Bovary and offers somewhat of a parody. As usual though, the plot here takes backstage to the form and style of writing and Nabokov does not disappoint; the prose is beautiful and enchanting (minus some laughable sexual innuendos and so on) and makes the novel worth reading.While it's far from counting among Nabokov's strongest works, I still enjoyed the book and certain images have and will remain with me (especially the last couple of chapters, filled with the imagery of azure beaches and wide open skies). Nabokov does make an 'appearance' in the novel (a la Hitchcock), along with his wife, as the couple with whom Franz becomes somewhat obsessed at the seaside resort (look for mention of the butterfly net).This is a relatively light and accessible Nabokov read, recommended for shiny summer days."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"This is an entertaining novel about a love triangle. The only twist about the story is the end which turns out to be surprising and satisfying, but what makes this novel exceptional is Nabakov's beautiful prose style and capability for penetrating the depths of the character's thoughts with intense lyrical innovations. I don't think you are meant to like any of the characters, but consider them to be hard toys with which Nabakov can play his devilish word games."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"Vladmir Nabakov may be the closest kin in the twentieth century to the magnificent imagination of \\"The one thousand and one Arabian Nights\\". Yet this is not entirely an apt comparison, for whereas the \\"Nights\\" was a framework in which the dreams were presented as a reality, Nabakov's is a strange world wherein the reality is painted as a lush, evanescent dream. But beware the reader, who thinks this mere clever wordplay, for to read Nabakov is to be entranced into a highly sophisticated web where life is as much a romantic dirge as a brilliant puzzle. King, Queen, Knave was by his own admission, \\"my gayest novel\\", and yet there is a kind of sadness here amidst the gaiety and superlative sequence of almost divine juxtapositions that I have only experienced from the likes of a virtuoso rendition of Paganini.The basic story is a simple love triangle, a rich Uncle, a faux nephew and a cold aunt, and of course involves an illicit affair culminating in a murderous plot. And yet what is not simple is how Nabakov deftly draws these characters, at once ultra real and but also aloof, blatant caricatures of the human soul. Like a pack of playing cards, thinking themselves to be free, but fully boxed in. And it's quite amusingly funny, but Nabakov's humor springs from diverse and often mundane sources - the ambience, the shaggy dog, the inward blindness of his protagonists and situations involving the Uncle and the two lovers where the former is completely unaware that he is being cuckolded right under his canopy. Personally, though, what I find most delightful is the poetic details that N throws in gratuitously everywhere, e.g.- The time when Uncle Dreyer, who is the owner of a large Berlin Department store pays a surprise visit to his nephew and his cohorts who work in the sporting goods dept. And \\"An early customer, who wanted another ball for his dog, was ignored for an instant\\" or consider \\"an old sculptor whose work was so lifelike that he managed to convey the impression of acute chorea\\". The descriptions of the lovemaking are also highly erotic - but I won't quote from that, not to mention the brilliant morphing of scenes and persons. Enough said. This book is a veritable masterpiece and a highly entertaining one at that.One final quote: \\"A baker in the encyclopedia who had poisoned an entire parish told the prison barber who was shaving his neck that never in his life had he slept so well\\".And there is a wonderful twist even in the last paragraph."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"I have read Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, and Effi Briest... and so it was with certain trepidation that I approached yet another novel dealing with the theme of adultery. But the twists and turns (and breathtaking close calls) in &quot;King, Queen, Knave&quot;, along with the brilliant characterization of Martha Dreyer make this book unique and well worth looking into. An excellent story. I was most impressed with the way Nabokov layed bare the tattered edges of Franz's conscience in the latter third of the story. The only reason I did not give this book a perfect rating is because the very ending left me a bit bewildered. (Maybe the author intended this)? All in all, to think that Nabokov published this book when he was but 28 years old leaves me with only one word to describe his talent: GENIUS! Read it."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"Nabokov got famous partly because, unlike most of his contemporaries, he went out of his way to remind his readers that his stories were untrue. That's now a very popular postmodern trick, and it's in operation right from the start of \\"King, Queen, Knave\\" - its well-known first line suggests that the story is little more than a wind-up toy. As a train carrying Franz, the Knave of the title, slowly moves out of the station, the description suggests that it's really standing still - rather, it's the station, the town, and the rest of the world that moves backwards.Other such techniques abound throughout the novel, and it can be difficult to tell just what they add to the story, entertaining though they often are. So let's have a look at that story first. Maybe that will help.The aforesaid Franz travels to Berlin for a job - it seems that his uncle, a wealthy department-store owner named Dreyer, met up with Franz's mother on his way home from a vacation with his wife and made the job offer without even meeting Franz. The younger man encounters uncle Dreyer and Dreyer's wife Martha on the train without realizing who they are and immediately conceives a towering desire for Martha. She's not at all displeased by this, actually. She's of a cool temperament, overwhelmingly concerned with social niceties, and finds her boisterous, life-loving husband utterly repulsive. So they all arrive in Berlin, come to realize their family relationship, and away we go.Aside from the blood relationship between the characters in this triangle, you've come across this exact setup in loads of stories, from \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" to \\"Body Heat\\" (not to mention the often-referenced \\"Madame Bovary\\"). It's nice and soapy, but not very compelling on its own. Maybe that's the function of all those postmodern tricks.As best as I can tell, the trick in this novel that gets the most mention in the critical literature has to do with a group of mobile department-store mannequins. Dreyer gets a visit from the inventor of these objects, and the inventor builds three of them as a demonstration - one figure of an older man, one of a younger man, and one of a woman. You read what happens to the three of them during the demonstration, and you get a pretty good prediction of what's going to happen to Dreyer, Franz and Martha respectively. In most novels, giving your ending away like that is a big no-no, but remember that funny mechanical construction at the beginning of this book? If the characters in this love triangle are so predictable that a bunch of dressmaker's dummies can tell what's going to happen before the climax, what does that say about their various passions?And sure enough, the longer this story goes on, the less convincing the three of them are about the love they supposedly feel. However, don't get the idea that the story is less interesting because the characters aren't emotionally involved in it. They are emotionally involved in something, believe me. Nabokov's just misdirecting your attention, like a true magician would.You run across a few other postmodern misdirections, such as the fact that a local movie theater is getting ready to show a film called \\"King, Queen, Knave,\\" and the appearance of Nabokov himself and his wife in the last two chapters. In his preface, Nabokov warned the psychological establishment (which he never liked and insisted upon referring to as \\"the Viennese delegation\\") that he had planted a few traps in his novel for them. I'm no expert, but I have a hunch that this novel was (among other things) Nabokov's way of insisting that sexual motives do not, in fact, run everything in life, as Freud seemed to believe.Anyway, he informs us that this \\"bright brute\\" of a novel is the most colorful and merriest he ever wrote. That's an odd claim for a story of marital infidelity, betrayal and attempted murder, but it sort of works - he even went so far as to use the word \\"pretty\\" almost every other page. Which only goes to show how playful Nabokov could be. As I've said before, the details of his biography can make him appear quite a dilettante - he was born into privilege and never seemed to lose the sense that the world was a toy - but you dig a little deeper and find that he actually had an enormous compassion for people. That lightness of touch allowed him to show his characters' inner lives without passing judgment on them. That's actually very respectful.It also allowed him to see his characters much more clearly than most authors could. Wait until you find out who the actual hero of \\"King, Queen, Knave\\" is. It's certainly not Martha, who at one point has her dog put down for the sake of her own convenience, and seems determined to play the same low trick on her husband, that great, expansive lover of life. Although Nabokov seldom based his novels on his own biography, he too seems to have been a great lover of life, with his long loving marriage and his great butterfly-hunting adventures. He was quiet about his love of life, but it's there, all right.Benshlomo says, If life is a game, at least play it well."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"the attraction of this book is the sense of things to come with regards to the author's future books. whereas &quot;mary&quot;, nabokov's first novel, emits a warm autobiographic glow, &quot;king, queen, knave&quot; does an about face to depict a world utterly distant and alien from the author's personal milieux. the result is an abstract world not quite as pure and fantastic as the one created in &quot;lolita&quot;, indeed the former pales greatly by comparison, but an abstract world which is nonetheless plausible and artistically pleasing. there are two unforgettable images in this novel. one adumbrates nabokov's penchant for condemning cruelty by having his characters indulge in it, that very cruelty, with inexcusable zest and relish; while the other gives us a taste of the author's wicked sense of humor. they are: marthe's repeated beatings and/or chastisements of tom, the family dog, and the pathetic fate of the monkey, a gift for marthe from dreyer before their marriage, which burns itself trying to light a match. these two images, which are patented nabokov, are just the tip of the iceberg in a body of work abrim with unforgettable images."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"This is the only Nabokov novel I have read, but it sticks in my mind as sensual and tragic... definitely reminiscent of Shakespeare.&quot;The Graduate&quot; also comes to mind.Nabokov's descriptive detail puts the reader into the rented room of the nephew, where the first sexual encounter takes place. He doesn't romanticize - he tells everything exactly like it &quot;is&quot; &amp; makes it extremely real.Very suspenseful at the end, although I see the description on this site reveals the entire ending, so it ruins it for any potential readers!So don't read that, just read the book. It evoked strong emotion in me, suffering with the characters' situations, frustrations, and desires."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"Often considered the greatest writer of the 20th Century (well, to everyone except those on the Nobel committee), Nabokov was a master in his ability to wrap language with a lyricism that created prose that seems to flow off the page. If he wasn't born with this skill, Nabokov sure developed it early, as is evidenced in KING, QUEEN, KNAVE, only his second novel. It is as beautifully written as the other books of his I have read.As KING, QUEEN, KNAVE is more humorous than many of Nabokov's other books, there is a tendency to not take it quite as seriously. I think that is a mistake. The book is a wonderful read. That it has a more amusing undertone than some of his others demonstrates not a less serious book, but that Nabokov had such control over his literary talents that they shone through on the lighter material as well as they did on the heavier.A young man goes to Berlin to try to get a job with his successful uncle. He is more successful, though, in the bedroom with his aunt! Their plans to kill the old man and live off his riches go awry, in that ironic sort of way that makes you realize that the author was as much a master of plot as he was of prose.Easy to see as merely a bizarre love triangle, KING, QUEEN, KNAVE is better seen through the prism of Nabokov's well known dislike, actually more like contempt, of the theories of Sigmund Freud. The heart of psychoanalytic thought, after all, is the young man's sexual desire for his mother and competition with his father for her affections. The relations may be a touch more distant, but the characters in this novel seem to be acting out a warped vision of the Oedipus complex, mocking Freud while creating a good story to boot."},{"Title":"King, queen, knave: A novel","review":"This was Nabokov's second novel, published when he was a mere 28 years old. Thirty-nine years later, after writing so many other fabulous books he said of King, Queen, Knave &quot;of all my novels this bright brute is the gayest.&quot; By this he meant that he enjoyed contemplating its &quot;rapturous composition&quot; and reminiscing of how the idea for it first came to him on the coastal sands of Pomerania. The book maintained a special place in his heart. The theme is in many ways similar to Anna Karenina or Madame Bovary, as Nabokov himself admits in the Foreword to the revised English version. I love those other books dearly, but Nabokov's contains several twists and turns that are even more dramatic and less likely for the reader to detect ahead of time than either of those other classic husband/wife/paramour triangle stories.The setting here is Berlin in the 1920's. The young, unsophisticated Franz arrives on the doorstep of his rich uncle Dreyer with hopes of securing a job in his department store. He gets the job and repays Dreyer's magnanimity by falling for his beautiful wife Martha. (Franz's aunt? Hello!) Martha's seduction of Franz seems to be motivated by something at least bordering on pure boredom, but at any rate, the triangle is set. Dreyer, oblivious to this development, plods on with his money-making schemes and inventions/diversions. Martha, in a departure from the more suicidal natures of Anna K. or Emma B. decides rather to begin clumsily plotting her husband's death so that she and Franz will be able to live happily ever after on his money. But things are not so easy in anything Nabokovian are they? Well, things don't work out the way they're supposed to here either, and that's all I will say. Far be it from me to unravel a rope the Nabokov has so skillfully stretched tight. By the end of this story Franz's conscience lies in tatters, and Martha is _____!The only reason I don't give the book a perfect 5 stars is because the very ending left me a tad bewildered. I attribute that to a fault in my reading of it and trust that you, being much sharper than I, will rate your experience with King, Queen, Knave a star higher than I did."},{"Title":"The Money Mystery: The Hidden Force Affecting Your Career, Business, and Investments (An Uncle Eric Book)","review":"Excellent primer in economics, that is for the layman like myself. In lucid, clear terms, Maybury describes the meanings of the demand for money, velocity and inflation and how it affects us from all over the world.In this, low velocity exists in the low volume of currency being transferred due to persons holding on to their money, while high velocity exists in higher volumes of money transfer. And while the government inflates the money supply to pay for their expenses, inflation occurs which can lead to the second stage of devalue and inflation and third stage of runaway inflation. And so the government then raises interest rates and stops printing in attempt to slow down the inflation, which usually brings on a recession. It is here where many businesses are adversely affected from expansion from the inflation, only to be severely affected during the recession.In this, Maybury brings out the history lesson from the French, prior the revolution, from over inflating the money supply and the subsequent results of runaway inflation; the end result was a new government with a dictator, Napoleon. And the history of President Carter's freeze on Iranian assets in response to the hostages held for the U.S. protection of the overthrown Shah. And so such a freeze caused panic in the other Arab countries, who could not liquidate their assets so quickly as they were bound in real estate and other non-liquid holdings. And then Carter's embargo on Russia from her invasion in Afghanistan also created a panic in the economy, the dollar way down, gold way up. Lessons to learn.Helpful advise is given on how to invest - short term, on what to watch for, the curve in interest. A great theory is given on what has been happening over the recent years. The ideas are that the U.S. has been issuing bonds with greater interest which people buy and subsequently hold on to. This way the government can print to their hearts desire and not increase the velocity and inflation and the deficit can go up to unlimited degrees. But this however will bottom out one day when people become aware. And when that does, look out, there will be runaway third stage inflation - a disaster. So there are things to do and watch for and Maybury is truly beneficial and helpful, significant advice, knowledge and insight to be more alert in what to watch for.What also is highly recommended are Maybury's other books in economics, \\"What ever Happened to Penny Candy?\\" and \\"The Clipper Ship Strategy.\\""},{"Title":"The Money Mystery: The Hidden Force Affecting Your Career, Business, and Investments (An Uncle Eric Book)","review":"If you are a libertarian or want to learn more about the stages of inflation this is a great little book.Great for home schoolers and anyone worried about Federal Reserve and possible worldwide collapse of thecentral banking system.

A few chapters in, you're swept, but in that rushing-rapids, I forgot the life jacket kind of way because, in the end, you really don't develop a care for meth addictions or compulsive sex -- and just when I thought I really could get into that family of origin, the Muscle Mary falls ridiculously short. Dear Ben, you're a good looking guy, but you should stick to the weights. Stop hawking your bod as a sign of your talent and leave the careful craft to those who hunger for it, not for some guy who needs something to do between electronically digitized voiceovers. Thanks."},{"Title":"Third and Heaven: A Novel","review":"The author does a great job of getting you interested in the lives of the characters fairly early in the book. It symbolizes the need for friends in one's life & reinforces that we are not alone in the world.I found particularly interesting were the Freddie/Julian & Joshua/Ritchie storylines. I think that the reader will easily identify similar characteristics in their own circle of friends and in the 4 main characters.Definitely a good read. It has a good pace to it!"},{"Title":"Third and Heaven: A Novel","review":"I have to agree with some of the other reviews here..this was by far the lamest book I have read in a long time. I am basically half way through the book and seriously considering dropping it. It is like a VERY BAD version of Sex & the City but only difference the characters are all gay and the lines not nearly as funny or intelligent. None of the characters, with maybe the exception of Claire have anything interesting or funny to say. Not to mention the countless typos and bad English used in sentences all over the book. For someone who obviously worships his own body, Ben spent way too much time writting about a greasy spoon breakfast place. I agree...Ben, stick to the weights and voice overs..leave the writting to people who can actually do it."},{"Title":"Third and Heaven: A Novel","review":"This book is thoroughly fun and enjoyable. Johnson gets at some weighty stuff, but uses humor as the sugar that helps the medicine go down. I read it over the course of the weekend and was glad I did."},{"Title":"Third and Heaven: A Novel","review":"\\"Third & Heaven\\" is the nickname given to Nobles, a Weho-trendy diner actually located in Los Angeles, which is a popular rendevous spot for many locals. Among them are a quartet of thirty-something friends, three gay men and one straight woman, from diverse backgrounds, spending their weeks seeking professional and personal fulfillment, but actually looking for love.There's Freddy, a former entertainment show host (likely also the central character in author Johnson's earlier work, \\"In And Out In Hollywood\\", though this isn't made clear) now trying to make a living as an author, and has a compulsive crush on a Broadway actor-singer. Claire is a twice-divorced rather sardonic osteopathic physician with a daughter in college, a dog named \\"Dog\\", estranged from her own mother, and with a seeming knack of atracting lunatics as potential suitors. Joshua, a nice Jewish boy from Salt Lake City, moved to Los Angeles after losing a lover to AIDS in San Francisco, and managing to eek out a living as a publicist to a handful of former sitcom stars and relative nobodys. Last but not least, Richie is a Sicilian hunk from the south side of Chicago, who came to L.A. to be an actor, and is working as a personal trainer. The story covers how each met and grew to became a part of their mutual support system, and establishes how each person's strengths are used to help the group and each other. For example, Freddy is kind of the peacemaker when something goes wrong, Claire cooks great dinners and has a gift for putting everyone's (except her own) life in perspective, Joshua is the business brain, and Richie is their conscience that keeps them from binging on junk food. Besides their standing brunch date on Saturdays, they might meet, together or in twos and threes, several times during the week, and also keep in touch by phone. They share their successes and failures, keep each other focused on their goals, give each other relationship advice, spend the holidays together, and try to keep each other sane in the madness that is Los Angeles. Colorful supporting characters, including a tweaked-out boytoy, a stalker who forwards Claire love letters he sent himself from her, Joshua's inscrutable Asian male receptionist, a closeted actor having an affair with Joshua, and assorted show-biz movers, shakers and low-lifes.I greatly enjoyed the patter and interaction between the characters, who each faced a personal demon and came out ahead with the others' help and support."},{"Title":"Third and Heaven: A Novel","review":"This was a great book to read while flying through the air. Almost brought me to tears a couple times."},{"Title":"Third and Heaven: A Novel","review":"I live in L.A. and know firsthand how insane the entertainment business is. That Johnson captures some of its players with style and empathy -- and makes them funny in a kind, loving way -- says a lot for his writing ability. There are some haters out there who will slam Johnson because he does so many things so well. But I am here to say that writing is definitely a big strength of his. I do not know him personally but I will eagerly await his next novel. Especially enjoyed the section in Third and Heaven where Ritchie auditions for American Idol."},{"Title":"Third and Heaven: A Novel","review":"Do you hear that choking sound? It's me eating my words. At the end of 2005 I placed THIRD & HEAVEN on my worst books of the year list. I hadn't liked Johnson's first book, IN AND OUT IN HOLLYWOOD, at all, so admittedly I approached THIRD AND HEAVEN with a great deal of skepticism. When I first started to read it I was annoyed by Johnson's present tense narrative style, never a favorite of mine, so rather than push forward, I allowed my unpleasant memories of his first book, to color my decision. In other words, I quit the book less than ten pages in, and I said as much placing my yearly list on different web sites.For some unexplainable reason, I decided to give the book another try. Much to my surprise, I discovered a passionate, realistic, if sometimes tragic, story about life, and how to deal with all it throws at you.The novel takes a look at the lives of Claire, Ritchie, Joshua, and Freddie, yes, the same Freddie from Johnson's first book, four good friends who meet every Saturday at the same charming but trendy dinner for breakfast. Freddie is now a writer working primarily for internet publications, and still looking for Mr. Right. Claire is an Osteopath with a successful practice and a messed-up love life. Ritchie is an actor, working as a physical trainer, trying to break into show business, and going about it all wrong, and Joshua is a struggling publicist with one demanding client and a strong inclination towards black depressions. Through the ups, and more frequent downs, of each of their lives there remains one constant. They have each other to lean on, and subsequently do.THIRD & HEAVEN has a strong message. Life is exciting and fun but mostly it sucks, this is how it sucks, and here's what you can do about it. You can put all your faith in the power of love, not God, not nature, not fate, just good old fashioned love, be it for a special someone, or those friends you'd jump into the abyss with. Give your trust over to love and regardless of what happens you'll make it through. To quote the book, \\"One can only love, laugh at the absurdity of living, and love some more.\\"Upon finishing THIRD & HEAVEN, I knew I must write this review, because I had so misjudged its content. This novel is not among the worst of 2005 it is among the very best. This is not, as I had erroneously assumed, a poorly written piece of self indulgence, but is instead a beautifully metered examination of how we as human beings cope with this confusing state called life. It is most definitely deserving of five (*****) stars."},{"Title":"Schism: Part One of Triad (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Asaro books are sprinled with strong female characters. Soz is my favorite. In this book we find out what Soz was like as an adolescent(17 years old). As befits the future Imperator of the Skolian empire Soz is brilliant, driven, opiniated. She has already created some waves; hacking into the computer complex of her planetary system; having the best test score of ten million. However she has not yet found the balance which comes with age and experience. She argues with her father; her father disowns her, she argues with her superior officer and gets demerits. Under all this though; Soz has grit & integrity. She always comes through in the end. This is the story of Soz going to military academy against the wishes of her father, becoming a Jagernaut (cybernetic warrior); and how circumstances combine for a father/daughter reconciliation. I wait impatiently for the next book. The Final Key : Part Two of Triad. Hoping for a description of my favorite hero in combat situation for the first time."},{"Title":"Schism: Part One of Triad (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Humanity has colonized thousands of worlds; technology and medicine have made incredible advances; yet war still exists. The Skolian Empire is based on democratic ideals while conversely the Aristo Traders Empire is built on slavery. Hostility seems imminent between these giants.On the planet Lyshriol, seventeen years old Soz has gone behind her father Eldrinson's back to take the preliminary exams to enroll in the Desham Military Academy where her brother Alhtor is a fourth year cadet. Due to her high scores on the tests and the upcoming need for warriors, the Academy waives the age and parental requirements enabling Soz to enroll. Soz's father angrily disowns both Soz and Althor.Their father regrets his words almost immediately but before he can do anything about it, his as his fourteen year old son has run away. As he looks for the lad, an Aristo capture him. Somehow the Traders have bypassed security on this Skolian planet. The Aristo cripples and blind him; when he recovers he withdraws from everyone even his beloved wife. Meanwhile Soz amazes everyone as she learns at an accelerated pace, but now she knows what happened to her father and vows to be the avenging Jagernaut.Soz is a very interesting character, who, if she lives long enough, will probably replace her half-brother as the Imperator when Korj is unable to fulfill those duties any longer. Like her sire, she is a strong independent warrior who refuses to accept any weakness as she expects to be more than just the best soldier the academy ever graduated. Her father has a long recuperative road to journey, but like Soz stubbornly refused to allow his captors the victory they expected. SCHISM is filled with adventure, intrigue and drama on personal and galaxy levels that makes for an obvious Nebula nomination.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Schism: Part One of Triad (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Schism is another excellent entry into the Skolian universe of books. It features one of my favorite characters - Sauscony - that Asaro has created. The manner in which Asaro has written these books (this is the tenth novel), moving many years backwards and forwards in time and shifting from character to character as she fills in the stories of the Ruby pharoh clan gives one an interesting and sometimes dizzying perspective on the characters. One would think that already knowing a particular character's fate would make a story about the early years of that character less than compelling, but Asaro pulls it off. As ever, I am looking forward to the next entry in this saga.P.S. Amazon Readers/Buyers beware. Beware reviewer Harriet Klausner, who supposedly read reviewed many thousands of books on Amazon, including this one. She always gives four or five stars (usually five stars) and her reviews are utterly formulaic, making one wonder if she/he/they actually read the books. In any event, how can anyone love every one of the thousands and thousands of books she/he/they have supposedly read?"},{"Title":"Schism: Part One of Triad (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"After Skyfall, with its cliche Roca/Eldrinson romance plot, I was a bit apprehensive about what I'd find in this book. Happily, I can report that this novel is a definite improvement over the last one.While it does deal heavily with Eldrinson and Roca again, this time Roca comes across as a person, rather than a perfect fantasy romance heroine. And Eldrinson actually grows as a character; he starts out as quite provincial and sexist, and is forced to open his eyes to the realities of the harsh universe he lives in. Eldrinson's never been a favorite of mine, but in this book I enjoyed reading about him.There is a very strong focus on Soz, Roca and Eldrinson's daughter who in earlier books was a great warrior and even became the leader of the Skolian military (Primary Inversion, The Radiant Seas). In this book, a much younger Soz defies her father and goes to the Skolian Jagernaut military academy. Even in her youth, she's a terrific character, with a nice balance of strengths and flaws. I found her reaction to all the pressures she was under quite believable, especially near the end where she behaves in a way that will be recognizable to overstressed students and cadets everywhere. She gives in to temptation, justifies it to herself, but comes clean in the end.Kurj, Roca's eldest son, also comes across as more of a person than he has in the past. While I like that he's getting more development and is no longer being treated as an unfeeling antagonist, I do fear that he will become less intriguing with too much exposure. After Spherical Harmonic, I found Dyhianna Selei to be more sympathetic but much less interesting. I'd hate to see Kurj go the same way.We also get some background on Soz's older brother, Althor.There was a lot of development done on Shannon (another of Roca and Eldrinson's many children) and his relationship to the Blue Dale Archers. The Archers are fascinating (if a bit elvish *G*), but again, too much exposure will probably make them less intriguing. Sometimes the mystery is more interesting than the explanation. I thought we got a good balance in this novel, though. Still, I look forward to finding out more about why the old Ruby Empire engineered the Lyshriol system and its occupants. This mystery has only grown over the last few novels, but I'm enjoying it immensely.Once again, a member of the Skolian royal family is captured and tortured by an Aristo. That part seemed rather repetitive, as this is a common occurrence in Asaro's books. By the time she's through, that whole family is going to be completely traumatized and dysfunctional. *G* However, in this case it is done so that Eldrinson's character can change and grow, so I'm not going to complain too much.Overall, this book was a good read. We got a lot of character background and development. There was a decent amount of technical science fiction, but nothing too overwhelming. Asaro's last couple of books only included the science fiction aspects as set dressing, so seeing the advanced tech treated with some depth and as integral to the story was nice.To sum up, I enjoyed this book and would even recommend it as a good entry point into Asaro's Skolian Empire series."},{"Title":"Schism: Part One of Triad (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"In \\"Schism,\\" Catherine Asaro returns to the saga of one of her most fascinating characters, Sauscony (Soz) Valdoria, who readers first met in the author's first novel in the Skolian Empire series, \\"Primary Inversion.\\"Here we drop in on Soz years before, in her late adolescence, as she prepares for military academy, against the wishes of her father, Eldrinson.Catherine Asaro develops a fascinating contrast--the \\"fast cold universe\\" of the high-tech military acadmey and the low-tech world of her father. The author interweaves the adventures of Soz, her parents, and her siblings skillfully, spinning a classic hard science fiction adventure (this time without the author's trademark hot sex).There are a few scenes that rank with some of the author's best work, and without spoiling the plot I'll mention the scene in which Soz's \\"node\\" is implanted, and the thrilling battle between the jagernaut squadron and the invading enemy.Notes and asides: To the publisher's great credit, \\"Schism\\" is prominently billed as \\"Part 1 of Triad.\\" I.e., the publisher makes no pretense that all of the story is told here (and it clearly is not). And to the author's great credit, she does not leave her readers perched atop a cliff."},{"Title":"Schism: Part One of Triad (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"This book is a bit different from the more recent entries by Asaro in her Skolian series, better. For all of us who have not been thrilled by her trend toward sexy romance, Asaro returns to complex sci-fi in Triad. We learn about the military and the commitment required of cadets at the academy as seen through the experiences of the 17-year old Soz, a novice, whom we already know will be the future leader of the Skolian Empire. We also begin to understand the personal conflict Soz has with her father over her decision not to marry and stay on her home world, but to pursue a career in the military that will put her in harm's way during the coming war.This book is not a good place to begin the series. Triad is a backstory. (I prefer to start with Primary Inversion.) Asaro does not publish this series in chronological order. The books may be about any one of the 15 or so main Rhon characters during three generations at any point in their lives. If you have read any of the other books in the series you know how the story began in Triad turns out. Rather, Triad fills in gaps in the Valdorian family saga and helps us understand why they are the way they are. They do not always behave as I would have expected them to. After all, they are Rhon and considered royals. Eldrin is more close-minded. Soz is more hotheaded. Kurj is more human. Althor is more confused. Shannon is more complex. In some ways it is very comforting to know that things are going to work out for these people, at least for a while. I found this book to be much more interesting than I expected. I cannot wait for the next installment. I just wish the books had better cover art. No sex or sexy thoughts in Triad; some general references to bi-sexuality and homosexuality."},{"Title":"Schism: Part One of Triad (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Schism is not my favorite book but it's definetly on my list for \\"Read again in the future\\"! I am pleased to tell all of you that this book was extremely well-written. I LOVE to read well-written books. The plot is made realistically as also the characters actions and emotions. Despite the fact that every once in a while you'll get \\"lost\\" and not know exactly what's going on that'll soon pass and you'll be stuck in reading once more. You'll definetly want to try out Schism.Soz is a girl dreaming of becoming a J-Force pilot. Her time comes when her step-brother Kurj needs an heir and picks her and her older brother, Althor. Her leaving is upsetting. Her father, his majesty, Eldrinson, the ruler of the Ruby Dynasty doesn't and hasn't ever approved of Soz fighting. He doesn't wish for his daughter to die on the battlefield so he banishes her for leaving and Althor for bringing her with him. That's nothing but trouble for them but they leave anyway and they begin their adventure.This book is breath-taking and will leave you searching for the sequel.

The initial work in this sequence isPrimary Inversion.In the previous volume, Roca was trying to evade the agents of her son Kurj in order to return to Parthonia for a debate and vote on invading the Platinum Sectors. She was stranded on Capsize, an antiquated spaceport, with only a rusty bucket of bolts for transportation. But it holds together long enough to take her to Skyfall.Skyfall is obviously an ancient colony of the Ruby Empire. A crowd of locals rode up on their animals and surrounded the port house. The locals got excited, their leader Eldri lifted her up onto his lyrine, and the whole party galloped away.In this novel, Roca is the sister of the current Ruby Pharaoh. She has been married to Eldri for decades and has had ten children by him.Eldrinson Althor Valdoria is a bard and warrior on Lyshriol -- known to offworlders as Skyfall -- and the ruler of Dalvador. Eldri has been married to Roca for a decade.Eldrin Valdoria is the first child of Eldri and Roca. Dryni is a bard like his father.Althor Izam-Na Valdoria is the second child of Eldri and Roca. He is now a cadet at the Dieshan Military Academy and training to be a Jagernaut.Del-Kurj is the third child of Eldri and Roca. Del is the twin of Chaniece Roca.Havyrl Torcelle is the fifth child of Eldri and Roca. Vyrl is married to Lily and has three children.Sauscony Lahaylia Valdoria is the sixth child of Eldri and Roca.

Kelric is also wants to be a Jagernaut.Starjack Tahota is a Colonel in the Imperial Fleet. She coordinates admissions for the Imperial Space Command Academies.In this story, Althor comes home to Lyshriol in a Jag starfighter. Soz observes the fighter landing on the minute starport and recognizes its type. She is determined to leave the planet in it.Shannon sees the starfighter and runs over the plains toward home. Del also notices the fighter and informs his father of its presence. Then Kelric slams into the house with the same news.Kelric wants to go to the starport to meet the pilot. Eldri wants them to wait until they learn more about the visit. Del suggests that they stay in the house with its protections.Eldri and Del don't know how to activate the security system, but Kelric does. They climb up the Blue Tower to watch the landing. Soz is on the walkway outside with her back to them.Kelric pushes open the window and calls to Soz. His father pulls him inside and warns him to be careful. They watch two people in dark clothes leave the Jag and cross the tarmac. They are met by a woman from the port, who converses with the visitors and then returns to a port building.The visitors head toward Dalvador and the castle. They remind Eldri of Althor. When he wonders why he is thinking of Althor, Eldri realizes that one visitor is his son.After greeting his son, Eldri enters the Hearth Room with Althor on one side and Del on the other, with Kelric following them. Roca arrives with several people around her. Vyrl and his wife and children come with her.Later Soz meets the woman and learns that she is Colonel Tahota. She has come with Althor because he is not authorized to fly the Jag except with an instructor. Also, she wants to talk to Soz about admission to DMA.Soz has not applied to the academy, but Tahota says that they are aware of her test scores. Soz tells her that Eldri doesn't approve of women warriors and will not give his permission. Tahota suggests that the admissions committee will admit her to the academy even without her father's approval.Soz talks to Eldri and tells him that she is going to DMA even if he does not give his permission. She also tells him that Althor and Soz have been designated as the heir of their half-brother Kurj. He tells Soz that she will be disowned if she leaves. Soz turns away and flies off Lyshriol in the Jag with Althor and Tahota.This tale introduces Soz to all the advanced technology of the Skolian Empire. She is admitted to the academy and meets her three roommates. Soz has some adapting to do for Skolian ways.Meanwhile, Eldri is having problems back on Lyshriol.

Perhaps if I had started this series at beginning, I would have cared more about them, but, as it was, none were that likeable, interesting, or believable.

Fans of romance might not like this one as much as her other books in the Raylicon universe -- there are no love scenes. However, being the fabulous storyteller that she is, she again artfully mixes science, scientific speculation, paranormal, and genuine human struggle as Soz and her family each make their way through the obstacles in their path. You'll relate to all her characters and cheer them on to the finish. Of course the end of this book isn't really the finish: there's another book in the 2-book \\"Triad\\" group called The Final Key. Slightly confusing, the labeling Triad, but fans who've read the previous books will have no trouble with the reference to the Ruby Dynasty Triad that keeps the Kyle \\"net\\" running the Raylicon universe. I especially enjoyed the thread of Schism that deals with one of Soz's younger brothers, Shannon. He is genetically descended from a group called the Blue Dale Archers. Their looks and manner are very elf-like. Shannon is a wonderfully drawn character who, at 15, faces great obstacles to help save his family and find his place in the world. Thoroughly enjoyable and highligh recommended!"},{"Title":"Understanding FFT Applications, Second Edition","review":"I own both the Understanding the FFT volume and its companion, Understanding FFT Applications. They have their place on my technical bookshelf. If you are new to the FFT, or just so-so with undergrad level engineering math, then this series of volumes on the FFT is likely to prove a gold mine. If you eventually tire of being taught by example at a sometimes slow and tedious pace after you are exposed to the basics, look elsewhere.The complete titles of the books say it all. They are tutorials for laymen, students, technicians and working engineers. They are NOT sophisticated. If you are seeking enough understanding to grasp some fundamentals by example they can be highly recommended as a place to start.Unfortunately, despite its strengths, the series feeds into the \\"this is all you have to know if you are a practical person\\" mentality frequently expressed by many I've met in the technical areas. The ideas of \\"practical and useful\\" should always be qualified by the terms \\"for what and to whom\\". It all depends on who you are and what you are trying to do.It is true that sometimes it is better to cut to the heart of the matter with simplistic approaches, but challenging problems are not all reducible to these kinds of \\"seat of the pants\\" approaches. The trick is knowing when to \\"hold or fold\\". Sometimes it is actually more \\"practical\\" to acquire a more sohpisticated approach to a subject, as it saves huge amounts of time and effort later on, and can provide insights that are not initially obvious.Fourier transforms are a sophisticated mathematical tool with broad applications frequently found in areas where analysis of complex data sets is important. They are not just \\"tools for the working engineer\\". If you are serious about mastering them, you must spend the time and effort.This series is a good place to start, it is hardly the final definitive text, even for the working technical person who wants a powerful understanding of the subject. If you want some good powerful intros to the subject at a more advance level, just look at the Bibliography of Understanding the FFT."},{"Title":"Understanding FFT Applications, Second Edition","review":"I bought this book and its companion \\"Understanding the FFT\\" to add to my basic knowledge of Fourier transforms.

That should be the book's caveat, as many of the protagonists had already appeared in full length novel form before these stories were published. The lineup includes such luminaries as Loren Estlemen's Amos Walker, Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder, Bill Pronzini's &quot;Nameless&quot; and Editor Robert J. Randisi's own Miles Jacoby. All of the series characters featured are currently ongoing (or at least were as of 1996, when the book was published). Editor Randisi knows his stuff, having been the founder of the Private Eye Writers of America.All that said, the quality of the stories varies. Some of the writers had yet to really find their voice and some (especially the older) stories are somewhat by-the-numbers. Nevertheless, the book is an inetersting historical artifactfor those who want insight on how their heros developed. My personal favorites are Block's and Estlemen's. They show again why they are, for my money, the two best and most consistent private eye writers currently working in the genre."},{"Title":"The poets and poetry of Europe","review":"The collections of poetry in this book are an excellent sampling from the rich histories of the European countries. The collections are placed into groups organized by country, then further broken down by chronological occurance. Each section includes in-depth historical and philological information in the form of an extensive preface written by some of the most respected scholars of the period.The poems selected for this book are no less interesting than the history they represent. For example, several poems by Michelangelo were included in the section of Italian poetry along with the expected works from Dante, proving that the criterion used for determining what should be included was weighted as much by historical signifigance as lyrical excellence. This nuance adds a marvelous texture to each section and provides the reader with a tangible sense of the spirit of these countries and the ethos of the periods represented.This book is one of the most treasured tomes in my library and serves the rare dual purpose as both a tool for study and a source of enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"I am 11 years old and in 5th grade. The author &quot;Roald Dahl&quot; added lots of details in this story so that I felt like I was in the story. For example the author wrote using the five senses. &quot;The Gregg family felt the wind blowing.&quot; This book is not true, but this book does teach a lesson. It teaches not to shoot at any animals or other creatures, because shooting an animal is the same as shooting a person. Humans are animals too. You will learn lessons from the bad things that you do. I like this story book. What I like about this story book is that a little girl gets to turn people into animals and animals to be just like people. I didn't like it when the sixteen ducks got shot and died. Only four ducks were still alive. Can you belive only four ducks out of twenty ducks lived? I don't think that kids under five years old should read this book because there are animals that are dying. Thinking of animals, sometimes I ask myself why do birds eat worms? I think they would taste bad by the looks of them. I would want to tell you more of this story, but I won't so that you can read it and enjoy it for yourself and family."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"Simple and a quick read...good message (depending on your perspective, I suppose) to love all creatures and have empathy."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"Wow. As a huge fan of Dahl since I was small, this was a shocking disappointment.If are a hard left, politically-correct true believer, you'll absolutely love this book. It's a wonderful display of PC attitudes.

This is Dahl, after all.If you're a more moderate person with a normal children, beware of this book. Unlike the silly cuisine of Dahl's other books, the material in this book likely will come across for what it is -- a putrid bowl of politically-correct screed.Typical to PC attitudes, it's hypocritical. While it supposedly teaches compassion, it glorifies cruelty to those with whom you disagree. Don't tolerate opposing ideas. Punish those with whom you disagree. Make a mockery of other people's values. Hurt them so they'll come around to your point of view.Not funny. Not cute. Not for my kids.At this point PC true believers likely will think this the review of some narrow-minded bigot who just doesn't get it. Believe what you will, buy the book, and revel in what your magic finger would do to me. I'll spend my time reading decent books to my kids.Dahl has plenty of other good, solid books. I'm sorry to tell people to pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"I rate this book 4 stars. My favorit character is Willam. My favorit part in this book is when the witch turned everbody into birds. I recommed this book for the end at 3rd grade."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"The author &quot;Roald Dahl&quot; added lots of details in this story so that I felt like I was in the story. For example the author wrote using the five senses. &quot;The Gregg family felt the wind blowing.&quot; This book is not true, but this book does teach a lesson. It teaches not to shoot at any animals or other creatures, because shooting an animal is the same as shooting a person. Humans are animals too. You will learn lessons from the bad things that you do. I like this story book. What I like about this story book is that a little girl gets to turn people into animals and animals to be just like people. I didn't like it when the sixteen ducks got shot and died. Only four ducks were still alive. Can you belive only four ducks out of twenty ducks lived? I don't think that kids under five years old should read this book because there are animals that are dying. Thinking of animals, sometimes I ask myself why do birds eat worms? I think they would taste bad by the looks of them. I would want to tell you more of this story, but I won't so that you can read it and enjoy it for yourself and family."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"This book is about empathy and fairness. An 8 year-old girl is annoyed when she sees people causing hurt. She zaps her teacher for telling the girl she is stupid when she misspells cat (kat). The teacher starts to turn into a feline-like creature with whiskers and a tail. The girl also &quot;can't stand hunting.&quot; Annoyed by the Greggs who hunt for deer and ducks, suddenly the Greggs find themselves changing places, roles, and body features with a duck family. The Greggs quickly decide they don't like being prey very much. Most young people will relate well to this book during their period when they think carefully through the implications of eating meat. The book contains many black-and-white pen and pencil sketches by Quentin Blake to illustrate the key shifts taking place.I thought that the story and the illustrations just didn't quite pull off the theme. It's clearly bad to hurt people's feelings and to hunt, as this story evolves. But what about having a hamburger? The book needs to broaden its message in order to make it clear what is being condemned. I wasn't sure where the book intended to draw limits on what people can do to animals. The illustrations sometimes look like scribbles done by someone in the back of a car that was hitting potholes. I suspect that the intent was to mimic a child's style. I would have preferred choosing a better child artist as a model, if that is the case. The beneficial changes occur because the girl has a magic finger. Well, I didn't have one when I was 8. What should an 8 year-old really do?When you and your child read this book together, I suggest that you plan to spend some time describing or developing a moral system that makes sense to both of you. This book's strength is that it will raise many valuable questions, that require better answers than are provided here. For example, if someone makes an error, what is the best way to respond in various situations? What are the rights of animals in terms of providing food and medicines for humans and as experimental subjects? What is each person's responsibility in this regard?Always ask yourself, would I like others to do unto me as I do unto them now?"},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"The Gregg family loves to kill ducks and birds.

Equivalent to the \\"Step 2\\" or \\"Level 2\\" books. It's actually got quite a story, but it's written easily enough for beginning readers to enjoy, which is really great and sometimes hard to find.I thought the illustrations were wonderful and whimsical.The story itself might be a little tough for an already extremely empathetic child to read. Since it depicts the feelings of ducks who are being hunted, this might be a sensitive issue for some. Introduce this book to the child of a hunting family, or even just a family of typical meat-eaters and you might find yourself with an angry little vegetarian on your hands! (Especially interesting, when contrasted against Dahl's \\"Danny, The Champion of the World\\" - a hunter's hero!)My children enjoyed this story (and still eat their burgers), but I think for some children, it might raise some ethical problems. Which isn't always a bad thing, of course! But parents beware! This story might lead to a domestic revolt.Of course, any family of vegetarians won't have a problem with this story at all. And, as another reviewer mentioned, this book can certainly offer some good \\"empathy\\" discussions with children."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"The magic finger is the thought provoking story of a little girl who could cast a curse on anyone she was angry with. The one thing that made her maddest of all was shooting animals just for the fun of it. And so when the Gregg family on the next farm went out shooting ducks, she turned their arms to wings and the ducks wings to arms. It was only after a tremendous ordeal, including being shot at by the ducks that the Greggs promised never to shoot another animal as long as they live. They even changed their names to the Egg family to remind them of their promise. The story is told from the perspective of a small eight year old girl, with magic finger, and uses the grammar, and turn of phrase that such a little girl might use, particularly near the beginning. The story therefore alternates between the first and third person, although for the bulk of the text it is indistinguishable from a standard narrative. This book has a strong underlying theme considering it's young audience, first solo reading. I would describe it as the seven year old's version of a political novel such as 1984. The theme, being animal rights, is obviously more accessible and understandable to a younger mind, but it is dealt with in an imaginative and thought provoking way. The argument which the author uses is one of empathy, basically running along the lines of &quot;how would you like it if you were a fox, and someone started shooting at you?!&quot; By reversing the roles of the ducks and humans, he makes the reader see the day to day life of a bird as far more taxing than they might otherwise have done, and forces them to view the ducks as more than just things. This is woven into a common childhood fantasy of having magic powers, to be used against those who are being unjust. Many children, I feel, particularly younger readers, would take the story as just a nonsensical childhood fantasy. The book's deeper meaning would be more readily apparent to a slightly older reader, or one with a special interest in the topic of animal rights."},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"This story is long enough to amuse an adult ,short enough to catch the attention span of 7-9 years old. Brilliantly written,it's about a nameless girl who hates hunting and succeeds in stopping her hunting-loving neighbors from ever shooting animals and birds again with the help of her magic finger which does very funny and strange things to anybody who crosses her. The story is short,so writing more details about it will only give it away spoiling the fun for first-time readers.One thing is for sure: kids and parents will enjoy reading this story together and there is a lesson to be learned by knowing how it feels to be in the other side's shoes.Lamberd BeanoThird Grader"},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"This book was SO funny! It gives people an idea of why hunting is stupid! The Gregg family is always shooting ducks and their neighbor finally gets so fed up with them she uses her magic finger to turn them all into birds! Lets them see what they put their victims through. I reccomend this book to anyone with an imagination,and to anyone who is strongly for hunting or strongly against it; those who are against it will enjoy how this book conveys your protest, and those who are for it will hopefully see why it can be so bad!"},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"I love the work of Roald Dahl and most certainly feel he is probably one of the greatest tellers of children's stories of all times. Many to most of his stories have a very quirky bent to them; many to most have an underlying theme of just slightly dark humor. Dahl was an extremely prolific author of both children's books and adult. I suppose he is best know for \\"James and the Giant Peach,\\" \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" and \\"Matilda.\\" To be honest with you, I have never read one of his stories that I did not like.As a side note of interest; at least to me, is Dahl's life (He was actually a Flying Ace during WWII and lead a rather adventuresome life. I have always been surprised that a major biography of the man has not been written - he died in 1990.Anyway, \\"The Magic Finger\\" is the story of a little girl who has neighbors who like to hunt. They like to go hunting and kill animals \\"just for fun.\\" (It is important to note the term \\"just for fun\\" here...more about that later). Their hunting practices make her extremely mad. Now this is a good thing and a bad thing because the little girl just happens to possess a magic finger; a finger that can have rather shocking results when she directs this finger toward those who anger her.The main part of the story is of course that this little girls turns her finger on the entire family of hunters and as it would happen this family find themselves changed into small people with wings living in a bird nest they were forced to construct and at the same time a family of ducks finds they have grown to human size, lost their wings, grew arms and hands and take the hunting families house over. Of course the day after this happens the ducks gather the guns of the household and \\"go hunting.\\" The thrust of the story is that the hunting family gets a taste of what the birds feel, gaining empathy.There is no doubt that this little work could be classified as an anti-hunting book but I feel that the one little line in the beginning of the book where it states that the father and sons \`should kill animals just for the fun of it.\\" There is, I think most would agree, a big difference in legitimate hunting and just going out and blasting any critter that happens to cross your path.There are a couple of things that parents should note about this book. First, it does reinforce the \\"Bambi Syndrome,\\" which may or may not be a good thing depending upon how you look at it. Secondly, if you have a child; a very sensitive child, some parts of this work could be upsetting to a certain extent. Thirdly, I note that several reviewers feel this is simply another of those politically correct books (what ever that means). Folks, this book was written in 1966 before the unfortunate term or concept had even been thought of. This is not a book commissioned by some animal rights group. Forth; the writing here is simply and extremely well done. But that being said, the story is very, very complex and may need some adult explaining as the younger child reads it.This is a work of pure fantasy. By far most children are bright enough to know fantasy from reality and I have found they have no problems with it - children from hunting and non-hunting families included. It is usually the adults that have a problem, one way or the other, with this particular work.This particular work has been illustrated by Tony Ross and needless to say, it does not get much better than that.End of review:Personal comment: Just to let you know where I am coming from I will tell you that I was raised in a hunting culture and started hunting (on my own) at the age of seven. I have hunted and fished in states from coast to coast - north and south. About 35 years ago I lost complete interest in hunting. I simply admitted to myself that I had no desire to kill stuff. Now this was a personal choice. I still hunt occasionally - pheasant, but only because I enjoy seeing the dogs work and I leave the actually shooting to others. I am not anti-hunting per se. I understand that here are many who do like it and I understand the need for it. Here in southern Missouri the deer (as an example) most certainly need to be harvested as we are absolutely overrun. (There are usually at least six in my yard each morning - we live in the woods).Now that being said, I do have a problem, and it is one of the reasons I did quite hunting, with \\"slob hunters.\\" These are people who seem to be breeding with no control. I know of quite a number who set around bragging that they harvested up to 10 or 15 deer each year - mostly for the rack - in season and out. Same holds true for turkey and other wild life. Along with the slob hunters we have many taking up arms once per year and hitting the bush for a couple of days that do not even know which end of their rifle the bullet comes out of it, much less how to load their own gun. I have a problem with this - truthfully.Anyway, this is a nice little book, well written and a delight to read.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Magic Finger","review":"How would you like it, if you woke up and had wings?

Hopefully she wont have to resort to wagging her magic finger again.This was a really cute, charming story. Though I was disappointed to find that our main character didn't have a name, the story pulls us right along in first person perspective. Immediately readers are intrigued because Dahl explains early on that she acted out of anger and what happened was pretty frightning.The book is fun and amusing, but carries a valuable message. While I believe there are good reasons to hunt besides to eat, I appreciate Dahl's message. Why do some people hunt just for the sport of hunting? My family has always placed animals and natural life high in value. This book certainly echoes that.The illustrations are fantastic too. Quentin Blake's sketchy style of illustration creates a youthful energy that accentuates any story. While his illustrations are always simplistic and flat, they are fun and playful. He captures the imagination of every child by creating illustrations that children might create to go along with the story. Of course, black and white drawings evoke a certain simplicity and genuine vision that make his work unique.If you know anybody who is frustrated by hunting and poaching, this book is great for them and their children. I actually think this book is great for anyone, hunters and nonhunters alike. It is youthful, fun and imaginative. Dahl puts his characters through experiences that children dream about. A quick easy read, this book should be added to any young child's collection and will round out the collection of anybody who enjoys Roald Dahl's imaginative narrative style.
