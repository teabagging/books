I just love the world that J.K. Rowling has created for this series. I love the characters and the things that she puts them through. The way that she has set up the series with each book being a different school year. I love that you can grow up with the characters. In this book, Harry Potter is in his second year at Hogwarts and he finds that he has the ability to talk to snakes (due to a connection with Voldemort). In this book Harry Potter and his friends must figure out who or what is petrifying all of the students one by one. In the end he must save Ron's little sister Ginny from the Basilisk, and Tom Riddle. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who read the first Harry Potter book and who likes witches, wizards and magic in their stories."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"One of my favorites it it never gets old no matter how many times.I read it!! word word word word"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the sequal to Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. J.K. Rowling is a very talented writer. Some say this book is not as good as the first. I strongly disagree. This book is incredibly interesting and fun to read. I could hardly put it down. It is very diffrent from the first book but is still great. The author describes things vividly and write creatively. There is no way you could guess who has opened the Chamber of secrets and is petrifying people so they look dead. It starts with Harry Having an awful summer with the Dursley's and fools them into thinking he is aloud to do magic in the &quot;muggle&quot; world, but when they find out he isn't its trouble for Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I bought Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on June 3,1999 and finished it the next day. I went to school with it and read it while having classes and the teacher always tells me to close the book which I couldn't do because it was very addictive! What urged me to buy the sequel is because a classmate of mine brought the first book of Harry Potter to school and told the teacher to read it to us everyday and I started to like it. There was a Harry Potter mania in our class! I can't wait to buy the third book of Harry Potter if their is. I hope there are many more Harry Potter books to come!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is even better than Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone! Whoever put ages 9 to 12 on the book is wrong! This book is for all ages! Our sixth grade class read The Sorcerer's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets this year and we LOVED it! We were always begging our teacher to read it to us and when she did, we were all absolutely silent! We love to fantasize about playing Quidditch or being a wizard! Most of us now own both books and are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the third. WE LOVE HARRY POTTER!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; for the first time (it is the first book that I have read more than one time), I thought there could be no book better than it.

IT IS A GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; really tops my favorite list....! I couldn't put it down! I am sure that for most people 3 days to read a book is lots.. but I was surprised by myself! It is such a cliffhanger.. and so GOOD too! It is definitely fantasty.. so it is a must read for all you fantasy fanatics out there. I liked this one more than the &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; because it had more mysteries in it.. anyway I think. There were marvelous connections with the first book.. which you'd know what I mean if you have read both of them. Well, I would definitely suggest that you all read it... 9 times even.. hehe. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"@nd book is a thriller, Much better than the first"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought that it was a teriffic book.

I think that anyone would like it as long as they read the first one first."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I was positive that no book could begin to compare with it. I was wrong. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets proved it. It was just as exciting, suspenseful, and well-written as the first. The villian suprised you, and the character Lockhart was funny I loved the book totally. Hermione could have been in it a little more, though? I can't wait to read more about Harry, Dumbledore (who I like more every book), Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Ginny, Mr. and Mrs. Weasly, Hogwarts, even Malfoy, Snape, Lockhart, and Voldemort. This book leaves you hungry for more Harry, and it deserves a googolplex of stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really like Harry Potter he is a entertaining character that gets into trouble, that saves kids lives at that school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts.

I thought that it was the best book. Boy, was I wrong. My teacher read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets to us and I was sitting at the edge of my seat. It had everything a story should have. Twists, turns, magic, and mystery. I can speak for my whole class in saying that J.K.

NOT.Here are the three things that annoy me about his reading: 1) Was this guy reading from a text with ITALICS? He totally doesn't stress the right words in many a sentence and so much meaning and cleverness is lost. 2) As other reviewers have said, he has one voice -- slow, low and raspy -- for 1/2 the characters, even those whose voices are described as \\"oily,\\" etc. It's annoying. Big time. 3) This guy switches in and out of accents (does McGonagall have an accent or not?)I just finished listening to Chapter 9 and I'm ready to strangle the narrator. Read it aloud or get another reading before you get this. My kids are too young to realize how bad this guy is botching it so they are OK with it.I wonder if he did any other readings or if J.K. Rowling has ever heard this. I can only imagine that she'd be appalled."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This says library binding, but it is not.

You need to learn that just because a book is meant for a younger audience doesn't mean that no one else will enjoy it. I happen to be 14 and I love this book. I enjoy the fantasy, that Rowling so carefully weaves into our imagination. I like the idea of a school like Hogwarts, especially compared to the school that I attend now. I do like the Redwall books and Tolkiien's books are right up there but that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy the Harry Potter books. I honestly think that the Harry Potter books are good for any age, and no one should be ashamed of reading these great books. I think this book deserves a 5 star but I put a one star to get your attention, since no one including me reads the 5 stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"All right, the first Harry Potter book was Ok; the whole deal with Diagon Alley; the unpredictable ending, etc. But this one...lacked even the qualities that made the first one barely readable.TCoS is even skimpier than TSS, and again, there is little storyline. The ending was obvious, pointless, and did nothing to advance the tale of Harry (which I've now lost complete interest in). By now you've probably read the excerpts of the story tons of times, so you know what this is about. Nothing. Harry is a character I can't care for no more than his... little goody friends.The only reason I gave this book two stars is because of the new teacher that replaced Quirrel, he was about all the comic relief in this book (and there wasn't very much).Please, save yourselves from these two hundred pages of complete and utter drivel and get something readable. Kids may not be able to tell the difference between good literature and bad, so get this for them if you're stuck for a gift."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I THOUGHT THAT HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS WAS A FAIR BOOK I MEAN IT WAS GREAT BUT IT WASN'T THE BEST .

THE BEGINNING WAS OKAY AND I WOULD GIVE IT ABOUT A 1 BUT THE END WAS REALLY INTERESTING AND LIKE THE OTHER BOOK IT ALL TIED TOGETHER REAL WELL SO EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK REALLY MATTERED SO SHE REALLY DIDN'T GIVEANY USELESS INFO.

I gave it 2 stars just to be nice!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Having written a Master's Thesis on the fantasy works of Ursula K. Le Guin, I am amply qualified to judge works of fantasy in general. Though these books do contain magic, that alone is not enough to qualify them as fantasy literature. In fact, each one of these first three books is really not much more than a mystery book with Harry Potter as the aspiring sleuth. And while these books do utilize some elements of Joseph Campbell's hero's tale, they fall far short of true mythic proportions. Good fantasy literature, or good literature of any kind, for that matter, has a theme which runs throughout the book. JK Rowling, in each and every one of these first three books, drops a theme into the book, only at its completion--For instance, in book one we learn at the end that Harry has learned about love, and in book two we find out that Harry is a lot like Tom Riddle, but only at the very end, and then the head master points out that he is like him, except for the choices Harry makes. This latter example would have made an excellent theme, but Rowling is not concerned with theme, but only with fun. To her credit, these books are fun, but a theme is what gives a book real cohesion, and, ultimately, real staying power. If you want your children to read excellent fantasy literature, stay with Tolkein's The Hobbit, LEngle's A Wrinkle in Time, C.S. Lewis' The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, Lowry's The Giver, and my favorite, Ursula K. Le Guin's A Wizard of Earthsea. You might note, that unlike these fine novels, Harry Potter has yet to win any serious awards such as the Newberry, etc. Nor is he likely to. Rowling's books are page turners, however, as are any decent mystery novels, and do help keep children reading who might otherwise close the book up. And that's the only good thing I have to say for them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading Angela's Ashes which was a wonderfully moving book, I thought 'Tis was a dissapointing sequel. The passion of the first book was lost to the bitterness of the second. It was understandable that after all the hardships endured to return to America only to have discover a new set of prejudices and problems. The book was not a disappointment, but after looking so foward to it's release it did not fill my high expectations."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsBy: J.k. RowlingJ.K. Rowling wrote a great book about a kid with a mysterious past. With a mysterious scar Harry gets into new troubles in every chapter. He again has trouble with his muggle family and barely makes it to school. When he finally gets to school he seems to develop dangerous situations. Kids from the school start getting hurt, and rumors are going around that certain students are doing it. With a few new characters, and most of the old ones, this is a great book to follow the first one. If you liked the first year of Hogwarts, this year is even better than before.Although I think most of the Harry Potter books are great they have a lot of fictional characters and ideas with magical thoughts. This is what I think makes it good. I would recommend this book to a 10 year old but the book is good for anyone with a wonder of the world of magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've read both books and out of both of them, I think this one is the best.

I read it while on vaction at a lake cabin...and barely put it down long enough to take a short swim. I ended up reading most of the book out loud to my best friend, who was having a hard time dealing with my numerous cries, yelps, fits of laughter and loud &quot;conversations&quot; with the characters. We were both very taken with the book, characters and adventures. When we finished the last few chapters, we were left sitting on the dock and looking pathetically lost. We wanted more!

On the tombstone Deathday cake, the date of Nick's death is October 31, 1492. That would make this book take place in 1992. If that's true, I don't understand why the castle is described as so primitive. The teachers still use parchment. Other than that, the book is terrific.

And I agree, the second improves upon the first. Fortunately Rowling paints such vivid a picture in your mind that it shouldn't be easy to screwed it up in the translation to film (Warner Brothers I hear) if whoever directs/produces it is competent (or at least has my vision).

One of the best books I evar read"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Just a quick note about the audio version: I listen to books-on-tape regularly on long drives, and I've come to appreciate the reader's skill. He/she must provide narration, mood, and a variety of vocal characterizations to differentiate the various characters. Jim Dale, who has read all three books in this series, is by far the best of the best. These books contain a dizzying array of characters: adults and children; male and female; human and otherwise. Mr. Dale provides an equally dizzying array of accents, timbres, and characterizations to flesh them out beautifully. He's set such an impossible standard for Audio Book acting that I've since been disappointed with some other fine actors' renditions of other works.These editions are unabridged, so the listener misses not a word of Ms. Rowlings wonderful prose, which makes the listener feel a little less guilty for not reading them in the usual manner. Actually, they are the first books I've actually read AFTER I listened to them!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is about three kids who get in a lot of trouble. This book takes place at Hogwarts magic school. The kids names are Harry, Ron and Hermione. The theme of this book is that there are hard choices between life and death.

I rate this book 5 stars because there are many cliffhangers in this book but most of all there are so many details that you can feel like your there with them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read this book so many times I cannot remember how many times I've read it. It is so good I did a book report on it. J.K. Rowling adds the perfect mix of suspense, drama, and comedy so that the story is a little bit of all. It's hard to believe she wrote these books in a crowded cafe. And the fact that she wrote most of them on napkins. ...and the Chamber of Secrets is I feel the best of them all. It is the real mystery of the three. I feel this is the story where Harry deals with most of his problems. In the original, Harry has to overcome an 11 year old boy, Draco, as you know. In this story, Harry has to overcome the Heir of Slytherin's monster. And that is why I feel that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the best of all three."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hello most of us have read at least one of the articles in the newspaper that says things about harry potter like sheer evil.I disagree.

It was very suspenseful and made me want to keep reading it. It was a great book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great book. Harry goes back to Hogwarts for his second year, even after being told by a house elf that trouble would strike at Hogwarts. Trouble does strike, and Harry, again, battles for his life. I thought that this was an excelant book. I am 11 years old, and I recomend it to other kids my age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I started reading Harry Potter last year and finished the first 2 books in 2 weeks! They were that good! I just couldn't put them down. Everywhere I went I had my Harry Potter book and was redaing it. Me and my cousin are both reading them together and wew both love them!I'v now read all 3 and am highly anticipating and waiting for the next Harry Potter. They are funny, adventerous and mysterious all in one! It's about a boy who goes to a magical wichtcraft nad wizardry school where he learns to be a master Wizard. It is so neat! He goes on all these really fun adventures in every book! These and Left Behind are my 2 favorite series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This novel was much darker and more mysterious than its sequls without losing its characterization and appeal. The mystery kept you anxious to turn the page, and the villain was obvious and unexpected at the same time. This is by far my favorite &quot;Harry&quot; novel up to date. PS Who came up with the 9-12 age limit. I'm in high school, and all my friends have read or are reading this book, as well as the parents and teachers. The story and conflicts are timeless and ageless. Keep writing, J. K."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling has done it again! I thought that the first book was extremely wonderful, but this one was at least as good, and possibly better. Harry has an extremely exciting school year, and there's even a time when he wonders if he, Harry, is really the heir of Slytheryn as almost everyone thinks. This is an excellent book even for those who do not like to read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This bok is just as good as the first one. It also is filled with suspensful twists, and humorous stories. Right before Harry goes back to Hogwarts, a house-elf named Dobby warns him that terrible things will happen if he returns to school. Excited to get away from the Dursleys for another school year, Harry ignores Dobby and goes back anyway. But soon after he returns people start turning into stone. Harry's worst fear is that he without knowing it, is making this happen. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes good fantasies, but be sure to read the first one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a great book. I have read each one...maybe 500 times each. From Harry to Hagrid to Ron to Dumbeldore, these are the greatest books ever. Anyone who gives it less than 5 stars, shame on you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This series of books has to be some of the most inventive and entertaining reading for &quot;children&quot; since Roald Dahl. This series is just incredible. Anything that gets kids interested in reading is great in my book. People who are uptight about the subject matter need to relax, and remember -- it doesn't matter WHAT your kids are reading, if you've given them a sound basis for morals, and beliefs. It's called, &quot;Fantasy&quot; folks, not &quot;Reality.&quot; The important thing is that they're reading. I heartily recommend this series, and can't wait for my grandson to get old enough to appreciate this series. Lucky him, he'll get to read the entire series in one go, and not have to wait like me for each book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The best book ever. I am a 11 year old boy that hated to read, reading was a torture for him, but now the boy found the special book and loves to read. YES IT IS THAT GOOD"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"How could a reader not fall in love with Harry Potter? He is a part of all of us. The universal feelings of wanting to be accepted, to be liked and to be able to achieve great things are things that we can all relate to. I am an adult and I have read all three of the books that are out thus far and my imagination is soaring!J.K. Rowling keeps getting better and better as she writes. I only wish that Hogwarts would accept me for next years class!This series is destined to sit on the shelf along with other well read classics as The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, The Phantom Tollbooth and The Wizard of Oz. A wonderful way to teach kids that it is okay to dream."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is wonderful and exciting! Any age of child can read this book. I recommend this for anyone. The characters are well-developed and the story has a good plot. I did not read the first one and am excited about reading it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the best book in the world because Harry did a number of things that were brave, adventurous, and kind. He was a warrior, a friend, and an adventurer."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I couldn't believe how good JK Rowling's first book was and was almost afraid to read this one lest I be disappointed. However, it was every bit as good as the first, perhaps even a bit better.My ten-year old son asked me to read both which I now have and am on the third.... I think her books are the most clever I've come across.... unbelievably imaginative with wonderful imagery and a few &quot;life lessons&quot; as well.... I hope she doesn't stop at seven books... Harry's young yet so there must be a lot of adventure for him in years to come!To the author: thank you for a most wonderful gift to children and their parents."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I wasn't able to put this book down once i started reading it! I even read it a second time within the same week. Although it says 9-12, I am a 13 year old in eighth grade. I could easily imagine people older than me enjoying it to. And to people who say that kids shouldn't fill their minds with such things as wizardry and witchcraft, I bet kids who DONT have no imagination. Don't be a fuddyduddy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book! the magic,suspence,were fantastic.when i read this book, i felt i was in Hogwarts with them.when i was done, i began to miss them, and ran out for the next book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In this Book Harry wins the quiddich cup for Grifendor and He finds out who his godfather is and more!(If I tell more I'll give it away)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"From the start of the term things have not been going well forHarry.First, he is almost expelled due to an incident involving anunusually violent tree,then a bodiless voice heard only by Harry begans to haunt the castle.When a mysterious message appears upon the wall people began to wonder if Harry might be the legendary heir of Slytherin.Soon, however he discovers the reason Hagrid was expelled fifty years before, around the last time the chmber had been opened.

Rowling really knows how to keep EVERYONE reading! I've read all 3 books and I have to say J.K. Rowling don't end at 7 books because I want to know what happens to Harry after Hogwarts. To all those people who think these books are bad because they are about witchcraft THEY'RE NOT! It's all fiction! GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The 1st Harry Potter book was good but the second is like the best.I haven't read the 3rd but I hope it's good.I love the magical characters in all the Harry Potter books I have read.The way they have to learn magic,not break rules,and have a good time is just amazing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I liked this book a lot. I would deffinatly reccomend you read it, if you haven't already. It is about a boy who goes to a school for magicians, called Hogwarts. Well, problems arise at his school and Harry takes it upon his shoulders to help solve the problem. Along his way, he encounters his deepest enemy, Voldemort. Will young Harry Potter make it out alive again, after his third unpleasent visit with Voldemort? You have to read this excellent book to find out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is a great book it's much better than the first with stunning, vivid, sparkly words it's like (when Harry found Tom Riddle's diary From Harry Potter and the chamber of Secrets). It just sucks you in you can imagine the scenes happening right befor you. J.K. Rowling (in my opinion is a fantastic writer) From the very smart beginning to the Fantastic, Breathtaking, Heartstopping ending!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When ever I ask my librarian at school how the sequel to a book is, she says, &quot;The original is much better.&quot; That's not true with the Harry Potter books. I found H.P. and the Chamber of Secrets more interesting and better written than the first. Harry's third battle with Voldermort is more exciting thn that of his first two. The addition of Dobby, the House Elf for comic relief was great. After finishing this one, I went straight to the library and got a reserve on the Prisioner of Azkaban."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is such an amazing book! I first started reading this book at 10:00 one night. I ended up staying awake until 1:30 in the morning reading this book. My mom got up to go to the bathroom at 2:00 and I was in a chair sleeping with my book over my face.I reccommand this book to everybody."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling You have done it once again! I was very impressed with the first book but the second book made me really look forward ti the third. Thaqnk you J.K. Rowling and keep them coming!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I hate to give this book three stars, but I simply don't feel that this book was quite as good as the original, to which I gave four; and there not being a three-and-a-half star option, I've got to go with three stars.Not to give the impression that this book is bad; not by any means. For the most part, I feel the book was a wonderful follow-up. However, I felt the end was cheating a bit, particularly in regards to the sword and the Sorting Hat (and if you've already read the book, you'll know to what I'm referring). It seemed to come out of nowhere. I felt that it could have been set up much better.Still, if you liked the first book, I see no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this one as well. Even though I thought it was a bit of a step backwards from the first book, it's only a temporary step back, as the next book in the series, &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, would be the best one yet, and well worth working towards."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This, the second book in the Harry Potter series, could only bethe work of a genius. J. K. Rowling took all the adventure of thefirst book and multiplied it by two: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the result. All who have read this book I agree that this is an even more exciting book than the already very exciting Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Comprehend?The adventure seems to be interminable. Just when you think it's the end, something up comes up. And the adventure resumes without hesitation. Harry Potter dares to do anything that his hearts tells him to do - an icon for bravery.Those who miss out on this book will truly be missing out on a lot of fun. Don't skip any of the books in the Harry Potter series, because each single one of them contains adventure and action that you will regret you never read. You'll spend the rest of your days in solitude and in sorrow weeping that you never got to read the second book in the Harry Potter series. Heh-heh, that's how much fun this book is!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What makes this a &quot;child's book&quot; is that I, a stupid Muggle (read &quot;adult&quot;), can anticipate some of the story's events and twists. Nevertheless, this sequel is not so lightly &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;innocent&quot; as the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry Potter is taking on unsuspected depths and powers. Ron is everyperson's magician; Hermione the know-it-all pain.What keeps me reading is the wonder-full story; the fast pace; the endlessly amusing wordplay; the ingenious bits of domestic magic so casually tossed off; the palpable characters; Rowling's amazing depth of forethought (story #1 was NOT so straightforward as she led us to believe!); shocking new revelations about Potter's parents, and others, we thought were already settled; the bottomless layers of secrets; and the whole artistic package (have you noticed how wonderfully integrated is the design of these books?). Definitely buy the hardbacks: these are keepers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book at my mothers request and I was blown away by it's creativity and story line. I got so wrapped up in it, that it only took me one day to read it. Rowling has a fascinating imagination and a nack for drawing in and holding the attention of her young audience. This is a great buy for you or your children, it has a great excitment that will apeal to all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book was excellant!I liked the book very much.My favorite part was when Harry battled Voldemort."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book was excellant!I liked the book very much.My favorite part was when Harry battled Voldemort."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I first heard of Harry Potter books I thought I wouldn't like them. After I read the first one, I had to read the second one.I was hooked! I'm interesed in witches(wizards),aliens, you know, that kind of stuff. If you are too, you should definitly read this book! But, use with caution, they can be addictive."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Of the first 3 Harry Potter books, the Chamber of Secrets is definitely the best. It skips the setting up of the first book and goes directly into the mystery and excitement. It is a very well written story, wonderful use of descriptive language that would be a challenge to the vocabulary impaired. A must read or read aloud for ages 8 and up."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved the cover of the book and found the book quite interesting but, did find it a little scary for yonger children that may have read this book.I think J.K.

I find nothing wrong with these books. They are fantacy and are written as such. They are exciting, entertaining and hard to put down. There are some books out that a parent should be concerned about their children reading but Harry Potter books are not among them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is truly astounding to read. The Harry Potter books have lots of fun word play,interesting characters-animal and human,and a certian magic that makes you want to read more! Ms. Rowling is a wonderful author,she has amazing writing talent.Her books are showing kids the joy of reading again,and an many adults are reading these books also.This book was much better than the first,and I can't wait to start reading the third."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"...I beleive that, perhaps, he is meant to do stupid things sometimes so that you feel superior (not unlike Dr. Watson from Doyle's famed stories). The books are excellently written, however. Some of the most delightful characters are Hagrid, Hermione, the Weasley twins, Prof. McGonagall, Prof. Dumbledore, Prof. Flitwick, and above all Prof. Snape. They are obviously all exaggerated versions of people that Rowling once knew. No one could make up someone like Snape."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"No hay muchos interesantes libros en el mundo moderno. Pero,esta libro es MUY bien porque es no dificil a leer y es muyexcellente. Esta es un libro por chicos y chicas."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's that time again! He's back and so is trouble. Someone has opened up the chamber of secrets and something is turning Mudbloods (people with one unmagical parent and one magical parent) to stone!

But if you like a fantasy or magic this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have already finished the first book and I am half way through the second and I am barely ever put it down! Some people in my school won't read them because they think they are stupid and have no point or plot! But I am sure that if they read the first chapter of any book (because I have) they would read this awesome series! If you are just looking at the Harry Potter Series and thinking about reading them, I encourage you to read! Like I said before these are the best books I have ever read!

I am eagerly anticipating the fourth book in this fantastic series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"ok, so some say that harry potter is too young to be a hero in his own right and that there is not much magic, but can you imagine, it is that same simplicity that enraptures the hearts of many people and it brings out the child in each individual. this book had me tearing through it in an hour and i still cannot get enough. as each book goes by, you really discover more about harry's mysterious past and about hogwarts. it seems in each book, there is a new hiding place in hogwarts. how big is the school anyway? what ever the reason, j.k. rawlings deserves all the acclaim and awards that she has gained! here's to j.k rawlings and her wonderful world of harry potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second Harry Potter book while scarier and not quite for my six-year-old yet, amazed me yet again with the depth of character J.K.

I read all three books and I can't wait to get the fourth. My brother hates this book, which I don't think he should. He always tries to karate chop the book. I am seven and he is four. The book is just great. Maybe when my brother grows up he will love it too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is fabulous! Even at age 43 this book seems to really grab me! As Harry gets older, the book seems to get more interesting and exciting.

It's great!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I looked at them and thought that one person had written them all. I've never seen so many people who all like the same book. My mom then got the book out of the library (after a VERY long wait) for my little brother, but I grabbed it first. I couldn't wait for the next one! Rowling did not dissapoint. The book is well written and fun to read. Most young adult books are dead depressing, and reading the Harry Potter books is a relief. I've read a lot of Adult fantasy, and I find myself almost liking Harry Potter more. Rowling combines the right amount of fun with just enough seriousness. A great book for all ages. Like C. S. Lewis's Narnian books, you can come back at any age and get something more out of them.Other good books for kids are the Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis and anything by Roald Dahl."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"YOU HAVE GOT TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It succeeds at continuing the mystery-solving, tongue-in-cheek good humor of the first story, which makes it fun to read, and yet it also begins to introduce many of the central themes and elements of the series as a whole. Several very memorable characters are introduced to the series here (Mr./Mrs. Weasley, Dobby the house elf, Lucius Malfoy, Fawkes, etc.) It is also where we begin to learn about Voldemort's past.I could spend a great deal of time complimenting this book for its wit, humor, and overall enjoyability, but suffice it to say that it is a fun read--and a quick read, which cannot be said for the latter portion of the Harry Potter series. The only major \\"gripe\\" that I have (and I may be the only one) is that in this book, the believability of the adults/teachers in the story--already dubious in book 1--takes a turn for the worse. I personally find it hard to believe that so little action would be taken in the face of potentially fatal attacks. This is consistently the case throughout the series, however, and is probably necessary on some level: Harry would never get to solve anything if the teachers managed to collectively have more brains than a teenager.Not much more to say really, I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved every word. I think the books are so much better than the movies. Don't get me wrong, I love the movies, but there is so much detail in the book that I only wish was in the movie. Great read!!! 5 STARS!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Each of these books in the Harry Potter series is a 'cover to cover read', as soon as I can buy them. Each is a gift to world literature."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Shipping was quick and the reader on the CD was interesting. Good voice for reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Listen to Jim Dale's narration of Dobby the House Elf especially- you can just see Dobby- he is so convincing. All of Ms. Rowling's characters come to life with him as the narrator. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My daughter has read the whole series and wants all of them for her collection. She loves it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I couldn't wait to start this book after reading the first one. I've seen the movie too. I enjoyed reading the books so much, felt like I was there as the story was happening. Great writer J.K Rowling's. A must read for young and old. I'm a grandma of 3 and I love these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was a fun-filled book with lots of action. I think this book really brings out what the wizard world would be like. My favorite part of the book was when Harry was in the Chamber of Secrets. There he escapes from the powers of Lord Voldemort for the third time. I would recommend this book to people who like exciting and action-packed books"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My 8 year old daughter and I have been reading it aloud. We each keep sneaking the book to read ahead which causes lots of teasing. We also fight over who gets to read and who gets to listen. My daughter loves to read out loud but says she can;t &quot;make the movie in her head&quot; when she has to read it out loud. Looking forward to many more adventures with Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was a great book, even better than the first. I'm not saying &quot;the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; was bad, that was awesome, but this one is more adventure based. Also, there are more surprises. You also get to find out who Voldemort is! Well, it is hard to see Harry Potter suffering his first summer home from Hogwarts, and the Dursleys are meaner than usual. It looks like he will never get to Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book is great. I read it in less than two days. I just couldn't put it down!!

Teens and adults would even enjoy it. The way the plot twists, turns and dives like Harry on his broomstick makes this book so interesting compared to most books written for this reading level. I would encourage people to read this book for a look into a world of fantasy, delight, horror, and witchcraft. It is definitely a must have!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is amazing! I read the first one and was afraid to read the second because it couldn't possibly be as good but guess what? It was better! It had definitely as much action and mystery as the first and humor was at every step. It concerns the old Potter from the first one, with more experience in his wonderful talent, magic. He finds new thrills and dangers in Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft, this time as a second year. Definitely the best book ever written! The third can't possibly be as good! Or can it..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone I was looking forward to reading the next adventure.

I recomend this book to every one!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As a teenager, I don't read too much, but I just could not put this book down, you could not make me!

I love the adventures with Harry Potter and I hope you do too!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and the second book( Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets).

I can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My favorite kinds of books are adventure.This is exactly the book I needed. It started out that my best friend was going to England. She said that she would get the book. When she entered the class room her eyes were glued to a book. Once we found out what the book was,There was a line to read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I come from Australia and Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone is called Harry Potter and the Philosiphers stone here. I have read both Harry Potter books and they are awesome. I am going to England these hloidays (1/7/99) to London and the first thing I'll do is buy Harry Potter and the Prisoner from Azkaban. P.S.

I loved the 1st book, and this second is better. Count on it being surpassed by each of the following books as well. WONDERFUL!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The first one was the slimmest in the series, and was an excellent introduction to the Harry Potter universe. However, it is fortunate that the second book is thicker - more good stuff to read. As always, Mary Grand Pre does an excellent job illustrating - it would have been nice if we had full-page illustrations instead of the cute little ones we see on the chapter beginnings.Harry Potter learns more about history overall - Voldemort's history, his own family history, and the history of the school. His relationship with Voldemort is hinted at, but since you know there's five more books to go, it won't be revealed here. Still, enough information is given to make for a good story, so kudos for the second installment of Harry Potter's story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book (like all J.K. Rowling books) generate loads of suspense, but this one is really good. The length seems good, and I love the story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"These books just get better and better. What's not to love about a fantasy world full of magic and wizardry?? Great read for kids of all ages"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My husband and I are listening the the books together. We both enjoy them. The author created such a magical world and it's fun getting lost in it. Jim Dale does a great job of bringing each character to life and giving them their own voice. We Highly Recommend the whole series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Like all of Potter, not Shakespeare ... but it doesn't have to be to be fun."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What can I say, I mean it is my 2nd favorite (my 1st favorite is the 4th book).It's great, mindblowing, love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was just as marvolous as the other Harry Potter books! I've read all 3. This one had some sad parts and a little mystery."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The first Harry Potter book was an imaginative romp through a Roald Dahl-like world of magic and oddities against idiots and jerks. It was wildly successful, mainly for its imagination and enthusiasm, which overshadowed the hollow motivations and 'pushing around' of the characters. Rowlings doesn't get away with it this time, though; this book was obviously rushed to cash in on the interest generated by the first book. The character personalities and plot ends are left to suffer for much of the book, though narrative energy takes up the slack once in a while. The plot is a loose recycling of the first book's, which I find shameless. I don't think that Rowling respects her audience as much anymore, seeing as she feels that she can ignore new ideas and inspirations and replace them with overcomplicated plot twists, which she drops most of toward the end. There are five books after this one (four to be written), and I sincerely hope that Rowlings finds her stride in character as much as she did in imagination--and even that falters, as plot retreads and cliches take up most of the book's pages. Anyway, kids younger than ten probably won't mind, but I'm 16. Parents may be dissatisfied with the book, but hey, it stalls their children from A Clockwork Orange for another few years."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The 2 stars were just to get your attention because I never read the 5 stars. I'm 13 and I LOVE this book! Now I'm reading the book to my sister (10), brother (8), and my mom. They love it too! All those people who are talking about 'evil witchcraft' are crazy! This book is great for all ages! A MUST read! :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Poter is the best book I've ever read because it has abig climax.I liked it because it is a fantasy story"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter series is an amazing phenomenon. Aside from being a great read for all ages, it has created a resurgence of reading in the US. Each book stands alone as a complete story, but read in sequence they create a wonderful suspence.At the end of book 1, we see Harry returning to his muggle aunt and uncle. Dumbledore is determined that Harry is safest there. The only thing that makes this summer a little easier is that Dudley is afraid he'll end up with another pig-tail!But as usual things cannot go easy for Harry. Something horrible is brewing at Hogwarts this year and someone is convinced that Harry must be kept away!As the year progresses, Harry discovers hidden talents and his sense of right and wrong are put to the test. Even Hermione cannot solve this one by going to the library.Now that there are six books, we know that there is a very important clue in this book. The first glimpse of how Voldemort has been keeping himself alive for all these years since Harry's parents were killed.Will Harry make the right choice? After all we know that what matters is whether he does \\"what is easiest, or what is right.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book that influenced my life is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Harry and his friends had to persevere to solve the mystery on why students were turning into stone and who opened the Chamber of Secrets. Harry soon went to a forest full of spiders. Ron and Harry met up with the big spider, Aragog. Harry then upsets Aragog. Then Ron and Harry were chased out of the forest by the creepy spiders. Later on, Harry, Ron, and Professor Lockhart found the Chamber of Secrets under an abandoned girls bathroom. Harry enters the chamber and fights the basilisk. Harry tries to defeat the monster with some assistance from the talking hat and the phoenix. Harry gets a sword from the hat and persevered to fight the basilisk with it. Harry Potter defeats the monster and the school is now safe. This opened my mind to persevere in skateboarding."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was a big disapointment for me. When I read the first 3 chapters I almost fell asleep it was so boring despite how many things happend. Jk. Rowling definetly made a big mistake on this book. It was absolutely horrible! I didn't even finish the whole book ...Later I was tempted to finish the book because I wanted to read the third one. I finished it ... um ... I just want to say it was pretty good at the end but the beginning ... could make you fall asleep. :)Overall: Once you get past the first couple of chapters you'll fnd the excitement. Read only if you want to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is cool cause it sounds like a stoner wrote it. i like the part when he goes to the chamber of secrets and all that stuff happens to him. i couldn't put the book down, i couldn't get my nose out of the book,....because it was glued to my face. i recomend this book for all ages expecailly 136 year olds...cause what else are they gonna do"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've read them all. They're all pretty darn good. Believeme. They are. Buy 'em all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Of the three Harry Potter books so far published, this is not the best. However, the quality of the writing and story are still far above the competition. Volume two changes direction a bit and messes with perceptions of time and existence. The theme is done a little better and more intricately in book three, but this book is worth buying. If for no other reason, buy it to get the story on why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts so long ago."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It seems the stories only get better.

It feels like you are in another world, but this world turns out to have Magic. Harry Potter goes to his second year of Hogwarts School with a big scare. In the story Hogwarts figures out that something is in the castle. A monster. This monster isn't just wandering around Hogwarts, it is petrifying the students. Hogwarts students are saying that the Chamber of Secrets is open again, but one tricky portion of this mystery is who would know how to open it and where is this chamber located. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all thinking about these questions. Who could be doing this? Then Harry starts hearing noises in the walls, but no one else can hear them. Then, the creepiest thing happens to Harry. He starts talking to snakes and he understands them, but the weird thing is that only two other people could have done that before. It was Salazar Slytherin and Voldermort. How could that be? They were both members of the Slytherin team and he was a Gryffindor. Did the Sorting Hat make a mistake with Harry's placement in teams? Theses things were all rushing through his head. Then since Harry talked to the snake, the students were saying that he was the mastermind behind these attacks. Harry was furious. I didn't do it, I don't remember at least he uttered. Harry's mind was racing as fast as a cheetah. Well Harry was done with all of this. Again Harry put his life in danger and went to find the Chamber of Secrets and tried to kill the monster. Does Harry find the Chamber? Does he find who was behind this scam? Will Hogwarts close? You will have to read and find out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I must say my first experience with the Harry Potter world did not occur until I saw the first movie in the theatre (relutantly dragged by my mother and nephews). I was hooked from that time on. I left the theatre and went and purchased the books. This second book is truly amazing. I am not sure how JK Rowling was able to create in such depth the Harry Potter world, but it is spectacular. I would recommend this book for ANY age person. I have already read the series twice and am looking forward to reading it again soon."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I bought this used book, labeled \\"very good\\" condition.

You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I absolutely love this series, it is so well written. This is something the whole family enjoys. I read a lot of technical/medical journals and such, so when I read for enjoyment I like to be taken out of this realm. This series definitely does that. I believe this will be an enduring series that our grandchildren and so on will be reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What do you think would happen if somebody in your school gets pulled into a chamber that hasn't been opened in a long time? What if you got pulled in and everybody was sure you were going to die? Would you be terrified?After returning to Hogwarts for the second year, Harry Potter wanted to find out what's happening to Hogwarts. Mysterious words in what appears to be blood are written on the walls. Nobody knows who is making it happen or how. People are getting worried that something really bad is going to happen. Sadly, they are right. In the staff room Harry Potter and Ron find out more about the chamber of secrets. Harry, Ron, and a professor from Hogwarts enter the chamber of secrets. Harry has to face the worst person he could ever think of. Will he be able to survive?I think that this is a great book because you can always picture what's happening in the story, and you can picture what the characters are doing. J.K. Rowling describes just about everything the characters see or do. You also never want to put the book down because the events keep on surprising you. You never know when something is going to happen, plus the story suspenseful. The series is amazing. Every book in the series connects to this book. The series hooks you in the beginning and you can't resist reading the next book in the series.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second book in the series. It is a great book for ages 9+ and will take in its own little magical world.

I have read 10 books this summer and the first two Harry Potter books were amazing. The Chamber of Secrets completely shocked me at the end and made me hungry for more.

I recommend this book to 7 year olds to 100 year olds."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Everyone, whatever age should read these books. They are wonderfully imaginative and the morals can be applied to any age group from young children to seniors. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This second installment in the Harry Potter series is every bit as charming as the first, but it is much more than a rehashing of the first book. There are imaginative new creatures to meet and a compelling mystery to solve. Elves, goblins, phoenixes and assorted monsters join the fray as Harry and his buddies struggle to unlock a fifty year-old mystery that threatens the very existence of Hogwarts. A great read for children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling has done a nice job of taking Tolkeins Ring trilogy and adapting it to her own ends. Sauron becomes Voldemort, dead but not dead. All of the familiar characters return Trolls, elves, etc. The writing is very much on the level of the audience it is designed for - 8-12 year olds. Despite the derivative nature of the text it is great fun.The \\"church right\\" has made much of black magic and a negative influence this text might have on children. Many of my children's friends are not permitted to read the text.I am mystified by this position. It is all pure fantasy.Remember censorship only makes the censored more attractive!This is a wonderful book which becomes a world of play for children and a 2 day read for adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"On the surface this story seems like a mere magic story. But if you look into this story you will find many life lessons.Our life is just like Harry Potter's life. We live in flood of anger, envy, destruction, hate, fear as well as love, courage, patience, creation and wisdom. Just imagine yourself being a Harry Potter who strives to have a better life in a spritual sense.Especially to so many people who claimed to be abused by their belived ones. You can be a Harry Potter too! Healthy and resilient.Enjoy this psychologically healthy story. You will love it.Cindy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When my sister first started reading brought home a book about some guy named Harry Potter and said it was wonderful, I thought she was crazy. Then, I sat down to read the first chapter, and I couldn't put it down. &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, the second volume in the series is just as amazing as the first. Filled with mystery, suspense, adventure, and (of course) magic, this is deffiantely a wonderful story. All Harry Potter fans, anyone who loves fantasy stories, or anyone who just loves a great book will truly enjouy &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; and all the books in this wonderful series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling has done it again! This book picks right up where the first one leaves us. The thing I like most about this series is that the characters are so believeable...well, not in the magical sense, but personality-wise. I can see shades of old classmates (and current co-workers, friends, etc.) in every single character. I cannot say enough about Harry Potter! Young, old, urban, rural...read these books! Also check out The Chronicles of Narnia if you haven't already...it is the prelude to the Harry Potter series, in my book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book, as are all books in the Harry Potter Series, is simply astounding.

I also wanted to say that no matter what people write in other reviews, I think the ending was really surprising."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love all the Harry Potter books, everyone is so exciting and fun to read, they sometimes make me laugh. The characters are all described real enough to be real people except for the fact that they are wizards and witches.

Read it - you'll enjoy it!Cheers!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling is a fantasy story with exiting characters that you'll want to read about over and over again.Magical and mysterious things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Harry Potter can speak parseltongue which means he can talk to snakes,he is almost eaten by giant spiders and much much more.I would recommend this book to people of all ages.This book is the best I've ever read.I predict that in the next two years I will have read this book at least once more because it is such a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I just read the first Harry Potter book last week after holding out for so long.....and I thought I'd &quot;eventually&quot; get to reading the 2nd book....but I found myself devouring it last night. I just needed to know about Harry's next adventure...In The Chamber of Secrets, Harry finds his way back (in a most unconventional way) to Hogwarts for his second year. Soon, students turn up petrified by some unknown force, rumors of a Chamber of Secrets start running through the school, and we find out some of Hagrid's secrets...and...well, you'll have to read it for yourself. And read it you must!For those stressed, over-worked adults out there, Harry Potter will surely bring a bit of your childhood back to you and help you through the day."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The story begins at Harry's 12th birthday - he's home for the summer with the uncaring Dursleys. New characters are introduced, starting with Dobby, an elf-slave who reminds me an awful lot of Yoda and Jar-Jar Binks from the Star Wars movies.The book is every bit as engrossing as the first one, though much darker with more frightening events - spells cast on children; giant spiders and serpents; a violent Quidditch match and a bit of bloodshed. It made me wonder if younger children should be guided through the story. For adults and young adults, it is fine.I like how there is a bit of humor injected but it isn't as frequent as in the first book. The loyalty of Harry and his friends is admirable, however they do seem to disregard rules and distrust adults a lot and take matters into their own hands.Harry is destined for greatness, however, and I'm off to read book 3!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A great deal of angst has been expressed in the Christian press and amongst conservatives over the notion that the Harry Potter bookssanction magic and are, by the very nature of the story, irreligious. Though many commentators have had great fun with this worry, feelingthat it somehow shows how fundamentally silly Christians are, I'm not inclined to dismiss it so quickly. In a society in which Wicca hasbegun to be taken seriously as a belief system, even receiving IRS tax-exempt status, a parent has to be concerned about the possible effectson their child of such a phenomena as Harry Potter. But a responsible parent who reads with their child and discusses the books and theirthemes presumably has no more need to worry about the witchcraft within them than have preceding generations of parents needed to losesleep over the sorcery in The Lord of the Rings. In fact, it's hard to escape the nagging feeling that most of us simply accept that Tolkienwon't warp our kids because we know him to have been a devout Christian himself, and influential in converting C. S. Lewis, whose Narniabooks are too explicitly Christian-themed to worry anyone. Presumably, if J. K. Rowling were known to be religious (I've no idea whethershe is or not), and outspoken about her beliefs, many of these concerns about her writings would likewise disappear. But this is neither arealistic nor a productive standard to hold authors to; instead we should judge them by the moral message of their works. By this standard,the Harry Potter books should give Christians, and religious parents of all stripes, reason to be grateful, not worried.This is the case because Harry is a quintessential example of Man's struggle to choose between good and evil. In fact, we've reached a pointin our culture where the simple acknowledgments that Evil exists, that the propensity to behave in an evil manner is an essential aspect ofMan's character, that Evil is seductive, and that we are susceptible too it--the bifurcated nature of Man which is the very basis ofJudeo-Christianity and, thus, of our civilization--are in themselves conservative notions. The political and spiritual philosophies of the Leftare premised on a very different conception of Man, that he is fundamentally Good and that selfish, antisocial, and antihuman behaviors areproducts of external factors : of faulty social institutions; political oppression; or errant belief systems. The Left believes that if all of theseartificial accretions could be stripped away Man would return to his natural state of goodness. J. K. Rowling obviously disagrees.Famously, or at least it will be famous to anyone who's read the books, when Harry arrived at Hogwarts the Sorting Hat hesitated over whatdorm to place him in. Eventually he was assigned to Gryffindor, but the Hat also noted that he would fit in Slytherin, the dorm associatedwith Salazar Slytherin and the study of the Dark Arts. Merely noting that the capacity for evil, as well as good, resides in Harry is unusualenough, but Rowling also makes it clear that Harry will be defined by the choices he makes between the two. At the end of Chamber ofSecrets, worried about his ability to tap into skills that are usually associated with Slytherin (like communicating with snakes [note theBiblical echo]), Harry confesses his self-doubt to Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts. Harry wonders if he really should be inSlytherin :'[The Sorting Hat] only put me in Gryffindor,' said Harry in a defeated voice, 'Because I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .''Exactly,' said Dumbledore, beaming once more. 'Which makes you very different from [Voldemort]. It is our choices, Harry, that showwhat we truly are, far more than our abilities.' Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned.Well might Harry, or any other modern child, be stunned by this revelation, that it is our moral choices in life that define who we are, thatwe bear the responsibility for who we become in life. Adults hear this seldom enough, children almost never. It is this message that makesthe Harry Potter books so valuable to parents and makes their appeal to children such a welcome development. Concerned parents--thoughthey may obviously prefer that kids not be exposed to such themes in public schools, which antireligion activists have rendered so morallyneutral and hostile to Christianity that they are incompetent to address them--should embrace the books, should read them with their kids,and, without sucking the fun out of them, should take advantage of the lessons that they teach.Meanwhile, the popularity of the books suggests a genuine thirst among kids for the kind of moral clarity that they provide. The Educationestablishment, the Left, and parents who leave such matters to the public schools to fulfill would do well to engage in some soul searchingabout the inadequacy of the moral education that the schools are apparently providing. One approach that conservatives and Christiansmight take is to, quite disingenuously, suggest that just as these Wiccan novels have valuable non-religious lessons to teach, so might someof the great children's novels of the Christian tradition, like Swiss Family Robinson, which is usually horribly bowdlerized to strip it ofreligious themes. Rather than trying to ban a worthwhile series of books, one which has kids reading enthusiastically, they should be used asa lever to get more good books into the curricula, to at least make sure that the same schools are reading Tolkien and Lewis and MadeleineL'Engle. After all, what's good for the Wiccan goose is good for the Christian gander, right?GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This one is just as difficult to put down as the first one. This one is so well written that it can be read alone, but I still recommend reading the first. While the author does give background information, she doesn't bog this book down in what happened before. This book details Harry's second adventurous year at Hogwarts. There is yet another mystery for Harry and his friends to unravel. Mystery and magic rolled into one. Sci-fi and mystery lovers should feel right at home with this book--this series. I gave this book only 4 stars because it's not quite as good as the first one. It's hard to recreate the original feeling of being introduced to the school, wizardry, etc. But the book does really deserve 4 and a half."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Wonderful story, strong hero/heroine characters, readers get to really flex their imagations. Fun adventure, sometimes scary --keeping you turning the pages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I echo the sentiments that I stated in my review of the first book: I could absolutely not put this book down! Ms. Rowling has a great skill and talent in pulling the reader in and keeping one enthralled until the last page. I was sorry it was over when I read the last words in the book. After reading the first and second book, I finally went with my youngest son to see the movie. The book was better, but the movie was a lot of fun. If you saw the movie without reading the book(s), now go back and do it right - read the books! They are a blast!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry's story goes on with another year at Hogwart's, and the magic too continues in this fantastic sequel.You don't need to be under the age of 13 to appreciate these books. They are incredibly fun to read. If you've been tempted but passed over these &quot;children's books,&quot; I urge you to be brave and pick up a copy. Read it in secret if you have to. You won't regret it. There's a good reason this series is so popular!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a sixteen year old reviever from the U.K. Firstly I would like to say that I have no objection to these novels being taken in their intended context, as children's books, I also am generally enthusiastic about anything that promotes children reading. However I can't understand how anyone over the age of twelve continues to be 'enthralled' by these books. It is understandable why the Philosophers/Sorcerrers Stone had some appeal. It was unchallenging, imaginitive storytelling, although hardly more inspirationall or originall than a 'Worst Withch' story, taking on a Goosebumps-esque format. However the second in the series, The Chamber Of Secrets, continues in exactly the same style, repeating the pattern of the first book. It fails to do any further character development, leaving the protaganists one dimensionall and uniform. It also bases all the humour element on stereotypes e.g the clumsy fat boy, Nevil. This really is enriching childrens world view! A further annoyance to me is that boundries between 'good' and 'evil' are laid down from the beginning, again enforcing stereotypes. The reader is autoumatically encouraged to be biased on the side of the 'goodies', justifying Harries actions and incriminating Malfroy's etc. No alternative perspectives are offered and no explanation is given as to why the 'evil' people behave as they do other than them simply being 'baddies'. If the character does not comply to the authers ideal they are bad! There seems to be no underlying point being portrayed in these books, In commparrison to other 'children's books' such as Phillip Pullman's, His Dark Materials Trillogy, this is meaningless and one dimensional. In fact the reason why these books have sold so much is the media hype surrounding them. It saddens me to see that people can't form their own oppinions of books based not on it's marketing and funding but on it's impact on the way they think. If you have agree with the stereotypical way this book is written, I suggest you and your children read 'Lord Of The Flies' and see it's implications!P.S I am sure that I will recieve lots of negative critisism for this review but I'm not egotistical enough to care. Having unhelpful points on my name does not devalue my opinion, it merely justifies my point."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The first half of the book, introducing us to the Dursleys and Hogwarts, was fairly entertaining (at least to someone like me who has never read a Harry Potter book before- though I have seen a couple of the movies). The escalating perils in the second half of the book seemed pretty formulaic to me- Harry meets bug eyed monsters, Harry wins, Harry meets Voldemort, Harry wins. This formula might be entertaining to most children, but I felt less engaged by the book in the last few chapters than I did earlier on."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the best. It's about a mystery where people yet frozen. Harry finds out its a snake. He also finds a diary where Tom Riddle writes in it.

I even fell asleep in the movie, amusingly."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Wowsers! Most people mistakenly think this book has something to do with all that Herald Potter business going on in England and stuff. After some investigative research, I discovered this book was actually written by Hemmingway (Mariel) and has little to do with wizardry. Instead, it's about a young boy in England named Harry, who goes to Wizard School but then gets kidnapped by the Yakuza and forced into the brutal world of high-stakes Asian porn. We see his Darth Vader-like rise to fame via VH1 and, often haphazardly bleed all over the dust jacket. Naw dawg! Do yourself a favor and memorize this book. There'll be a quiz on it later."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read the first four volumes in the series. I think this is the poorest of the four and would actually skip it when I reread the series. I am 62 so not still a child. I enjoyed 1 and 4 the best."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"OK, so I'm the only one who had not heard the hype of Harry Potter before I picked up this book. Yet once I told folks that I was about to read it, their enthusiasm overwhelmed me. Frankly, I just don't get it. Maybe it's because I'm uncomfortable reading made-up words and names that can't be easily pronounced. Or because characters such as Moaning Myrtle in the bathroom could have been dreamed up by the writers of Saturday Night Live. Or that magic is used by the author to provide simple endings to complex situations. If only I could believe that the Quidditch game rules were designed to actually work (try drawing the game field, players, etc. to see what I mean). Sorry, Harry, I think you're going down in history as a fad, not a legend."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A friend bought my children the first three books in the series, so I previewed them. I had a hard time putting them down, I must admit. However, the violence level is horrifying. In Prisoner of Azkaban, the lead evil wizard kills thirteen people while laughing maniacally. Not kids stuff."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I won't repeat my last review, you can find it under &quot;Sorceror's Stone&quot;, which describes why I gave that one 3 stars. It was good, but not mind-boggling so: Read Roald Dahl.This is a comparison to the first book, which I enjoyed and found interesting and entertaining. The second book is Much Darker, and I caution people who give this to young children: not because I think they shouldn't read about Magic, but the overt death threats for Harry spooked _me_: and I'm 23. (Maybe it was because I kept reading this until the early hours of the morning in the dark!) So don't read this book at night if you are easily scared. :)Anyway, *definitely* much more violent than the first, which was mostly schoolyard fighting and MAGIC battle to the death (in other words, fantasy and pretend); as opposed to the attempted murders in this one. There were no less than four instances where graphic killings were attempted, and they were much more real in this book: Spiders (which many people are scared of Anyway!); Magic giant insects trying to kill you, plus some pain and child manipulation thrown in.In short, good, IF you can remember it's not real."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is just as good as the first!

Harry Potter faces all the school things a muggle-born boy might only, of course, Of course, Harry is anything but normal. As an infant, his head is scarred by Voldemort's death curse, which nearly destroyed the Dark Lord. Now the boy is a twelve-year-0ld wizard in his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.In this book, Rowling introduces a division in the wizarding world, between those who believe wizards should come from wizard-only (\\"pureblood\\") families, and people who accept the wizards from muggle-born parents. This concept forms the foundation for much of the plot for the next 6 novels. Lord Voldemort and his followers have done much over the years to impede muggle-borns (who they derisively call \\"mudbloods\\") in every way possible. The followers and descendants of Salazar Slytherin are noted for their hatred of muggle-borns wizards.The crux of the matter is this: where does Harry belong? He was almost placed in Slytherin house. He is a Parselmouth, a wizard who can communicate with snakes, which is an extremely rare ability, noted as a gift possessed of Slytherin. Somewhere beneath halls of Hogwarts is the fabled Chamber of Secrets, guarded and unseen by Slytherin's monster. Harry, who knows little of of his own family, is terrified he is Slytherin's heir, and is suspected of initiating the attacks on muggle-born students throughout the school.Harry struggles with who he is, much as we do. Are we beings who are controlled by nature, or by the choices we make? At the height of Harry's self-doubt Dumbledore insists that \\"only a true Griffindor could have pulled [Griffindor's sword] out of the hat.\\" Despite this, the story doesn't read as a morality tale. It is filled with action and, truth be told, reads more as a school whodunnit. The reader is constantly asking, \\"Who is the Heir of Slytherin?\\" and \\"Who or what is petrifying the students?\\" This in itself isn't a surprise. Plenty of other novels make the reader ask those questions. The difference is this: JK Rowling makes us care about the answers.The book is punctuated with humorous anecdotes of the eccentric Defense against the Dark Arts instructor, a few wild and gripping quidditch matches, and of course the grudge between Harry and his Slytherin-house nemesis, Draco Malfoy.Rowling's writing is, once again, taut. She seldom uses frivolous words and phrases. I particularly appreciate this of her. Nothing is discarded or throwaway in her writing. Forgotten characters from the series's first book resurface a half dozen novels later. A seemingly innocuous mention of a potion or spell at the beginning of a book proves to be extremely important later in the same story. It is appealing to me, both as a writer and a reader, to see how she is not frivolous with words, characters, and most especially, the Magical World she's created.That said, Her characters are pitch perfect. We remember what it's like to be twelve, and despise someone in school. We remember what it's like to have a best friend who's a girl, to whom we have no romantic consideration. We remember loving, and hating, and thinking too severe, any number of teachers. At that age, we notice girls with frizzy hair and large front teeth. We think puking up slugs is the height of comedy. Not only can Rowling write, but she has complete mastery over every situation in her novels.The only downside I can think of is the Scholastic (American) edition of the novels: I despise Mary Grandpr&eacute;'s art, and can hardly stomach these covers. As appealing as the novels are, I have to be honest: it's one time when the cover nearly made me judge the book. The Chamber of Secrets is not just for children. It's exemplary in every way. However, the cover made me think it was written for eight-year-olds. After seeing Grandpr&eacute;'s covers, I expected a novel that read in couplets like \\"Humbledy bumbledy diggledy pum / Draco the Malfoy is silly and dumb.\\" Gods be thanked, I was wrong, and thrilled to admit how wrong I was...Kudos to her for an exemplary second novel. Of course, I've read the other five, and will review each in turn.Five stars of five."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Received the product in excellent shape.

I have enjoyed all of her Harry Potter stories. Keepup the good work."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Inevitably, J.K. Rowling begs comparison with C.S. Lewis. So I will get it out of the way with a discussion of Rowling's second Harry Potter novel, _Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ (1998). Let me say that I find Rowling's view of the world much more compatible with my own in so many ways. Though I am sure that it will horrify a great many people for me to say this, Lewis is frequently reactionary and stuffy. But if you were to ask me to name the greater writer, I must answer without hesitation-- C.S. Lewis. Rowling is a great storyteller (and I am the last critic to deride good storytelling), but Lewis' novels have a literary polish to them. His Narnia books will stand the test of time better than the Harry Potter books.That being said, there is a lot to like about this novel. The action of the story takes place during Harry's second year at Hogwarts Academy. But this time, Harry is warned by Dobby the House Goblin not to return to school. Harry does return-- though not by train. And he quickly becomes involved in adventures and misadventures with the thumping willow, an egotistical new defensive arts instructor, the ghostly Moaning Myrtle (who haunts the girls' bathroom), a trail of spiders, and a mysterious diary written by a former Hogwarts' student. And then (as Dobby predicted) things go seriously afoul. One by one, the students are being paralyzed by... Something.There are a lot of twists and turns before the mystery is resolved. And there are a couple of dandy double-crosses at the end. By God, if only my own high school had been like this!There are passages that strike me as hastily written. And I do wish that Rowling hadn't written so much dialogue IN CAPITAL LETTERS whenever somebody gets angry. It is a bit too much in the way of overkill and gives the impression that characters can do nothing but scream for long stretches of time at one another.I suppose that comparisons with the movie are also inevitable. For the record, I read all of the Harry potter books before watching the corresponding movie. The movie version of _The Chamber of Secrets_ followed the book closely (something which rarely happens) and was well acted, well directed, well photographed, and had great special effects."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm amazed at the number of people who dismiss this entry in the series as the worst one. True, it lacks the freshness of the original, the intricate plotting of the third, and the epic scope of four and five. But it's well written, moves at a brisk pace, and has some really clever elements (flying cars; an extraordinarily stuck-up new professor, who gets the comeuppance he richly deserves; a main character accidentally tranformed into something hilariously unexpected; a miserable ghost). There's lots of humor, balanced by plot structures foreshadowing the darker aspects of the forthcoming books. And, it introduces some plot elements that prove to be critical to the series as a whole.For one, Rowling (through extremely shrewd use of metaphor) shows that even wizards can be elitist, racist snobs, thumbing their noses at those they see as inferior. The Malfoys look down on Hermione (who, incidentally, is the brightest student in school) because her parents are Muggles; to Draco and his father, she's less of a person because she's not a \\"pure-blood.\\" They also despise the Weasleys for their lower-class status and for Arthur Weasley's love of all things Muggle. Sound familiar? I've found that these particular plot elements are a good touchpoint when teaching children about racism and hatred. These elements prove to be critical not only in this book (what we learn about Salazar Slytherin in this book explains a lot about what kinds of people are placed in Slytherin House) but beyond; once we learn more about Voldemort's origin, we can see why his hatred of Muggles is so severe. (Even Book Five echoes back to this story; Sirius' mother holds many of the same views as the Malfoys and Voldemort, and is more than willing to express her opinions). When reading the following books, one will find that many things refer back to \\"Chamber of Secrets:\\" Here is where we first meet Dobby the House-Elf, who reappears in books four and five, and begin to see the difficulties of house-elves' subjugation (another clever metaphor by Rowling). We gain some incite into Hagrid's background, and learn why he was expelled from Hogwarts as a youth. And, Harry grows up quite a bit, as he is forced to face an extraordinary evil alone, with an innocent life at stake, in a gripping and taut battle. He learns more about an unusual talent he wishes he didn't have, a talent that's largley due to Voldemort's attempt to kill him as a baby. Plus, he finally gets an answer to a question that's nagged at hime for some time: Why did the Sorting Hat put him in Gryffindor, and not Slytherin, as it seemed wont to do? It answers some of his doubts, but seems to create others; the Harry of Book Five is asking a lot of questions for which there may not yet be answers. All of these elements add up to an entertaining, well-structured book that's as good as the others."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Including the inconsistencies and logic flaws, up to just before the end of #5 JK Rowling's books are perfect; no doubt whatsoever there. This audio version, however, managed what I'd previously considered impossible: it *improved* on what was in my head. Jim Dale's Lockhart is so far beyond the already odiously fabulously hilarious Lockhart I imagine when reading for myself that I prefer to *listen* rather than read. Impossible! There should be an audio performance category/version of the Oscars -- that man deserves one for each of the 4 books I've heard so far, and some kind of entertainer knighthood for his Lockhart in Book 2. Jim Dale's performances in these audiobooks more than makes up for the abominations of the first 2 movies. Give them a try -- if you regret it, I will send you an official apology."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is the continuation of the saga that began in \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" and is another smash hit. Harry is easy to relate to, bullied and wishing he was somebody-- which he is, but only in the wizarding world.The book is darker than the first, probably because in the first book only Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew about the danger surronding the Stone. In this book, everyone knows about the danger surrounding the Chamber of Secrets, so the whole mood of the book is darker and gloomier.Harry is suspected by the students (no big surprise, he's famous,) and Harry, even though he knows he's innocent, begins to question himself and his place in life. In this way, everyone will relate more to Harry than in the first book. Again, the mystery is well-done, with many small details that didn't seem important at first glance becoming important in the end. Questions from the first book are answered, such as why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, and the mystery of why the curse of death rebounded on Voldermort after he couldn't kill Harry because of his mother's mark of dying love, is raised again, though not answered-- it is probably the main part of the saga.Need I mention the continuing morals? The difference between your choices and what you are capable of acheiving or destroying is the main part of this novel, and it doesn't disappoint. Bigotry is given a condemning blast in this book and is put where it belongs.I hope you enjoy the second part of the Harry Potter saga for what it is-- a wonderful fantasy book. But once you finish do not fear, for the saga is not over. It continues in \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is another great hit in the Harry Potter series! I loved this book just as much as the first one. There are some new characters added, another mystery for Harry to solve, and some unexpected twists in the book.\\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" kept my attention throughout the whole book, as did the last one. I couldn't put it down. I also found that Ms. Rowling gave enough details in the 2nd book to where one could read it without reading the 1st book and still be able to follow along; and it also wasn't too repetitive for the readers who have read the 1st one. Yet another great book for readers of all ages!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"On the level of introducing a child to the joys of reading a long novel, this book has succeeded far and beyond my expectations. Ever since I began reading Harry Potter to my six-year old daughter, it has been the main attraction of the day or evening. In addition to the suspense, adventure, fantasy, and mystery that come with a Harry Potter story, the author does a good job in walking a fine line between writing about a magical world in which anything is possible (e.g. preserving a copy of one's self in a magical diary), to addressing that part of life which is governed by laws and rules (e.g. underage wizards cannot practice magic in front of muggles, but how the Ministry of Magic knows when this happens is never explained).For us the excitement of reading Harry Potter is certainly real and magical; and I hope my daughter's enthusiasm carries over when reading other books that are more concerned with the rules and laws governing the lives and relationships of muggles."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry potter is one of the best books.

Its filled with a magical theme that everybody would lobe. This is a definate book to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry is just like he is in the 1st book except older and a little physical/mental changes. Harry's closest relatives (Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and his annoying cousin Dudley) hate him even more than ever and Harry can't stand it. So he leaves in an amazing way (which I can't tell you about) and a strange creature comes to warn Harry about horrible things that are going to happen at Hogwarts if he goes back. When Harry returns to Hogwarts for his second year, Harry finds out that the warning is true. Torments start and horrors come which includes a new stuck-up/dumb/Mr. big shot (not really) professor and a ghost of a girl who haunts a girl's bathroom. Harry finds good info from her in the book about the strange things going on. Then the worst part strikes, someone or something is turning people into stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, the biggest rival to Harry, or could it be who everyone is talking about, Harry himself?! Wait a second, does He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (Lord Voldemort) have something to do with this? Maybe. You'll have to read the book to find out!There were a lot of fantasy elements that I liked and disliked. I liked the part with the strange creature who warned Harry about the dangers that were going to happen at Hogwarts that year. The story described that magical creature so well. It told every little detail. The part where Harry escaped from the Dursleys was exciting. I wash holding the book so hard. My parents kept telling to put the book down but just I couldn't. Another good part was when Mrs. Weasley got really mad at Fred, George, and Ron. You could practically see the seam rising above her. So was just screaming at them but being so kind to Harry. She said she didn't blame him one bit. I also liked the part when Harry and Ron flew a bewitched car to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry because they didn't catch the Hogwarts Express (which is a train that takes students straight to Hogwarts). It was amazing how they got there. There were some close calls. Especially when they got to the school and met the Womping Willow (a bewitched tree). The part with the new Professor \\"Gilderoy Lockhart\\" and Harry was also good. I could tell that Harry hated him. He always tried to stay as far away from him as he could. Then the best parts started to happen. Students started to get turned into stone. But the students who were attacked were all Mudbloods (people born the a magical person and a normal person or muggle). I don't know why Colin Creevey (a weird kid who takes a lot of pictures) should be in this story. He is just annoying. The best part about Colin is when he gets turned to stone. I enjoyed that. I bet that Harry thought it was a lot quieter in the Gryffindor common room. But Harry did feel sorry for him. I kind of did...sort of. There are some parts that I didn't like. Like when Hagrid got sent to Azkaban prison (a place where wizards and witches go if they did something really, really bad like murder). Everyone thought Hagrid was the person who turned people to stone or they thought he sent something loose on the school. Harry finds out it wasn't really Hagrid, It was... um cough. Sorry, can't tell. Top secret. FBI info only. Another part I didn't like was when a Quidditch game got canceled. I loved reading about the Quidditch games. There one of the best parts! Well there weren't many bad parts in this story. I really liked it and if you like to read about adventure, sports, magic, and some scary stuff (etc.), you'll like this book.

The main characters were Harry Potter, Ron, and Hermione. Harry is a popular person because when he was a baby Lord Voldemort tried to kill him and he lived. Harry is a friendly person. Harry is tall, has black hair, glasses, and a lightning shaped scar on his forehead from Voldemort. After Harry had came back to his aunt and uncles house for summer they were really mean to him. He gets ready to go back and this really weird elf thing comes and warns Harry not to come back to hogwarts. Harry gets locked up so he can't go back to school but someone comes to get him and a magical way. He gets to hogwarts and just like the creature said things started happening. People start getting hurt and Harry keeps getting blamed for it but Dumbledore knows he didn't do it.I give this book a 4 star rating. This book is really magical. Their where flying cars, wands, and broomsticks. I think there should have been more magic in this book. I liked that Harry had to save everybody again. The phoenix was really cool how it can die and came back to life and its tears can heal anything. I didn't like the part when Ron tried to cast a spell on Dracco and he started puking out slugs. I think it was well written and had good words for explaining the characters and things.

The 2nd book has a lot more action and you see more chemistry between the characters. The books just keep on getting better. I definitely recommend this book for anyone, all ages can read it and I can assure you, you will enjoy it!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Chamber of Secrets follows Harry Potter's 2nd year at Hogwart's School of Wizardry. It is assumed that it is also the reader's second incursion into this world, so that the book is a true sequel. This allows the story to move at a faster pace, without slowing down to explain the rules of Quidditch, for example. The overall effect is a much smoother and ultimately more enjoyable story.The titular Chamber of Secrets is the source of the mystery for Harry and his best friends, Hermione and Ron. When several students are literally petrified, and chilling warnings written on the walls threatening more of the same, Hogwart's is thrown into confusion and chaos. Naturally, it's up to our 3 heroes to save the day, whilst trying to defend the House Cup championship and passing their courses.We are introduced to some new characters, and most of our old favourites are back. There is something familiar and comfortable about the surroundings and the people, mostly because Rowling does such a good job of introducing them in the first book. However, there are a number of new, creepy, and fun situations, making this story as inventive as the first. However, the overall theme is very similar to the first book - something unknown endangers the school/students, the heroes can't trust anyone and sneak around after hours to figure out the problem, and it comes down to a confrontation in the bowels of the school. You only notice this on hindsight, however - while immersed in the story you are entranced and likely to finish in a very short time, then go looking for the 3rd book.The writing level seems to be about the same as the first book - intended for early teens (maybe 11-14?), but is equally enjoyable to adults, and is probably not too scary to be read to younger children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My book is called Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by JK Rowling. Ok so the inside scoop on Harry Potter is his parents were killed by you-know-who. He&#65533;s now living with mugles ( non- magic folk). They treat him like nothing, like he&#65533;s just an ordinary boy. But really he&#65533;s the boy who lived. That&#65533;s what&#65533;s up. Well he goes back to school at Hogwarts and there is a monster in the chamber of secrets. Well if you know Harry like I do he wants to find out what monster is hidden in the chamber of secrets. He goes to Aragog, the spider, and after that he finds a clue between Moaning Murtle, and the girl who was killed almost 50 years ago. The girl who was killed was killed in the bathroom. Well that&#65533;s all I have to say for now. READ IT AND FIND OUT WHO THE KILLER IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by JK Rowling is about a boy who goes to a magic school named Hogwarts. There are three main characters; Harry,Ron, and Hermony. They helped Harry get through the traps. Then he finds out someone is trying to kill him. Harry is my favorite character. He gets all the cool toys.I can't really relate to any of the characters in the story because I don't go to magic school and I don't hane a pet. . I really like the book because I like adverture stores. I don't have a least favorite part because the whole book was pretty neat and I wouldn't change anything about it.I would recommend this book to 13 years of age and above. If someone likes adventure stories then this book is for you. But if you don't then don't bother reading this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry has spent most of the summer holidays at his Aunt and Uncle's home and their attitude towards him has not changed, his cousin is on an enforced diet and Harry is given very little food, he has spent his worst birthday ever and has had a visit from a house elf called Dobby warning him not to return to school because of danger. Dobby causes problems for Harry and he is locked in his bedroom for days (he no longer sleeps under the stairs, partly because of his Uncle's fear of magic); his friend Ron and Ron's twin brothers, Fred and George, using a flying car, rescue him. Harry spends the remaining couple of weeks of the holidays at Ron's home where he is made to feel like one of the family. Ron's sister Ginny has a crush on Harry; she is one year younger than them and going to start Hogworts after the summer.Mr and Mrs Weasley take Harry, Ron, George, Fred, Ginny and Percy to the station to catch the Hogwort Express. Ron and Harry are last to walk through the barrier onto platform nine and three quarters and find they cannot get through, the train leaves without them and they are stuck at the station. They decide to use the flying car to get to school, something they should not do incase any muggles (the name for ordinary people like you and me) see the car flying. They reach the school grounds and crash into the Whomping Willow - a tree that attacks you with heavy blows using its branches.Harry's second year at Hogworts is just as adventurous as his first, there are more Quidditch games to play, new spells to learn and more of the castle to explore. Harry and his friends are invited to a deathday party by one of the ghosts and they join the school duelling club. The year is not without mysterious goings on, Harry hears voices no one else can hear and pupils are found sort of frozen in a state of shock. Harry and his two loyal and faithful friends try to find who the Heir to Slytherin is (Slytherin was one of the four founders of Horworts School). They find a very secret diary, which belonged to a boy called Tom Riddle who was a student at the school fifty years ago, that eventually leads Harry to the Chamber of Secrets and a meeting with Voldermort.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is two hundred and fifty one pages of funny, exciting, frightening and unexpected events; it is just as gripping as the Philosophers Stone and once finished I had to read about Harry's third year at Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter, the famous wizard has saved muggle-borns from the giant snake.

It was awesome. You can't take your eyes away from the book. It is about a boy who's parents were killed by an evil sorceror named VOLDEMORT. Harry then is sent to his aunt and uncles house. The only problem is that his aunt and uncle HATE, and I mean HATE Harry because Harrys aunt hates her sister(Harry's Mom) because she was as UnDursleyish as it was possible to be.(The Dursleys are Harrys aunt and uncle) He then finds out 10 years later that he is a wizard, not a human like the Dusleys. He is then sent right away to a School of Wizardy called Hogwarts. That is when Harrys adventure comes in. Harry makes many friends at Hogwarts and they went on many adventures, but their main adventure was to look for the legendary Sorcerors Stone.

This second book in the J.K. Rowling series is a must read! Not only do the main characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger set out to solve a new problem but, they realize that somebody has opened the Chamber of Secrets. Through trial and error our heroes search for clues to save one of their friends. Again Harry must put his life in danger to save others who are important to him. J.K. Rowling has introduced us to some new characters in book two. We meet a magical elf, Dobby, a new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart and finally Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister who joins the famous trio. I liked this book because it was a true page turner. As the reader you can search for possible clues along with Harry, Ron and Hermione. I would recommend this book to anyone over seven years old. J.K. Rowling did an excellent job on this book because it's exciting and full of adventure. I have learned from this book that life is full of tough challenges and problems. No matter how hard it is you have to be brave and trust in yourself to do the right thing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Although I am 40+ and my husband (also 40+)originally bought the Harry Potter books for our eleven-year-old daughter, she really had to fight us both off, in order to read it for herself. She finally got to read it first because she had the excuse that her homework required her to read for at least 20 minutes a day. I can't think of a single time that she stopped reading after 20 minutes;we had to remind her that she had other homework. I found this book to be highly entertaining (although not quite on a par with the first and third books). However, my biggest complaint is that (like the other books),I couldn't put it down for just a few minutes, or my husband or daughter (whoever got there first) would grab it. Then I had to keep a watchful eye out and grab it back. I usually read it during the night hours (I'm a night owl anyway), which leads to my second complaint. Not only did the book keep me awake, I found it almost impossible to read my textbooks (I'm a graduate student)until I had finished the entire book. J.K. Rowling has made a wonderful addition to literature; I'm sure these books are destined to become classics. I can't wait for the next one to come out. In case you're wondering why I gave it four instead of five stars, was that the vain professor did not ring true and I found myself getting irritated when none of the faculty did anything at all about this incompetent instructor. On the other hand, the car who turned wild, but came in the nick of time to save his friend Ron, was thoroughly charming."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading the original of the recent hits and chart-topping Harry Potter series, I just had to read the second. It once again begins over summer vacation and takes Harry to his second year at Hogwarts, the best wizarding school of the day. But for some reason, people begin to be attacked by someone - or something. Harry, Ron, and Hermione start on another slew of detective work to find out what's going on, and how to save the students of Hogwarts...it's hard to give a plot summary without exposing the secrets of the ending, which, by the way, was a total surprise!This book is truly engrossing, more intense and frightening than the first. I loved it! It was both fun and funny, much like the other two in the series. It is interesting to read, and I honestly think it appeals to all ages. Even older readers will enjoy being taken back to the days when the line between fantasy and reality was blurred, and all the books would keep any modern teenager enthralled. Harry Potter No. 2 actually kept me laughing throughout. At some points in the middle, the story may get slightly bland, but don't worry: the best part is yet to come. I love children's stories, have read many, and these are the best, most modern works out there. There's a reason they are so hot right now, and all these other 5-star reviews are deserved! This series breaks the ordinary mold of children's books which are not always written with the same flair J.K. Rowling successfully incorporates into the plot, and they each possess their own sense of magic, not allowing the reader to put the book down! The Harry Potter books are highly recommended! Other children's authors I enjoy are Roald Dahl, Louis Sachar, Mark Twain, C.S. Lewis, and E.B. White."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was doubtful when I started the Harry Potter books- in fact I was only going to read them because a friend begged me to do so. Much to my surprise, I was immediately hooked on the first novel, and finished all three within a week. I can honestly say that the three Harry Potter books are among the best books I've ever read. I now recommend them to everyone- children and adults alike. They're thoughtful, original, suspenseful, and humorous- everything you could ask for in an adult's novel. I'm 17 years old, and I never thought I'd be reading kids' books. But now I'm glad I did- don't miss out on these amazing books, especially the third one. The Chamber of Secrets is by far the best of the three books. Rowling explores new dimensions of Harry's world and reveals the secrets readers have been dying to know since the first book. This book leaves you hanging for the fourth novel, which is sure to also be incredible!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was reading my kid brother a bedtime story when he suggested that we should try the Harry Potter books next. I was doubtful, having never heard of them before, but when he left one lying on the kitchen table I had a look, and the next thing I knew, I was halfway through the book! I couldn't put it down. Harry's unusual adventures caught my imagination. Plenty of twists and laughs, as well as suspense and tension. And the characters are great! Since then, I've heard a lot about the series, all wonderful, and many comments on how much the parents seem to like them too..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you have children aged between 8 and 13, they will absolutely love this book. If you like to read to your younger children, you will love this book. There is intrigue, suspense, drama, comedy and best of all, magic. It is one of several stories about Harry Potter, a young boy who thought he was quite normal until he found out he was a wizard. The three books published so far are about Harry and his time at Hogwart's School of Wizardry and Witchcraft. Each book covers a full year at the school. This book is his second year and his search for the secrets within the castle of Hogwarts. If you like Roald Dahl or C.S. Lewis, you will love Harry Potter and his adventures. This book is one of many excellent stories. A must for any parent who loves fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling wastes no time further developing the world she introduced first in PHILOSOPHER'S STONE. While the first book got us acclimated to her magical world, it is here, in the CHAMBER OF SECRETS, she really begins expanding the vocabulary of that universe.Apparently, Potter, at this early stage in the story, is already in grave danger. He has a house elf named Dobby appear to him in his uncle's house, warning him he must not go back to Hogwarts. Dobby even gets Harry in trouble with the Ministry For Magic (thus reads the unaltered UK edition, rather than the Americanized \\"Ministry of Magic\\"). When Harry and Ron try to get onto Platform 9 and they find the way blocked, an so have to (illegally) take a flying car Arthur Weasley, Ron's father, had enchanted. Once they land, Severus Snape reads them the riot act, for they have been spotted by muggles. And that's just the opening section. Danger doesn't stop there.Murders and attacks begin to occur within the school, and whispers of a dark area known as the Chamber of Secrets somewhere in the castle, where the Heir of Slytherin has bred a monster, is begingin to circulate. Apparently this Chamber has been opened before, and the last time it was opened, someone was murdered.It is here, in the second novel, we are first introduced to Potter's ability to speak Parseltongue, though we were told of this ability in the first book. Here this ability takes ominous overtones, for it is thought the Heir of SLytherin, the one who can open the Chamber of Secrets and command Slytherin's monster, would also be able to speak parseltongue, and so Potter must endure persecution on that front as well.A funny character in this one is Gildery Lockhart, that fraud of a teacher who is world famous and takes credit for work that is no this.. His fate is well deserved.Eventually, Harry finds his way into the Chamber of Secrets, and through the aid of Fawkes the Phoneix, fights off the magical beast of Slytherin and learns more about Tom Riddle, the boy who would become Voldemort.Ultimately, All of these mysteries are unraveled, and Potter and the gang are safe again. However, in typical Rowling fashion, there are some central facts regarding the storyline that would not emerge until much later in the series. It is not until Book 6 we learn the importance of Tom Riddle's diary, and that it in fact a Horcrux.Rowling introduces some new features and characters in her universe. It is here in CHAMBER OF SECRETS we first really get to meet Ginny Weasely (though she appears briefly in Book 1), who at this early stage has a crush on Harry though Harry does not return this crush. We are shown the Whomping Willow, Aragog the giant spider, and are given more backstory on Hagrid. We are shown Polyjuice Potion, and learn about Moaning Myrtle, the ghost in the third floor lavatory. We see that Hogwarts is not as safe as you may suppose (though the school was never THAT safe to begin with). Probably one of the most important additions to Rowling's cast of characters is Dobby, the house elf who would became a major character throughout the remainder of the series.CHAMBER OF SECRETS shows, more than anything, that the success of PHILOSPHER'S STONE was not a fluke accident, and it is with this novel we get the first real rumblings of the Pottermania that was about to take over the globe. This book is easily as readable as the first, and most readers will fly through this novel.This is my order of Potter books by preference:Deathly HallowsPrisoner of AzkabanOrder of the PhoenixPhilosopher's Stone/Chamber of Secrets (I rank them both the same)Half-Blood PrinceGoblet of Fire."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Want to end the TV addiction in your family? Get a copy of the audio versions of the Harry Potter books and you'll never know what hit you!Every kid who drives in our car wants to move to our house! My daughter and I have been listening to the first and second Harry Potter books (Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets) on both audiotape and CD for weeks and weeks now. By that, I mean, that once we finish one, we put the other one on, and have continued to go back and forth at her request.I don't know how long this can last, but I agree that nothing else quite measures up afterwards! The reader, Jim Dale, is somehow able to communicate at least one or two DOZEN characters without any duplication and perfectly captures the style and personality of each of the characters without any loss of how you imagine them. What a treat!Each character has a perfectly appropriate voice and tone and loses absolutely nothing from the book. Quite the contrary, we are both hearing new things that we must have missed the first time we read the books as we are endlessly entertained and amused.We listen whenever we are driving in the car, or drawing or doing crafts, while laughing out loud, crying, and giving each other funny looks!We have even found ourselves sitting outside the movies, lessons, and our own driveway, without being able to move until we come to the end of a chapter.No matter how many times you have read the books, I guarantee the audio versions will give you a new perspective on the stories and/or reveal something which you didn't already know from your reading. Besides, it is a pleasure separate and apart from reading the books yourself. The art of reading out loud is not entirely lost--you only have to listen to these audiotapes to realize that the TV can never compete with this type of reading out loud! Share this with your family--YOU'LL NEVER LOOK BACK!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think the Harry Potter books are really fascinating. They are full of suspense and irony. I wouldn't have read this book because I thought it was for younger kids ( I'm 13)but my friend was reading it so I gave it a try. I didn't put the book down until I finished it. It was that good! I don't want to be rude either but it really does not promote witchcraft. The whole time I read it, using black magic never crossed my mind. I know parents can be overprotective about that stuff but what about JRR Tolkien's Hobbit series and Disney movies with witches and wizards in them. SLeeping Beauty and Snow White and the 7 dwarves show this. Most stories or movies have a villian that is either a sorcerer or a witch. I thought this book was really awesome and even if you are above the age of the Reading Level read it anyway! I love Harry Potter: he is really responsible and smart. He is a good example. His friends are really funny and so are all the other characters. This is really good literature. Thank you so much Ms. Rowling for writing these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"All 3 of the Harry Potter books are great. They are so enjoyable to read with the family. If you think these books are bad in a way that they show violence then you are wrong. I would recommend these books to all ages!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry is spending a dreadful summer stuck with his uncle, aunt, and cousin. Even though he now knows who he is, they still treat him like dirt and refuse to acknowledge his magical powers. Harry is looking forward to the end of summer so he can return to Hogwarts and his friends.But one night he finds a weird creature in his room. He announces that Harry can't return to school because of the danger Harry would face there. But he won't get into specifics. Harry's attempt to go anyway is met with a road block, and Harry and Ron must sneak there in a flying car.But things aren't any easier at Hogwarts. Someone is whispering in the walls, and only Harry can hear it. The new defense against the dark arts teacher is a little too full of himself. But worse yet, pupils are turning to stone and the rumor is Harry is doing it. Can he figure out the truth?Yep, I'm just now joining the party, but I can see what all the praise has been for. Like the first book, I thought this one started a little slowly. But it build speed faster and I was hooked for the entire second half. The characters are growing on my as well. I can't wait to spend more time with them.If, like me, you've been waiting until the final book is announced to start the series, the time to wait is over. Act now and discover just how much fun these books really are."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book in the Harry Potter series is definitely the weakest entry in the series. The plot is somewhat dull and lacks the strength to give the story direction. The Chamber of Secrets seems to meander into a very quick conclusion. Further, it is the worst written book in the series by far, featuring some very cliche dialog. Much of the book is devoted to repeating character mannerisms and rehashing the events of the previous book.Despite this, the book is still pretty good and will keep the reader interested in Harry Potter and his adventures. The characters are still likable and because the world is so new to the reader, many of the books faults are hidden underneath the very well-written quidditch matches and respectable plot development. In addition, some of the new characters are rather enjoyable, particularly Dobby and Gilderoy Lockheart.There is no sense reading this book if you have not read the Sorcerer's stone. Although Chamber of Secrets more or less stands on its own as a book, if you like this one, you will like the Sorcerer's Stone and if you dislike the Sorcerer's Stone, you will dislike this one, so you might as well start at the beginning. If you were ambivalent about the Sorcerer's Stone, you should read this anyway since the books get considerably better after the Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Well, I decided to give this series another try after originally reading the first two. I didn't particularly like them before, but now I think they're enjoyable, if definitely standard, fantasy. I read this book in a couple of hours, and it was a very easy read. The plot is much like the first book, but maybe that's intentional. I like the fact that there is a mystery involved in these books, but the suspense is not built up anywhere near enough. I don't get it, really. I don't understand WHAT everyone sees in these books. I think they're just a fad. We'll see what happens in 30 years... Anyway, I'm determined to finish the series now, just to keep up with things, but I know they get progressivly longer, so I don't think that's a good sign. Anyway, I don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but I just don't get it..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"So Harry is addening his second year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizarding.

For the first time, she read at every possible chance. ( Often,outloud to me or her Grandmother). It is a book that you can not put down. The story is about a boy named Harry Potter and we slowly learn about why he is so special to the Wizard world. The author helps us understand his sadness, and longing for the parents that he can't remember. You can't help but share in the excitement of his school triumphs, which so sharply contrast to his lonely, isolated home life with his Aunt and Uncle. I have purchased all the books in the series, because they are like peanuts- once you have read one, you can't wait for more. The story telling is flawless and it is a wonderderful trip into anyone's imagination. If you only buy one book for your child this year make it this one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I know I must sound like everyone who writes in, but ya know, it's really true!This is (along with the other two) the BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!

The characters are well developed and the plot is interesting. What that means to a reader is: you want to know more about the people in the story. They become friends (or enemies) that you want to know all about. You can't wait to get to the next installment. J.K. Rowling has the knack for creating that kind of feeling.This book is the second in the series. It takes Harry through his second year at Hogwarts. It has interesting new characters, and new spells, and new information about the \\"Wizarding World\\", as it's called. But more than that it gives us a glimpse into the lives of our beloved stars of the first book. Draws us into their lives even further, with the result that we want to know more.In general, these are classed as Children's Books, but in fact they are people books. Most Children's Books are a little on the shallow side. These are very deep books with deep insites into the thoughts and personalities of the main characters. It is true that the main characters are children, but they are treated as real people in the books.Very well done!Jim Umber"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The tale of Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry begins with dire warnings of terrible things to come. And indeed, from a series of attacks during the school year to a gruesome final confrontation, this adventure is darker than the first. Fortunately, Rowling balances the darkness with plenty of levity and light: the charm of the Burrow, flying cars, whomping willows, and a Deathday party, just to name a few.Through it all, Ron and Hermione help Harry balance schoolwork and Quidditch practices while trying to solve the mystery of the attacks. Along the way, they meet a series of memorable new friends and foes, among them Dobby the subservient house else, Moaning Myrtle the miserable ghost, and Gilderoy Lockhart, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who is his own greatest fan. And as the conclusion nears, Rowling's talent for weaving a tangled web of foreshadowing becomes ever more apparent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling creates another masterpiece in her second Harry Potter book.

JK Rowling can be creative and not creative at the same time. Her books are entertaining, but I do not see the excellence in her writing.

Along the way Harry is confronted several times with his ultimate enemy, Draco Malfoy, who will stop at nothing to get the best of the, \\"so called,\\" famous Harry Potter.

It is shown on the NZ cover. However, The Chamber of Secrets, unfortunately, doesn&#65533;t match up to its hyped and brilliant predecessor. It is still a great read no doubt, but the idea could&#65533;ve been taken further. Okay, on to the good cheese. Ron&#65533;s character is described much better in this book, we get to know more about his personality. The book is extremely gruesome at times and should be classed as a full-on-reminiscent-of-James Patterson-thriller, which is a fabulous change because it is definitely not what I expected. J.K. Rowling certainly gives us shocks, surprises and chills up our spine. She did this in the first, but not as adult as she has done in this book. The withcraft and wizardry was good, but not as great as the first. I definitely enjoyed the tense games of Quidditch, which are a high-point in all the books. This sequel was just missing the personality of the first I guess it has much more to do with evil than grand. Still, it&#65533;s an enjoyable read that I would recommend mostly to teens due to the fact that children may find its gory story a little too freaky."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A good book by J.K.

Harry's got a new fame-hungry professor to dodge, Quidditch matches to win, friends to protect, and mysteries to solve. The story unfolds at a rapid pace, and the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets is intriguing.In the Harry Potter books, Rowling has created a fantastic world of magic in the vein of C.S.

Any fans of fantasy should be sure to read the Harry Potter books, as they hold their own alongside these classics."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read the first book and loved it and then I decided to read the second one. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I don't think it is wonderful for kids under ten. At points in the book I found my self going &quot;ewww&quot; and then laughing at other points. I think the book is written wonderfully with the nice balance of laughter, sadness, and triumph over dark forces."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm very glad I decided to read this series in spite of thehype. Rowling takes many of the best elements of fantasy fiction andadapts them for a younger audience without dumbing them down. Very, very enjoyable.One of the things that struck me about this book was the consistent disparagement of hero worship. Not only was the insufferable Gilderoy Lockhart made fun of, but Harry's fellow students who acted like groupies were shown to be on dangerous ground. It's nice to see this book tweak the all-too-common worship of idols, while showing respect for characters who have earned it (Dumbledore).I liked it, but not quite as much as the first book. Looking forward to getting my hands on the 3rd."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After the less plot-driven &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; I didn't expect anything dense, and was surprised by the attention to plot and development. But now that Rowling has introduced us to Harry's world she has free reign to gloss over the details and follow a single plotline. And what a plotline! I expected these books to be childish, but this one is actually creepy. When several students are petrified and a mysterious message proclaiming the chamber of secrets has been opened appears Harry must find the culprit before his friend Hermione is the next victim. It sounds vaguely like an episode of Scooby Doo - but trust me, it's not. I couldn't put it down once I had started it, and found myself staying up until four in the morning to finish it the same day I got it. My only complaint is that it had to end. If you have children you should read it to them - I think the whole family would enjoy it. I know that this is the sort of book that I would have loved to have heard back when my father used to read to us."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After I read the first Harry Potter book I couldn't wait to read this one. Like the first one I was hooked on this book from the beginning to the end.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Rocks! Unlike the first Harry Potter book this is much more mysterious and action packed.(Although I do like the first one.) This book is definatly a great way to continue the Harry Potter series. It also has a suprise ending which is only one of the great features of this book!If you liked Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone you'll love this. If you haven't read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone you'll still love this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"From the opening sentance this book does not dissapoint. The writing is so consistent with the first book that you feel you are just reading the continuing chapters instead of a whole different book. The characters are the same yet they change as the year progresses and we get to meet some hilarious new ones. Gilderoy Lockhart's &quot;test&quot; on the first day of school is a highlight.This is definitly a worthy succsesor to &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone.&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great book.

It draws the reader into its realm and creates a new generation of readers. As a parent I was happy to see my child reading so intensely that the 300+ pages were read in 26 hours. It was also exciting to have my 9 year old daughter request I read one of her books so we could discuss the content of the book. However, I had to wait until she finished reading it the second time in three days! I enjoyed the fast paced content of this book, designed for children but also enjoyed by adults. Enjoy reading it yourself!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a great book and the Narrator is fantastic. He really pulls you into the story.

I will definitely be reading them again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter books are jewels in the realm of fantasy novels. They get better and better as novels become larger in length. Chamber of Secrets offered one of the best mysteries I've read in a long time, as does the rest of the series. I think you will find that nothing in the world of Harry Potter is predictable and every suprise comes splendidly. I've read 4 of the 7 books before, and I recall Chamber of Secrets being my favorite. If you loved Sorcerer's Stone, then you will be thankful that the following books never decay in quality.Mystery, Suspense, Wonder, and Wicked Fun await you. As the wizarding world broadens we are always left wanting more. I reccomend these tyrant stories of the fantasy world to any type of reader. I doubt there are many people in this world who can manage to dislike Harry Potter after reading it. Chamber of Secrets offers no secrets to steer you away. Harry Potter: Book 2 is solid and dashing without flaw."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Chamber of Secrets is a fine book, but even after having read it several times and now listening to it on audiobook (the first time I've revisted the story in probably 5 years), my feeling hasn't really changed in regard to it being my least favorite of the Potter books. Even saying that, it's not that I hate the book. There's a lot to like in it. I just feel like it remains the volume in which the main mystery is the least well-developed; it's the book in which two of the final reveal feels like they come from out of left field. Yes, I'm still bothered by the way Ginny is absent for most of the book yet stands revealed in the end as a main component of what has been going on at the school all year long. I felt like there should have been more indicators than the occasional \\"Ginny looks like she's got a stomach ache\\" toss-off line. I also think the reveal of Lucius Malfoy's connection is a bit of a stretch, although there at least you can go back to the beginning of the book and think \\"okay, yeah, I guess that happened.\\"However, as I said, even with that dissatisfaction, there's still plenty to like. Gilderoy Lockhart remains one of my favorite smarmy, self-involved characters of all time. I can't help but picture Kenneth Brannagh when I reread the book, and even with Jim Dale's slightly different take on the voice of the character, I still felt Brannagh's presence. And of course, Rowling used this book to set up so much of what will come later: the mystery of Harry's shared abilities with Lord Voldemort, the Harry-Draco Quidditch rivarly, the possibility that rather than being the Heir of Slytherin, Harry is actually the Heir of Gryffindor, and of course the introductory mention of Azkaban prison. While Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday party feels like a bit of a waste of space considering the smaller and smaller roles the ghosts play as the series evolves, it is still a fun diversion.Jim Dale, of course, does his usual stellar job at performing the book and giving characters individual voices. It is a little tough listening to these while driving because his voice is just so darn soothing, but if I don't listen to them on the road, I never will!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love the Harry Potter series. I have all of the hardback books in the series and bought this one to complete the paperback series for my kids to read. This is a very good series and I recommend it highly. It is good for young readers because it is very easy to get into."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling has written one of the best series of books ever.

K. RowlingAfter a miserable summer with his despicable aunt, uncle, and cousin, Harry is more than ready to return to Hogwarts for his second year. But a mysterious creature named Dobby warns Harry not to return to school, and causes trouble for Harry, using magic and getting him an official complaint from the Ministry of Magic.Rowling starts off the second Harry book with plenty of action, plunging Harry and Ron into trouble on their very first day back at Hogwarts; and then there's Dobby, popping up now and then, causing mayhem. I'm trying to avoid too much summary, because more than enough has been written already.\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" reveals some of the history of Hogwarts, and Voldemort's humble beginnings as a student there. If you've already read the series, you may make connections between some events in later books and events in this book, which is one reason I enjoy rereading the series at least once a year. It's fun to look for hints.The tone of this book is a little darker as the first, as Harry and his friends try to solve the mystery of the deadly Chamber of Secrets. There are plenty of funny moments though, thanks to the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, who is an amusing airhead. My one complaint with this book is that Lockhart does get a little annoying, and I wanted to slap him sometimes; but I think that was the author's aim, so I can't complain too much.Just like the first Harry book, \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is a fun, quick read. It's a wonderful return to the magical world Rowling created.4/5."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Although COS is short, it is another great installment in the Harry Potter series.

Over the last year or so I have read the Harry Potter Books and watched the movies. I listen to the music on the soundtrack CDs while working. It sets a nice mood for me. Why?There has been a flurry of writing over the issue of why Potter has been such a hot item. Why do children like to read the books? We have their quotes to read over and think about. Some declare reading them has pulled them away from the abyss and toward success. Adults ponder these issues and offer various reasons why they think they have been so popular with children. Better, they also ponder why the books have been popular with adults as well. Notice that Lady JKR says she wrote the books for herself, because she liked them.Some have detailed the perfect fit the stories have with the trends in political and economic aspects of British or American society. Others have described the wonderful use the plots make of classic templates that always win hearts and imaginations. Harry is Jesus made flesh. Those who see a satanic cultus have been pretty much laughed out of town or they live in towns most laugh at.We also have the interplay with public relations and the media. Lady JKR received good PR even prior to the first publication of HPP/SS. The news media were interested in the poor single mother making good. It was like magic. Scholastic bid high for the rights in America and that meant a burden was on them to produce fans. They did a good job. But of course, the book was good in its own right. The movie stuck to the text, so to speak. One thing AOL did right. The kids would have been disappointed otherwise. Now when we read we picture things according to the film for better or worse. Frankly, I could never have imagined the delivery of lines such as, \\"It does not do Harry to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\\" as well as Richard Harris did. Bless him. The irony of it hurts, but it sounds like good advice and one reason to dwell on someone else's dream when it delivers such wonderful insights.With so many enjoying the books each for their own reasons, it makes little sense to think there is a peculiarly important reason why the books have enjoyed the overwhelming success they have. There are lots of reasons.I do not want the story to stop. It bugged me that I had to wait until June to see the last movie and even longer to find out what happens to Harry next. Book 6 is scheduled to come out July 16, 2005 and my order for it is already placed. But I know I have to be patient. I don't want JKR to feel rushed. I want her to do the job right all the way to the word \\"scar.\\"When I received my order for HPCS, as a side note, I puzzled over this recent development of ordering things before they are published. I have had outstanding orders for about four of five things that have not come out yet. This never used to be the case, at least for me. So this is some new kind of economic development in its own right. I suspect computers had something to do with this. And credit.I would love to teach at Hogwarts. Imagine! Students studying. Reading assignments and papers done. Students working at the library. (I seriously think Snape is the best teacher there). Reading books after class on school grounds. Students getting along well in their own houses at least. Competition between houses is a good stressor. Teachers get to teach what they consider important and they don't have to worry so much about their popularity. They can be as strict as they want. In fact, if they are not good enough or strict enough they can lose their positions!No more casual clothes. Discipline is the order of the day. All you need to do is deduct points or give detentions, even if those are no longer hanging by the thumbs in the dungeons; they are amazingly effective at Hogwarts. Students really behave. School spirit is great. The school spirits are interesting as well.The classrooms look like the pits - well, dungeons at least. At least they are not temporary or make shift! And if they are drafty? Except maybe divination class where it is warm on purpose. Students have sweaters and robes to keep them warm. Cooler is always better for staying awake anyway. Heck, even dead teachers can keep going in a school like this! (See professor Bins in the books.)No Internet. Heck, no eklectricity at all in fact. But instead of instant messaging there are instant owls. No spam, though there are occasionally howlers. You never have to find someone's address even if they are hiding from everyone. Owls know where they are. Imagine the possibilities! Message to Osama? Better use a timer if you want your owl back. How would that work?But I think the reason I would want to teach there is not just the castle and its peculiarities. It's the quality of the students. They are smart and interested. They are the kinds of kids we really want. Is this different than the ones we really have? They come to school reasonably prepared even if some of their wands are defective. There is still the pressure on those who would over indulge in intellectualosity-- maybe I should use the word \\"lucubrations\\". \\"This is light?\\" \\"How can you be behind in your school work? We are on vacation!\\" \\"She's a nightmare. No wonder she doesn't have any friends.\\" But that sort of thing is resolved. \\"Thank goodness. Hermione pays attention in Herbology.\\" What could be more rewarding than being her teacher?I do miss the fine arts. History taught by a dead teacher is not the best critical thinking course. Would critical thinking be out of place in Hogwarts? Not likely. Maybe there is a place for philosophy? At least in Britain.Well, no tickling sleeping dragons."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is number 2 in the Harry Potter series. It is Harry's second year at Hogwarts. The author does an good job of refreshing the reader on the essentials of the storyline from the first book, without belaboring them. Harry has his usual share of troubles with the Dursleys and can't wait to get back to school. However, someone or some thing is turning students into stone. To protect the students, the teachers enforce strict curfews and cancel Quidditch games. They may even have to end school early so that students can be sent home for their own safety. But Harry dreads being sent back to the Dursleys and that makes him more determined than ever to find out who has opened the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing the menace that is petrifying students. The sense of danger heats up even more when one of Harry's friends is attacked.The reader, Jim Dale, does an excellent job of portraying all of the voices. Check out his website for insights into how he creates the voices for the characters in the Harry Potter books.I liked the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a little better than this one, but that was primarily because I felt that part of the ending was a bit too contrived. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"On July 16, 2005, Book #6, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, will be released. It is eagerly, almost desperately, anticipated. I own and have read, Books 1-5, and am remembering each. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second book in Rowling's extraordinary series about a remarkable young boy; a lad who starts out life happily, then his wizard parents are tragically murdered, and his life is forever changed.One of the challenges facing this author, and others who write series in which characters are brought forward, is the necessity to keep track of each character's personality traits, habits and experiences over time. If an author comments on one page that so-and-so dislikes coffee, and later has so-and-so savoring his or her favorite cup of java, well, we have a problem. Rowling has prepared well with outlines, drawings, and briefs about people, places and things portrayed in her work. Still, the task is enormous. Throughout seven books (that is the total number, she says), she must keep every detail constant, unless of course so-and-so decides he or she likes coffee, after all!!In the Chamber of Secrets, Harry must spend another summer on Privet Drive. He eagerly awaits his return to Hogwarts and his friends. Transportation back to school is a flying car, driven by friend Ron, who shows up at his upstairs bedroom window (an upgrade from the space behind the stairs where Harry spent his first 10 years on Privet drive). The adventure starts here. First, they stop off at Ron's home where we learn more about the Weasleys, and formerly meet Ginny Weasley, the boys' sister (she was at the train station in Sorcerer's Stone). The trip to school is treacherous with Ron at the wheel and a car with a mind of its own.This book takes us through Harry's second year at the Hogwarts School and more dangerous adventures. His curiosity and innate sense of right and wrong carry him through, though barely, in some cases. We meet several new characters, including vain Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, pesky Colin Creevey, and creepy Moanin' Myrtle; and there's more Quidditch. There's trouble about Mudbloods who are half wizard and half Muggle. Hermoine Granger is a Mudblood.What makes Harry so likable is that he's not perfect, far from it. He gets angry, is not a good student, occasionally disobeys the rules (for a just reason, of course), and gets into all sorts of jams. However, whatever roadblock appears before him, whatever mistakes he makes, he carries on without whining (well, maybe a little), blaming others or giving up, a good lesson for all of us. However, the dangers he faces in the Chamber of Secrets may be insurmountable. Read and see.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Imagine it's your second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and you and you are being united with all of your good friends from Gryffindor! But on the way there you miss your train and the only way for transportation is a flying magical car, but your luck runs out when you crash into a valuable Whomping Willow.Well this is what happens to Harry Potter in his adventure to find the meaning of the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, in J.K Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.The story includes an abundant amount of nail biting events. For example, when a bunch of malevolent voices murmur from the walls of Hogwarts only to Harry, it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as more strange things begin to stirrup around Hogwarts. The words \\"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of heir beware,\\" is written on the high walls of Hogwarts. \\"Well what does that mean\\" says Harry and his friends? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do whatever is possible even if it includes risking their lives, to solve this 50 year-old mystery.After the suspenseful events of the story Harry changes from a normal wizard at Hogwarts to this brave, courageous, and loving person by the end of the story. It is the actions and words of other characters that make him act this way.Bravery, courage, love and friendship are just a few of the outstanding traits that the main characters have, and they show these traits throughout the whole story.There's always a lesson the author is trying to explain to the readers, and in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets clearly explains that bravery, courage, love for one another, depending on one another, and friendship are the main themes of the story.If you enjoy a book with a dash of adventure; if you enjoy those nail biting events. Then you'll enjoy J.K Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Love how it gets darker, the mystery is spun great and the plot keeps thickening.

It's incredible that an author can captivate audiences with two books in a row!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"There's a hidden, dark place in Hogwarts; a chamber which has never seen the light of day; a horror that has not been unleashed upon the school for fifty years. Thus the legend goes: but does it have basis in fact?Professor Binns doesn't think so. He's the history teacher at Hogwarts, a ghost who died by the fireplace and, not realizing he had in fact died, has kept teaching his classes and never missing a work day.Almost everyone else at Hogwart's School knows better. ;-)Only the heir to Slytherin can open the door to the chamber; but who is it, and why?There is a new instructor for the Defense against the Dark Arts this year. He is Gilderoy Lockhart, author, five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile-Award, recipient of the Order of Merlin, First Class, and all-around devil-may-care adventurer who has beaten off werewolves, vampires and who knows what other manner of dark creatures. Still, he can't quite figure out why people are being petrified at random around the school.Oh yes, and Harry's a Parseltongue, just like Salazar Slytherin; this means, essentially, that he can talk WITH SNAKES.Many things at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are not as they seem....."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As I said above (and in my Philospher's/Sorcerer's Stone Review), the Harry Potter books better as they progress. Chamber of Secrets didn't grab me as much as the newer three but still holds up.The story goes: A demented house elf (similar to a slave) informs Harry he will be in danger should he return to Howarts. Harry is punished by the Dursleys for a deed he didn't commit and kept from returning to Hogwarts(!). Luckily his best friend Ron breaks him out and they progress to Hogwarts (with some difficulties) and start Year Two of their schooling. But as we soon hear malicious voices in the walls of the school, their message clear: KILL. With a growing number of students and occupants of Hogwarts (including one of our heroes) becoming petrified, Harry needs to discover who the attacker is, where they hide, and what he can do to stop it.The story has some very funny moments (a mismade potion and a certain dead girl come to mind) but does raise the bar on the tension. There is more combat than in the original, plus we have the unseen attacker who keeps taking victims around Hogwarts. Kids under around 9 should steer clear but maturity is the main factor to keep in mind when deciding whether to read this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is obvious from the very beginning why children are so enthralled with the Harry Potter books. J.K. Rowling has the most vivid and wonderful imagination and has created a world of pure fantasy that any child who ever dreamed of putting a spell on the school bully would love to visit. In this second entry of the series all of the fantasy of the first book returns along with a house elf, a flying car, a whomping willow tree, a deathday party for a ghost and a diary that writes back. Even more impressive than this author's imagination though is her writing ability. Despite the fact that this is purely fiction it is written in such a brilliant manner so as to make it seem like the author was really there and has come back to our dull world to take us all back with her to this enchanted place called Hogwarts.What is not so obvious at first however is why so many adults have become such die hard Harry Potter fans. As I read this book though an idea came to me and now I think I understand a least part of the attraction so many adults feel for these books. With her wonderful writing style the author brings this story to life in such a vivid way that it takes many adults back to their school days. We are able to identify with Harry, Ron and Hermione as they attend classes and do homework. We can relate to the fun and comradeship that these children have with their classmates and it brings back fond memories of our own childhood. Most all of us had one or two very best friends and we understand the bond between Harry, Ron and Hermione. Most all of us had teachers like Snape who were ill tempered and went out of their way to catch us at something. Most all of us did at least a few things that we didn't want to get caught doing and finally most all of us had our little crushes like the one Ron's little sister has on Harry. For adults this book is not only a fantastic voyage into a world of fantasy but it is also a trip back in time.There isn't much that can be said about the plot of this book without giving too much away but the basic premise of the story revolves around an old Hogwarts legend. Supposedly one of the four founders of Hogwarts only wanted the school to be open to pure bloods and when he lost that fight he left the school but he left behind a hidden chamber that could someday be opened by his heir unleashing a terrible curse on the students not of pure magic bloodlines. Well the old legend seems to be coming true and once again Harry and his brave comrades are caught right in the middle of the situation and Harry is even accused of being the one who opened the chamber.This book contains several cleaver scenes that were left out of the movie including the fantastic sight of the Weasley's garden gnomes. If you have seen the movie don't think that you have the whole story. You should really read this book and believe me, it is such a wonderful book that you will finish it in no time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second installment in the Harry Potter serires by JK Rowling is just as enthralling, enchanting, and mesmerizing as the first. Before his second year at Hogwarts can begin, Harry has to find a way to escape from the Dursleys. Yet luckily he has friends, friends who happen to have a flying car! His next challenge ends up being just to get on the train to Hgwarts, when the passage to platform 9 and 3 quarters suddenly seals, trapping him and his friend Ron Weasley on the outside. Again they are saved by the flying car, yet Harry and Ron learn that any landing you can walk away from is a good one, as they end up in the clutches of a disgruntled, but valuable, Whomping Willow, which seems intent on bashing them to pieces! Soon, though, their troubles realy begin...Harry's second year at Hogwarts becomes very eventful, and very entertaining for the reading, as well as a bit scary. JK Rowling does a wonderful job of increasing the danger and the suspense in her second novel, keeping the reader's attention throughout. We are introduced to new entertaining new characters, such as Dobby, a sad house elf that seems to be trying to keep Harry away from Hogwarts, and yet says he is helping Harry. Also we meet Moaning Mertyl, a weeping ghost that lives in one of the girls bathrooms.Chamber of Secrets is highly entertaining, and would be greatly enjoyed by readers of almost any age, 9 through adult.

He does different voices for all the characters, and he makes the books come alive! The Harry Potter books are even better when read by Jim Dale!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Have you ever read a book with two worlds? One world is normal and very boring. The other world is happy but weird with magicians all over.This is about Harry Potter the famous kid who survived the most wanted killer Lord Voltemore. Secondly it was about a little creature named Doby who warn Harry about the danger he was in. Ronald and the teacher against black magic Gilderoy Lockhart were in the chambers. Myrtle also was a main character that told Harry how to open the door for the \\"chambers of secret\\".My favorite part is when they pull out the crying plants they really made them deaf. This part was cool because the funny parts start really early. It also talks in steps like how you can take a plant out of the ground. I like how the teens are described.This book is about making your own decisions because he chosed in what team he wanted to be in Hogwarts when he was talking to the crazy hat. He also decided to discover what is going wrong in the place. Harry also decides to tell the people that Gilderoy Lockhart is a copy cater and he puts other legends or stories in his books of adventure. This is why this book is about choosing your own decisions.I say the beginning was good compare to the two chapters because the crazy stuff happened all long. Action, funny and fantasy was this book all through. Two was the unluckiest number in this book because it was the two last chapters I didn't like and I would change the two last chapters of it to make it a six star book. J.K Rowling should read this book so he could see I am right and fix it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In this book is where people start to reveal their deepest secret. Harry in this book changed a bit more. Harry started to noticed girls. He also started to become more responsible of his actions. Harry grows and grows as the story or the series keeps going. In this book Harry didn't change a whole lot, Harry is becoming a teenager just like any other high school student. The second book was great because nobody knew who was realy petrefying everyone at Hogwarts. And then at the end you find out that Riddle was the one who send the creature lose at Hogwarts. So that's pretty cool."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Camber of Secrets is a good book. I like the way Rowling has mudbloods and full blooded wizard. Its interesting how she uses names to figure the characters out. I like when they use Tom Riddler in a diary. Don't trust if you can't see its brain. The way she uses Lockhart. Rowling is relateing Lockhart as a real writers that steal other people work for their fame. Then their is racism, and their is a lot of racism. And loyalty, and Harry is loyal to Dumbledore."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that this book was a very good because there was a lot more action than there was in the first book. In this book Harry left the Dursleys a lot earlier and he went to Hogwarts a lot faster because in the first book it took at least one hundred pages until he got to Hogwarts. The bad thing was that in the movie a lot of parts were taken out. The chapter \\"The Death Party\\" was taken out. The movie was a lot better than the first one though.The movie was a lot better than the first one only because there was more action. The first movie had less things taken out of it. I think that the death party should of been in the movie because that is how you can find out what nick is saying about the headless hunt. They should of also put in the thing that Harry found out that Filch was a squibble. This is how the people who saw the movie know why Filch hates the wizards and witches that come to hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Chamber of Secrets is my least favorite HP book, but that doesn't mean it's not great. It simply means it's not as fabulous as the others.In chamber of Secrets, Harry finally learns why he can talk to snakes, but it's also the first book where death becomes vitally important to the entire series. For those who don't know, death is, indeed, a main theme to Harry Potter ... how we deal with it, fear of it, what we're wiling to do to escape it etc. It's the first book where life or death becomes a reality for a character other than Harry - namely, the person opening the Chamber of Secrets.One of the reasons I do like COS is because it's also the introduction to Moaning Myrtle, who is so annoyingly cute and nerdy, you can't help but like her, and also, it's the introduction to Dobby, the house elf. Thankfully, the movie included both of these elements (though the following movies left out Dobby, which I think was a huge mistake on their part.)So, final thought: if you read Sorcerer's Stone, chances are you read Chamber of Secrets quickly after and so on anyway. They're like Lays potato chips. Betcha can't eat just one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets was a great book. It is one of my all time favorites. The book starts when Harry is at his aunt and uncles house for the summer. His aunt and uncle are having company over, so Harry had to go wait in his room quietly until they left. Then out of know were an elf comes and tells Harry that he can't go to school this year. But Harry would let nothing stand in the way of him and his school/home (Hogwarts).That year at Hogwarts a bunch of people get petrified, which means they can do nothing, but they are still alive. Do these strange events have anything to do with the elf that came to Harry's house? Was the elf right, should Harry have not gone to school? Will anything happen to Harry?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets is an intriguing book. JK Rowlings does an amazing job writing the Harry Poter books. She describes the characters so well and has such a rich descriptive narrative part that you feel like you feel like your standing right there watching everything happen. You absouloutly must read this book.This book, unlike the first tells alot more about Hogwarts history and about the four founders. This book builds up a lot of suspence and, much like the first, is impossible to put down.During the summer Harry's aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon are terrible and all Harry wants to do is get back to Hogwarts. However Hogwarts would prove to have troubles of its own. There's one of those \\"I'm the best and your all inferior to me so you should do what ever I say\\" defence against the dark arts teachers. There is also a Ghost who haunts the girls bathroom and is always bothering Harry and his two friends Ron and Hermione. Of corse, Draco Malfoy is his usual anoying self. But the real trouble begins when someone or something starts attaking students at Hogwarts. Can Harry save Hogwarts? Can Harry stop the monster? Can Harry save the student the monster has brought into the chamber?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought this book was really good, expecially when I figured out who was the heir of Slytheryn.Now that was great.

Not everyone wants Harry and his Mud Blood friends at the schooland a spell has been cast to get rid of them. The question is who unlocked the Chamber of Secrets and how can it be stopped? Can Harry stop it in time? What will happen if he is not enough?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"You fall in love with the characters.

Truly a brilliant author. A must read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, is a story with many different characters. These characters are unusually easy to remember. The capability to recall the role, personality, and part in each of the harry potter books is due to the way Ms. Rowling can write a story that keeps a persons undivided attention do to its thrilling story line and plot. The story takes you on a magical adventure into some of the darker areas in the magical realm. This book being somewhat of a contrast to the first book that Ms. Rowling wrote, Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone. The contrast makes the book even more enticing. I would give this book a rating of, 9/10 for its visible action and the ability it has to keep a readers interest threw many hours of pure reading. I also gave it that rating do to the books capability to paint very precise pictures of what is going on in the story due to the great job that Ms. Rowling dose in describing the events that take place in the story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was just as good as the Sorcerer's Stone!

The Chamber of Secrets book is the best!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Here comes the second band wagon, has your kid jumped on it yet? This is the Britney Spears of children's fantasy. The music is bad, the singing is almost decent, but the hype is tremendous. The controversy also brews.Despite the fact that J.K. Rowling is not that much more than an overhyped plum, the series is still great for your kids. Why? Because they'll grow up thinking that reading can be fun. And that's an attitude that's more valuable than all the diamonds in Africa.So buy this for your kids if for no other reason than to get them to READ!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"alright, let me try and explain my self out of giving &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; only 3 stars. First of all, let me say that though i haven't rated all of the other novels, i have read them all and believe that &quot;Prisoner of Azkiban&quot; is the best of the four released. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; and &quot;Sorceror's Stone&quot; are close seconds, but this novel lacks something the other's have. But for those of you who are not yet potter-fans, let me explain the story a little.Harry is a twelve year old wizard who is to start his second year at a wizarding school called Hogwarts. His best friend, Ron Weasley, and Ron's brother's free harry from his mean-spirited relatives, the Dursleys. He goes to school and gets himself into tons of trouble on the first day. To wrap up, the novel gets going with several of harry's least favorite people turning to stone.OK. You want to know more? Read the book. But for those who have read it or those who need a better explination as to why this book is not as good, continue forth.J. K. Rowling does an amazing job of writing in the other three novels. However, i feel that thematically, this book falls short. In &quot;Stone,&quot; Harry faces Voldemort for the second time in his life. His mother's love protects him from the evil wizards power and harry is saved by LOVE (Theme 1). In the third novel, Harry faces the prosepect of meeting his godfather, who is an accused murderer and the novel ends with harry using patience and understanding to solve problems. UNDERSTANDING (Theme 2). In &quot;Goblet of Fire,&quot; Harry is saved by his wit, trusting, and bravery. WIT AND BRAVERY (Theme 3).Alright. Here we go. The Themes i've capitalized show how Harry's problems are resolved. These three (well, four really) themes are good things for children who read these novels to apply to their own life, using these four characteristics to help them live life.The Problem: &quot;Chamber&quot; has a theme, but it is not something that is populary among wise parents. Harry uses violence to finish his problems. He fights evil with evil, and that is a wrong on itself. Rowling has a shortfall here and I wish that she could have used the same creativity shown to design the plot (which is very good and creepy) to finish it. However, this novel is not one that is necessary to read because it doesn't have anything really, really important. If you want, you can skip it, but i don't necessarily recommend that.&quot;Chamber&quot; is worth reading once (or twice), but it is not of the same calliber as the other novels so far. I highly reccomend any of Rowling's other works and listening to any of Jim Dale's beautiful protrayals on CD or Tape (The unabridged productions are extraordinary).I hope i've dug myself out of any serious holes and helped someone on whether they will buy this novel or not."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"At first when I read the book, it was hard for me to judge it buy, because it really wasn't my cup of tea (the other books were, even though I now have little intrest in Harry Potter anymore [maybe once Book 5 comes out, I'll get back into the series.]) This book was dark (sometimes too dark), but lacked the mixed genre of book 1, the cleverness of book 3, the darkness, thrills, and twists to book 4. Yes, I'm sorry for sounding so much like I'm saying this is an awful book. Really it's not. It defintley isn't a Godsend to the genre though. It's a mixed bag. But I did like the mystery in the middle."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's now been some years since the \\"Harry Potter\\" books first came out. Unless I am mistaken, book # 5 is due on shelves soon. In addition, two major motion pictures have now been produced.During this time, I have been repeatedly asked, as a parent, as a clergyman, and as a student of fantasy literature, what my \\"opinion\\" of the series is. After having read all four books, and having seen the first movie, I am now prepared to comment.Some people, especially those in the conservative Christian camp, decry the books as inherently Satanic, dealing, as they do, with \\"witchcraft\\", etc. As a conservative Christian father and clergyman, I must admit that I do NOT agree with this assessment -- an assessment made, all to often, by persons who have not actually read the books in question. Do I understand \\"why\\" some would suggest this? Of course I do. The difference, however, lies in the nature of fantasy literature. As can be seen in other fantasy series, (Katherine Kurtz' \\"Saint Camber\\" stories come to mind) the characters in the \\"Harry Potter\\" stories are endowed at birth with certain gifts, powers, etc., not typically applicable to ordinary persons. Much like \\"The Force\\" in the \\"Star Wars\\" stories, this power can be used for good or for evil and is, in and of itself, neither. It is this point which firmly seperates \\"Harry Potter\\" from those who actually believe in and seek to practice the Dark Arts -- activities which conservative Christians -- rightly -- condemn as anti-Scriptural.Thus, it is within this deliberate \\"suspension of belief\\" that these stories must be judged. Are they good fairy tales???\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is light reading -- without quite the creativity and certainly without the plot of the first volume. I'll grade it as follows:Plot: C- -- entirely too similar to the first volume to be truly creative. The \\"house elf\\" theme was cute, but ultimately ineffective. One almost expected a silly scene with the Dursleys. The flying car??? Nope. More than half of the book said very little, and did not, in this reviewer's opinion, properly further the plot toward the climax. The climax was, I will freely admit, well handled and creative -- it just took far too long to get there, and there was far too little to salvage the rest of the book. And again, the book ends with the loss of the \\"Defense Against the Dark Arts\\" professor. (CAUTION: SPOILER!!! This will be an ongoing theme -- and one which is less and less effective.)Character Development: C -- In the first story, Harry develops quite a relationship with Professor Dumbledore. Yet, in this story, until after the climax, Harry's attitude toward Dumbledore doesn't make sense. Why is he so reluctant to tell this trusted Professor anything at all? Especially considering the support received in the first book? This re-structuring of the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore causes the climax not to make the sort of sense it should. Also never satisfactorally explained is why Hagrid had to be taken away. Yes, he was \\"set up\\", so to speak, many years earlier. But the reasons for actually incarcerating him did not make sense to me at all.Setting: B -- here the author does use a bit of imaginative creativity, but not nearly so much as in the first book. I did enjoy the \\"Whomping Willow\\". But overall, the setting is very similar. Not much new here.Overall, I'll give the book a generous 3 stars. Not as good as the first, but not bad."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone I was totally drawn into the book. I couldn't set it down. New things were happening every second, and it kept me in suspence the whole time. However, when I eagerly started reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I was disapointed that the book was nearly three-quarters over before it started getting into the action. The book takes too much time setting it up for the one moment of suspence, and I started yawning with all the description. I think this book could be skipped and you would not loose too much of the Harry Potter series. However, even though I did not like the Chambers of Secrets was good, I thought both the Sorcerers Stone and the Prisoner of Azkaban were fantastic, and I would definately recomend them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My 9yo son is now fully prepared for life in our coven...I hope nobody took that seriously.A bit formulaic (hence only 4 stars) but otherwise fabulous. I don't think that this book was 'darker' than, say, Azkaban...&lt;'Chamber of Secrets' and 'Prisoner of Azkaban' spoilers ahead&gt;I mean, Harry almost gets his soul sucked out by a dementor in that book! Here he just almost gets killed.&lt;end spoiler&gt;I agree with most of the other superlatives tossed about here, and I would like to add a thought directed at the people who think this book is evil: while childrens' thoughts are influenced by what they read and by what they see, the primary influence is how _you_ act. You should only fear this book if you fear the example you are setting for your own children. Don't try to dictate what my children can read--that's my wife's and my job."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was very happy with the product and received it according to what I was told.

The first Harry Potter book didn't excite me too much. It was just a better-than-usual children's book. The second book blew me away. It is good even by the standards of adult fiction.When harry returns to Hogwarts, the wizarding school he attends, some sort of monster has been released on the school and is attacking students. During the course of the book, Rowling weaves a complicated puzzle around this mystery, and by the end of the book, the reader still has no idea what is going on, until she drops in the last, tiny piece of the puzzle, and everything becomes clear.But the along with the mystery, Rowling still manages to fill in the other, more mundane details of Harry's year, his classes, his teachers, the Quidditch games, and many other minor details. Yet I'd still call this book an easy read.The bottom line is, if the first Harry Potter book didn't impress you that much, pick this one up and you'll be an instant fan."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have just finished reading Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone to my 5 year old and she loved it. I recommend this book to parents with school age children, simply because the literal content of this book is at a level that children can understand. The story line is not complicated and it is very easy to build a mental picture. Now, for those adults that don't understand what all the &quot;hype&quot; is all about: HARRY POTTER IS A CHILDRENS BOOK!

For once in my life, I knew who my favorite auther was. It's J.K.Rowling!It's pointless to write a review on this book. The only way to describe it is to say: IT'S THE BEST BOOK AROUND! If you have not read it, or onee of the other books in the series, you skould do so RIGHT NOW!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Two books into the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, my husband and I am convinced that J.K. Rowling's books will take their place with C.S. Lewis' &quot;Narnia&quot; series and Laura Ingalls' &quot;Little House&quot; books, to name a few, as true classics of children's literature.Judging from &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,&quot; J.K. Rowling is a writer whose work gets better and better with each effort. With No. 3 on back order from amazon.com, we're facing a 3-5 week wait before we can continue reading the series, but it can't be helped, I suppose.Book 2 chronicles the second year of boy wizard Harry Potter's stay at Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry. At once mystery, thriller and human drama, the book is a multifaceted gem. Disparate and seemingly unconnected elements tie together neatly as the story unfolds.After finishing the book, my husband and I were left with a burning question concerning the character Hagrid. As readers of Book 1 will recall, he was expelled from Hogwarts as a student, and now serves as its gamekeeper. I won't say exactly what the question is, because I do not want to give away a major plot development, but I will say that I hope the question is taken up in subsequent volumes.Younger children may find elements of this book frightening, but what better way to introduce them to the world's harsher realities than in the company of young Harry? Parents may want to read &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; with their children, in order to discuss the more unsettling passages.Having said that, I feel that I should address the &quot;occult&quot; controversy that has erupted over Rowling's series. I think that fanatical muggles who dismiss Rowling's books as promoting the occult miss the point entirely. Although they interact with very magical and fantastic circumstances, Harry and his friends possess very strong virtues of love, loyalty, bravery, dedication and cooperation -- all traits that are prized as the very best of humanity.The Harry Potter books also are very moral ones, in which good ultimately triumphs over evil. The books also have a tremendous impact upon the imagination. This crucial part of the human personality needs to be encouraged, not suppressed. Today's children can be greatly enriched through an introduction to J.K. Rowling's creations.The Harry Potter books offer much that is beneficial to adults, as well. Adults, perhaps even more than children, need a reminder of the wonders of imagination as presented in Rowling's books. I strongly recommend this book and its predecessor to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"You as an adult may wonder why children love this book.

Year one brought the good news (people know him, he is special, and he can thrive in the other world). Year two has more lessons. First there's the warning that he should not return to school, that it is dangerous. Then the problems start, and the insights start.Harry learns more about his father (don't we all have to do that?), rescues his friends, and also learns what it feel like to be suspected as classmates are attacked and he becomes the main suspect of many around him. Again, Harry holds fast, deals with the problems as they present themselves, and of course triumphs in the end after several close calls.This book, like its predecessor, is a wonderful tale written for the modern child by an author with a wonderful sense of fancy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am old for a Harry Potter fan, 32 to be exact and I have no children.

This book is considerably darker than the first 3 but it is still fun and enchanting to read. What little information initially given about the plot had me, like many readers, expecting certain things but it twists in ways I never imagined. The deceit and betrayals in this book and certain hints at the end lead me to believe Book 5 will uncover a villain who has, in past books, protected Harry.

The typical school pranks, given a twist with the addition of magic, are recognizable to anyone who has any memory of school.

The Leaky Cauldren, a dusty musty old tavern, Diagon Alley the only place for a wizard to shop in London, Hogwarts a school devoted to teaching young witches and wizards the art of magic, and the hearts of three, brave 12 year old heros, who, in this book, risk their life to save someone they care about. And you can't fine a book better than that."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm a college student and I enjoyed reading Harry Potters adventures as much or more than my 11 year old sister. We're both hooked!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved the book. I am a long term substitute for a county school system. My last class was 10 Learning Disabled children who had very low reading levels are were absolutely addicted to Harry Potter. It impressed me so, that I bought the first one at a school book fair, and read it in one afternoon. I've just finished all three, and I am reading this one again. This isn't just for Young Adults, it is for people of all ages. This would be a great read out loud book for any classroom or family."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought that Harry Potter was the best book I ever read and I can't wait for the sequal. From reviews I read The Chamber of Secrest sounds amazing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"You will want to read this book because it has so many clever people in it. I think Harry Potter is intresting because he is not what he appears to be. He is a little child who is ignored by his family, but is famous to witches and wizards. This book is really exellent! I can't wait for the sequel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a fantastic book! My son and I read it aloud. We enjoyed it even more than Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. We can't wait for J.K. Rowling to come out with another Harry Potter book. Harry is such a great character."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I got Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, on Christmas Eve, I could not put it down. It had great details and I loved the characters. My favorite is character is Hagrid. I like him so much because although he is a big giant, he is very gentle and very funny. I can not wait for the sequel to come out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I guess I can't tell you how good this book is, really no one can yet, but I can suggest that you get Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone.

I'd really like to give a round of applaus to J.K. Rowling! I love all the magic that comes along the way! I can't wait to read the other book! It was a book that I didn't want to put down! All you kids out there I highly recommend this book! Thanks for writing such a good book J.K. Rowling! From Libby Specht"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great book! It's very thrilling, and it never turns out how you think it will. Every kid should read this book. It has a great plot, setting, great characters, and is basically just a wonderful book. The brave and famous Harry Potter is very good in this book, and I think anyone who reads any of the Harry Potter books will agree, that the Harry Potter books are so good, kids will be sad when J.K. Rowling stops writing them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is the best book I have ever read! Everyone shouldread it. The third is even better!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you dont want 50 points taken away from Gryffindor you had better buy this book.This is a GREAT sequel to the Sorcerers Stone, and a must have for every collection.one word explains it all &quot;AWESOME&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Could not wait to start reading this book, loved #1 so much. This one did not fail me either... It was fun to make new aquaintances and renew old ones. Love the fact that my daughter and I now truly can discuss books as we're both reading the same books. husband is next on the list to become a convert..... Again my daughter plowed through the book as I had. Wonderful reading..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My son(age 7) and I read this book with great interest. We read it during every free moment until it was finished. For those people who have read &quot;HP and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; read this book! For those who have not read it buy both books and start with year 1.Not the literary masterpiece that War and Peace is, but this story is much more engaging. Rowlings' attention to detail is fabulous and the children pick up on it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought that all of the Harry Potters are amazing, it makes you feel like you're there with them and enjoying the same adventures with them! when I heard that Hermione got attacked i was stunned exacly like Ron and Harry felt. The lady from texas who wrote a review and said that this book is one star, i think you are just strange. You may not think this book is approprate for your children but by making a review that you think this book is disturbing, you may put other parents off letting their children read these absolutely spectacluar and amazing novels, so keep your nasty and discusting thoughts to your self!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This series is one of the most inavative and interesting collection of books anywhere. This authour creates a compeling and magical world where anything can happen. This story written by J.K Rowlings is about a young boy who is being constantly mistrated at home and then when an owl bearing unsally letters appaers harry is wisked away by a gental giant called Hagrid. This book is wonderful, some readers may think that tis book is to siimple to read but the litaruatre is one of the best well written storys since the times of mark twain."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am not kidding. Harry Potter did what five doctors and many others could not. Harry Potter inspired my 9 year old learning disabled son to finally read. He took my paperback of Sorcerer's Stone and plods along. Harry is his buddy. Now, he dies to hear what I recently read in this book -- which is BETTER than the first. I won't gie anything away, so he is pushing to finish the first. Reminds me of my Hardy Boys days or how I watched my sisters swallow Nancy Drew or how the neighbor's kids ate up R.L. Stine. But, this is really the best of the lot."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone went straight into everybody's heart and mind....&quot;I HAVE TO READ THE SERIES!!!&quot; Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (year two at Hogwarts) was another extrordinary book. The excitment of Harry 2 was amazing! It was better then the first one...WAY better! Again the third book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has taken number one in the reading list!!! Kids love it!!! Sirius Black coming and Harry knowing he's an escaped convict and that he's his godfather is kind of freaky!!! Reading about werewolves and hippogriff's and other awesome creatures is all packed in this series!! Check out (when it comes out!) The Qudditch Cup! READ THE SERIES! IT&quot;S LIKE NOTHING BEFORE!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved the book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, but boy was I surprised when I read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azcaban! They're all thrillers, and they keep getting better! I can't wait 'till the fourth book comes out! So if you're a fan of the second, wait 'till you check out the third!!!! It's soooo great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It had to be five stars...because how else can you rate a book (or the whole series) when you can't seem to stop reading, from the moment the book starts until the last page...After finishing (in one sitting) the first book in the Harry Potter series, I ran out to buy number two, which I also read as quick as possible. The characters that I came to know &amp; like in the first book were all there (Harry, Hagrid, Hermione &amp; Ron), the humour was there, &amp; of course the mystery was there...culminating in an interesting &amp; unexpected ending. If I absolutely HAD to look for a flaw in book number two, the only thing I'd say is that it's not that different from book 1. And therefore it doesn't take you so much by surprise as the first one does. The third book in the series (The prisoner of Azkaban) is, I believe, much better than the first 2 books. But anyway: these are all details: the point is that the Harry Potter books are clear, pure fun &amp; even if one is a little better or a little worse than the other, all in all, the four books (up till now) are all very worth reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Well my Harry Potter fans, you may be sitting at your local bookstore wondering is you should buy this adventure....YES! It was wonderful. This time H-Dawg is out to find out who is turning people into stone. I mean total stonage! Harry has to go totally and completely into &quot;police guy&quot; mode and find out who is doing the evil deeds. This novel had everything a good novel (and a instant classic) should have. Great Characters, good plot, good bad guys and a fangtastic ending. Now be a good Muggle and go out and get this book. *S*"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is not easy to be a wizard. When Harry Potter returns to Howarts he must face the fear caused among its peers due to its special condition, and the risk of losing all the elements which makes his life bearable. Apart form the wonderful details and events woven in the story the message of Rowling to its young and older readers keeps on being the same. You must be the hero of your own life and once a problem is solved you shall always expect the next challenge. Then face it and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hey, if you haven't read the first Harry Potter book then go read it before you read this one. Book 2 gives all the mystery away of book one. Book 2 is a fabulous read, but it's much much much better if you read book 1 first. And, if you have read book one, then you shouldn't even be reading the reviews, you should already be reading the book (giggle). As always J. K. Rowling does a fabulous job of giving me another visual read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I like Harry Potter books alot beacause,they are full of mystery and thrils and some times funny! It also teaches kids to have an imagination, and that dreams can come true."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"And just as good it definitely was! Harry Potter is back, and in more trouble than ever, but with just as much humor and excitement.The story opens a week or two before Harry returns to Hogwarts, and takes off quickly. Harry is accosted by a tiny house-elf, Dobby, who frantically warns Harry that he should not return to Hogwarts and goes to great lengths to stop him. Harry, believing that the house-elf was sent by his school rival Draco Malfoy as a prank, is torn between taking Dobby's advice or discounting him altogether.Back at school, Harry hears a mysterious voice that none of his friends are able to hear, and there is a string of attacks on kids (and cats) at the school. The plot builds rapidly, never a detail you should overlook, even better than &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone.&quot;Several previous reviews harshly criticized Harry's disobedience to school rules, saying that kids reading it would pick up bad habits, and think that it's okay to disobey teachers. I was stung--the book doesn't say that at all! If anything, Harry exploits illustrate the consequences for breaking the rules, not setting a double standard for &quot;good guys&quot; vs &quot;bad guys.&quot;There is nothing harmful in these books, and I think they are a wonderful addition to any personal library."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter books are some of the most fun and imaginativeones on the market. This book is no exception. Just when onehilarious, frightening, magical, warm,or exciting thing has finished the next chapter takes you there and beyond all over again. The element of mystery and suprise is crucial in these books so I don't want to give away any plot points. It is wonderful... I am an adult and plenty of us love them too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Another enchanting story of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. All of her characters seem to jump off the page, from the comical Dobby to the cruel Dursleys. A must read for fantasy fans."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"An instant classic series, it has all the characteristics of the finest children's books. It has a really likeable, plucky but not perfect hero. Many interesting characters, good friends of his, and many others you love to hate. It has adventures, suspense, humor. It really does (without any overt moralizing) pitch good against evil; and though it's always a close call, so far good has won out. And it's a children's world --- adults always take second place to the kid characters. Which also means, it's the kids who are called upon to be heroic against villains of all ages. The only problem for me (a grandmother!) with the second book is how suspenseful I found the last few chapters, not good for the hypertension!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is a worthy successor to the first book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone.&quot; The characters are well developed, and the plot is engrossing. The only big negative about this book is that for those of us who read the first book then hurried to devour the second book, it was a pain being re-introduced to all of the characters, but re-introduction is understandably necessary in a sequel. In short, these books are classics in the making."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book really took me back to my early days of dreams and fantasies. I could almost taste the candies the author described. The honesty and bravery of Harry Potter I admired and wished I had had a friend like him when I was young. I am very much looking forward to the next adventure! But sad to say all three of my book stores in town are sold out of the secound book. I feel like a little kid impatiently awaiting for the next book and I am 31. I had really wanted to take it on my vacation with me. Boo Hoo!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Imaginative, and fun to read. I don't understand the fuss. It's fun to read a book where characters in pictures come alive, wizard work their magic and the reader becomes part of the action. All you need to do is use your imagination and for a while you are a part of the story.The best thing that can be said for the Potter series, is that it encourages children to read. If children learn the joy of reading, than who can ask for more.I highly recommend the Potter series for children of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an outstanding book.

I would recomend this book to anyone. This book had my favorite ending. If your thinking about buying this book buy it! I read a book a day almost and still think this is one of the three best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Im not going to bore yeh about what happens because everyone has already read it and if yeh havent yeh should be ashamed of yehrself. My advice: read or I'll send VOLDEMORT out ter yeh!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I got the first book as a gift. It was the only book I had availible for a book report, so in disgust, I was forced to read it. Even the first chapter was good! I kept my nose in the book until it was finished (must have been hexed!). Since then, I've been a Harry Potter fan.In this book, Harry Potter, with the help of the Weaslys, escapes his prison on Privet Drive. There he spends his summer at &quot;The Burrow&quot; - the ramshackle house that the Weaslys put together with wood, brick, and magic. He soon begins a wild adventure at Hogwarts, starting with a fantastic arrival by flying car with perils like Moaning Myrtle - ghost haunting the bathroom, a new unbelievabely stuck up teacher, and an enemy that &quot;Petrefies&quot; students - makes them stiff and lifeless like a statue. In the end he has to use all the tools and charms he has in a showdown with Voldemort and the horrible monster from the Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets is about a boy,but not any ordanary boy. Unlike most of us Harry is a wizard in training, in other words he is attending a magic school called Hogwarts. Harry adores Hogwarts and has made many friends here like, Ron and Hermoine. They get in to lots adventures with eachother wich leads them to trouble. But that dosen't stop them from opening a very secret part of Hogwarts! AHH this book is so tense and exciting you can never stop!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Are you into fantasy, dangerous actions, thrilling story plots, or interesting twists and turns? Do your favorite books have fun characters, cliff-hanging suspense, and terrorizing danger? If so, then this book is definitely for you.In this book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, search for the Heir of Slytherin and the opening of the Chamber of Secrets. As they run into all sorts of trouble with their school professers and their peers, they will capture your heart with this interesting tale of everything from wizardry to giant spiders. This book is perfect for kids as a read-aloud or for children aged 8 to 12 to read to themselves.I hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"coo"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I choose the book &quot;Harry Potter and the chamber of secerts.&quot; It was about a young wizard who went to a school that was attacked by an evil wizard. I like the book because it made me feel like i was in the story. I aslo like the book because it was hard to put down because it was so unusual and interesting. I would recommend this book to whoever likes books about magic and make belive situations."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"&quot; The Chamber of Secrets &quot; is a book about a wizard named Harry Potter. Who finds out a secret that no one else but the teachers know about, he finds out about the Chamber of Secrets!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The author (J.K. Rowling)has a great imagination. She is a dream maker. That means that she makes anything possible in books. Magic things happen like instant travelling by using a powder (floo powder), games played on magic flying broomsticks(quidditch) cars that fly, owls that deliver mail. Everything, even hats are magical - there is a hat (sorting hat)that chooses to which house the students will belong - Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,Griffindor and Slytherin. There is a complete other world -not the one that we know of.. This book takes you to another world - a magical world.It makes me feel that I am missing out on a lot of fun things. I would like to be Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am starting the third book in the series, practically as I type this. I can't seem to read them all fast enough. I was first introduced to the Harry Potter books by a few of my middle school students. I teach remedial reading and many of my students do not like to read, so I was surprised to hear them raving about these books. I knew I had to check them out, and I'm so glad I did. I recommend them to anyone and everyone, adult and child alike. They are imaginative, fun books that captivate the reader -- you won't be able to put them down until you've finished and then you'll be hungry for more!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book, the second in the Harry Potter series is amazing! J.K. Rowling is so imaginative and creative. If you want a fantasy story that captures your imagination, and has you remembering every single detail, this is the story for you. I recommend this book for anybody, anywhere. If you're 9 or 49 you will love it! I know our entire family does! : )"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was sooooooo good. Any one--kids or adluts would like to add this book to there colection. At the end, it gets a little discusting but other than that, every thing was fine. It did not make me want to go into witchcraft. I found it an enjoyable fantasty read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter Books are all quite good, if not quite as good as their press. Harry Potter himself is an engaging, if not particularly complex, young man, and his collection of friends and enemies at school are, if a bit overly broadly drawn, eminently enjoyable.On the other hand, collectively the books aren't a patch on Diane Duane's Wizard books. (Start with http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0152012397.) Why the Harry Potter books have become modern classics, and the Duane books haven't will remain a mystery.At least to me. Everything that the Harry Potter books do, much juvenile science fiction and fantasy does better, and has done better for a long time. The Heinlein juveniles are simply, in every respect, better books, as are the Duane books.So: read the Harry Potter books; they're good. But don't stop there."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I like this book because it was such an adventure to explorer Harry Potter. It was very interesting. Harry Ron were best friends throughtout the book! Ron was very helpful. All the characters were funny,out going, villains,and all sorts of personalities. I absolutely love this book, I want to read the next one! I rate this book 5 stars because it was excellent!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Dusleys were so mean and hideoous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted to do was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's backing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a stange, impish creacher named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.That is the frist paragraph from the inside cover. I think this book, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, is the best of the first three, on a scale from 1 to 5 I give this book a 12."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Wow. I'm 14 and I enjoy Harry Potter. I must say they are much more enthralling then I had imagined.

JK Rowling is a magnificent writer and I hope to be reading those stories for years to come!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter gets into the most trouble in this book! That is good of course because it means more excitement! The Dursleys surely put this book off to a big BOOM!, then the adventure ride to school gives this book another BANG!, then the magical year at hogwarts sets this book off to a five-star classic!

She attends a private school in the US and knows the difference as Mr. Roger's says between a threat and make believe. She has been glued to the cassette as I was in radio's &quot;Let's Pretend&quot;. This is a first. The book is enjoyable, interesting, and exciting. It would have to in order to hold her interest in a lost art...listening. It has increased our quality time as we listen together and our imaginations soar. Get in audio and welcome back exciting radio."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read the Harry Potter books at first I didn't like them because they seemed to unreal. What are the chances that there are wizards? But the book is great because every night you can read it in bed and it is a nice bed time book because it is almost like a fairy tale. It is so unbeleviable that it is really enjoyable."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"...Well, perhaps they CAN be wrong sometimes, but not in this case. I'd never even *heard* of Harry Potter, but was passing a favorite bookstore and saw it in the window. Having grown up on C.S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, and such novelists, I saw the cover and was instantly drawn in.I was certainly NOT disappointed! Rowling has a way of transcending the barrier between children's fiction and adult fiction. I'm 39 years of age, and an engineer, and I read The Wall Street Journal, but I also highly recommend the Harry Potter series. Even if you don't read them in order, which is how I've done it, you won't be disappointed. Rowling's imagination and wit have no bounds!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is awesome for young adults everywhere, it is one the best book i have ever read considering the other two!!!

I sat down one day and read all the way through in about 4 hours. I have heard a lot of people say that Harry Potter is the writhing of the devil and I could not disagree more. This book is just and innocent childrens' book that triggers the reader's imagination. I am 15 years old and it even interests me, so a little kid would definately like it. I am an avid reader of fictional books and all I can say is that this is one of the best &quot;Wizard&quot; Books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Yes, another winner Harry Potter book! JK Rowling has done it again. I liked the first book a bit better, really only because I liked the story better... but this was another &quot;can't put it down&quot; book. JK Rowling has an incredible knack for being able to plot her stories so well you can never guess the outcome... you may think you have... but then it goes another direction... one you hadn't even considered! The plots are very well thought out and come together flawlessly at the end. After each book, I can't wait for the next! Read book 3 too, you'll LOVE IT! I can't wait for #4.

I have read the first three and I liked this one the best, even though it is a close call. Even though I am not that big on fantasy books, I made an exception for this one. It is a mystery and fantasy that just keeps amazing you after every page. It seems as though the climax starts from the first chapter and you can't put it down until the last page. J.K. Rowling writes incredibly and as you read it you can really relate. Through all of the suspence and amazement she still manages to keep a high level of humor. I highly recomend this book to everyone, all ages, all genders."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What can I say!?!

I was watching Rosie O'Donnell the other day and she was telling her audience how great a book &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is, so I decided to check it out and see if she is telling the truth. Well, I read the book and I absolutely loved it. It was probably my first time ever that I actually finished reading a book in one day. I couldn't put it down. It was full of magic and creativity. The imagination was totally beyond anything I ever watched on television! It took me to a place only I could imagine. It was an excellent book and I absolutely love it. I have all three.~Lori"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was so good i could not put it down. It was much better than the first and i'm getting the third. The only thing I fear is that I once I finish the third I will have to wait for the forth! Hope the third is even better:)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book has lots of magical surprise, twisting and turning endings, and it even gets scary! This is better then the first book! Read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was really surprised when I saw that the age recommendation for all of the HArry Potter books is 9-12. I first saw thses books on Rosie O'Donnel and she loved them. I am assuming she is over 12. And so am and I and all of my friends. I recommended it to almost everyone I talk to. You MUST READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I liked reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. When you read it you can't put it back down, because you want to see what happens next. When I finished the Sorcerer's Stone, I wanted to know when there would be another book out. I read both the books in 2 days each. Now I wish I would have taken more time, because now I can't wait til the next one is out. We bought the books right when they came out. I like the books a lot, and Magic, and mystery in one book are the books I like to read. The books are a must read!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As I read on and on, I was left guessing. When I got to the good part, I read about 25 pages a night! I think it pulled together better than the first one. I couldn't stop reading it until the fierce ending. I can't wait until the third one. It was action-packed,mysterious, scary, eerie, spooky, and fun! The characters were one-of-a-kind, and there's a twist around every corner. it's now my favorate book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Iabousolutly love it.

I was hooked from the begining to the facinating end. I thought the knight bus was a very good idea, and i loved how Harry had to go stay in Diagon Alley. I was over joyed when the weaselys got money, and was very happy when Hagrid got the care of magical creatures job. I think my favorite chapter was the one where Harry got the marauders map. The wizerds town was a wonderful idea! I think i may have another favorite characher in Sirius Black. Read this book as soon as you can."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"its nice too know that i am not adnormal. harry potter, j.k. rawling puts everyday living situations into imaginitive and emotionaly stimulatig read.a story that a 10 year old can not stop reading even in the car."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I had read &quot;Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone&quot; and absolutley loved it, so when I saw this book at are local library, I atomaticly Picked it up.

Boy, were they wrong when they said it was a children's story. This book (this series of books) is appropriate for any age.I loved the 1st book, this (the 2nd) was even better. It kept my interest and I read it over a 3 day period.I have ordered the 3rd already. Can't wait till it gets here. I plan on buying all 7 in the series. These books will definitely be a keeper in my bookshelf. I have been recommending the books to my friends.You won't regret taking the time to read this book. In fact, I am sure it will capture you with their humor, suspense, and story line."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rosie O'Donnell was right! This book is definately not just for kids. I hated putting it down and couldn't wait for my next chance to read. At chapter 4, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.

I can't wait for the next one!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My little sister and I just finished reading it yesterday. It was as good as the first one and a little scarier. I loved Dobby. She liked was when Professor Lockhart lost his memory. I commend Ms. Rowling for her special talent. Thank you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I bought the books as gifts for a 7 year old (advanced child) and 9 year old nephews in Pennsylvania. I couldn't resist, having two grown sons who grew up on Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, and others - I read them. They were wonderful! And I have already given the parents of these two young men a synopsis so that they won't worry - I told them to read them also. Harry Potter, and his trials, will be understood by every age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and I couldn't put it down. But then the second one came along, and after reading that, now I'm obsessed with Harry Potter. Rowling has a good combination of description and dialog. Both books are outstanding, but the first one is a joke compared to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I recommend this book not only to young readers, but adults as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I live in South Africa and I thought the book was great. It's amazing the way J.K. Rowling constructs the world of Harry Potter around you. This book to me was slightly better than &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; as it was longer. I can't wait for 3,4 and 5 to get here."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J. K. Rowling is a wonderful author.

The book is appropriate for any child who can sit and listen. My son learns something now, at the age of six, and will love it when he is 12, from a different prospective. The book also offers me, as a parent, an opportunity to remember how it felt to be a child, and to better relate to my own children. I dread the thought that one day we will finish all three parts (now we are in the middle of the chamber of secrets, and already looking forward the prisoner of Azbakan). enjoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It\`s really great.I like to think about things like that.It\`s fun and exiting.J.K.

Don't let some of the other bad reviews make you not want to read this book. I'm almost 14 and I loved it, and all my friends (10+) who have read it think they are the best books ever also. So do yourself a favor and read this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book.There were so many different mysteries,none of which seemed to relate to each other at first.Then,more connections were made,and finally,at the climax,everything came together.There's not much I can put into words.Want to know anthing more?If so,read it yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When i started to read Harry Potter I just got hooked to it! I couldnt keep my hands off it! It is just so cool that a boy could have the powers of a great wizard and go to a wizard school. I just had to get the second book afterwards. I read both books in about 2-3 days each. I just want to thank J.K. Rowling for her fabulous imaginative book, Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Anyone who works with children should read this book. It has something for everyone! The book is exciting, has a mystery, and involves witchcraft and wizardry. The young Harry Potter returns for his second year at Hogsworth and more trouble! I loved the first book and this one was not a disappointment! I teach English in a low income/gang area in So. Calif, and my students loved both of these books. I use them for read aloud time.

So a few days later may friends came over and asked if i had read the book. I said no and so they told me to read it. I'm sooo glad i did! it was an awsome book. i can't say there's just a few things i liked about this book cause there were like a billion things! Now i have to read the other 2 books cause i read this one first (oopsy)!

And it strikes alright! He and his friends, Ron and Hermoine try to find out who the the Heir of the Slytherin is... It was a such a thrilling book that I couldn't put it down. It is my favorite book so far.By: Harsha Pandurangachool to learn about his true heritage, he makes friends, gets into lots of trouble and has amazing adventures. There has not been such a fabulous series since the late lamented Roald Dahl went to the chocolate factory in the sky. Crammed with humor, poignancy and wonderful characters in the true British style. I only wish that Ronald Searle could have done the illustrations. Thumbs up. *Let's put it this way, Harry's relatives make the family of Dahl's Matilda look good, say no more say no more, nudge nudge wink wink. **I suggest you check out Dobby the house elf, he is a direct descendant of Tolkien's Gollum, besides which you will never feel the same way about lawn gnomes again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is a true hero; full of self-doubt, afraid and alone, he reminds adults and teaches children that anything is possible with a little faith and a few good friends. This book is as good as the first, and my son and I enjoyed it thoroughly - laughing together and guessing what the next chapter would bring each evening. You'll never regret getting these books, and I recommend buying them in hardback, if possible, for your younger children to enjoy later."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone.

I strongly believe that this is the best fantasy book out yet."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book was wonderful. It was a mix of adventure and fantasy, which is a perfect mix for young children. For adults,, it is very intense and the characters intermix. the way the story is twisted together makes you not want to put the book down.. It is an all around great book"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is AWESOME!

Rowling documents Harry Potter's return to Hogwarts school.A wide array of new characters includes Gilderoy Lockhart, the new defense against the dark arts teacher; Dobby, an adorable little house elf. Tom Riddle, the mysterious Hogwarts alumni who provides Harry with clues; not to mention the whole Weasley family, and their flying car! A new mystery awaits Harry upon his return to school, and it is up to Harry, Ron and Hermione to save the school once again, this time from the evil Heir of Slytherin, who has opened the Chamber of Secrets and unleashed a monster on the school. Only in the amazing, spine-tingling climactic scene is his/her identity revealed, and you won't believe who it is. If you liked Harry Potter and the sorceror's stone, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I received this book on Friday afternoon and finished it on Saturday night. I just had to find out how Harry would save Hogwarts again. I have recommended this series to all my school's reading teachers. I know that their students will enjoy these books also. I hope Ms. Rowling will continue the series like The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This second Harry Potter book is quite a bit gloomier than the first. The characters are still exciting. I thought Gilderoy Lockhart was simply snobbish, a man with a huge ego. The Weasley's home is warm and happy; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are hilarious. This story is whimsical and funny, with some doom and gloom thrown in. I thought the fight at the end of the book was really disgusting. Still, I liked this book and will read more Rowling books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this on vacation and finished it in under a day. Harry Returns to hogwarts for another awesome year. A lot of sequeals are bad but this one is awesome."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"i do not think it was a s good as the first one but heres my thoughtsi thought that harry potter and the chamber of secrets was more spookier than the first one but it didn't have as much plot as the first onei could see that harry potter was growing up too fast. 12 years old? give me a break. he looked about 8 and that is my full thoughtthe part that really caught my eye is when herione granger was petrified. that was so sad. but she still was annoying sometimes.when i read the first one, i thought, &quot;i want to pull myself into the magicsl world&quot; but on this one i felt dulli felt this one was a little boring but i liked it i'm giving it 3 stars bye bye"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a thriller! I read it in three nights and i couldnt put it down. J.K. Rowling gave out clues in the story and in the end it all fit together...like a puzzle! I thought this was a WONDERFUL book and so was the Sorceres stone. I cannot wait until i read the Prisoner at Azakaban. Again, this book was heart-pounding and so fun and full of mystery sometimes i wish i was a wizard like him too!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you have purchased the audio tape for any of the HarryPotter novels you would know what i am talking about. &quot;Jim Dale(the narrator) with his fully voiced reading, brings the world of wizards to life in ways unimaged even by those who have read and re-read the book&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an astounding novel by J.K Rowling!

I HIGHLY recommend this book to all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In this book, there are great adventures and a big surprise at the end! This book was written very well and I think you should get this book and you would give it 5 stars too! Each book from here only gets better!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second Harry Potter book is my favorite. J.K. Rowling is a teriffic author. The characters are excellent (I like the Weasly twins the best). After being visited by a mysterious house elf named Dobby, Harry escapes the Dursleys and goes to Ron's for the rest of the summer. He and Ron end up flying to Hogwarts in a car and crashing into the Whomping Willow. Then, Harry stars hearing voices. Several Hogwarts students are turned to stone. The Heir of Slytherin is behind this all and only he can open the Chamber of Secrets and control the Monster of Slytherin. Whodunit? Could it be Hagrid, whose past is revealed? Could it be Draco Malfoy, Harry's rival and the most malicious boy at Hogwarts? Or could it be Harry Potter himself? What is the monster? Could it be Norbert Hagrid's beloved dragon? Could it be Aragog, the giant spider, or something worse..... To find out, you'll have to read Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, if you dare!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":".Even though I missed the quidditch matches and the more intricate look at Harry's friendships that were in book 1, this book still far surpasses it in overall draw and excitement. I now longer wish I was still a kid, because now I can fully enjoy the books at my age. No wonder they're so beloved!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"So far i have read all three book from harry potter and let me tell you that since i was born i had been looking for books like this ones that could transport my imagination to a magic and wisdom kingdom.

Out of all 3 books my favorite one has to be Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Chamber of Secrets is more action-packed then the first one. If you enjoyed the first one then you'll love the 2nd one! Everyone suspects Harry as the heir of Salzaar Slytherin after a suprising Dueling Club lesson. Pretty soon muggle-born students are being attacked! Including one of Harry's best-friends...Hermione! Can Harry solve the problem before a muggle-born is killed? Find out...once again, if you loved the 1st one you'll definately love the 2nd one!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really like this version (paperback) of harry Potter.

This time with Ron's little sister Ginny who gets to attend Hogwarts for the first time! An exciting time that Harry and his friends got to experience in the first book. They are on a new adventure as Harry tries to further unravel the mystery that is his life before he started living with his horrid Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and his foul cousin Vernon. J.K. Rowling weaves a story that is just as good the hundredth time you read it as it was the first time you ever read it! I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read that will carry you away on a very good adventure!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter has never been accused of being a Nobel Prize contender, but I firmly believe that not every book has to be. Harry Potter is quite entertaining, however. I downed the entire book in one day because I couldn't stop turning the pages.In Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, something at Hogwarts has been turning those closest to Harry into stone. There is an addictive quality to Harry Potter that just sucks the reader in. I kept turning the page, trying desperately to put the pieces together to figure out just who was turning people into stone.Pacing is Rowling's ultimate gift because she gives the reader pieces of the story puzzle, but not enough where the reader finds the ending tired and predictable. Can't wait to read more!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a good improvement on book one of the series. JK Rowling's writing has gotten a little better since Sorcerer's Stone but the plot is less interesting. I became somewhat bored during most of the book and was only entertained during the ending. Nonetheless, it was a good book. Chamber of Secrets is my second-to-last least favorite of the Harry Potter series.Zachary B.

This book is a MUST read, so put it on your wish list!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book was great. There was mystery and adventures and jokes, but it lacked the magic and suspense the first book contained. The ending wasn't that surprising and it looked liked the author had no idea how to finish the story. Although I liked the first book better, this book is worth a read for the understanding of this series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was excellent! Everyone must read these Harry Potter books they are unlike any book ever written. They are the best books i have ever read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am convinced that Rowling is one of the most talented storytellers ever existed. Her style resembles that of Steven King, but a bit more sophisticated. If you are a grown-up and think that Harry Potter is for children, that is not quite the case: adults can enjoy reading Rowling, too!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. It was so astonishing. I could not put it down. I love the unforgetable characters and the mishaps they have every second. J.K. Rowling has created magic herself in writing the Harry Potter series. To whomever hasn't read a copy of any books, in the seris, I suggest they run out and find the first copy they can grab!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This Harry Potter book was the only one I read but it was a good book.It surprised me in many ways.I liked how the author gave each character a unique name or how she gave the friends something in common but at the same time they were different.The character that I like was Ron Weasley because he had a rat as a pet and he seems like if he was a real person he would be a good friend.I also like his dad because he wasn't use to the mortal world so he was intrested in every little thing about what Harry did."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"... and let me tell you some things about them: for the people that say that HP always needs somobody's elses help to get rescued, from this book on this happens less and less; for the person who says that children may think it's ok to break the rules becuase HP always does it, maybe she could be right, but I would say it's a perfect oportunity to get close you your children and explain that they can always come to you when they are in trouble, nowadays kids need to trust their parents, (I'm going to say something that happens in the book now), if Harry has told Dumbledore what was hapenning and asked him for help he wouldn't have broken any rules, of course there wouldn't have been any story either.After saying that, now I can tell you that this book is easy to read, has a great adventure in it, will have you in suspense all the way to the end when you will find out that the least you were expecting to happen does. In a few words is one of the best fantasy novel books I've read in my life and they keep getting better.You just can't deprive yourself and/or your children of it, you'll have a lot of fun reading it(them) and if you do the same thing I did (buy all four of them toguether) is very likely you'll read them in less than a couple of weeks as I did."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is the most thrilling book I've ever read.

Once again JK Rowling shows what a great imagination she has in creating the stories and the world of Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is an amazing second book in one of the best all around series ever written. I cannot recommend this highly enough. It is a must read for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Read this book (and the series) over and over and it gets better each time! Can't get enough of Harry potter!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Such a good book love it. Every books is better than the last I 're read them twice a year it was sad when the series endedwish there was more in the harry potter world"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Love this series. Would recommend it to everyone. Great for all ages. A classic. I'm collecting all the hardcover books for my family to enjoy for generations."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Very interesting and entertaining! !!! You will laugh and cry with the main characters! It's worth reading it! I recommend buying it"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Like most of the Harry Potter books, there is a slow start. So for readers who would rather have a fast book from the get go, I do not recommend it. I do say that most fantasy lovers should get their muggle hands on this series. It is a good series with mystery in every book. The plot occasionally twists and turns and gives the reader a bit of a surprise.Now about the book. The story takes place in England in pretty recent times. In this book, right from the beginning, we meet the loyal house elf named Dobby. Dobby is a character that is seen many times throughout the series, and that most Harry Potter fans grow to love. Through the story, the reader can feel the feelings of the main character as it is described. If you are a reader looking for a good read with action, hope, mystery, fear, betrayal,and have been prevously introduced to the series, then grab your reading lights and grab this book. Rowling has blow my socks off with these books and will happily read these books anyday."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Personally I enjoy Book 1 more. I think Book 2 has a slow start. The story doesn't really get to the guts of the book until the second half. Then it starts to pick up. I like the very end the most. Overall I still enjoy reading it (compared to Book 1) and do admire the very innovative imagination of the author."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The first Harry Potter book suffered from an aimless narrative that, while fun to read, more or less served as a simple introduction into the world of Hogwarts and its students. With &quot;The Chamber of Secrets,&quot; Rowling continues what she began in the last installment, but this time around she makes substantial improvements to the formula to garner some weight to what many may dismiss as a children's story.Much of the wonder that the first book elicited is now gone--but only because we've already been introduced to the sport of Quidditch, the living paintings of Hogwarts, and the moving staircases that make getting to class on time a contemptible ordeal. Rowling takes the care this time around to paint a more vivid image of the new settings she introduces on Harry's second school year, making the world feel more natural, and making us, in turn, more envious of the luck that Harry, Ron and Hermione have to be part of all these wonderfully whimsical events.The major improvement here is that every last detail given serves to advance the plot in some form or another. There's practically no pacing problems as in the first novel, and the stronger brand of humor that's infused into just about all situations makes for a quicker, more enjoyable read.And of course, there's a much sharper sense of poignancy this time around--it's hard to believe how these characters can just keep getting better and better.Of course, Rowling's not quite at the top of her game until the third novel. But this is a fantastic follow-up that manages to outdo the original, and once you get your hands on it, it's hard to put this series down."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is exciting and full of magic. Harry Potter is a twelve year old boy who lives with hi9s mean aunt and uncle in number four Privet drive. He is going back to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. for his second year. People at his school are being attacked and blaming Harry. If you want a good book that is full of action read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a great book. another fantastic harry potter book. what's Harry to do when an elf says he cant go back to Howgwarts, the only place he ever enjoys himself? Who is commiting the attacks on other students at Howgwarts? Fingure it all out by reading this intensley wonderful story. SO much to read and discover! BELIEVE ME! I know you'll love it, no matter what you think of harry potter. Worth all of the galleons, sickles and knuts in Diagon alley!!!(...) Do by it! You'll adore it. (...) I KNOW THESE THINGS! :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In the book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets written by J.K. Rowling, we get an inside look at the life of the main character Harry Potter, a young wizard. The story takes place over a span of one year and is set at the school Hogwarts. After a long summer with the horrid Dursleys, Harry's atempt to catch the train to Hogwarts also fails. He is now left only with the transportation of a magical flying car, and it is just his luck to run into a valuable Whomping Willow. It only gets worse. Through the halls of Hogwarts, Harry hears voices from the walls that only he is capable of hearing. Harry feels that it is his eveil enemy Draco Malfoy trying to get him. Soon the entire school is worried about survival at Hogwarts. One day there is a writing on the wall saying, &quot;The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir Beware.&quot; Harry and his friends Hermoine and Ron do everything possible to figure out what this mean and to see who the heir is. This novel left me in suspense the entire time I was reading because I never knew what was going to happen. As in her first book, Rowling writes with a combination of suspense and imagination which will leave the reader yearning to read more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"it keepedt you reading and wondering who opened the chamber"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I\`m sure anyone would like this book. It\`s like you\`re in the story as you\`re reading it. I would suggest this book to anyone. Harry couldn\`t stand living with the Dursleys. (I\`m sure it would be a pain for you too). You'll have to read it to find out what the Weasley's are driving around town these days. Strange things are happening at Hogwart's and not a soul knows who did it. Someone is stopping Harry\`s birthday letters and Harry thinks his friends don\`t care about him. If I would say, It\`s a great sequal to Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone. When you\`re done with this review go ask your mom or dad or gaurdian to go to the book store and get this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book follows gracefully after &quot;Sorcerer's Stone.&quot;After finishing the first book in two days I settled myself down for the second book with great expectations, J.K. Rowling did a wonderful job in exceeding them.It also links you up with my other favorite characters Hermoine (Hermoninny as we fondly call her after the 4th book) Granger, and Ron Weasly.If you liked the first book, I sincerely recommend you read the second in this delightful series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really enjoyed reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I liked it because it was one of thoes books where it's good from the first page all the way to the last word. Some books I read and it doesn't really get into the plot until half ways through the book. Another thing I enjoyed about this book was that after reading it I went back and looked at the front cover and the pictures that are on the page when you start a new chapter, and it looks just like how I read it. This book really got exciting in the last fifty pages or so, because Harry was finally going to do what he has been planning in his summer at Hogwarts. I wouldn't suggest reading this book until you have read Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is magical and utterly spell-binding! It's even better than the Sorcerer's Stone and the plot here is more complex. What a great read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was was not the greatest book Ive read but its ok .Harry Potter did not give me a good picture of how he felt .Some people in the story were boring."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Fellow readers, I think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a good book, although J.K. Rowling could have been more discriptive about the snake and the phoenix while they were in the chamber. Only a genius could think of Hogwarts and the discriptions of the old building was brilliant. But in the first book when it said the Snape had saved Harry's life it didn't say how he saved him which didn't make it very interesting towards the end I lost interest"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I had to send this item back because it was cassette not CD as the other set that I bought and there was not a cassette player in the car."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I like the Harry Potter books, but I'm not one of those fans who camp out overnight to get the next book. I only started reading them like two years ago. It surprised me to see that a lot of the characters are pretty stereotyped (which a lot of authors do), like Malfoy, as Harry's rival, being evil to everyone and all the Gryffyndors (sorry, don't know how to spell it) hating him. The houses themselves are stereotyped: all the Slytherins are bad, all the Gyrffyndors are good. Yawn.But I thought that the writing and the storyline was pretty good, and I was hooked on it to the end, even though it was long. The only thing I do have a problem with is people saying that the things like Mandrakes and basilisks are Rowling's inventions. Some of the creatures she uses (not all of them) are in fantasy creature books, and mythology, too.These are good books, but I'm not sure that they're worth all the publicity that they get. Sure, I'd suggest picking them up and reading them, but I wouldn't go to the bookstore at 3 AM to get the newest one. They're not really that outstanding, but maybe it's just me. Four and a half stars is my rating."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book was alright. I am not big on the magic stuff so i didn't really follow too much on the wierd words that make stuff float. the plot was good with plenty of leading turns which cause you to wonder and second guess all thatr you have concluded. the one good thing about this book is it really shows the true value of a good friendship and teamwork."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter series has received so much media endorsement that it has attained a kind of god-like status. When you actually strip away all the hype you are essentially left with a basic story that lessons. No thought provoking concepts, just lessons that could be similarly acquired through watching any cartoon on Nickalodeon. The author, while demonstrating she does have a good command of the english language, has simply produced a work so devoid of content, that any ten year old could have conceptualized it.Bottom line: the Harry Potter books are rudimentary stories that have no value beyond entertainment. If you realize this and still choose to allow your children to read them, wonderful. Just be aware that there is nothing in these books that can't be gleaned from a few sessions in front of the tv. It's still the same garbage that media titans have been cramming down the throats of our children for decades. The only thing innovative is the new techniques they use to perpetrate their massive indoctrination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I first read this book I was &quot;in love&quot;. Now I think back and think, What catches people? I would like to say J.K. Rowling presents a fine problem, and her plot isn't weak. But the rest of the book is to predictable. Leave Harry to others, for me, I'll take the Lord of the Rings!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Oh dear...where should I begin? To be honest, the 1st half of this book just isn't that exciting - if not boring - compare to the 1st book.I can only read so much about Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's abuse to Harry - it's just not very intesting - I'm sorry.The 2nd half things begin to pick up, I only wish JKR wrote the 1st half more exciting..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a great book, however if you are looking for a complete set of the HP books in hardcover this is not the version to buy. This version has a very poorly made hard cover with no sleve and is much smaller then the hardcover version of the later books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love this book but there is better HP books.Here are the details of this book:1- Ginny Weasley comes to Howarts.2- A muggle-born student chase Harry with a camera.3- Students turn into stone.4- Harry and Ron flies a car to Hogwarts.5- Harry gets a new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher named Professor Lockhart.6- Harry and Ron uses the Polyjuice Potion.7- Hermoine turns into a cat."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets made me feel like kid again if you are interested in mysteries and fantasy then this is the right book for you this book is for all ages if you have a young one then you can read them the story around bed time"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was absolutely great. A great second book to entice anybody into a continuation for the rest of the series. By no means have these books taken over my life...that would be a lie!

Tolkien: The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition) Fiftieth (50th) EditionThe Hobbit"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is a bit darker than the first book. It was okay, but it almost made me lose interest in reading the rest of the series, but I think I'll continue on with it anyway. I liked the parts where Harry speaks Parsel Tongue, but I hated the giant snake altogether. Rowling did a great job with description because I had no trouble imagining the snake and it's sounds; it's just not my cup of tea. I like Harry's relationship with his friends and I'd like to know a bit more about the lives of his enemies. I look forward to finishing the rest of the series because I really want to read Deathly Hallows."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The story starts off with Harry stuck at the Dursley's house and for his birthday. They get so mad at the boy they lock him away in this room for the rest of the summer. I know, crazy right? But of course Ron comes to the rescue for Harry and they go back to the Wesley household. From there on out the Harry, Ron, and Hermione start another fabulous adventure, all the while learning about some of the past. The key to want will become information in how \\"thou shall not be named\\" makes his return!I read this book over 10 years ago. I have yet to re-read it but that is one of my goals in the next six months; to re-read the entire first four books of the series and try to finish the 5th one as well. I never read the last two, but I heard they are amazing! One good reason for my to dive right back into the wonderful series.Anyway, I was just a 'tween' when I started the series back in 1999. I ate up the first one faster than I've ever read anything in my entire life! The 2nd book didn't stand a chance when my mother bought it for me. The way the story makes you feel, as though you are really there, immersed in this magical world. It's a priceless piece of imagination that no other series has done in the last 20+ years for children and everyone else of all ages.I'd recommend this book, of course, to those that read the first book. But also to those that haven't read the first two. I'd give them both to someone who loves the read and take a truly amazing journey with books.J.K. Rowling is simply a visionary in story telling. I wish she would maybe write a pre-quel to the books about maybe how things began or how Harry's parents were as teenagers at Hogwarts. I think that other fans of the series would love that too, mostly due to the fact that on 'Pottermore' she explains some backstory information. Some of that included that his Aunt Petunia, she is Harry's mother's Sister, which meant she is a witch herself! She denied her magical side and well ended up marring Veron, a muggle, and had a very boring life. This means his cousin Dudley is half muggle and doesn't know about it. Things like that could make a very lovely story! But alas Rowling doesn't want to write anymore of the 'Harry Potter' world.So in conclusion, if you haven't read the series, you may want to or wait, because next year for the first time ever, the eBooks will be available. So no matter how you decide to read it, this series isn't one to miss, especially this one from the series![...]"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When the Harry Potter series first came out I vowed I would not jump on the Harry-bandwagon and read these books with my son's. When my middle son was diagnosed with dyslexia, my stance changed to anything that would get him to read, I was willing to try.After watching the movies, he fell in love with Harry and wanted to read. I was ecstatic and together we cuddled up on the couch and entered the amazing world of Hogwarts! The book draws you in from the very first page. You can't help but want to see what happens next. Each chapter introduces you to new characters, spells, intrigue, danger, and adventure. The story is non-stop action, a page-turner. The worst part of the book, is getting to the last page. It is also the best as you know there are more books to come.I now have a voracious reader in the house that is reading above grade level. I would recommend these to anyone who has a child who hates to read and needs something to hold their attention. I have recommended this book to hundreds of students who were once reluctant to read and now they can't put down books. My one problem is what to read after the series is completed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book 2 in the Potter series is a fun, fantastical story of make believe. The tale involves wacky wizardry and witchery as Hogwarts faces a foe unlocked from the Chamber of Secrets after 50 years. The drama threatens Hogwarts very existence and the life of Harry and his friends. Harry will again be thrust into a duel with a deadly foe.The writing is creative and the book is an excellent follow up to book 1. The dangers the kids face seem extreme for an academy and excessive for likes of Dumbledore to abide as headmaster. It seems that the professors at Hogwarts would have a better handle on their domain...snakes, spiders and the unseemly Syltherins seem a bit dark to be given reign."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets is a great book for all kinds of people, adults and kids! It is the 2nd book in the 7 book series, Harry Potter. Harry is a wizard who's invited to attend Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. Hogwarts is in a valley by a lake and is enchanted so if a human (wizards call them \`Muggles') sees it, it appears as old ruins. Strange attacks are happening at the school and people are becoming petrified. Harry's friend Hermione becomes petrified by a beast called a basilisk. Harry enters the chamber with his friend Ron and professor Lockhart to try and stop the attacks. Will he make it out of the chamber in one piece? This is thrilling all the way through it.

It sets up the series to continue so perfectly, while actually giving closure at the end--something few series books are able to accomplish well. At the end of the book I was eager for more, but satisfied at the same time.As far as the Harry Potter series is concerned, I think this book is right in the middle with the first book being only slightly better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is really addicting, and not the bad kind of addicting either. It is a wonderful tension-trigger. As soon as I started this book, I fell in love with it. I read it when mom wasn't looking and in the car. During piano lessons and when I was supposed to be asleep. I really liked it. This book is really good and action-packed. I would highly reccomend this book for anyone. But beware, it's addictive! (but not the bad kind!) :-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was the best book of the Seres. J.K Rowling writing just keeps your head in the book. My eyes were in the were book from start to finish. I didnt miss a word while reading it. Harry's second year at hogwarts was the most exiting for hogwarts. Him seeing who should not be named for the first time. And the three headed dog garding the door. It sounded mean. Well I highly recommened this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book was a slightly deeper than the first. I found myself very frustrated with the first several chapters. Rowling must feel compelled to build artificial review of the first book's concepts and ideas so that readers won't become lost. This makes it somewhat possible to read the second book without having read the first, but why would anyone do that? Tolkien never felt this kind of review was necessary. I think he was able to assume that a reader would be able to bridge between the first and second books without a review. Once we got out of the first chapters, and the story picked up again with the second year, things got better. I've now seen all the movies and they are motivating me forward in the series too. So, I'll keep going for now. I'd give the second book three stars just like the first."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is one of the scariest Harry Potter books yet to me.

While people are being paralyzed from a basilisc, the creature who lives in the chamber, Harry must find a way into the chamber. When he does, he finds Tom Riddle there.

This book was just as wonderful as the first, and in some respects I think it was better (the key phrase there was &quot;in some respects). I don't care what kind of books you like, everyone must read this book!!!! My sister hates fantasy, but now really wants to read my copies of the Harry Potter duo (soon to be more than that!). YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"An outstanding book. The characters are charismatic and quirky. I enjoyed the roller coaster of events that kept this book moving. Very ingenious to have a book for this age group which doesn't involve women in hoop skirts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I purchased the first book for my grandchildren, and found myself enchanted by it. A must read for children young and old. the second in this series is as delightful as the first. Don't hesitate to read this just because it is a &quot;childrens book&quot; it is much more than that."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is perhaps the least impressive of all the Harry Potter books. The novel is still one of the very best of the genre, but compared to the other books in the series, Chamber of Secrets felt rushed and was less in depth than what we expect from these books.The earlier Harry Potter books are much shorter than the final four in the series. While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone managed to make the very post of it's page count, Chamber of Secrets seemed to focus more on plot progression than the wonderful details we loved in the first book. The story was very fast paced. It had to be to fit a story with so much action into such a small space. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a consistently thrilling adventure, but I would have loved if we could have explored Hogwarts and the rest of the magical world in as much detail as in Sorcerer's Stone.During my re-read of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I was struck by just how protective Fred and George seem to be of both Harry and their family. On first reading, all I could see what their face value of irresponsible jokesters. I felt like I saw them much more clearly this time around and loved all the things that showed them to be deeper than they first appeared.While Ginny did appear in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, we really get to know her better in Chamber of Secrets. I loved how clearly unsure of herself she was, especially with what we know of her in later books. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets really sets of the basis from which Ginny grows from.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is most likely my least favorite of all the Harry Potter books, but even being my least favorite of the series, it still gets my highest rating. This book is absolutely necessary to the story as a whole and while not the best of the series, is still well beyond most books of its kind."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is very good.It makes me feel like I want magic to be real and go into the magic world.Harry faces a basilsk at the end of the book.He finds the real chamber of secrets inside Moaning Myrtle's bathroom underneath the sink.The chamber is hidden inside the pipes.What a great book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"\\"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\\"- Albus Dumbledore, p. 333After \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" delighted readers at the close of the twentieth century, its sequel was highly anticipated. It could have fallen flat, disappointed many, or just plain stunk. But \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\", the second book in J.K. Rowling's fantasy adventure series, is none of those things. It is engaging, intriguing, and a bit scary.This novel revolves around several themes: frienship, gossip, fame, and loyalty. After a house-elf named Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry is devastated. After all, Hogwarts is much better than his \\"home\\" with his horrid aunt, uncle, and cousin Dudley. But there are strange things happening at the school this year. Students are being petrified, a cat is attacked, and Harry is hearing strange voices that may mean he can communicate with snakes. Someone has opened the dreaded Chamber of Secrets, and gossip around the school states that it is Harry himself who is causing the problems. Can he stop the culprit before it is too late?It was wonderful to see so many beloved characters from the first book make their return - the awful Professor Snape, Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy, along with Harry's best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger. However, this book also features some great new characters, from a ghost in the girls' bathroom named Moaning Myrtle to a vain (and incompetent) professor Gilderoy Lockhart.Is this novel darker than its predecessor? Absolutely. As Harry is growing up, we see him having to make more difficult decisions. But it is always nice to see him try to do the right thing. I had originally read it nearly a decade ago, but \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" still has me hooked every time I open it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The important theme of this book is the same as the first, you need to rely on others and trust in them, if they are trustworthy. This theme is expressed when Harry finds the diary of Tom Riddle, who turns out to be a younger version of the Dark Lord, Voldemort, he does not trust his friends enough to tell them about it. This ends up creating a disaster for the whole school.This quote is significant to the theme because it shows how Harry believes in Dumbledore and believes Dumbledore is telling the truth. Harry ends up trusting in his friends and Dumbledore more and more, \\"The Sorting Hat only put me in Gryffindor,\\" said Harry in a defeated voice, because I asked not to go in Slytherin.\\" \\"Exactly,\\" said Dumbledore, beaming once more, \\"which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\\" I believe that is true because Harry has shown true bravery throughout his experience at Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What I Loved: The friendships! G. Lockheart (just because he was fabulously stupid) and Snape (which I read every scene he is in with a different perspective than the first time). I loved when Harry got a name to being able to talk to snakes and also got a history lesson on why it was not looked at kindly.What I Liked: The more description we get of Hogwarts and how the school is run. I could probably say this about this exact same thing about the first 4 books but I really do think it adds a lot to the story. You realize that school is very important and that the lessons are for life!Why I gave it a 4: This book had one of my favorite silly characters in G. Lockheart. Is he good? No. Is he evil? Not really. Is he fun to read? Absolutely! I must add I thought he was brilliantly acted in the film too :)Who would I recommend it too: Honestly, anyone. This is a magical story for people of all ages.This is one of my favorite series to read and love my annual re-reading of them. If you are one of the few that have not read the books--you really should whether your young or young at heart![...]Read Again: 11/02/2010 (Watched the Movie again 10/27/2010)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter audio books are a must listen.

Affording one of these audiobooks isn't too much of a financial stretch, but starting a collection, however, can leave you searching for loose change.

Instead of a fascinating opening to a new world with detailed character descriptions and imaginative situations, this edition cuts straight to the chase with nothing more than &quot;special effects&quot;. How many more times can Harry escape a narrow death? After giant spiders and snakes, how much gorier and scarier can the monsters get? The characters from the original story make a token appearance at best, with only a few new ones added. One of these is Ginny Weasley, youngest sister to Harry's best friend, who forms the basis for this plot. The responsible villain, which first appeared 50 years ago, kidnaps her leading Harry to (yet another) show-down with predicatable results. One rather worrisome plot twist: 50 years ago, another girl was perished at the hands of this same perpetrator, but instead of this being a tragedy, she is reborn as a ghost of the girl's bathroom nicknamed Moaning Myrtle and played for laughs. Why is that funny, when the kidnapping of Ginny is a near tragedy? There are a few nice imaginative touches, such as life with the Weasley family, but by in large readers might as well buy themselves another edition of &quot;Goosebumps&quot;."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read the first HP and thought. Huh? No big deal. Then I thought maybe I was mistaken and read the second and this is even less of a big deal. OK, I suppose kids with a short attention spann like all those things going on and it's probably great fun for them but as an adult (and after all, all these reviews seem to be from adults)I find it extremely shallow. I think the difference is this: Potters magic relates simply to changing things: this turnesinto that, cars can fly, and so on. But as I said, HP probably greatfor kids, obviously, they love it and I don't want to spoil their fun. But I would advise adults to look futher, deeper: magic isn't just hocus-pocus, abracadabra!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As a gift, my 12 year old son received this book from an incredibly excited nonparent relative. YIPEE, I decried, a bestseller for this age group during the summer. Excitedly, I drooled it toward said almost 13 year old male with poor track record of reading and sat with beated breath at his reaction. Okay, he liked it at first, second, and third, but amongst the sincerity of my prodding, it was still a 'chore'. So, the reader of all that I profess to be, I 'announced' that I would read the book myself. (As a reader, 2+ novels per week, 5- hours of sleep, 12+ hrs of work, single parent). I found it quite lulling in content, not cohesive in subject matter, leading from one scenario to another without obvious motivation from characters who were mostly characatures. Although visibly charming and inately cunning and sneaky, paths were not completed and the train of thought was at best, colorful, imaginative, but murky. The 'hype' with these books is just that. Some kids will like them,some adults will, but they are simply books with kids in mind. I think what we are missing in this is that kids have the right 'not to like a book' and not be regressed to the fact that 'everyone likes this book, even adults' so you have to! Desperate for reading material, my son just started a novel I have been reading for the past week and loves it. Let's not prototype our kids or our reading. These are great books to great audiences. POINT: ANY BOOK APPEALS TO ANY PERSON. THE MAIN THEME OF LITERACY IS THE CHOICE, OR LACK OF THAT ANY READER CHOOSES TO NOD THEIR RESPECTIVE INTELLECT TOWARD AT ANY GIVEN TIME OR SPACE. I did not like the book. My son did not like the book. THIS IS OKAY!!@!!!!! We read it and will read much more. Kids, expand your reading choices and do not be lead into pathways of 'bestsellers'.

Well Harry potter and the chamber of secrets was on New York's best time sellers list in 1998. It is the 2nd book out of a series of 4 books. The 1st 2 books were so popular they made them a movie.Harry Potter (the main character) lives with his aunt petunia, Uncle Vernon, and his cousin Dudley because his parents died. The last year he found out that he is a wizard and had been accepted to Hogwarts the best wizardry school.This year he had been visited by a house elf named dobby. Dobby tells Harry that he must not go back to Hogwarts because He- who- must- not- be- named will get Harry and kill him. Dobby does something horrible to a guest of his Uncle Vernon. Harry is blamed for it and he is locked up in his room so he can't return to Hogwarts.Harry's friend Ron is worried about Harry because he hasn't returned any responses from Harry. Ron and his 2 brothers come to Harry's Rescue in a flying car. They get Harry and return to Ron's house. Ron's mother is furious, because her 3 sons had left the house with no note and a missing car, but she is very happy to see Harry because she has been worried about him as well as the rest of the family. Hermione write Ron and Harry asking if they got Harry out O.K. and how she can't wait to see them at school.Harry and Ron have trouble getting to the school. They get to the school and nearly get expelled. But some things from the past are coming back and are putting the students in real danger. As usual Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in the mess. They know they shouldn't be doing this but Harry doesn't want with his uncle, aunt, and cousin. Harry is determined to try and save Hogwarts.

Hey, I've never read it but I'm smart enought to know that basically every single adult in every single country in the world enjoys Harry Potter and reads it to their seven year old children who enjoy it too and what parent would let their child read a violent book that they thought shouldn't be read at school or at home. I'm now changing my mind. I will change the 1 star to 2 out of pity for all those heartfelt fans who are not allowed to read the books anymore because of some people! I admit, I'm a kid, but the stupidest kid in the world is smarter then all you adults who think Harry Potter shouldn't be read at school! None of the kids in my school deal with this problem, they're allowed to read it. But other schools in the US can't and I'm complaining on behalf of them.

If you read the 2nd book first, you will have NO idea what's going on like who the Dursley's are. This is a book especially for you if you love magic, humor, and wizard. But I'm warning you, if you gross out on stuff easily, be ready for what's coming. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets has quite a bit of gore in it. But it still is an absolutely WONDERFUL book!

There is one thing I reccomend, though. Have a piece of paper handy to write down any little detail. It just might come in handy. Take the little brown package, or Quirrel's turban, for instance.

It's been several years since I first read the book, and on reading it a second time, it was like reading it anew all over again. I forgot how good it was. Full of new surprises and new revelations about the magical world of witches and wizards."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"You have to wonder how a person such as J.K. Rowling spent her time prior to writing these books. I gather she was divorced, raising a small son (in a stroller) and writing in a local cafe. How did she go as long as she did without anyone knowing about the talent she had? Didn't anyone in her school (perhaps a teacher) notice the skill and imagination that goes into her writing? Well, anyway, on to the discussion of the book.In this second installment in the series, Harry Potter is now on summer break, staying with his aunt and uncle, and their fat and horribly spoiled son. The Dursleys (their son is named Dudley, of all things) hate Harry, the memory of his parents, and all things magical, so naturally they keep their nephew in a closet under the stairs. When Harry escapes their clutches the second time, to visit friends first and then go back to Hogwarts, the magic college, the adventure begins.There are mysterious things going on, though. A house elf tries to stop Harry from returning to Hogwarts, and when he arrives back at school, almost immediately students begin to appear, petrified, literally almost turned to stone. Harry's mysteriously attacked while playing Quidditch, his favorite game. And he has the start of an annoying occurence, a fan club. Even worse, there's a fraudulent wizard at the school who's supposed to be teaching \\"Defense against the Black Arts\\" and instead is mainly interested in increasing his own popularity and signing copies of his best-selling books.The adventure is fun, the characters are interesting, and you can see where parts of it are taken from other classics, reworked, and incorporated into the story. One odd note, which detracts (I think, anyway) from the British feel of the story. The spelling and punctuation are Americanized, for some reason. I'm not sure why someone would bother with this. Perhaps it's because the book's mostly for children? Regardless, I enjoyed it a great deal anyway."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I first read Chamber of Secrets hot on the heels of finishing The Sorceror's Stone (book 1 in the Harry Potter series). I had run into a bookstore during a layover at an airport to buy Chamber of Secrets because I knew that I'd be finishing Sorceror's Stone by the time I reached my final destination. Down went one book and up came the other and I was transported straight back into Harry's world.The Chamber of Secrets opens, like with all other Harry books so far, at the Dursleys. Fearful of his magical abilities, the Dursleys have locked all of Harry's things away for the summer. Not only that but none of his so-called friends have been writing to him. Harry is miserable. Just when he thinks things can't get worse he gets a strange visitor warning him that he mustn't return to Hogwarts that year because dreadful things are planned!Of course Harry can't stay with the Dursleys - that is a fate worse than death so off to Hogwarts he tries to go. But something is wrong - why can't he get on the train with his friend Ron? When he does get to school, dreadful things really do start to happen. Filch's cat, the Gryffindor house ghost - even some of his best friends have a very mysterious fate in store! Worse than that - much of the school suspects Harry of being involved. It's up to him to get to the root of the trouble and he's sure the answer lies with his nemesis, Draco Malfoy.This is a better book than the first - though with the Harry Potter books, they are really in a class of their own. We get into the action much quicker this time - in fact, out of all of the books, this is really the most action packed. We also start to meet more of the wizarding world - including some interesting creatures, his best friend Ron's house and an extremely over the top Defect Against the Dark Art's teacher who might not be all he makes himself out to be. We also find out more about Harry - was he really supposed to be in Gryffindor and why is he so like Salazar Slytherin himself?I suggest you read these books in the order they were written - so read The Sorceror's Stone first. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I breezed through CHAMBER OF SECRETS almost with a sense of urgency. I wanted to read what was going to happen next, and I was never bored. As soon as I finished I picked up the third Harry Potter book and began reading it. This reaction pretty much describes the strength of the book and the series (at least thus far) - it is compelling, interesting and entertaining.I liked that CHAMBER OF SECRETS made use of stories, powers and characters mentioned in the first Potter book but in a more expanded way here. I'm never a fan of inventing something new to get a character out of a situation. That happens to some extent near the end of CHAMBER OF SECRETS, but the book is stronger when Harry's ability to speak with snakes comes in handy and is explained further, Hagrid's past plays a key plot role and Percy the prefect subtly falls under suspicion. In each case, these things first appeared in HARRY POTTER AND THE SORUCER'S STONE. On the other hand, Tom Riddle, the sword of Gryffindor and the phoenix seem introduced to explain away situations that can't be explained with already-introduced elements.Some other things I don't like about this book (and the first) - Harry's distrust of authority, while perhaps true to form for a child, is annoying. When Dumbledor asks him if he has anything to tell him, Harry withholds key information, but when his abck is up against the wall, he trusts in Dumbledor's promise. What's the message here? Be distrustful of adults unless there's no choice?Also, poor Draco Malfoy never even temporarily gets a leg up. Harry's one-upping Malfoy has become boring because Malfoy never takes the lead, never pulls one over on Harry, and never does a bad deed that goes unpunished.Similarly, the return of Voldemort is something of a disappointment. How many times will Harry beat him? Pretty soon, Voldemort will cease being intimidating.Finally, the ending, like the ending of the first book, is too good. Like the repeated defeat of Voldemort, repeated all-out happy endings lose their excitement after a while.None of these problems take away from the book's pace. Despite its flaws, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is awfully fun."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"...i am drawn into a world of majesty and magic, leaving the Muggle existance behind with something akin to joy. Harry Potter & The Chamber Of Secrets is every bit as enjoyable, mysterious, fast paced and well plotted as the firt novel was, if not even moreso, and the action/adventure quotient is stepped up a few notches. In this book, death is mentioned as though it may actually occur, and again, Harry, Ron and Hermoine come into their own as shining examples of what truely great characterization is. We learn here that Harry is a lot more in touch with his mysterious past than even he thought, that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named takes a back seat this time around to a far more sinister being, that Hagrid isn't quite what he seems, he and his dark past,and that in the end, selflessness and faith in onesself can win through all kinds of hardship and terror. What can i really say to do this book justice? The story is pumped up, the villians are even mopre grotesque and heinous, and the backstory is brought to the forefront of the tale once agin. We meet interesting characters like Prof. Lockheart, Dobby the house elf, the King of Arachnids, and somethin called The Basilisk. Ginny Weasly joins the other infamous Weaslys at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore once again shines as the quentisential headmaster, along with his pet phoenix and an air of precognitive knowhow. I read the entire second half of the novel in one whole day, and while that isnt anything uncommon for me, as i am a voracious reader, this still says a lot about Rowling's attention to detail and pacing, how she can keep anyone glued to her tale, and without becoming boring or insulting. Everything she puts into her story has a meaning, from ghosts to certain properties to attitudes and motivations, to pasts and futures. Pick this book up, though only after reading the first novel, Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone. A perfect pick up to the first novel, starting its own story, but also managing to continue the awe inspiring winding road that is Harry Potter, alongside Hermoine, Ron, George and Fred, Ginny, Dumbledore, Mcgonnigal, Snape, Flitwich, Mayfoy and of course, Hagrid. You will not be displeased. Onward to the next part in this tale!!!!

It is sure to delight people of all ages. In this volume Harry is in his second year at Hogwarts school of Magic. Harry and his friends are faced with a snake that is attacking anything that gets in it's way. The only person who can hear it is Harry. Not to mention that it has killed before. It is now up to Harry and his friends to stop it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a word-for-word telling of the story, nothing added or taken out...Hollywood hasn't touched this one.We used it for trips with the kids and it is simply marvelous. Even though the kids have read the books or heard them read by us to them, hearing the parts acted out by Jim Dale gives the tale a whole new life--he is especially good at making Prof. Lockhart seem more annoying than in the movie.You could also use it in a Read-Along format since the recording is unabridged, helping your child learn to read better/faster/more confidently.Now if only they'd come out with a LeapPad version of Harry Potter...that would be marvelous!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"i had been avoiding the Harry Potter books, both on the grounds that over-hyped fiction usually falls short of expectations, and because i didn't think a children's fantasy author could meet the standards set by Diana Wynne Jones. so it was a pleasant surprise to discover that The Chamber of Secrets is actually a very good book indeed: well plotted, amusing, slightly dark, and full of imaginative detail, with the history of the chamber and its opening 50 years ago being particularly brilliantly realised. there are also some useful moral observations, including the thought that a person is not so much the talents they possess as the choices they make. and the satire of ineffective bureaucracies (Ministry for Magic), Daily Mail readers (Harry's uncle), and convention-bound adults in general is perceptively handled.i thought the description of magic use was the weakest element of the fantasy - years of study at school to acquire spell knowledge that amounts to little more than pronouncing a single Latin word per spell. and there was a bit too much of the Blytonesque, \`Christmas dinners were always marvellous at Hogwarts' stuff for my liking. but overall, i have to say i was impressed, and, having read the first and third books as well now, i think that Rowling, if she can cut down on the repetition (which reaches Homeric proportions), and the feel-good padding, has the potential to be not just a very entertaining writer, but also a very serious one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I just finished reading the book.

Not only does Harry receive a dreadful message, he is, then, locked in his room for the rest of the summer as punishment.When Harry does return to school, almost late with Ron and in a flying car no less, strange things do begin to happen, just as Dobby had warned. Draco Malfoy is clearly after Harry, and more importantly, students are being turned into stone, and rumors begin that Harry is the cause!

I was hooked. Rowling's expert writing and vast imagination drew me in the world of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarths. This book, and the others in the series, are great works of literature that will be looked back upon as the 'must read' novels of this decade. They are humorous, intelligent, imaginative, and adventuresome.The \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" picks up where \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" left off. Harry is in his second year at Hogwarths. His aunt, uncle, and cousin still mistreat him. He still gets in some sort of trouble at every turn. And there is still plenty of magic and other mishaps. Something or someone is secretly turning students to stone at school. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine try to get to the bottom of it.As with the other books in the series, I recommend this book to both adults and children. It goes without saying that you should read \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" first though."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsBy: J.K. RowlingReviewed by: W. ...Per.6I like the second book better than the first one because this one is more scarier. The book is about Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts. However, a few weeks before school was going to start, Dobby, an house elf, came in Harry's room and told him not to go to Hogwarts this year. Dobby also said that something horrible was unleashed and Harry Potter will be in great danger. Harry Potter tried to find out who's responsible, but Dobby won't tell Harry. Intead, he kept on bumping his head against the wall.Harry Potter didn't listen to Dobby and still went to Hogwarts. When he came to Hogwarts, something strange was happening, he's hearing a scary voice and he found out that he could speak parseltongue, the language of snakes. Something else scary was also happening, people were getting petrified by something, but what? Even Hermione got petrified by it. Will Harry get to the bottom of this mystery and will he defeat whatever's lurking around?I like this book because when I got to the middle of the book, it just gets more interesting by the page. Once I start, I can't seem to stop and rest, it seemed like I have to finish this book in one whole day. At the end it gets even scarier when the Basalisk battles Harry and Voldemort versus Harry. Harry was very fortunate to survive both attacks. At first Harry was injured by the Basalisk. However, the Phenix helped him like this: \\"A pearly patch of tears was shining around the wound-except that there was no wound.\\" The Phenix healed Harry just in time to verse Voldemort!Although this book is like perfect, there are still some things that I don't like about the book. The main reason was Lucius Malfoy and his son, Draco Malfoy. They are so mean and they think they can do anything because Lucius has a very high position in the Ministery of Magic. This is how he treates his house elf, Dobby: \\"Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his eyes. And cowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby.\\" Lucius actually beat Dobby down. The good thing is that Harry help freed Dobby by tricking Lucius into giving a cloth to Dobby.My favorite part of the book is when Harry saw how the Phenix dies and reborn. The Phenix burns up and turns into ashes when they die, however, from the ashes, a baby Phenix will be born. Isn't that amazing or what. You can have a loyal pet that lives forever until you pass away. The Phenix also have tears that have amazing healing powers. I wonder where will the Phenix go after it's master dies?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter of the Chamber of Secrets is a book about good wizards and bad wizards. Harry Potter is a good wizard. Draco Malfoy is one of the evil wizards. They all go to school called Hogwarts.I really like this book because it has a lot of adventures in in. It has wizards fighting and unlock secrets about Hogwart. Harry Potter is a really famous boy he overcome the powers of Voldermort in the book they say you know who? Harry has a friend name Ron he is like a beginner making mistakes all the time.In all the series of Harry Potter books they all have a mystery to solve.I sort of dislike the book because it always have something to do with killing, or people getting sick. The stuff they use in Harry Potter are really imaginable. The things they use are cool like using magic. It is bad that you can not use magic outside of Hogwarts because it is a rule.My favorite part of the story is when Ron's dad and Malfoy's dad fight. they use a lot of cool magic in Hogwarts. Imagine that there is real magic in the real world. It would be nice to have real magic in the real world. I really like things that you can't get like magic no one has real magic in the world only chgeap tricks."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The story of Harry Potter continues.

Then on the day after his birthday, (where he got nothing) and his uncle is having a very important party to negotiate a deal, a house elf arrives and tells Harry he cannot go back to Hogworts because dreadful things will happen if he returns. Harry refuses and goes back to school anyway. I am not givng anymore information because this second volume to the HP series is just as good as the first. Although the school settings and the plot lines may ahve been trying to send some sort of mention about political corruption, I found this a rather fun read and was begging for more.

When he comes back the book even starts off with a bang. I think this is a much better book than the first book. This is because the things that the author had to put into detail did not have to in this book. It is a good book and a good sequel.I liked this book. I liked that this book is suitable for all kinds of people being young or old. It is good that Harry and his friends always stay together even when they are mad at each other. The book shows this friendship when Ron is in trouble and Harry says, \\"Hurry up Hermoine lets take Ron to Hagrid, he'll know what to do with Ron.\\" That's what I like about this book.I also disliked parts of this book. The only part that I didn't like is how Hagrid's dialogue is sometimes hard to read because of the way the author makes him talk. Such as when he would say something like this to Harry, \\"Said she was jus' lookin' round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin' she might run inter someone else at my house.\\" This is the only thing that I don't like about Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.There are many parts that I like about this book but one part definitely stood out for me. It was the part when they are arriving to Hogwarts for their second year when they lose control and crash into the Whomping Willow. I liked this part because before they crashed the author put a lot of suspense before and got excited at the event that was going to happen. This was my favorite part in the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved the second book better then the first. It's a lot more funnier and scarier.

Also read Playtrain. I loved this book!!! I've read all the Harry Potter's, dragonlances, summerland, Artemis Fowls and Series of unfortunate events, and golden compass. This book is just as good if not better then some of those. Except Harry Potter cause they are my favorites! It's got a cool website! I love when the train comes flying in! ...

In this book, Harry Potter goes to Hogwarts for his third year. Harry Potter goes through lots of horror and happiness at Hogwarts. At the end, he goes home safely.I like reading this book. I liked the book, because it makes me feel that i'm a Hogwarts student, too. I imagine myself following Harry and his friends(Ron and Hermione)to a place. \\"Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes-he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.\\" Honeydukes was a place Harry couldn't go. So I imagined myself going in there and eating all those candies.Another thing I like about Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the action. There is lots of magic in this book. \\"A giant spider, six feet tall and covered with hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then-\\"Ridikulus!\\" bellowed Ron, and the spider's legs vanished.\\" I like it when lots of action goes on in this book. It makes me want to do some magic!My favorite part of the book is when Professor Lupin taught the students what the boggart can do. A boggart is a shape-shifter. It can turn in to whatever that can scare someone. Professor Lupin let the students do the magic, and I got to see who is scared of what. Harry never got the chance to do it. That's because he was afraid of dementors.

The beautiful minds and ideas of J.K. Rowlings make this book interesting and mysterious. This book is a fairly good size book. 77Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is kina weird and mysterious at a lot of points in the book, like because there is lots of pranks and murders going on that are bad enough that they are thinking about shutting down the school for good. Hagrid opened the chamber of secrets when he was young and was kicked out. The witches and wizards are thinking that the chamber is being open because of the killings. They think it is Hagrid that is trying to open the chamber of secrets so they took him to the prison of Azkaban the strongest and most secured jail on the planet. The wizard who runs hogwarts doesn't think that Hagrid is guilty of trying to open it. Some time later it was opened and now they were in trouble.

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a great place to keep things safe, but not safe enough to keep Harry safe this year. During his summer holidays, Harry was visited by a strange elf-like creature who told him that he should not go back to Hogwarts this year. Harry does not trust the elf, and he goes back to his school. This is when Harry realizes that the elf was right. The Chamber of Secrets is opened, and Muggle-borns everywhere are getting attacked. It is up to young Harry to save the school when half of the school believes that HE is the one attacking everyone. Read the story to find out what happens next.I liked a lot of things from this book. The author does a great job of depicting what the basilisk looks like. She writes, \\"...enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk...\\" Every time that I read this passage, I always get really scared. I can picture the basilisk clearly in my mind. The author does a great job of describing in every book of hers that I have ever read. I think that is why everyone likes her books so much.I didn't really like one of the parts from the story. The part that I didn't like is the whole plot. The story sometimes got a little confusing at some times. I also didn't like the fact that Ginny had to be taken into the Chamber of Secrets. This is because Harry Potter acted all noble and went into the Chamber himself. Harry could have died in there, and then there would not have been more to the series.My favorite part in the book was when Professor Lockhart took all the bones out of Harry's arm after the match with the rogue Bludger. I really like this part beacuse I think it is really funny. If someone had taken all the bones out of my arm, I would probably just sit there and laugh it off.

Too bad J.K isn't writing more than 7 books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry can't wait to go back to Hogwarts, but an odd stranger warns him (and trys to prevent him) of evil happenings at Hogwarts. Exciting and memrable!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is just as great as the first. It's horrible that he has to stay with the Dursleys over the summer. But something very interesting happened. Dobby, a house-elf who serves Malfoy, warns Harry not to go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry goes anyway and Dobby goes any length to save him and make him come back, nearly killing him. Then Harry found out about the Chamber of Secrets, which was opened again after 50 years. He and Ron and Hermione Granger, his other best friend, goes any length to solve the mystery. When they found out that Muggle-borns and Squibs are going to be attacked by the horror within the Chamber, they were worried about Hermione because she's a Muggle-born. Suddenly attacks were everywhere, Petrifying four people and a cat, Mrs. Norris. Harry and Ron with the help of Hermione, solved the mystery and Harry killed Lord Voldemort, the devil. All of the Petrified people were healed, and twelve-year-old Harry Potter had another year of adventures. This hailirious book brings characters to life and, I can't wait for the third one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am 10 years old and I think this book is - fantabulous , spectacular , an adventure in your own home! If you want adventure, HERE IT IS!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This second book also shows humor and imagination, but Rowling deserves to have her publisher hire an editor to correct things like the punctuation of dialogue. One does not sniff an entire sentence. One might speak an entire sentence and then sniff.In addition, how about if the publisher fires the person responsible for dumbing down the first title for the American audience. &quot;Philosopher's Stone&quot; has a specific meaning, which is not present in the revised title."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Breath of fresh reading is the Harry Potter series with plenty of scope to develop into a whole series of books. This is what children of this reading level have been waiting for and I take my hat off to Joanne Rowling for unleashing her great depth and ability in encapturing children's imagination. My daughter has never read a book so avidly before picking up this and the previous book and she awaits with anticipation the release of the third in the series. As someone who works in libraries it is refreshing to read new ideas and I applaude Joanne Rowling's ability to develop her characters and plots which leave the reader waiting for the next edition. A well deserved recommendation for any children's book award and like my daughter I have thoroughly enjoyed her refreshing new books...keep writing Joanne!! As to the person who criticises her reviewing characters in her second book &quot;chamber of secrets&quot;, this is a necessary element in any sequel when people perhaps read out of order which cannot be avoided at times, and in my opinion, the review of the characters is well done. Try and be more positive!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I liked the book so much that I was kind of disapointed when I finished it. I couldn't wait for the next one to come out! It inspired me that there is a such thing as magic. An amazing story with only magic to help Harry defeat his arch enemy, who used to be the most powerful sorcerer of all time, who lost all his power after failing to kill Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort. I would recomend this book to anyone who asked me about it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've read both of the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling. They are pretty long but I read them in a flash because you just don't want to put the book down. Even in our school library there was a waiting list, I don't know how long. I think you should read this book because it talks about stuff far beyond imagination and uses funny words that mean all sorts of things. The first book is about a little boy named Harry Potter who is living with his Aunt and Uncle because his parents died in a &quot;car crash&quot;. They treat him so bad he even has to sleep in the cupboard under the steps. Then on his birthday a weird man comes and tells Harry that he was born awizard and his parents really were killed by an evil wizard and that Harry is the most famous wizard in the world. He then takes him shopping because he has to buy him stuff for a speacial school of magic. He inquirers magic he didn't even know existed. I lot more happens but that is for me to know and you to find out.

I love to read his books and I can't wait until the next one comes out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Every book in this series is special in its own way. The first book is such a lovely introduction, and obviously Rowling's baby. The third is just a spectacular novel, it is secure in the knowledge that it is not only a part of a series, but a firm novel all on its own. The fourth book changes the whole world, and will make the 5th, 6th, and 7th books world totally different from the one we were introduced to (but still good). This second book has its own special place as well. It is a marvelous change. It is so different from the first one. Slightly darker, but that makes it all the more exciting. It is a mix of sadness and happiness that Harry Potter is growing up, and can now handle more. He is 12-years-old, and achieving things that we couldn't achieve as 35 year-olds. The books set a wonderful example, and really show good being rewarded for being truly good. The final battle has so many different metaphors, myths and great references that it takes a few readings to fully understand. I have read this book 4 times...and it is still exciting!! I have it on tape and CD and in hardcover. This is a truly magnificent novel on its own, and a great section of a great series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I do not remember the last time I enjoyed reading so much, and I love to read. The whole Harry Potter series is great, but I really loved ...the Chamber of Secrets. To some these books may seem silly, or even offensive, but as an adult and future teacher I find them facinating. I know that if they are exciting enough for me to read until the wee hours of night, they are exciting enough to make children learn to love reading. In this day and age it is almost impossible to get children to sit down and read for a decent period of time, but I have seen many children who just do not want to put these books down. They are all wonderful fantasy stories, but there is a tinge of reality in the storyline. Harry overcomes adversity (a terrible home life with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley, the loss of his parents, bullying at school, and the normal child's self consciousness) and manages to win in the end. What a wonderful theme for the children of today."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an exciting sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone. Harry Potter is in his second year at Hogwarts, school of wizardry. The chamber of secrets has been opened, and someone, or something, is out to get all the non-magic students in the school. At first, everyone thinks the chamber is a myth, but after odd things start happening, people turn into statues, Harry and his friends decide they have to find the chamber, and try to stop whatever is doing this. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventures. I thought it was great. I really enjoyed reading it, and it made me want to read the next one. If you have read the first one, you should definitely read this one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As a father of three I've read many a bedtime story. As a change from the ordinary I decided to begin reading the Harry Potter books, a chapter each night, to my children in lieu of a regular story. What a wonderful decision it was! At ages 9, 7 and 6 each of them was as enthralled with the story as was I. At the end of the first night the oldest says, &quot;Read another chapter!&quot; I knew then I had a winner. What a treat this has become for us all. We're not through with the story but we can hardly wait to find out what happens next; who or what is sitting on Harry's bed and why? Not only do I highly recommend this book I recommend starting this tradition. I guarantee, bedtime stories will never be the same and this book will have your children wanting more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was my favorite of the series.

Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Wonderfully imaginative and a real page turner, i couldn't put this book down. I believe any one with a HINT of an imagination will find this book a refreshing change from the doledrum books for children lately. And as for others who have no taste for the imaginative and have reviewed this book, I feel sorry for you. This book is a cherished addition to any household."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Just a quick note about the audio version: I listen to books-on-tape regularly on long drives, and I've come to appreciate the reader's skill. He/she must provide narration, mood, and a variety of vocal characterizations to differentiate the various characters. Jim Dale, who has read all three books in this series, is by far the best of the best. These books contain a dizzying array of characters: adults and children; male and female; human and otherwise. Mr. Dale provides an equally dizzying array of accents, timbres, and characterizations to flesh them out beautifully. He's set such an impossible standard for Audio Book acting that I've since been disappointed with some other fine actors' renditions of other works.These editions are unabridged, so the listener misses not a word of Ms. Rowlings wonderful prose, which makes the listener feel a little less guilty for not reading them in the usual manner. Actually, they are the first books I've actually read AFTER I listened to them!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm a Mom.

A definate read for young and old folks alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This sequel was very enjoyable. Not only was it a smooth transition from the first book but the plot thickened and made it even more interesting. Harry comes home for the summer from Hogwarts to the mean and nasty Dursleys. A little visitor comes to Harry's room and warns him of danger at Hogwarts and that he shouldn't go back for his second year there. Needless to say, Harry didn't listen and his friend Ron Weasley and his brothers come to rescue him from the Dursley's house. When school time comes around again they all go to get their new books and they meet Gildroy Lockhart the author and their new professor. Trouble starts almost immediately upon arrival back to Hogwarts, including a flying car accident, Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy (who is always trying to start a fracas), and Lockhart who is constently on Harry's case. This book is loaded with event after event, it hooked me right in and I couldn't put it down. I reccomend this to anyone of any age, you will never be able to set it down, a real page turner."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved the book!

I am a sophmore student attending Franklin Learning CenterHigh School.() Harry Potter is a great book it is great for all ages. I have read only the first and second book. Even though I am at this age I still love reading these books. I plan on reading the rest of her books. I think Ms. Rowling is a great writter she describes the characters in a great way. I can almost imagine what the characters look like and the expressions on there faces. When I read Harry Potters first book, I couldn't put it down. I think Harry is a great character with his friends. The second book was the best because I really didn't think that, Who's Name Must Not Be Said could have appeared back into the story. In the first book I thought that Snape was the one who was trying to kill Harry. This is a great book I recommend this to all who want to read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It was ok, but not as good as the other four. But I stil love mthe other four."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's pretty difficult with any medium to create colorful characters with a crusading plotline. From Stephen King to Luke Skywalker, from old-time westerns to modern-day tv, it's tough to create characters that continually stand up book after movie after magazine with entertaining stories. Our man Harry has perservered through this challenge -- leaving us with a very engaging first novel, The Sorcerer's Stone, and a only mildly less-so sequel.Mild as it may be, the only thing that I found troubling in Chamber of Secrets was its close echo in form, in flavor, to the first book. While hiking a different path, J.K. Rowling climbs the same mountain -- the climax, for instance, is too similar in both books.Considering the audience, though, is not 22 year old readers like myself, this seems like a wholly insufficient reason for anyone younger not to buy this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and The Chamber Of Secrets is just a delightful as the first novel in what I hope to be, series. Although it might deal with more serios subjects the quick wit and steady charm shown throughout the entire experiance of reading it makes it a certain winner. It was one of my altime favorites."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"WHY DOES EVERYONE KEEP COMPARING HER TO ROALD DAHL?!J.K. Rowling is twice as good as him! When my mother and I read it, we couldn't wait for the sequel to come out, but then we got really down because it was only coming out here in the US in September '99 (this was in November of '98). But then, fortunately, we knew someone that was coming over from England, so we got it from them. As usual, the Weasly twins are a bomb squad of laughs. Also, watch out for Lockhart, he's a torture chamber without realising it! In the end, Gryffindor wins the house cup and Harry defeates You-Know-Who once again. How? Find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read harry potter and the sorcerer's stone I knew i would like it because I have a great history with magic-type books, but I have to agree with millions of other readers that Harry Potter was one of the bestbest books I have ever read.

In fact, why didn't it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Abracadabra! Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling is a magical journey that takes Harry through his second year at Hogwarts School for young wizards and witches. Superstar Harry Potter, made famous by his dark past, is starting another year at Hogwarts and trying to solve a puzzle of the school's mysterious history. This book was an amazing blend of humor, magic, danger, and friendship. One thing I liked was how Rowling leads the reader through Harry's travels with easily relatable characters and deceptively simple story line. The story line is easy for most readers to understand but there is just enough sophisticated language used to make it a great adventure for all ages. This makes it a fascinating book to read. Another thing I liked was how the story's plot is like a braid of intertwined events. Reading this book is like riding a water slide; you twist and turn at light speed and then end with a big splash at the most unexpected time. The final thing I liked about this book was how believable the story was. Though the concept of wizards and magic seems very fictional, the way Rowling tells the story, makes the reader believe everything and feel as though they are actually there. It makes reading the book a much more involved activity. Overall, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was an extremely interesting book to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've read all of J. K.

These books are absolutely great, and are one of the best ways I've ever seen to get kids to read (nevermind the demographic who's actually buying the books, which is just about everybody)! I really hope Rowling writes FOUR MORE!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am not sure if I should err on the side of generosity here, but I cannot give one and a half stars, so it is two. I will do my best to give a reasonable account of my bad mark, as ninety-something percent of the Amazon reviews give top marks, and I don't want to be a sour grape for no good reason.The general plot is familiar if you have read book one, but this is not a bad thing as there is still a \`whodunnit' element. The book is inventive, and the humour is still there, and a little more sharp-edged in places. I got a wry botanical smile out of the magical mandrakes (plants with human-shaped roots), which are nursed in the potting shed from young plants to full grown during the story. They betray approaching maturity by becoming moody and secretive, and trying to move into each other's pots. I think I can also detect improved writing technique, as some of the scenes are more coherent and descriptive than book one, although the characters are barely more fleshed out. And as I am an enthusiast for spiders, my favourite fantasy monster, I enjoyed the big spider scene. (I am trying to not reveal the plot too much, or I would wax more lyrical here.)As to the down side, I am not too worried by the Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, but I am bored by the overly obvious new DADA teacher, who is an unfunny buffoon and a charlatan. I can only presume that a bigger fool employed him. Much worse, the mentally disturbed, slime-ridden self-harming elf who tries to help Harry, just detracts from the whole story. He is in bad taste. I think Rowling hates JRR Tolkien's elves, and hates them with a passion, and wants a spoiler in here. Parents reading this story to their children will want to avoid having to answer too many questions about this elf. They may also have grave doubts about the moral example of the criminal way Harry and co. acquire the ingredients for their Most Potente Potion. It is too much like organised crime for me. Even Malfoy's father has a sneer for career thieves in the Little Shop of Horrors, earlier in the book.Lastly, there is an unpleasant undercurrent in this book, as there was in the first. In the first few chapters, before we get to Hogwart's, there are a number of striking references to ordure - filth, excrement, the smelly stuff, etc, ad nauseam. Dung abounding and toilet humour - Harry completes his potty training! Do we need it? Do we want it? Mercifully, these references largely disappear when we get to school, but only to be replaced by many scenes located in the girls' toilets. Still, flushed with success, Harry completes his mission, so all is well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book was good, but it repeated a lot of things from the first book.

Overall, it was enjoyable, but I had a harder time keeping my attention on it than the first book in the series. I think the story was not as grabbing, though large bits of it were very good. Maybe it was something about the writing style, I'm not sure. But I was not nearly as blown away by this one as I was the previous book.That having been said it was not enough to dampen my enthusiasm for the series, and I am already reading the third one. I'm told they get better and more rich from this point on. Here's hoping. 4.5 out of 5 stars seems right."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A classic Harry Potter book.

The character of Gilderoy Lockhart had me rolling. His gleaming smile, audacious personality and hidden intentions made for a gripping tension between him and many of the other favorites at Hogwarts. This second book also set the stage for what we would come to expect as the yearly return to the school of wizardry. Each time the journey would change (This time including a flying car), new faces color the crowds and active scenery (An unhappy willow tree) adds depth to this secret world within our own. In this case the book far surpassed the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" starts out with Harry Potter, back at the Dursleys' for summer break. The Durseleys have not changed and are still not nice to Harry. Then, a flying ford filled with Weasleys shows up and Harry is off to visit with the Weasleys utill school starts.The author manages to change the story line quite a bit from the first HP book and we are immersed in another series of Harry Potter adventures. This time, the dangers get a bit more sophisticated. Eventually, all ends well.While this book is written for children, the characters are beginning to develop and the story is broadened beyond the confines of the first book. Also, there is a start to deepening our knowledge and understanding of the evil that threatens Harry's magical world.This is an excellent fantasy adventure. I recommend the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Did not come with the Dust Cover but was in excellent shape and came on time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading the first book and diving headfirst into this one (like I did) you notice how the story itself is so well put together because it's like there was never a seperation. This starts where book 1 left off. And unlike book 1, where you can tell the main focus of the story was to develop who it is you're reading about and get planted into their lives, this book begins the slow yet ultimately satisfying dark plunge that the series as a whole is going to take.During and after reading this you will come to understand that the rollercoaster of friendship, magic, prophacies, and ressurecting evil wizards is shaping up to be one hell of a ride."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A wonderful sequel to \\"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone\\". The first book introduced the reader to the world of wizardry. While Ms. Rowling's debut work was filled with wonderment, suspense and gee-whiz fun, the second installment is a little darker. It also answers a few questions which remained dangling at the end of The Sorcerer's Stone. In addition, colorful, new characters are introduced; some of the familiar characters are fleshed out more; and fresh mysteries pertaining to the whole Hogwarts' realm make this book an extremely entertaining read for all ages. Read the books in sequence and enjoy the ride. My guess is that Ms. Rowling's series still will be popular long after all of us are dead and buried."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've just read this book for the 2nd time realizing how much I had forgotten. The movie follows this book closely but the book is always better. This book like the first starts off pulling you in the minute the Weasley's break him out. I enjoyed the suspense/mystery of this book as to who is the heir of Slyterin. Time doesn't feel rushed in the book as it did in the movie. I loved this book and read it quickly, a real page turner. I will read this book again. It's excellent for kids and adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This, the second book in the Harry Potter series, is better than the first, but not as good as the others.

This year I have been teaching a group of seven, eight and nine year olds, who are great kids, full of enthisam and energy, and I wanted a book to read to the class that would spark their imaginations. Six months ago a friend recommended a book that had gone down very well in her school - Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. I bought the book and then began to read the book in preparation. After six chapters I had to stop myself, I was enjoying myself too much, I felt I needed to share the excitement as I read it for the first time with the children - A first for me. As I predicted the children were thrilled with the story, many quality peices of work were written using the book as a stimulus and the word soon spread to the rest of the school. Soon children from all different classes were comming up to tell me about when Ron lost scabbers or how they actually secretly liked Hermoine. Out of all the children in my class, one particular child became enchanted by the book. He was one of the youngest in the class. He had always been very young in the year and had found reading a particular struggle. His parents were very supportive but were worried because he didn't seem to have any interest in fiction - the main bulk of our reading material. The child decided to read Harry Potter by himself even though it was an almost impossible task. For the next four weeks it was rare to see him without his copy. His parents had to pry it away from him so that he could go to sleep and every play time he would sit quitely by himself or with other children and read and read. The first major change I noticed was when he decided that he wanted to read aloud to the rest of the class. This was an idea that I don't think he would have entertained previously. He read with some difficulty but with increased accuracy, the look in his eyes after he had finnished stunned hyself and the rest of the children. A look of pure achievement and pride shone out from his face. Since then his reading has improved amazingly, it has also filtered its way into different areas, spelling, concentration and his overall confidence. At a reacent Perental consultation his Parents were visably and verbally extatic about the progress their son had made. He has now read all three books and many more at the same standard. On a recent Birthday list at the top, higher even that a playstation was the third Harry Potter book. So a huge thank you to J.K.Rowling, who has not only given me and twenty seven small children hours of excitement and nail biting anticipation. But more importantly thank you for making a significant difference to the life of a now flourishing eight year old boy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I picked up the first Harry Potter book to see what all the fuss and media hype was about. Now, I'm hooked. I had to read the second book and now I'm searching for the third.Harry returns to Hogwarts against the advice of a mysterious visitor, only to find that life there is not the same as it was his first year. There's an egotistical new professor on the faculty, mysterious attacks against Muggle-born students, and a new ghost that haunts the girls' bathroom. Harry and his cohorts must get to the bottom of the mystery and, in the process, discover the real reason Hagrid was expelled.These books are not just for kids. They're for anyone who enjoys a light, fast read with a little injection of mystery.As for those critics who insist that the books are about the occult, that's nonsense. I grew up watching &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and these books are as &quot;evil&quot; as these television programs. The plot is the classic &quot;good vs. evil&quot; with a magical twist and a young, likeable hero."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I first heard about the series from one of my friends, but was skeptical as to thinking it would be something I would enjoy. I am a teenager and assumed wrongly that this was another series for children, but I quickly found out why this book is such a hot seller! I didn't realise that a kid a year younger than me would capture my attention, but that's just what Harry Potter has done in all the books I have read. I instantly fell in love with Harry Potter and his crazy Hogwarts school for wizzards, and everyone with him. Book 2 is his second year at Hogwarts, and once again he is the team's Seeker for Quiditch, stuck with a bias Potions teacher, Professor Snape, and of course, Harry gets his chance to prove that once and for all he is a hero. I shared with him the triumphs and tribulations as he made his way in the wizzarding world of magic. Packed with new suprises about the characters, an intruging and explosive ending, this sequel was one that I literally couldn't put down!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is wonderfully imaginative. From the viewpoint of both a good reader and a good writer, I would give it a higher 'star rating', if there was one. The woman who wrote this series is an astoundingly powerful writer. I couldn't put it down. When asked what I thought of it, compared to the other books, I would say that it is the all-around best, although the best ending would go to &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. Teachers: Do NOT read this to your class out of order! The book sequence is one continued story, and it would be like reading the 23rd chapter to the end of Tom Sawyer, and then going back and reading the first chapter to the 22nd."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read all the current Harry Potter books, and this is my favorite. I got the first one a year ago where it resided on my bookshelf, untouched.(At the time I was reading Ghost and Mystery novels.) One day I overheard some classmates talking about the book. They seemed to love it. Although I was not very fond of Fantasy at the time, I decided to give the book a shot. I ran home, dusted it off, opened and read. By the following morning I had finished it, unable to stop reading, and was planning on buying the second one after school. This one was even better then the first as I finished it in even less time. After reading the third, I came back to the second and reread it. It is, in short, a real page-turner as it has all the humor and quality of the first book along with some new captivation as readers wonder what is turning the students into stone, how, and why. I even found myself a bit scared, something I didn't find in the first or third book. This book is probably the most realistic in description of the three, and I would guarentee you to like it, no matter what your tastes."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm an avid reader and when my 11 year old brother got the first three Harry Potter books for his birthday I wanted to see what the hype was about. I devoured them! I'm 15 years old and was slightly ashamed. Teenagers get a bad rap for not reading so I didn't really tell anybody how much I loved these 'kids' books. One day however I was talking with a 17 year old friend about books we love. I mentioned the Harry Potter series sheepishly (our previous mentions had included Sylvia Plath, Tolkien, Oscar Wilde, The Brontes...) and she said she loved them too. We spent several hours talking about the books. So to all teenagers that are curious about the hype... READ 'EM!

I read \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" more than a year ago, and after reading \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" I am not sure why it took me so long to read this sequel. I enjoy the wonderful world of Hogwarts so much more than I enjoy the actual story of Harry's perpetual battle with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I loved jumping into the world of flying cars, Quidditch matches, and photographs that move. I also love the beggining of this book, which describes Harry's wretched Muggle Family--Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and horrible cousin Dudley Dursley.Because I enjoy the atmosphere of these books more than the action, I was not pinning all of my hopes on a climactic showdown between Harry and Voldemort at the Chamber of Secrets. If I had been, I have to imagine that I would have been a little disappointed. It did not seem as though Voldemort was as cleverly disguised as he was in Book 1, or that the author did as much to build the reader up to an exciting conclusion. I saw the ending coming from miles away. However, I can't criticize the book too much for this flaw. It was written for children, and I am 27!All in all, a creative, thoroughly enjoyable journey back to Hogwarts. All your favorite characters from \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" are back, including the Dursleys, the Weasleys, Hagrid, and Professor Dumbledore. Also back are the characters you love to hate, notably Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape. However, there are also a host of exciting new characters: Professor Lockhart, Ginny Weasley, and many others.

It has a lot of acquired situations and has unique vocabulary. The author's stile of writing is very unique, she uses very suspenseful words to make the reader feel more excitement. I believe that the author gives a lot of info about the characters as if she always on the 1st chapter of all her books all she does is tell you every time who Harry is, why he's living with his nasty relatives and who are his friends but overall it's a good book.

A wonderful second book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsReviewed by: Ben HoggDid you read the first Harry Potter book? Did you like it? If you did then you'll love the second one. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is possibly better than the first. It stars America's favorite boy wizard saving the world again from the forces of evil. Harry attends Hogwarts, a school for witches and wizards, with his two friends Hermione Granger and Ronald (Ron) Weasly. Harry suspects that something evil is going on when Dobby, a house elf, warns him not to go to school, for Harry is \\"too great to loose.\\" He starts to really get suspicious when the barrier to 9 closes on him and Ron. And then when he finally gets to school, he hears an icy voice saying plans of murder, and students turning into living statues, and meets a ghost that haunts a girls' bathroom. He knows something is up. It's then up to Ron, Harry, and Hermione to save the school from who, or what, is causing all of this.This is a great book. It has mystery, magic, and proves that one person can make a difference. I think this is a must-read book. I believe that this book is for children and adults, making it a one-of-a-kind piece of literature. It's definantly a 5-wand book! Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the best book in the series in terms of both pure suspense and humor. After a horrible summer with his relatives, Harry returns to Hogwarts in an illegal flying car and gets in trouble right off the bat. Soon, he hears mysterious voices from within the walls of the school that nobody else is able to hear. When students start turning to stone, the race is on to find the perpetrator before he/she/it strikes again.The mystery of who is attacking Hogwarts students drives the plot of the book. In book one, all the clues were designed to point to one suspect. This time, however, the attacker could be anybody, and there's a clear sense of danger throughout the entire story. The suspense keeps building until the final fifty pages, when Harry must risk his life to save another student.At the same time, Rowling maintains her sense of humor from the original novel. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets features a 'whomping willow' tree that will hit anybody who comes close, an incredibly arrogant replacement teacher, and mandrake plants that need to mature before they can be used in potions (when several mandrakes hold a party in their pot, it's a sign that they're almost ready). The book is full of good fun and great excitement. An enjoyable read for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"you know, it's actually just the darkest and the most beautifully written by mrs.j.k.murray.i read it 28 times.(dont laugh,i'am not joking). if you have'nt read it yet, it is a real loss.get it today itself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In the second novel of her epic Harry Potter story, J.K. Rowling weaves another thrilling tale of mystery, magic and fantasy. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets will leave you on the edge of your seat as Rowling takes you on another magical ride of mystery and suspense as Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione get caught up in more magical misadventures battling the forces of evil and searching for the truth. As has become her M.O., not all is as it seems is you discover the who-done-it. The ending will leave you in shock and surprise.The Main Story:Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft starts off with an ominous warning as Dobby the elf sneaks into Harry's home at the Dursley's and warns him not to return to Hogwarts because his life is in danger. Not heeding this warning Harry does indeed return to Hogwarts and becomes a suspect in a string of attacks against his fellow students where students of muggle descent are turned into stone. In actuality, Harry faces the evil of the legendary Chamber of Secrets, a secret chamber built by one of the school's four founders which contains a hidden evil monster. The real mystery at stake is, who has once again opened the Chamber of Secrets?Supporting Stories:- For the second year in a row, Hogwarts has a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, a famous author with a series of book about his battles against the dark creatures. As the semester progresses though, it is clearly obvious something is not right about him.- As a second year student, Harry becomes ever more aware of his celebrity status as a new underclass joins Hogwarts, including Colin Creevey who worships him and Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister who is quite taken with Harry.- We also see Harry, Ron and Hermione's continuing rivalry with Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slitherins, and Professor Snape the Potions Master- Harry, Ron, Fred and George have fun with Mr. Weasley's enchanted car.- Will Dobby find his salvation through Harry?What We Find Out:- We discover why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts when he was a student- We take a look at Hogwarts as it was 50 years ago through the diary of Tom Riddle.- We discover a little more about the mysterious link of fate between Harry and evil Dark Lord, Voldemort.Just as gripping and engaging as the first novel, fans of Harry Potter will enjoy this second chapter in his epic story. At a little over 300 pages, the book reads fast. Harry Potter mania has swept the nation, if not the world, for the past several years. Rowling's gripping stories of mystery, suspense, shock, fantasy and magic are a true treat. This book is another shining example of why her characters are beloved by both children and adults the world over.My total read time: 9 hours, one evening.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secerts was a fantantic book. It gives the reader what they want with a great plot and awesome ending. The book has a nice combination of a great story with the touch magical fiction.

Kids in the school are being attacked by some thing and they don't know what. It's up to Harry to save the day. I felt that this was interting and it kept you in suspense.

Rowling. This fiction book takes place in London. It has 341 pages. This story is about a boy who goes to wizard and witch school to learn how to be a wizard. In this story Harry Potter finds the entrance to the chamber of secrets and defeats the monster inside. In the end, Dobby, a house elf, who appears in other parts of the story, gives Harry Potter a reward. Harry Potter has glasses and a scar that he got from Lord Voldermort, an evil wizard who killed Harry's parents. Harry lives in the country with his Aunt and Uncle, who don't want him to go to wizard school because they don't like magic. I highly recommend this book because it is very captivating and is fun to read. Benjamin Bayless"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"For those readers who have not read the first Harry book, \\"The Sorceror's Stone\\", I advise you to read my review of it as a more general review of the Harry Potter series as a whole. Anyway, although I enjoyed the first Harry Potter novel immensely, I think that \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" is even better. Since readers who have journeyed this far with Harry and his friends already are familiar with Ron, Hermione, Dudley, Malfoy, and the rest of J.K. Rowling's delightful characters, this installment focuses on developing their personalities further. We see some of the characters start to change. Who would have thought that Hermione Granger, the goody-two-shoes, would actually devise a plan that broke more rules than any they had done before? We learn why Hagrid got expelled from Hogwarts, and we see Draco Malfoy evolve from a schoolyard bully to a real menace. We also meet Malfoy's sinister father, Dobby the house elf, and the hapless Gilderoy Lockhart. \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" is a little darker, a little more complex, and a little more satisfying than \\"Sorceror's Stone.\\" The plot is more sophisticated, and a bit like an Agatha Christie mystery. Remember that unpredictable plot twist at the end of the first Potter book? There are more here, and they get even more bizarre. For every question answered in this book, many more troubling ones come up in its place, until the climax when everything fits together in typical Rowling fashion. It is very rare that a sequel live up to the expectations of fans, especially with something as popular as Harry Potter. However, \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" does just that. (I gave it four stars instead of five only so that someone would read my review.) And I really, really want a flying car."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Did you ever hear of a book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone? Me and and my friends think it's great! Right now i'm on book two called Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. You might want to get this book soon, parents want to take it off the shelf! Sure it has some un-expected things but if you want a book that surpises you every second this is the #1 book to get. If you still don't think it's the perfect book for you I have two options, number one is to go get the book or keep reading my message to find out more. I don't think you should skip to the second book even if it is better than the first. In the first book there is 309 pages. Every word is worth it. Harry goes to a school named Hogwarts for Wizards and Witches because his father was a Wizard and his mother a Witch. They died when Harry was a baby and his mean uncle and aunt took care of him.

They remind me alot of the Chronicles of Narnia. I recomend reading all of the harry Potter Books. If you like them I recomend the Chronicals Of Narnia Series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've always been incredulous that people could consider these books the work of the Devil, because they are superb pieces of fiction in their own right. Fiction is made-up, and I consider this book - The Chamber of Secrets - to easily be the best of the first three books. Its plot is worthy of one of the classic whodunnits, with its convolutions, its twists and turns, and its red herrings. We allow ourselves to think one way, and then another, and then Rowling surprises us and knocks us sideways by revealing the solution. And the solution makes sense, when you think back through the book. This is a very good book for fans of Agatha Christie and the classic whodunnit genre. The plotting is surprisingly complex and mature for a recommended reader age of - what is it? - 11, 12? which is largely why the Harry Potter books have so successfully captured the attention of adults. These are books for intelligent people of any age; a rare commodity, and even rarer is the fact that they can be read by people of almost any age. Of course, I would not recommend these books for the very youngest children, and they can be truly spinechilling, but there is nothing wrong with horror if it is firmly set in a fantasy world. There have been complaints that these books stereotype all Muggles as stupid lumpish people, but frankly - this book is written from the viewpoint of a world where witchcraft and wizardy is a way of life. It is no wonder that Muggles seem stupid, because they do not know or see the same things as the non-Muggles do. We are fortunate to be allowed to read about these things, and it makes us view this world with renewed wonder and magic. Because what is mundane becomes marvellous. Read these books to your children, or if they are old enough to read, read it with them. Your children will learn to think, especially if you discuss the issues raised by the books. There have been complaints that Harry Potter makes it good to tell untruths. I read all three books recently, to see whether this was a fair statement, and can tell you that where the untruths appear, they are almost always accompanied by a Very Good Reason - someone or something's life needs saving, or a very important talisman needs recovery. The lying and untruths are not gratituous, and the authorities usually find out about them at the end of the day, and excuse them with good reason. Joanne Rowling's prose is not bland-bland, or unduly convoluted, but settles at a very satisfactory point in between. She writes with wit, humour, warmth and intelligence, about real people who make the same mistakes and do the same things that Muggles would do in the same circumstances. Children's writing is where the discerning adult has to look these days, if they want good plotting, clever reasoning and strong characterisation, and fantasy as well. To find all these rolled up in one book is a delight; to find that they are rolled up in a trilogy - one day to be a septology - is wonderful. If Rowling had put her hand to classic whodunnit, in the mould of the women crime writers such as Christie, Tey, James and Rendell, she would quickly have become just another of those women writers. But she has instead combined her head for a strong whodunnit plot with magical elements and fantasy, and has produced something that is original in its elements, if not totally original in its concepts. And it is the best-written, best-composed of all the magician's-school stories I have encountered.I would like to add that I believe in God, and have seen nothing in Rowling to support the accusations that she is an arrant heathen and writes blatantly pagan stories. She is just a very good writer, and one who deserves her success. I will certainly be buying her next book, and the one after that, and the one after th...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowlings is a master.

My students are convincing one another to read this book, and Harry and friends are regular topics of conversation. I have yet to hear any negative reviews.

It sure beats children reading nonsense books and keeps them out of trouble by doing something they enjoy doing. We can't wait until the movie comes out so the whole family can enjoy a great film together! 10 thumbs up!

In this book, Rowling begins at the ever so unpopular home of the Dursley's. Harry is having an awful summer... as usual, and the only thing that keeps him going is knowing that he is soon to be back at his beloved Hogwart's. Harry's excitement for the approaching school year is put on hold when a strange magical creature (a house elf) begs Harry not to return do to the danger he is soon to be faced.Harry returns none the less, and aside from his annoyance in the new Proffesor Lockhart, and the always bullying Draco Malfoy... Harry tries to solve the mystery of what is suspiciously turning students of Hogwarts into stone, and if whoever's behind it has the ambition of killing Harry himself!A wonderful book! Five stars... and even more if were even an option... buy this book now! Along with all the other Harry Potter books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling has hit upon a tried and true formula and she uses it here to perfection.The second in Rowling's series about the young orphaned wizard, Harry Potter, starts off similarly to &quot;...Sorcerer's Stone...&quot; the first book. During the summer break between his first and second year at Hogwarts, Potter is subjected to and the brunt of more indignities by the Dursley family, his Muggle-born aunt and uncle and their annoying young child.As in the first novel, Harry is rescued after a fashion from life in the mundane world and spends his school year at Hogwarts, tracking down the heir of Slytherin who is turning an alarming number of Hogwarts' students to stone.If there is any one complaint I can make about this book in good conscience, it is that the book is far too similar to the first book in the series. There is very little deviation between the two.Don't let that put you off from reading this book, or from buying this book for a young reader. It is a very palatable book, exceptionally easy to read and &quot;get into&quot; and hard to put down once you have. Rowling's style is a little bit formulaic, but it's a formula that works!Once again, this book explores the differences between good and evil and further examines free will and free choice vs. destiny. It's a great children's book in that it teaches children that they can choose to do the right thing even when it seems like they're being pigeonholed or peer pressured into doing the wrong thing.As I've mentioned in my review of the first Harry Potter book, fundamentalists have decried this series due to the fantasy nature of the storyline. Please don't let this detract you from purchasing or reading the book - it is easily on the level of CS Lewis' &quot;The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe&quot; series in teaching valuable moral lessons while being a compelling read. The Harry Potter series of books is also very similar in quality to Madeleine L'Engle's &quot;Wrinkle in Time&quot; series of books.If any adults have concerns about purchasing this book for a child, I encourage you to read it first.

Even though I've watched all of the films that have been released up to this point, this is only the second book that I've read. I have to admit that this tale is wonderful, but compared to the first book, it isn't quite as good. Don't get me wrong, this is a great read compared to many other novels out there, but it ended a little bit too abruptly for my tastes.All of the characters from the first book return, excepting the Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, who's been replaced by the glory hound Lockhart. Harry still has to deal with those wretched Dursleys, and he believes that his friends have forgotten about him. However, he happens to have a strange little visitor one night, Dobby, who warns him to not return to Hogwart's for his second year of wizarding school. Of course, Harry does manage to make it back to Hogwart's albeit not aboard the Hogwart's Express. He has to take a detour in order to get there.This is just the first in a number of stumbling blocks and dead-ends that Harry and his friends run into. Not to mention the fact that someone or something is \\"petrifying\\" students at the school. Harry is also hearing voices through the walls of the school. Plus, he has to deal with Draco Malfoy and his cronies.With Hagrid, Hermione, Ron, and Dumbledore, among others, on his side, Harry attempts to find out who or what is committing the multiple crimes at the school and clear his own name. It's a wonderful little mystery reader and I plan to pick up the third book as soon as I can.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Chamber of Secrets is a great follow up to this long running series about Witches and Wizards. I just started reading the series in 2005 after 'Goblet of Fire' came out in theatres, and I loved each of these from start to finish. Chamber of Secrets is actually my favorite of all six books so far, and I finished this one in a couple of days. I'm not a fast reader, but this one was just great. I highly recommend this kid-friendly book as a bedtime story, or even a quick read on a vacation to get yourself started in the series. J.K. Rowling hits another homerun."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's a wonderful cute book - even though there's definitely a dark side between the sheets.In this second year at Hogwarts Harry gets a new Defense against the Art Teacher who's a git - and extremely full of himself... he's unable to... - so Harry and his friends have to take over when strange things start to happen at Hogwarts. Harry hears strange voices who nobody else is able to hear and even asks himself if he's lost his marbles - but then it turns out - it's a specialty. Harry only can hear the voice because... Oh! another secret which I shouldn't talk about!Read the book! You'll be surprised how wonderful it is - how carefully and tenderly written. You'll get a better sight into the Weasley family and learn how to love them!You'll get an idea of how much Snape's preferring the Slytherins and learn how to wish you could give Draco Malfoy a few well placed kicks...It's new - it's magic - and you start dreaming about being a teacher in Hogwarts - since I'm REALLY old (over 30) - I figure it might be better to see me as a teacher than as a student - and by the way: a fair and nice teacher - and not one like Snape or Lockart!Have fun!

In every book of the series something happens and Harry Potter somehow saves the day using a magic wand and a little help from his friends. In this one, Harry Potter hears voices from the walls of his school, kids get turned to stone, and Harry's friend's little sister finds a magic diary.It's much better than the first book in the series, but it's still written for a very young audience. It's not until Book Three that adults can read this series without constantly rolling their eyes.

It's here where we meet the Weasley's flying car, the whomping willow, the giant spiders in the forest, Moaning Myrtle, the Headless Hunt, Professor Lockhart, Mr. Weasley, and find the first hint of the \`divided souls' that come to play such a vital role in at least one of the later books. Mystery plays a greater part here than anyplace else in the series: what IS the Chamber of Secrets and where may it be found? If there's one criticism I have for this installment in my favorite boy wizard's adventures, it's that the crisis over the Chamber was allowed to go too far in disrupting life at Hogwart's. I found the intricacies of daily life at the school so interesting that I wished more had been written about them and when classes were suspended, it disappointed me. The confrontation at the climax of this book is probably scarier than most readers were expecting, and the outcome of that battle more exciting. These earliest Harry Potter books contained a more relaxed charm than the later books do once war comes to that world and the parade of deaths begins. Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets is a lovely book that celebrates the magic of imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book was great.

This time Harry is blamed for turning kids into statues as if they were frozen. Why? Because he was at the crime scene when everybody saw it. Even a ghost got turned into a statue. I love how the author builds suspense and has a good begining, a good middle and a good ending. Hogwarts was going to be shut down if the attacks didn't stop. And my favorite part is when harry and another friend got a hundred points each for Gryffendor and when Harry's friend is unfrozen and all is saved. But the part I think is most cool is that Gryffendor wins the house cup two years running. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and aren't afraid of snakes.~malady"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Always love the Harry Potter series.

But in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets it seems that his second year will have more danger than his first. To start he arrives at Hogwarts in a flying car that crashes into a tree and he and Ron are nearly killed. Things will not end there for this daring wizard. This time at school he will find and try to end the evil that lurks in the halls of Hogwarts.As more terrible events occur in Harry's world, he dives into each one. To the voices he hears in the halls, a late night adventure to the forest, and concocting a potion Harry, Ron, and Hermione come across the most adventure and jeopardy. Most importantly the chamber has been opened. But what is this secret that the school holds? They must find out. Always willing to take on the task these three create intriguing stories wherever they go.

The person I gave this to was really exicted to receive it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I absolutely adored this book! This, and the other two, are already clasics! Harry Potter's amazing world and adventures should have their own little place in everyone's hearts. In this book, Harry and his friends are starting a new year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. After a few weeks, things go haywire. A creature from the Chamber of Secrets, built by Slazar Slytherin, is back in school, after 50 years. Only certain people can open the chamber. Only certain people with a gift of talking to snakes. It is Harry's duty to prove to everyone that he or his friend the gamekeeper are not guilty of committing such a crime... Some people say that this book series is a bad influence because of the tendency of witchcraft and violence. I am not about to say it doesn't express such things. All I am going to say is that it really really stinks that some people have to be torn away from such wonderful books just because of people who haven't read them and don't understand how touching they really can be in the lives of many kids like myself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a 12 year old kid who doesn't read that much at all. But when I read the first one, I just had to read the next. So I did and I found the 1st hundred pages good. The next hundred pages boring, but the last hundred pages the bomb. Man, those last pages were so good. It makes everythung else just worth it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm gonna be honest.I didn't like this book as much when I first read it.However, after finishing the seventh book, I have found a new respect for this chapter in the Harry Potter series. The Horcruxes become such a large part of the series that, having completed the journey, it is hard to not like this book as much as the others.This is the chapter in the Harry Potter book series that really sets up everything from Ginny to Horcruxes, and it is truly a great chapter in the series. If you don't dig it as much initially, finish the series. You'll know what I mean."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Well if you're looking at this product you're probably like me, busy and not the biggest fan of sitting down to read. I've always been a big fan of stories but I could just never find the time to read because of work and when I did I am admittedly an abysmally slow reader. After years of hearing how amazing these books, the Harry Potter series, were and loving every movie immensely it finally dawned on me to see if there was an audio book and there obviously is.When I first started listening to the series I must admit I was a little turned off because Stephen Fray came across as a little dry and I was beginning to think the audio books weren't going to be much more tolerable than simply reading the books. As new characters are introduced though I was pleased to find that he managed to give most of them a unique personality and even more so that he maintains these personas not just through this single book but all the way to where I am now, The Half Blood Prince. Aside from just their vocal definition Fry also manages to display a diverse range of emotion for each individual character as if there is a separate actor for each character, it's really quite an amazing performance in my opinion. At certain times various audio filters are added for dramatic effect like echo and things of the sort and I guess that's really the only place this audio book comes up short for me is that there really isn't a whole lot to it other than Stephen Fry reading the books. This being my first audio book I can't really compare it to anything but I guess I was expecting at least some music between chapters or maybe some ambient sound effects but I still find the overall experience enjoyable without them.There are probably hundreds of reviews for the books themselves so I'll keep my opinions on the series short and sweet. I believe the thing that I like most about the Harry Potter series is the overall charm of everything and the connection Rawling maintains to both the real world and real life. She really seems to nail human archetypes and the teenage inner dialogue and I can't help but think there are many pieces of her own children in this book. It showcases such an amazing insight as to the way people think and feel that I really can't help but be awe inspired. Like I said though, I'm not a big reader/listener so I imagine there are better books out there but that really doesn't take away from this series' ability to crack a smile on my face at work. I guess my only gripe is that it sometimes appears as if she has some favorite words or a limited vocabulary or perhaps people in England just find these words more common but there is an obtuse overuse of the words incredulous, glower, and one other that I will add in a couple of hours when I remember it. This obviously isn't a big deal but it can make me cringe a little.Anyways, I work in science and listen to these all day when I don't have to read for work and I'm actually doing lab work and they have improved my enjoyment at work immensely so they come highly recommended by me. Each book is probably about 18-24 hours long off the top of my head so the whole series should take you a while to get through. I hope you enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Year Two at Hogwarts almost didn't happen; luckily the Weasley boys figured out that the Dursleys were holding Harry captive in his room and came to break him out. Of course, it turned out to not be much safer at Hogwarts - it seems that someone has opened the Chamber of Secrets and students are being turned to stone. Can Harry and his friends find out what is happening before it is too late?Filled with a lot thrills and chills (not to mention a flying car - how cool is that?), this is a solid continuation of the series, picking up where the previous one left off and continuing to give our characters growth. We are always learning new things and of course things are never as they seem.Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you like mystery then you will love this book.

Who is the heir of slverin, whats the creature that lives in the chamber and how will harry survive.A must buy that you can't miss."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry's back at Hogwart's for his second year, and this time trouble starts before he even leaves home. Dobby the house elf tries to warn Harry not to return to school, but Harry is determined to escape the Dursleys for the school year. Dobby's efforts to prevent Harry's return force Ron and Harry to \\"borrow\\" Ron's father's car, which gets them into trouble before the term even gets started. As the year progresses, Harry faces new challenges, including an incompetent new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and a mysterious monster that is attacking students. In the end, Harry has another show down with his nemesis, Lord Voldemort, this time in the form of a teenager recorded in the pages of an enchanted diary.This book continues peel back the layers of Harry's story, and we learn more about Harry and his friends. We also get a more detailed glimpse into Lord Voldemort's history, and begin to see striking similarities with Harry's. Clearly these two are destined for a epic confrontation. The story is well paced, and sprinkled with imagninative humor, making it a pleasure for children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"There is obviously nothing wrong with this book. Truth be told, it took me three times before I completely understood everything.Having read all books released (currently five), Chamber of Secrets has always troubled me. Not because Rowling's story is difficult to comprehend, but because Voldemort is different here. I can speak no further without spoiling anything, but the reader must really pay attention as to what's going on.There is so much going on here, far more than in the first book, that I found myself reading slower, in order to retain as many details as possible. The first book's conclusion makes the reader aware that he or she is not just reading a hack author. These stories are brilliantly thought-out. So obviously the second book will be as complex. This time, the reader is prepared to make mental notes, remember as many of those \\"little\\" details... and still, so much slips through, re-reading the book is almost obligatory to fully enjoy Harry Potter's adventure.Like Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets is a stand alone effort that if, for some strange reason, anyone were to read before any of the other books, the mystery would unfold as any good murder-mystery would. And, both these books are what I would deem murder-mysteries, a wonderful genre, in my opinion. Many of the greatest novels ever penned were classic whodunnit tales. This is one of Rowling's many strengths (and a great addition to the \\"classics,\\" I say).After completing book 2, the reader will come to terms with Rowling's writing style: it is quite simply the most efficient, well organized, humorous, dramatic, and comprehensively detailed style I've come across. Rowling's tales are pure enjoyment, almost hearkening to oral tradition. You feel as if the story is being told to you.While the first book is filled with nervous first-years, here, Harry and his friends are now focusing on adventure (and half the adventure is just getting through those difficult classes!).Rowling's new characters are simply delightful. No two characters are the same, and it is impossible to confuse them with one another. And while my eyes only well-up at the end (Sorcerer's Stone makes me burst into actual tears everytime I read how they win the House Cup), I am moved in a different way... Harry now has a \\"family\\" of friends, young and old alike, and I know, from this point on, he will be protected and loved."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book, a sequel to \\"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone\\", is the second book in a proposed seven-book series following the adventures of one Harry Potter as he advances through Hogwart's School of Wizardry. In the first book, he was eleven years old, a first-year student; in this one, he is twelve and a second-year. This is to be the pattern for the series; each book is to be one year in his school career.Like the first book, this one is a wonderful tale which has deservedly captured the imaginations of most of the fantasy-reading populace (and a fair number of people who DON'T generally read fantasy.) It has all of the elements of a traditional story, with an evil villain and main characters who are good people struggling against that evil and doing heroic things in the process, but it is far from a stereotypical story. The characters have very definite life, and Rowling is a fine writer with a deft touch at a clever turn of phrase, who never lets her desire to show off that talent become distracting, as some lesser authors do. What's more, the books are competently edited and proofread, something of a rarity these days in mass-market paperbacks; I didn't notice a single typo or poor word choice or grammatical error throughout the entire book.This series compares favorably to C.S. Lewis's \\"Narnia\\" series, with which it shares some elements, and if I can't QUITE bring myself to rate it higher than Tolkein's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" saga, that's only because it would seem sacrilege to suggest such a thing (besides, it isn't finished yet; maybe by the time it's done, who knows...)If you have ANY interest in fantasy at all, DO NOT miss this series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the camber of secrets is a very good book and i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy novels. The book far better than the film and I think that the film is rubbish compared with the book. Harry Potter: He is the main character in the story. He is very brave but he also puts his life on the line. Hermione Granger: She is very clever and she loves magic. She is the best in her year at magic.Ron Weasley: He is a red headed boy with many brothers and one sister. His family is sort of poor and he wears second hand robes. Reading the book was very enjoyable and I couldn't put it down. It was a book full of adventure and it felt as if I was there. It was all about him trying to save the school from a terrible monster that lived in the Chamber Of Secrets. Many of his friends blamed him for the creature attacking students. The creature would petrify students which meant that the students would be scared stiff and could not move. An excellent book over all.Reviewed by Seamus Kearney"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Once I finished Book 1 I just couldn't help myself and I picked up THe Chamber of Secrets as fast as I could. I was extremely pleased by this wonderful sequel. Just like the first and third books, I could not put this book down for more than a minute. THis book has caused me many hours of lost sleep. A lot of fellow Harry Potter fans think that this is the weakest book in the series, but I must differ. I think this is just as good, if not better than the other books. Book 2, in my opinion, provides us with some of the most important information in the series(although not as much as Book 4). THe ending was absulutely fabulous(as always), and J.K. Rowling once again retains a certain air of mystery at the end of the book. So, this definitely one of the strongest books in the series and comes just as highly recommended as the rest."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think the story was great because it was very exciting. It kept me turning the pages and reading as fast as I could. It took me a month and a half becuase I was busy with required school reading from Mr. Schrader. This book is the second in the fantasy genre series by J.K. Rowling. The series main character is Harry Potter. He is an orphan who finds himself with magical powers and an invitation to Hogwarts, a special school for wizards. I enjoy Harry as a character because he is adventurous, he never gives up, and is courageous in the face of danger although he may feel fear.The story takes place mostly at Hogwarts during Harry's second year. One of my favorite parts was when Harry and Ron flew the car to Hogwarts and they land in the Whomping Willow. Another exciting part was when Harry talks to the snake at the Dueling Club and found out that he was a parcel toungue, one who has special powers to talk to snakes. Harry and his friends spend most of the book trying to find out who is opening the chamber of secrets and what secrets the chamber holds. Near the end the plot thickens when Harry most save Ron's sister Ginny from the giant snake Basilisk. To find out what happen, you'll have to read the book. I enjoy J.K. Rowlings writing style because it is descriptive, allows my imagination to run wild, and how she builds anticipation and surprises in her books for her readers. Another author in this genre that I would recommend is J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think the story was great.It was very exciting.I liked it when Harry and Ron fly the car to Hogwarts and they land in the Whomping Willow. I also like the part were Harry talks to the snake at the dueling club and found out he was a Parsel tounge. The really exciting part was when he went down to the chamber of secrets to save Ron's sister Ginny. He has to fight the giant snake called the Basilisk. Dumbledores Pheonix named Fawks brings Harry the sorting hat with the sword in it and Fawkes pokes the Basilisks eyes out. I can't wait until the movie for the second Harry Potter book to come out next christmas.I would recomend Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.I thought the whole Harry Potter series is wonderful and exciting.Theres always suprises and it never gets to plain or boring.Once you start reading it you never want to stop.I think the whole Harry Potter series will always be a big hit."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is definatly better than the first Potter book, not saying that I think the first one is terible! I loved this book! This second Potter instalment dives deeper into a more, darker look at the magical wizarding word as the mystical Chamber of Secrets is becoming the talk of Hogwarts. The story starts off with Harry, as usual, sulking at the Dursley's home on Number 4 Private Drive. However, his world is soon pushed back into the magical world as a house elf named Dobby tells Harry that he must not go back to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry if he wishes to avoid mortal danger. Of course Harry kindly sayes no, and decides to go to school, after spending the remainder of the summer with Ron's, one of his wizard friends, family over the remainder of the summer. When Harry arrives at school, things are going well for him. Things are the norm. (Harry's enemy Draco Malfoy is still being his mean self, Professor Snape still hates Harry, and Hermione is still a book worm.) But, a new teacher for Defence Against the Dark Arts is a brainless Celebrity, enter Professor Lockheart. Anyhoo, Soon after Harry and Ron arrive, Harry starts hearing voices in the wall and attacks are made on students, leaving them petrified. Ron, Hermione, and Harry soon start to suspect Malfoy as the suspect, all of the attacks were on witches and wizards of Muggle parentage and Draco hates these people, but are their suspicions right? Read to find out! I can't stress enough how much I liked this book. One of my favorite scenes, besides the end (all of the Harry Potter endings leave me shocked, and gripped in such a way I can't put the book down untill the last page) is in a chapter called the writting on the wall. I love this part because it's so creepy. Harry starts hearing this nasty, cold voice and Ron, Hermione, and Harry find the first victime of the Chamber of Secrets. Filch's cat is hung on a rope, and in silver writting the words The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware. Creepy! The only thing that seemed lacking in this story was the sence that, good gracious, these kids never got caught? They break so many rules and regulations that it seemed bound that at least once they got cought. Also, there is this seen where Ron and Harry fly a car to get to Hogwarts (long story, the magic barrier to the train to Hogwarts was sealed off). Anywhy, Ron and Harry had so many other choices to get to Hogwarts, Rons parent were at the train station and Harry has his owl. It just seemed dumb to me why the took the car.If you have already read the first HarryPotter book and loved it, this will not let you down. It was, in my opinion, better than the first book..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was a very good book. It is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. I thought this book was even better than the first one. It is more exciting and tells you more about Harry's past. It starts off with Harry staying with his horrible aunt and uncle again for the summer, and this summer is worse than any summer before. Harry gets a strange visit from an elf named Dobby; he warns Harry not to go back to school at Hogwarts because horrible things will happen, but Harry doesn't listen to him. Harry's friend Ron and his two older brothers, Fred and George, get Harry out of his house in an amazing escape. Harry stays with the Weasleys for the last couple of weeks of summer and really enjoys it. Ron's little sister Ginny starts her first year of school there. Then Harry goes back to school, and Harry starts off just as he left the year before getting in trouble the first day. There are a lot of mysterious attacks; people keep on turning up turned to stone. For some reason everyone is blaming Harry for the attacks. They think Harry is the heir to Slytherin and that he is the one opening the Chamber of Secrets. So Harry and his friends set out to find out what is going on. Harry finds a mysterious old diary from fifty years ago. It is from a boy who went to Hogwarts. The weird thing about the diary is that Harry can talk to it and it talks back. No one knows what is in the chamber of secrets, or even where it is, or how to open it. All they know is that it is very dangerous, and it hasn't been opened in fifty years."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"An excellent follow up to HP & the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone for those of you in the US of A). It is a little uneven at times, but as JK Rowling has promised, it is just a shade darker than the first novel, which makes it just as enjoyable."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought Harry Potter 2, Chamber of Secrets was a great Book! It was interesting, funny, and such a great story! It didn't have a lot in it about Harry actually fighting the serpant, but i think it made it better. I cant wait to read the next one! I hope Harry gets a \\"love intrest.\\" Oh and i wish there was more about Quidich! But over all EXELLENT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling is a master storyteller, and she has created a new classic series that will be on juvenile bookshelves along with the Wizard of Oz and Through the Looking Glass.I was impressed with the levels of humor (adults can read this and have a good chuckle.) The sheer imagination and wealth of language makes these books very appealing. What's even more impressive is that they apparently translate well into other languages. My German friends are very enthusiastic about Harry Potter \\"auf Deutsch\\" and that is a testament to the superb storytelling ability of the author.There is some gross stuff in this volume: the \\"Deathday Party\\" for Nearly Headless Nick is none too savory (Nick is a ghost who had a botched beheading and now is socially an embarrasing rung below the well-guillotined.) The refreshments at the party are pretty disgusting. Of course, that appeals to kids, who love the sensational and thrilling, and yes, the gross.I'm going to gloss over the controversy over whether these books glorify Paganism and witchcraft. Any fairytale in the last two centuries has a lot of this kind of thing, so if you are going to read a fairytale, that's the kind of stuff that's in there.As a study for how to write a classic fantasy tale, you can't get a better example than Rowling's works.

As an adult, it turns on the world of fantasy and imagination that have been put aside in many of our lives. As a special delight in this book is the wonderful creature named Dobby. You learn to love Dobby as time goes on. Also, I loved the flying car and the impact with the tree. So cute and imaginative. Mr. Dale, the reader, cannot be complimented enough in how he brings each character alive in this series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am reviewing the book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets .

It was fun and exciting and made you anxious to keep reading. I am not someone who really enjoys reading, but give me a Harry Potter book and I don't put it down for days. There are so many exciting things twisted into the story that make you want to keep reading and see what could happen next.I recommend this book to everyone. Old or young, your age does not matter when reading a book like this. It is enjoyable to anyone with a good imagination.Along with all the excitment of magic and hogwarts, J. K. Rowling also had a tale about a boy with a horrible story about living with crud people all his life and the hate that went on with the only family he had left. It made me really apprecite what I have and the people in my life. Imagine how it would be to only be a kid and never have anyone tell you happy birthday or any kind of encouragement whatsoever. Not a happy life if you ask me. But besides that little part of unhappiness, there is an amazing story of young boy with amazing talents! Read this book, you will love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling again captivates readers with Harry Potter's second adventure, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. We join this novel during the summer after Harry's first year at Hogwarts. His uncle has locked up his school things and he has not heard from his friends at all during the vacation. Harry can't wait to return to Hogwarts--until a house elf named Dobby shows up and warns Harry that he must not return to school. Dobby won't explain why and only causes trouble for Harry.When Harry finally does make it to school, the new year doesn't get off to a good start. Then, to make matters even worse, someone or something is petrifying Muggle born students and an eerie message appears that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened again. Unfortunately for Harry, the whole school begins to suspect that he is the one attacking the students.This second book is darker than the first, with more mysteries and adventures. Anyone who loved the mystery in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will love Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Harry, Ron, and Hermione keep readers captivated with their adventures."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is filled with adventure and excitement.

And Dobby is telling Harry that he can't go to Hogwarts. But why...? But Harry has to go, he doesn't want to be tortured by the Dursley's all year.Ms. Rowling weaves the magic of her first novel with more darkness and humor than the first into a great second novel. I dn't think that this is the best novel but it is very good. I would defintetly reccomend this to fantasy and adventure fans."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm fourteen and have read the first two books and now I'm going to read the third, and my ten-year-old brother is also reading them. I do not think these books promote the devil or are evil but provide entertainment for readers. The plots aren't extremely deep and I wouldn't recommend them for a high school reading assignment, but they are good books and I find them fairly realistic. They do NOT promote BAD witchcraft or wizardry, and don't make fun of non-wizards and non-witches. How could this book be trying to lure people into that kind of world if it doesn't even exist? J.K. Rowling seems like a normal person just trying to provide entertainment, and you should give her a break if you seriously think these books are &quot;evil.&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A girl I know has a mom that works in a school. Her mom was walking down the hall one day and saw a girl outside a classroom crying. She asked her what was wrong and the girl said her mom and dad wouldn't let her read the Harry Potter book with the rest of the class. Pesonally I think this is very pathetic and think that those parents should pe shuned from parenting. I am 12 years old and have read all three of the Potter books. They don't teach me hate or make me have dreams about being killed by Dark Lords. The books taught me to expect the unexpected and not to lose my head in an emergency. I think that if you are worried your kid will have nightmares you should read it with them and explain it's not real. No kid should be deprived a book this great. I liked them so much I read all three in 6 or 7 days. Don't deprive your kid because of what an adult mind thinks it's the kids mind that matters. THE BOOKS ARE GREAT READ THEM!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Porter a wizard is back with the Dursleys on summer holiday from Hogwarts, the wizard school. The uneventful wait for the trip back to Hogwarts is punctuated by a dinner party by the Dursleys in which Harry is told to stay quietly in his room. Dobby a house elf with a penchant for self punishment appears to Harry and plead dangers to his life if he return to Hogwarts. A scene is caused with embarrassment and humiliation to the Dursleys. As a result, Harry is locked up permanently in his room with no return trip to Hogwarts. A rescue is made at the Dudleys by Weasleys and thus began Harry's great adventure culminating with a stand off in the Chamber of Secrets.This includes a journey back to Hogwarts in a bewitched flying car with his pal Ron after a failure to enter platform nine and three quarters at King's Cross Station. This ended with a crash and an attack by the crash victim - an ancient tree known as Whomping Willow.Once at Hogwarts, Harry began to enter into the wizard school life with the usuals; quidditch match - a game played on flying broomstick - and boring lessons. However nothing stays usual in a wizard school. Students are found frozen with fright. They can only be cured by mandrake juice - a plant with a fatal cry to anyone who hears it. The cry is let out by the roots of the plant, which is an ugly baby with green and mottled skin.Harry's mortal enemy, Lord Voldemort is at the heart of it all but in a totally unexpected way. This leads Harry into the Chamber of Secrets at which entrance is a disused female toilet haunted by a self-pity ghost.J.K. Rowling is simply magnificent in her story telling. Her imagination and story telling is absolutely brilliant. This might be classified as a children book. Yet any adults with a sense of humour and childhood memories would enjoy this book as much as any child would."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My daughter (9) and I read this book together and we both LOVED it! It was so fantastical that I am not concerned about her taking it seriously, and even when anything bad or scary happened, it was resolved in a way that didn't cause her any worry.I found myself just as excited for our nightly reading sessions as she was and am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K Rowling is amazing! These books are somuch fun to read, and so good! I thought that this was the best out of the series, and it was a book that I couldn't put down! It had so much detail, and so many surprising events. It felt like you atually knew the characters, and were atcually in the book. I love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is not the best of the Harry Potter series, but it is certainly a wildly entertaining and fast read. It is a must read to continue on to the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire, which are both excellent along with the remainder of the series. The movies are also good, but they never do the books full justice."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"There's a special place in the hearts of most fantasy readers for all of the Harry Potter books, but there's no doubt, in my mind, that Rowling's follow-up to HP and the Philosopher's Stone is just not quite as good. That is to say, Chamber of Secrets IS good--very good, in fact--but in this second installment, Rowling has less jaw-droppingly imaginative storytelling and more mystery-thriller stuff.There's a monster buried somewhere at Hogwarts, and people are turning up petrified in the halls. It all has to do with a diary, a kid named Tom, a pet spider, and a ghost in a toilet. To say any more would be a crime, so I'll leave you to it, those of you who haven't read this already (and you know who you are, all twenty-six of you). Suffice it to say, it's up to Harry and his plucky friends Ron and Hermione to unravel a secret apparently beyond the grasp of their teachers ... and if you can believe that, not only will you love this book, you'll love most of the rest of the series even more.In the Potter rankings, with book seven yet to be published, this ranks as superior only to the grossly overwritten \\"Order of the Phoenix\\", but in this series, that's not saying anything bad. Loved it!(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy \\"Teeth.\\")"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Have you ever wanted a lot of suspense in just one book? This book is only about suspense and mysteries. I liked this book because when I started reading it, I couldn't stop reading it. I actually thought I was a character inside the book while I was reading it. My favorite part was when Harry Potter started to fight with Tom Riddle using their own weapons. I say that this book is for every one because I say who ever reads will have fun reading it. This book is about finding the heir of Slytherin and opening the famous chamber of secrets.By Bernardo"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This like all of Rowlings books is a fun read..Harrys in his second year at Hogwarts and of course runs into a miriad of problems, Rowling infuses her books with so adventure, as she has said, she does not write for children, she writes for readers, it's annoying that Amazon says this book is for nine to twelve year olds, it makes you wonder if the people that run this site, read books..anyway, very good book...not the best in the series of course, but they are all five star books and only really separated by length and the strength of the new characters...Id rate the series* Goblet of Fire* Prisoner of Azkaban* Half Blood Prince* Sorcorer's Stone* Chamber of Secrets* Order of the PheonixOh, and read the series in order, it will be much more enjoyable..and the audio books are great, the narrator, Jim Dale, really infuses the characters with life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Once again I have read the adult edition of this second episode and have no idea how different it may be from the children's one.Here the darkest side of Ms Rowling's inspiration takes the upper hand: lost are the fairy-tale-easy language, the good natured examination of both human and magical worlds, the wide eyed discovery of a new enchanted reality of the first episode. Many paragraphs will have you laughing but irony is here tinged with sarcasm, a hard edged nasty one.This second year the Dursleys are not just mean, they are evil, in a everyday sort of way; the school is peopled by young adults struggling to go on in a hostile environment; cheerfulness is always short lived, always replaced by a sense of foreboding: not a book you want your child to read unless he/she is at least 14 and quite mature.This said one can complain about losing one's fairytale but one can still enjoy the proficient plot that keeps one turning page after page.One major flaw: Harry and his friends are supposedly 12 y.o. but they think and behave as if they were 17 or even older; this allows one to relate with them much more easily but it also proves a lacking command of writing skills: Ms Rowling is a competent fantasy writer but not a feather-penned classical children stories genius. Think about Collodi or Saint-Exup&eacute;ry and you will understand what I mean: those stories you already know by heart but you keep on re-reading because you cannot get enough of their delicate, ever changing worlds."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I COULDN'T PUT DOWN THE *#@* BOOK!!!

I just wanted people buying this book to know that."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I did not hestitate to read the second book after I read the first. Like the first book, I became very quickly attached to the book. The mystery and suspense of the whole story grabbed my attention, starting with the first two chapters, where the Dursleys continued their cruelty. Then, strange things start happening in Hogwarts and the reader reads on and on and the whole story leaves you in suspense. You keep wondering Who is the Heir of Slytherin? Why is Dobby doing this? and What on earth will happen next? There was one day when I started reading on page 254 and could not stop reading until I reached page 327. Even with the mystery and gripping plot, it came to a very satisfying ending. An important message also: do not descriminate those who are not like you. If want entertaining reading, you'll find it right here. If you have a kid who doesn't like to read, reading this book will give a love of reading to all children who read it.

This year just has to be better he hopes as Harry loiks forward to learning all sorts of new wizard tricks. But almost from the beginning things go wrong. Harry can't seem to find his way in the train station to track 9 and a half and suddenlt instead he is offerd a magical ride back to school. But as magical as the ride is, problems are waitng for Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione.Strange things are taking palce at the wizard achool and even a noted guest teacher can't help Harry from being suspected of doing these deeds. His enemies continue to stalk his every step and as if that isn't enough he now muct risk his life to find out the riddle of a 50 year old mystery which takes place in an underground chamber.Once again Rowling fills her pages with wonderful characters and tricks of the imagination. And in this book she also begins to introduce more adult themes such as prejudice between Muggles and Non - Muggles children and parents, intolerance and even status. And while I am no longer a child, I found myself joyfully gulping down the first two books in this series. Now as school begins once again and children here return after Labor Day, I will happily spend my days in England at the Hogwarts School leanring about Harry's next adventures and the Prisoner of Azkaban."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second best book in the series after the Goblet of Fire.

This book has a fabulous twist at he end that you'll die for. Don't miss this exquisite piece of literature.

These books are good for all age and I know what some are saying about these books and they are WRONG. So read this book and injoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's going to be another great year at Hogwarts, or is it?Wizards and Witches from Muggle families are being attacked by amysterious monster and someone in the school is responsible.This book though similar in many ways to the first novel is different in just as many ways. In this book you learn quite alot about wizard politics, history and the lives of wizards from the past and present. Though the story line is bewitching, readers may find the story slower moving than The Sorcerer's Stone. There isn't as much of a sense of burden on our hero which makes the story a bit less exciting. In The Sorcerer's Stone, Harry, Hermoine, and Ron were the only ones who could stop a certain someone from stealing something that wasn't his, however in this story everyone wants to know what's going on which makes Harry attempts to solve the mystery seem less significant. Also Harry has to constantly be convinced that he is in danger, so you are not scared about his safety. However the book was an great read. As in book one, it's full of suprises and chock full of laughter and it has an ending that will stun you. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is all set to start his second year of hogwartswhen he gets a warning not to go back.

When my mom saw it on my Christmas list, she asked me why I, a 25 year old college grad, would want a kid's book? I told her that I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So she bought it for me and I put off reading it until about a month ago. Surprisingly, I was hooked. So I rushed out and bought book 2. I know that everyone has been going on about how wonderful the books are, but I am pleasantly surprised by the depth of these books. The &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; has so many layers that I found it hard to keep track of at times. However, the book itself is so engrossing, I read it in one sitting. Although Harry is only a teenager, Rowling writes him in such a way that people of all ages can either look forward to being that age and having similar situations and thoughts, or look back on when their lives were much simpler. The reader is led through Harry's struggle to understand what being a wizard is all about and who is really is.

That especially seems to be the case when the magical platform to board the Hogwarts train mysteriously closes, leaving Ron and Harry to find a way to get to Hogwarts on their own. The magical adventures are just beginning, and Ron and Harry are off to a whole new year of wizardry and wonder at Hogwarts. The battle of good vs. evil continues as Harry hunts for the mysterious Chamber of Secrets. This is a great book of fun, fantasy, and fiction for young and old alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm 14-year-old girl from Indonesia.

In this book there is an even greater plot and it has a twist that you'd find in a Stephen King or John Grisham novel. In this second installment Harry turns 12 and he is ready for his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After a car lift in the middle of the night from Ron and his two brothers they fly to the Burrow, the home of the Weasleys. There Harry is introduced to the family and Hermione is there.

We find Harry at the end of summer vacation before returning to school: mean relatives, and the expectation of going back to school (that right there is fictitious!)Again, an influx of some off-the-wall characters makes this story delightful. The fame obsessed Dark Arts teacher is the funniest...all text books are his own works.We find Harry and his adventureous friends hearing rumors about the Chamber of Secrets, and the Heir of Slytherin: The one house that has produced the most dark wizards. But people (and Mrs. Norris, the cat) pop up petrified, and rumor suddenly becomes reality. The mysterious Heir of Slytherin is bound to unravel Hogwarts at its foundations.The junior sleuths find their way to the Chamber of Secrets, and Harry once again to the Dark Lord himself, Voldemort.

The imagery is vivid, and the characters real in their response to the circumstances in which they find themselves. We learned from their mistakes and triumphs.

He does great voices and adds lots of excitement to the story. And amazingly the voices he uses are very similar to the voices used in the movies. I was afraid that after reading the books and seeing the movies that listning to Harry Potter on tape would just be too much and I would start to get sick of it, but I was so wrong. I plan to listen to these books on tape over and over again.

Nothing to disappoint and always enough detail to keep it interesting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After finally caving in and picking up the first Harry Potter, I became hooked, just like everyone else (hey, I like to fit in!). I think I had even more fun reading the second Harry, as I spent most of the first one getting used to all the wonderful witches and wizards (and some not so wonderful ones). During the second one, I felt like a proud veteran, who could immediately jump into the action, with a smirk on my veteran face.Goodness, I didn't think it could get any better! The story opens with Harry's crazed uncle Vernon, and Harry's subsequent flight (quite literally) to Hogwarts, to start his second year at school of wizardry. Hissing walls, dark lords, Phoenixes and talking diaries are just some of the delights that ring so true, even if learned people say they are impossible. Harry is famous among wizards, but that fame gives Harry more heartache than anything else. But Harry does not back away and confronts everything that is thrown at him, with no pretenses of being fearless. Harry is as real as any one of us.It is official now - I am a Harry Potter addict. I could have quit after the first one, but now that is no longer a possibility. Looking forward to reading the third one!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is a twelve year old orphan in his second year at school. Witches and wizards school that is, and let me tell you things are not going well at Hogwarts School for witchcraft and wizardry.

The worst part of all is that Harry is the prime suspect!Everyone is pointing to Harry, everyone except his best friends Ron and Hermione. Then Harry's problems go from bad to worse as he finds the diary of an old Hogwarts student. This is not a normal diary because when you write in it, it writes back. Harry also discovers secrets about the diary, his friend Hagrid, his parents, Voldemort (his parents killer), and himself.J.K Rowling does an excellent job of making Harry and the other characters come to life. She does this by taking her time to show details and was proven when she sold over one million copies of this book.

Not only does Harry once again fight against those who would do him harm: but he gets to outsmart a giant snake. In this book we get to learn some more about Hermonie, Ron, Harry's family, but we learn that something was passed on to him, the night he got his scar. If you have only seen the movies based on the series, you are missing out. The books go more in depth on the characters and the plot. The movies (although very good) tend to skip over parts of the book. My suggestion is to read the books first, then watch the movies.

She has a charming sense of humor."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am 46 years old and when I found out the Harry Potter Books were on Audio I had to have them to go along with all the other Harry Potter stuff I already have. Actually, my Aunt Bea bought me my first set, Book One The Sorcerer's Stone, about a month ago and I have been addicted ever since. I love the way the reader, Jim Dale, reads. He takes you right into the books and brings them to life with his different voices for different characters. The way he reads you can tell who the characters are before he even says who's speaking. He is an awesome reader. I listen to the books over and over again, while driving in my car, cleaning my house, working in the yard and even in bed before I fall asleep. It's like being a kid all over again and having someone tell you a bedtime story. I appreciate J. K. Rowling for bringing the magic back into my life. My 5 year old grand daughter listens to the books as well. She has grown up with Harry Potter. It is a wonderful tale of love, hardship, grief, inner strength, courage, friendship, challenge, sportsmanship, compassionship and much, much more. There are many life lessons in these books that, I think, are wonderful for children, as well as adults, to learn. Everyone should have the pleasure of hearing the Harry Potter books read you them.

I thought all it would be about is witch craft and it wasn't. It was about children working together, using communication skills, and overcoming their fears. I think everyone should read this book.Every child and adult can relate to Harry when he is being made fun of by Peeves. Peeves sang the song, \\" Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You're killing off students, you think it's good fun--\\". At some point in everyone lives they are made fun of, and I could just feel the hurt that Harry was feeling. J.K. Rowling did a great job in her descriptive words to make you imagine that you are actually in England. At times in my mind I could actually see Hogwarts school of Witch craft and Wizardry. I loved this book more than i thought possible."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the first fictional mystery that I have read, and I'm so happy I did I loved this book; I have nothing but great things to say about it. It's so hard to put down. Rowling did a great job, she's so creative! I didn't read the first Harry Book of the series, but I could figure out what was going on, and what had pretty much happened in the first book. Harry and his two best friends do a great job of finding out who is responsible for TRICKING someone into opening the secret chamber. Harry, what a brave wizard! This was a fun read that I couldn't put down. EVERYONE should read it. Any age group would like it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This engaging sequel follows Harry and his friends through their second year at Hogwarts. With the concept of magic already introduced, the book expands characters from the first novel and also further develops the world of magic. The first third is laced with humour, illustrating Rowling's flair for invention. The middle section mostly deals with setting up the mystery of the chamber of secrets, and the ending is an inevitable and frightening confrontation between Harry and the hideous monster of the chamber.Although the setting is a school for learning magic, the kids behave pretty much the same as they would in any school, and this is what makes the novel so accessible to young readers. There are bullies, mean teachers, rivalry between sports teams and many other problems that most kids have to face. The writing is so original, however, that it should hold adult's interest as well (it certainly held mine). Racism in schools is also touched upon in an original and surprising way.There is just something about the Harry Potter books that make them a cut above the rest. Other children's authors write about imaginary worlds but to me, the result is never quite so effective. The Harry Potter books are already classics and I hope they will be passed on for many generations to come."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought that this book was really exiting and i could not put it down! It's great for all ages and this is really one of the best series of books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I enjoy each and every one of the Harry Potter books buy JK Rowling. I find her to be a very gifted writer. I wish that the movies were on the same story lines. So many things are deleted, so reading the books first and then seeing the movies help to pull the plots together. She explains things in her books that are not mentioned in the films. I recommend the book to anyone 12 and older. Some of the things in these books along with some of the words can be a little difficult for younger children. Events and characters can be a tad scary."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets! There is still a magical charm that lures you in, and keeps you begging for more. Reading this second book has definitely set my determination in reading the remainder of the series. After Goblet of Fire, I will anxiously await the release of the new books.This book starts with the same scene as in the first book...Harry Potter is staying with his relatives, The Dursleys, over summer break. They treat him the same, while fearing his magic at the same time. During the summer, Harry doesn't receive any letters from Hermione, Ron, and Hagrid, and believes his friends to have deserted him. Then, a little house elf named Dobby comes to Harry and begs him not to return to Hogwarts because he is in danger. Dobby also reveals that he has been intercepting Harry's mail. After Harry stays firm on returning to Hogwarts, Dobby causes havoc with the Dursleys, causing them to lock up Harry. The Weasley boys rescue Harry and they start off the year together.Right off there are some mishaps, and changes that everybody has to deal with. Some include the flying car that crashes, the arrogant new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and Ron's broken wand.Then, something terrible starts happening. Students (and a cat) have been turning up...petrified; practically turned to stone! People begin suspecting Harry as the Heir of Slytherin, who can open up the Chamber of Secrets and release whatever is attacking the students. Harry finds a diary from 50 years before, and it turns out to explain much more than first appearance.Truly marvelous tale!

Like I said this is a great book and I think that everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"JK Rowling gives us the second installment to the Harry Potter saga in THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, which covers his second year at Hogwarts, the school of wizardry and magic. Rowling knows how to spin a good yarn, and &quot;this Potter is hotter&quot; than its predecessor.Harry returns for the summer to the Dursley household, much to their chagrin, for they would wish him out of their lives. They give Harry much more respect this time around due his learning the art of wizardry, until Uncle Vernon discovers that Harry cannot use his magic on a Muggle, because it is against school rules. Almost immediately, Harry's life becomes a living hell again, even to the point of Uncle Vernon chaining him up in his room. It is here that Harry meets an interesting little creature named Dobby, who warns him not to return to Hogwarts for fear of his life; nevertheless, Harry does not heed his advice and returns. This sets the stage for an interesting plot.Harry quickly discovers that Dobby was correct in his assessment. At Hogwarts, danger looms around every corner, but all are warned by the writing on the wall, &quot;THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED, ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.&quot; What does this mean? Who is the HEIR? Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the reader will have to discover answers to these questions before it is too late! It is and could be a petrifying experience for all.Rowling builds on some of the characters introduced in the first edition. Harry's Slytherin enemy, Draco Malfoy, is still up to his old tricks and possibly more, along with his father, Lucius Malfoy, a major player in the story. Moaning Myrtle, the bathroom queen, returns with a bigger role in this book. Remember she is the ghost that lives in the toilet, the one with the terrible self-esteem. Rowling introduces new characters into the story as well. There is Gilderoy Lockhart, the famous Gilderoy Lockhart, the author of many of the textbooks at Hogwarts, who does NOT lack in self-esteem, and Ginny, the little sister of Ron Weasley, begins her first year.THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a wonderful read as the author keeps the reader turning another page, so get ready for an exciting adventure with Harry and the Gang as they face the powers of the Dark Arts...again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is my favorite Harry Potter book. It is very exciting. Many people think that Harry Potter is bad because it deals with magic and withcraft, and that it will set a bad example for kids. But just because kids read it dosen't mean that we will want to do witchcraft! I am christian and I have never wanted to do witchcraft. Harry Potter is a great book and I suggest that you read it"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I very much enjoyed the first Harry Potter book, and I opened this one expecting to see more of the same. While I did find it very well-written and original, I was a little surprised by the tone of this book, which chronicles Harry's second year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Of course, JK Rowling spent a good part of the first book introducing us to Harry and the characters and locations that share his world. There's not as much need for this here. Rowling proceeds on the assumption that you've read the first book (as she should), and jumps right into the plot with little in the way of character introduction.Someone or something unknown is attacking students at Hogwarts, and the evidence begins to pile up and point to Harry. Some of it is so convincing that Harry starts to think that maybe he IS involved somehow. He, along with his friends Ron and Hermione, begins to investigate the strange happenings in order to clear his name, and stumbles right into a 50-year old mystery. All of this takes place amid a backdrop of school life, including a plot to discredit Headmaster Dumnbledore, and of course, a few Quidditch scenes (though not enough to satisfy me.)There are a couple of new characters introduced here - The new Dark Arts teacher, replacing Professor Quirrell from the first book, and Moaning Myrtle, a ghost who haunts the first-floor girls' bathroom. We also learn a little more about the history of Harry's nemesis, Draco Malfoy, and his father, Lucius.AS I've mentioned, this book has some parts in it that are fairly dark and disturbing, though nothing any worse than R. L. Stine. All in all, a worthy sequel to the excellent debut. I look forward to reading the next book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Exceedingly better than the first book which I enjoyed tremendously. This book has the advantage of not requiring lengthy character introductions. However in the book's beginning chapters the author has intermittently provided brief overviews about the first books events. Although helpful to novice Harry Potter reader begining with book two, the overviews can be somewhat distracting to the veteran reader who is anxiously anticipating future happenings. Thankfully most of the first book's information is successfully regurgitated early on and both novice and veteran reader alike are quickly boarded on the Hogwart's Express. This book's plot tends to be more suspenseful and intricate. With each successive chapter the reader is involved more deeply in this magical mystery. In summary I can only comment on the fact that I have begun book three without hesitation."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is now our favorite bedtime reading. We love the characters, and Ms. Rowling does a great job of developing a sense of place. Incidentally, &quot;we&quot; are two kids in our late thirties. Friendship, loyalty, and bravery are appealing at any age. We bought the hardcovers - I plan to re-read these a few times while I wait impatiently for the next 3 books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter gets locked in his room, because Dobby knocks over a bowl of Aunt Petunia's sugared violets.

Proffesor Snape catches them and they get into detention before the first day. Suddenly, strange things start to happen. First, Mrs. Norris is turned into stone,and then students! When Hermione gets turned into stone, Harry and Ron decide to help Proffesor Lockheart, who gets chosen by the staff members to go retrieve the student that has been taken into the chamber itself.

The ending to this book is very good. So far all of the Harry Potter books that I have read have had really good endings.

Later in the book Harry, finds out about the chamber of secrets and whatever is in the chamber is making some kids petrified when it looks them straight in the eyes."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It was a ok book but it was not a very interesting book to read. You might like the book, so if you enjoy Harry Poter books or J.K Rowling's books then this is a book for you.

If you are 98 or 12, please pick this book up and start reading the life of Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I bought the first four harry potter books about a year ago and did not have the time to read them until last week. I was wondering why the series was such a big hit and I found out. The books put you in a made up world you do not want to stop reading about.After reading the first book, I had to go read the second one right away. That is how engrossing the books are. I could not put this book down either. I do not want to talk about the actual plot of the story for fear of giving something away. All I can say is that, after reading the second book in the series, I want to tread the thir. A very enjoyable read. This series is fun. If that is what you are looking for get this book. You wouldn't want to skip it because each book represents a year of Harry Potter's life at the Hogwarts school. I read in a biography magazine article that Rowlings plans to do 7 books total, one for each year of schooling. GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I rated this book a three star, and the three reasons why i did is First, I thought the author had a good imagination, she made cars fly and a certain plant had a baby growing. Second, I thought she was very discriptive, she described certain things like the whomping willow tree that crushed a flying car and she described how the tree looked. Third, I thought it was interesting. At one part there was a dead cat hanging from a torch post. The age group i rated this book for was grade six or you could say eleven year olds, and interest would be witchcraft and wizardry. In sixth grade they kind of get into books that might be similar. And they might read discriptive books like this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a wonderful book about a famous wizard, who lives with his muggle aunt,uncle and cousin.

I thought that Harry was the best because he played tricks. Harry kept getting away with everything even though his uncle treated him bad. The dwarf kept coming up in strange places and no one else saw him except for Harry. There was one part when Harry was at school. Harry and his friends were trying to get something upstairs. He was not allowed to go upstairs but he did it anyway by waiting until everyone else was asleep. He got caught but again got out of trouble. He is a good person to play sneaky tricks. Harry could also use his magic cape to get anywhere he wanted to go.

It will grab your attention from the beginning, and won't let go until the very last page. Doesn't matter how late at night it is, or how early you have to be up the next morning, you won't put this one down. I'm in my mid-20's, and I still couldn't put the book down. However, word of warning to parents of younger children, this book is much more intense, and much scarier than the first Harry Potter book. This book may not be suitable for younger children (9 or under). Towards the end of the book, Harry encounters hordes of spiders...one of the size of an elephant! Yikes! Then, the battle between Harry and the 20-foot serpent occurs. It is extremely well written, but may frighten younger children. With that said, it is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it (for anyone over the age of 10)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Chamber of Secrets, which was built centuries ago by Salazar Slytherin, was opened by the Heir to Slytherin (Tom Riddle) through none other than...

I'll say one more thing, Hogwarts needs a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! So get reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a great book for ages 6 and up. It is one of my favorite books. It is a book that you never want to set down. It is so exciting. Something is always happening. Harry Potter and his best friend Ron are very adventurous in this book. I suggest that you read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone first to understand the 2nd book better. I really enjoyed reading it and I hope my review helped you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was introduced to the Harry Potter books by my 9 1/2 year old son and I didn't really know what to expect... I was very plreasantly surprised when I loved all 3 of them! I had a to giggle at a negative review of &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; that was written by a 16 year old; she/he spent more time slamming anyone who enjoys the books than actually writing about the book itself and I got the feeling that she/he wanted to hear her/himself go on and on. She/he also said that the only reason that these books are popular is because of media hype, but my intorduciton to the books shoots down that theory. &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; picks up where &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; left off and I found myself instantly swept away with Harry and the gang. Rowling uses tidbits from the first book and I also know, from having read the third installment, that she will continue to weave the web further as more about Harry' s past and future is revealed. It's fun to hate the Dursleys, Snape and the Malfoys and it's a kick to love the charming Weasleys and the kindly, but strict teachers at the wizard school. And I love Harry, Ron and Hermione because they continue to be typical kids, albeit kids who happen to be magic. Rowling's desciptions are very vivid, her characters are very well fleshed out and the story is extrememly compelling. I'd recommend this book to kids above 7 or 8 (depending on their reading level) and to all adults who enjoy being swept away by a book that has a wry sense of humor and an engaging plot."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I first started with the series one year ago when I was 12 and went on a holiday to London (I'm from Israel) I am a book collector and quit mad on books, I saw that everybody was very ecxited about some book so I decided to buy the first book, The minute I started reading it I couldn't stop - it was wonderfull, I read through the night and when I finished it I read it again and again, I counted about 14 or more times. after that I bought the second book and the third they are all very nice and cool and I can't wait for the fourth book to come out! I would recomend this book not only for 9-12 years old but for 11-17. it is about Harry Potter (12 years old in this book) and his adventures in Hogwarts (A school for witchcraft and wizardry in England), There is alot of magic, evil and fun, I hope yoy will read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I can't tell you how amazed I am at how the kids I have taught have grabbed hold of Harry! I'm glad, because these are well-written, and intensely exciting. Far better to read HP than most of of the other boy-hero books. Harry is not the snide rich kid saves all through rejecting the 'wisdom' of adults kinds of tales (anything Macauley Culkin has ever done, for example).In all, the Harry Potter books are intelligent. For the kids who think the Babysitters Club or Goosebumps are the best the world, start with Harry. Then work your way over on the shelf to read the Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis.Will there be a fifth, sixth or seventh Harry?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book of the Harry Potter series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, begins were the first book ends. The Dursleys are so mean to Harry that summer that all he wants to do is to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, elfish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. And bad things do happen. For Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise. Someone or something starts turning Hogwarts students into stone. And everyone at Hogwarts suspects Harry Potter himself!In &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, J.K. Rowling has written a brilliantly imagined and beautifully written fantasy. This book relates very well to the young readers because Harry himself is just an early teen experiencing his first years in what Americans refer to as high school. This book lets the reader's imagination run wild. Rowling introduces the reader to not only a whole new world we never knew existed, but also to new forces and creatures."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is great!

In the book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets all sorts of magical and creepy things happen. Like at the beginning a house elf causes all kinds of mischief and tricks to keep Harry from going back to school, like; making a cake fall on someone's head, making loud noises, and taking all of the letters Harry's friends have sent him. When Harry finally gets his school shopping done, he and Ron can't get through the doorway, because Dobby the house elf, decides to block it. After finding an alternative ride to Hogwarts, Harry is happy to see an old friend Hermione Granger. After a couple of days at Hogwarts, the first bad thing starts to happen, a cat is petrified, and Harry is to blame. After Hermione gets petrified, Harry gets a clue to whom is doing this to his friends. The creature to blame is the Basilisk, an ancient, 80 foot, serpent that only Harry and the memory of Tom Riddle can speak to. When Harry finds out that Tom is really Lord Voldemort, Harry gets angry and uses the sword of Godfrey Gryffindor to defeat the Basilisk. Thus saving Hogwarts again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a book that all people should read. This is because it opens a high level of imagination and adventure. It shows that if you take risks and persevere, you can perform astonishing achievements. Although it does promote witchcraft and rule-breaking, it is a classic piece of literature that will be in most peoples minds for ages to come."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Chamber of Secrets is every bit as enjoyable to both younger and older readers as the first Harry Potter adventure. However, this time JK Rowling is starting to find her groove as she weaves a more interesting and intricate plot. However, readers are left with a feeling that this book is just a filler relating the events of Hogwarts' 2nd year without breaking any new ground."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Although its been quite a while since the Harry Potter series first came out, I'd never really gotten into the whole thing. Now, I wonder why I didn't. I finished Socerer's Stone in about a day; Chamber of Secrets in about two. I was absolutely captivated by Harry and his magical adventures, as J.K. Rowling builds more and more upon his character, as well as the plot and theme.After having an eventful year at Hogwarts in his first year, Harry returns for what might be hoped is a relatively calmer second year. WRONG! Even before school starts, a house-elf comes to visit Harry telling him NOT TO GO BACK TO HOGWARTS, and Ron, Fred and George Weasley rescure him from his locked-up room on Privet Drive. A run-in with the Whomping Willow gets Harry into trouble eve before he enters the castle at school.Soon, Harry, Ron and Hermione are on a quest to find the Heir of Slytherin. Why are so many people at Hogwarts being Petrified? What is the Chamber of Secrets? This and more our three heroes will find out, as Harry finds a diary that gives him a glimpse into the past. A fun new character who enters in this book is Professor Lockhart, a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who is completely in love with himself and the fame he has acquired.A very engaging read; fun for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter two, didn't have as much going on as the first book, but had much more suspense.

I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I know that lots of people enjoy the plotting, scale and darker style of Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, but Chamber of Secrets really is, if you'll excuse the clich&eacute;, magical. Hogwarts and Rowling's world seem more realized. We get a first look into the lives of the Weasleys (best supporting family ever), and wizarding outside Hogwarts and Diagon Alley proper. The adventure always seems urgent, after all the lives and health of friends are on the line, but the real villian is, after all, only a shadow and not flesh and blood like in the other three books. No problem is insurmountable as long as Harry and company have their wits about them. Truth and friendship win in the end, the pompous are humbled and evil is defeated, plus the heroes and heroines are still able to have fun. Maybe it wears its relationship to classic children's adventure and fantasy a little too proudly, where all of the above happens in spades, but I don't care, I haven't had this much fun since I read The Box of Delights."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is about Harry Potter in Hogwart school for witchcraft and wizardry the second year.

Also the mystery surrounding Hagrid's past come to light.Author J.K. Rowling's very worthy sequel is a sheer delight and continues the series in grand style. Ms. Rowlings has an uncanny way of setting up each story like a giant rollercoaster ride, ones that quicky approaches an incline, the journey up and then the ride back down where the reader is hanging on for the ride of their life. As a reader I became aware of a \\"darker\\" turn in the series with this second novel and I'm eager to see if this continues with the other books in the series as well. As Peeves the ghost would say \\"Potter, you rotter\\" to which I add \\"You're wonderful.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I just finished the book for my second time and I caught some things I missed the first time.

What an amazing book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read the first book before the movie and loved it. Now that the second movie is coming out, I thought, better read the book 1st. Wow! glad I did. This book is so well written that you will not want to put ot down.

It about how they blame Hargid that it was him who unleashed the monster in the chamber of secret fifty years ago. How Harry and his friend try to stop the guy or girl who keep on opening the chamber."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading the first Harry Potter book, I fell in love with J.K. Rowling's imaginative mind and ability to put it on paper. In the book HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, Harry returns to Hogwarts, school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and meets an all new challenge. Harry returns to the Quiditch field for practices and games, he meets up with his old friends and his big buddy Hagrid, and even get into a few duels with his nemesis, Draco Malfroy. After strange occurences started happening around campus, Harry is determined to find the culprit who is putting very serious spells on the rest of his classmates and risks his life to help all those around him. It is exciting to read about Harry as he discovers secrets about himself and his past. There is so much comedy in the book between Harry and his two best friends, Ron and Hermine, but it will also keep you on the edge of your seat itching to find out what happenes next. I would recomend this book to anyone no matter their age. J.K. Rowling has broken the barrier of children book and adult reading and has entertained many of all ages. I give HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 5 stars and I can't wait to continue reading the rest of the books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book was a great book filled with suspence, and thrillers around every corner.

This book is full of emotion. Sometimes it is sad ,or serious, but most of the time very funny. What I like to do is as I read, I play a movie in my head of the words I have read and some things were so imaginative I couldn't picture them. Harry is always suspecting Malfoy of everthing, is it Malfoy this time or not?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"...\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" was not a perfect ten. I enjoyed the follys of the first book a bit more, but I must say...I am utterly hooked. I think having seen the Harry Potter movie even made reading this second chapter of his school years even more enjoyable. The movie gives us mental images to play with while we adventure through Harry Potter's world. All the old favorite characters are still there...Hermione, Ron, Harry, the professors, and Hagrid (my favorite big guy).In book 2 poor Harry is still surviving the horrors of the Dursley's home...but magic and adventure soon come to the rescue, only to \\"land\\" our favorite boy in a most difficult and frustrating school year. In this book secrets are unlocked. We discover some amazing secrets from the past of our favorite characters and Hogwarts itself.I adored this book. The 4 and a half stars are given because I felt the ending of this book was O.K...not phenomenal like the last. As always a Harry Potter novel keeps you on the edge of your seat, but the ending seemed a bit rushed and lazy to me. However, perhaps I should give the book 4 and 3/4 stars since the other 99.9% quantity of the book is amazing. I can't wait for the next Quidditch match! The adrenaline of catching the Golden Snitch gives me goosebumps! Onward Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was my favorite book this year. The reason I like the book is because sometimes it had lots of action. Like when Harry was trying to defet the bathil (snake).It also had great made up animals. Like the Phenix or the bathil. When he saved people people everyone forgave him for thinking he opend the chamber of secrets. Like Ernie from Hufflepuff.Some of the other reasons I love this book is becauseall the petrified people became unpetrified, but most of all that Harry Potter saved the day again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Wizard-in-training Harry Potter's summer with his Muggle aunt, uncle, and cousin hasn't gone well. When an unidentified wizarding family's house elf turns up at the worst possible time, to warn Harry not to go back to Hogwarts School, the elf causes so much trouble that it looks as if Harry may not be allowed back. But with help from the family of his school friend Ron Weasley, Harry returns to Hogwarts anyway - after which someone or something starts turning the wizarding school's students to stone.Who is \\"Slytherin's heir\\"? Is it Hagrid, the groundskeeper who was expelled during his long ago boyhood? Is it Harry's dearest enemy, Draco Malfoy? No one knows. But unless Harry and his friends can find out, soon, the school will have to close.Since I can only take just so much of Harry's horrible Muggle relatives, the opening chapters seem slow to me. Once the Weasleys enter the narrative, though, things pick up. The rest of the tale is a page-turner. Rowling's humor relieves the tension at just the right moments, and the new characters she introduces more than hold their own among those we already know and love (or hate!). Another excellent book in a series destined to join the ranks of children's classics."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is such a great book. I think it is 10 times better than the first one. There is triple the action. I think the best part is when they play Quidditch it's really exciting! Dobby tells Harry not to go back to Hogwart's, but Harry doesn't listen and there is much trouble ahead! I don't want to give it away so that's it. But i definetly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book begins with Harry back at Privet Drive with his horrible aunt, uncle, and cousin. Then on the night of his uncle's big meeting with a new customer for his drill company, a strange looking creature visits Harry in his bed room and warns him of awful things that will happen at Hogwarts in the up-coming year. This creature is the house elf Dobby. Dobby causes trouble for Harry so life at Privet drive worsens. Then Harry's best friend, Ron, and his two older twin brothers, Fred and George, fly their father's bewitched car to rescue Harry from the Dursleys. During the year at Hogwarts, a number of students become petrified by a creature that is loose in the school. The rumors of the Chamber of Secrets begin to spread throughout the school and it is believed to be opened once again. Many people believe that it is Harry who is the heir of Slytherin, which means that he would be the person responsible for the students, ghost, and cat that were petrified. To find out who the real heir of Slytherin and opener of the Chamber of Secrets you'll have to read the book for yourself!This book was exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. It was impossible to put down and I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, thrills, and a little bit of mystery all in one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Summer didn't start out too good for Harry Potter. The Dursleys' were just as terrible as before. All Harry wanted to do is go back to Hogwarts the School of Witch Craft and Wizardry. He gets a warning from a elf named Dobby, to not return to Hogwarts or terrible things will happen.The elf was right. During Harry's second year at Hogwarts, new terrors occur. He is left to deal with a self-centered proffesor names Gilderoy Lockheart. He has to try to pass his classes while in between new potions turning one of his best friends, Hermione, to cat, Ron's little sister Ginny who is head over heals about Harry, and Moaning Myrtle in the girls bathroom.These turn out to be the least of his worries, when the myth of the Chamber of Secrets returns to haunt everyone, leaving students petrified. Someone had to reopen the chamber, but noone knows who. Could the person be Hagrid, who was accused of doing the same deed in the past? Could Draco Malfoy be doing it, who seems to be joyous about the tragedy. Or could it be Harry Potter himself, who is believed to do so by all the students."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This wasn't as great as the first book.

It's got more staying power than any of the other books, except possibly for book 1.I absolutely LOVED book three, but once you know all the secrets, it doesn't hold up as well in the re-telling. Chamber of Secrets however never get's old even after you know all about Tom Riddle and Dobby. There are some heavy concepts covered in this book (racism, time-travel, death, ostracism) so each time you listen to the cds, you pick up something that you didn't see in it before.If you've never read the Harry Potter books, seen the 2nd movie, and think you know this book, think again! Director Chris Columbus did as good a job as could be expected on the movie, but the book is too awesome to overlook. Jim Dale's reading makes it come so alive!

The Dursleys are so mean and hideous over the summer that all Harry wants is to go back to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors and some minor annoyances arise, and then the real trouble begins.Readers don't have to be a wizard or a kid to appreciate the spell cast by Harry Potter. Harry himself is the perfect confused and unassuming hero. Any willing person will be interested in all the adventurous moments throughout the book. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a delightful romp. J.K. Rowling leaves the door wide open for a third book or a series; bedazzled readers will surely clamor for one.

One might think that Rowling herself has been to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with as much detail that she manages to incorporate in her book about the school and the three main characters: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasly.This book is for anyone who enjoys adventure and mysteries or has a vivid imagination, and wants to explore the possibilities of a magical world where people can cook, clean, and get to the store all with a wave of their wand holding hands. Rowling has created a world where the unreal becomes reality and what most can only imagine is an everyday occurrence in the lives of her characters."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Following the huge success of her first book, J. K. Rowling reintroduce us to the magical world of Harry Potter. In the sequel, Harry once again faced a lethal yet unknown threat which petrified (turn into stone) many of his colleagues. The structure and pacing of the book is close to the first one yet it still manages to create enough suspense and surprise along the way, so that the readers can hardly put the book down. As addictive as it is, there are some points I do not like about this book. First, some characters, e.g. Lockhart or the Dursleys, are stereotypical to the extreme that it got annoying. I understand that this is a book for young reader but I believe that young audiences can be intelligent enough to appreciate characters that are multi-dimensional. Second, this book may send a wrong message to children, being as successful as it is. In this sequel, Harry did almost every illegal things to achieve what he wanted, e.g. steal, lie, or hurt other people. Worse, he went away unpunished at most of those things. That is not the way it works in real life, isn't it?, even if you did it for a good cause. Despite all these, I still enjoy this book immensely and finish it in only two days. However, parents would be advised to communicate with their kids after they read this book to prevent children from embracing wrong ideas."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, written by J. K. Rowling is probably the best adventure book one might end up reading in his lifetime. It is a book packed with turns and twists that will keep you on your toes. This book starts off very slowly when Harry's summer comes to an end and he has to go back to wizard school from his relatives' home, the Dursley's house. As Harry is packing all of his bags, the young boy receives a warning from a strange creature that goes by the name of Dobby. Dobby tells Harry that some sort of disaster will strike his school, and maybe him. Harry is not that scared. Harry leaves the house to go to the train station but is too late. The heavy train is puffing its way all the ways back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry without him and Ron. The young boy is left clueless of what to do so he goes to his only other resort, his friends' flying car. Just a couple of miles after they take off, Harry and Hermonie crash into a huge whomping willow tree. As Harry gets into his second year of wizard school, he suspects that his friend, Draco Malfoy is out to kill him somehow. Mysterious walls having weird words appear on the walls signifying the Chamber of secrets has been reopened. Day by day more weird stuff is happening at the school. Ron, Harry's best friend, and Hermoine, the smartest person at the school who makes almost perfect A's, accompanies Harry Potter to solve this odd 40-50 year old mystery-taking place at Hogwarts. As the story comes to an end, the three-person trio finally find a way into the chamber of secrets. There inside of the chamber lay one of the people Harry suspected the whole time, Voldemort. Voldemort was the darkest and most evil wizard Harry knew. He was the wizard who killed Harry Potter's Parents and now he is out for Harry. The story's problem comes to an end when Harry takes a huge sword and jab it right into Voldemort's heart. Just like every other story, there is peace and everyone lives happily ever after. I believe that the author has a typical lesson to teach kids that read this story. The lesson is never give up. Harry Potter in this story is a guy that does not believe in giving up. He is willing to go down fighting. Throughout the story people really try to scare Harry away from wizard school. Harry just does not get scared away. He just turn, his fears into little mini adventures. This book was one of the best books I have ever read. The author J. K. Rowling writes in perfect detail, only leaving room for one to wonder about what happens next. It is an easy read, but has just enough length to make the enjoyment to last a while. I would like to recommend this to anyone that is under the age of 16. Anyone over the age of 15 may think that Harry Potter is just too much of a baby book, so I believe that 16 and under is a good age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was completely hooked after reading the first book in the series -- I'll never forget the innovative descriptions of quiddich, the Hogwarts School, the magic wand selection and the hat sorting. After the magic and inspiration of the first book, I found this book just a tad disappointing, and I mean JUST a tad. Still, it's great stuff and I recommend it because you'll need the plotline before reading the 3rd one in the series which was just excellent. I can't wait until my 3 year old is old enough to understand the whole series. Even though I loved Beowolf, I still think Rowling deserved the Whitbread Prize as hers was an original work, not a translation."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think Harry Potter is so, so cool! Every thing is sosurprising, interesting, and fun. In my opinion this is the best bookin the series (so far.)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"OK, while the series may not be the defining literary work of the 20th century, it IS an extraordinary tale. I agree with some posters, that Ms. Rowlings prose is not the best, nor is her character development, etc. etc. But these book DO have the ability do get one lost in a world of magic and wizardry, and that's really all that matters. Love it, like it, or hate it, I'd bet no one put this away without finishing it, and I'd bet most people read it in one or two days because they couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hats off to J.K Rowlings, Harry Potters first year at Hogwarts was a massive success and gave her a very tough act to follow. But with the Chamber of Secrets she has matched, and gone beyond the magic of the first book. The original characters and underlying plots carry through to this story with just as much pace and excitement, and the new characters (Lockhart!) blend in and make the book another classic. It is so wonderful to drift away and join Harry Potter and friends as the stumble across the most unbelievable, but perfectly believable calamities."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a book about Harry Potter who is a wizard that is in his second year of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.I thank that it is a very cool book. My favorite part was when a cat was frozen."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Wonderful follow-up to Rowlings tale of an average boy who discovers he is a Wizard. Great lessons of good and evil for kids and adults alike. Makes me think of an adolescent version of Why Can't I Spray Today by Francine Poppo Rich."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This delightful, witty book will charm adult and child readers alike. The colorfully woven tale, a continuation of Harry's life at Hogwarts, will keep readers enthralled for hours! As Harry and friends Ron and Hermione try to unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, they also must find a way to put down awful Draco Malfoy and his good-for-nothing father, put up with an obnoxious, wailing ghost, a know-it-all dimwitted teacher, and a well-meaning elf who gets in the way of everything!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm not a kid anymore. I'm an adult now. But somewhere in between childhood and adulthood a curse was cast upon me. I stopped reading. I used to read all sorts of books when I was young (if Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys sound familiar to you, then you'll know roughly how old I am). I read whatever I could get a hold of and it filled me with a sense of wonder and imagination. Reading filled voids during the lonely times, and gave me something to think about during the happy times.It's kind of ironic that a children's book should make me fall in love with reading again. But this book did the trick. From Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I slowly read the next book in the series, then the next and the next. Each book got progressively thicker, but that didn't matter. The stories come to life with humorous characters and this world of witchcraft and wizardry. I was beginning to imagine again!After reading the four books in the series, I said to myself \\"Hey, that wasn't so bad. I wonder why I stopped reading.\\" From that point on, I started with The Hobbit, then The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien. Then I saw the movie trailer for The Bourne Identity which stars Matt Damon and I looked for the book it was based on. That led me to explore the world of espionage and international conspiracies according to Robert Ludlum. From here, I realized that I should probably balance my reading between fiction and non-fiction. So I read Good to Great, a business book by Jim Collins (the author of Built to Last), Jack: Straight from the Gut (about Jack Welch, the former CEO of GE), Made in America (about Sam Walton, the founder of WalMart). With a seamingly endless sea of titles to choose from and written by authors I did not know, I started one book at a time from each \\"famous\\" (atleast to the world around me) author. I've read current books by John Grisham, Jonathan Kellerman, Sandra Brown, Carol Higgins Clark, Robin Cook, Tess Gerritsen, and many many more. From this sampling, I've developed a sense of what I like and don't like. I've discovered what \\"formulas\\" these authors use. All this in a span of 5 months.I don't even realize how caught up I get when I describe to my friends the books I've read and the books I plan to read. It's truly an indescribable feeling to once again find the passion for reading. And it all started with this simple children's fantasy book.So would I recommend this book? Wholeheartedly! To kids and adults alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The author takes the reader on another high-flying adventure with Harry and his friends. It is at times an edge-of-your-seat read, but can also be a little graphic and scary for younger readers (of 8 or less years of age.) It's hard even for adults to put down! It leaves you waiting to start reading Harry's next adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The title itself hints at something far darker than the first book in this series. I loved it even more for that. It is through some kind of magic the Rowling transports us into this mythical world, making us believe in giant spiders, terrible monsters and ghosts. After reading the first two books i found myself reaching for a 'wand' trying to zap annoying characters around me. It is difficult, sometimes, to not believe that there are two types of humans after reading this book and it is the the way that Rowling brings us so close to Hogwarts and this world that doesn't really exist that makes Harry Potter books an adventure in a nutshell.Just what if, all this -was- real?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter series is amazing! I have read all three books and am anxiously awaiting four through seven! I recommend this book, and the ones that follow, to young and old. I have already captured the attention of the eighth graders that I teach. Harry Potter is all a reader can ask for. He is exciting, adventurous,humourous, heartwarming and a hero that you continue to cheer for. If you only read one book this century, or the next, choose Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't know what the parents are freaking out for! This is the best book series that I have read in my whole life! I may be thirteen years old but I am addicted to Harry Potter! Listen parents, if you want to get your kids to read more and have them find some adventure and a great imagination builder, then get them this book along with the others! The kids will build up a great imagination system, and if they already do then this will be something that they will cherish for years."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I teach sixth grade and I read aloud to my class. I started the first day of school reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and we were hooked!! We are currently finishing up Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and we are looking forward to starting the last one. The parents of my students are thanking me for sparking their non-reader children into wanting to have the Harry Potter collection of their own!! This is a wonderful collection of stories. Thanks to J. K. Rowling for making books come alive!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an Awesome book! I can picture everyword read! I got my friend interested in these books and had him take my copy of The Sorcerer's Stone home one night hoping he would get interested. The next morning he gave me the book back and said that he had finished the first 90 pages! &quot;I couldn't stop!&quot; he said. Anyway i think these books are the best ever and everyone should read them! Heck, my dad has read the series twice!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was a great book. I just love how Rowling makes you think alot throughout the book. Harry gets into more trouble than ever when they miss the train and end up taking the flying the car to Hogwarts. Harry goes through alot of work to find out the heir of slytheryn.

It really makes you think and it is one of the greatest books to ever be published!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"All of the Harry Potter books are fantastic!

I normly don't read and all (except nsync magazines) but I jyst couldn't help myself in reading the book. It took me only 5 weeks to read 18 chapters (342 pgs) People you have got to read all of J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter books. They are GREAT!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"&quot;And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You had to wander around with your nose in it trying to do everything one-handed&quot;(chapter 13 from Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets.) The perfect way to describe it.

I picked it up because the cover was so interesting. I read the book in one sitting and loved every minute of it. I was so glad when I found out it was the second book in an ongoing series. The characters are so real and the plot was very intriguing. Where was this book when I was a kid? When much of the books available deal with troubling adult issues, it is refreshing to go into the lives of Harry and his friends. As a child, I was convinced that there were schools for wizards and witches, and I would have given anything to leave my Muggle school for a place like Hogwarts.Harry Potter has allowed me to finally do just that."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A great book for people who don't like to figure out who the bad guy is until the end.

I have already read it 3 times in just a day each. I loved how Harry just kept going, and finally unraveled the mystery."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I can't believe Ms. Rowling is such a talented author. This book has a lot of life in it. Unfortuanatly, it describes a lot of what happened in the first book. That was quite annoying.

I think that the names and comical satire is amazing and shows splendid writing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book! I could not put it down!

My son and I are very addicted to the Harry books and can't wait for the next installment.The characters are well-rounded - no one is all evil or all good. Even the nastiest kid in school who hates Harry with a passion - you get a glimpse of his home life and figure that there is a good reason why he's as rotten as apples gone bad.I highly recommend these books. I also hope that someone who knows how to handle taking a book to the screen can be persuaded to make some really great movies out of them.

My 9 year old did a book report for school and I have to add her final paragraph to my review.... &quot;I liked this book because it is about magic and because the good people always win. Harry has a bad family, and his parents are dead, but he still tries to do the right thing and be a good person. He is brave and he is loyal.

Details are so rich, they are one of the things I like so much about this series. The books really seem to come to life"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book is awesome!I loved it.I always had to read more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am nine years old and I am a Harry Potter fanatic. In this book we find out the true identity of &quot;you know who&quot;....otherwise known as Lord Voldemort. We are also introduced to Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, who really knows nothing about defense against the dark arts. Moaning Myrtle also makes several pitiful appearances in this book. Severely annoying and also a ghost, Myrtle haunts the girl's bathroom crying constantly to whoever dares to enter. However, she holds a dark secret that is important to Harry when he has to go up against Voldemort. There are many more interesting and scary and funny and exciting things that happen in this story....you must read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"At first I was laying at home bored and not knowing what to do because I had just finished the first Harry Potter book when I decided I would read the second book. The second I started reading it I didn't want to put it down I just needed to know what happened next. Harry Potter books are always full of excitment and adventure. I like the description that j.k. Rowling uses. I hope the third book will be as good as the first and second."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hubby is very happy to listen to the books on CD; being a truck driver it helps him pass the times as the miles melt away. He now gets to enjoy what the rest of us have read. He will be listening to books 4 and 5 on his next trip out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Chamber of Secrets continues the development of the characters and basic plot of Harry versus Lord Voldemort, although in this book Voldemort only appears as a memory. It's a good book, but the series doesn't get juicy; i.e., develop its depth until the third book, The Prisoner of Azkaban."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My son is halfway throught it, he loves it. I know everyone think J K Rowling is an amazing woman, so do not need to say more. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Just thought I'd start this review by asking something of you, reader. Next time you're in a book store, walk by the children's section. Then, head to the teen section. If 85% of the books in both of those sections aren't fantasy, I'll eat my entire Harry Potter collection. Thing of it is, it wasn't like that eleven years ago. It really says something about the quality of Harry Potter when every children/teen author strives to live up to the status quo made by J. K. Rowling and her wonderful series. But out of all the fantasy I've ever read, and I've read a lot, Harry Potter is by far (repeat the word \\"far\\" about twenty-five times) the best.Upon re-(re-re-re)reading \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" (the second in the Harry Potter series), I couldn't put my finger on why people list this as their least favorite of the series. \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" is an astounding sequel which is just as good as the first and a contender for one of the best mysteries of the series. While it lacks the depth of the latter books, it's simplicity is, I believe, a testament to the age of the characters. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are twelve years old, and to make this book a complex seven hundred-page tome would be a mistake. \\"Chamber of Secrets\\", like each of the other Harry Potter books, is perfectly, flawlessly done.The characters are one of a kind. The book itself is beautiful. It's heartwarming, smartly plotted, skillfully written, and any other good adverb-verb combination you can come up with. If you haven't read it, climb out of your hobbit hole and give it a try.Because there are really only three types of people in this world.1. People who love Harry Potter.2. People who haven't read Harry Potter, but would love it if they did.3. People who choose to hate Harry Potter. But we don't talk about them.10/10 Classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is now in his second year at Hogwarts. Before he even leaves for school, he is visited by a house elf named Dobby who begs Harry not to go back to Hogwarts this year. There are terrible plans in motion. Harry ignores the warning and decides to go back to school. Soon after, he is rescued from the Dursley's house by his best friend Ron Weasley and two of Ron's brothers. He stayed at the Weasley's house for the duration for the summer. When Harry finally gets back to school, strange things start happening. He finds out that he can speak the language of snakes, Parseltongue. The Chamber of Secrets is opened. No one seems to know where this chamber is located, or what resides within it. It's up to Harry, Ron and Hermione to find out what's going on. Will they be able to figure it out? Read the book to answer the questions, and to quiet your curiosity."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is rely cool to hear the book being read. The way it is being read makes it come lifelike as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was even better than the first. Not only do you get to discover Hogwarts itself, but Harry is introduced to many more characters in this one. At the same time, however, Rowling never forgets to keep us up to date with what happened in the first book. That is a bonus about these books. Sometimes, time will pass before I read the next book, but each book updates the reader about the past. In my opinion, I feel that Harry has many more challenges to overcome in this book, and those challenges make it twice as interesting. The characters that are introduced in book 2 seem to be even more colorful that the ones he previously meets in book 1. Very good book to read! I can't stop reading them!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think people who aer deep readers or like Charlie Bone will love Harrry Potter and the Chamber of secrets. For myself my favorite character is the antagonist:Voldemort. I love his character because he's so deadly and sinister.But without Voldemort I think the story would be very quirky."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After the first book I was hooked and just can't get enough of the Harry Potter serious. Everyone should read these books. They take you to a magical place where the imagination can roam."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I did not get into the Harry Potter books until recently. I can now see why the books and movies are so popular with both teens and adults alike. The magic world that J.K. Rowling has invented is both intoxicating and fun to be in. I will read the rest of them up to the release of the 7th and last book. Thank you Amazon for being able to purchase this at such a great price."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read this tale I was reminded of Andominii - by Lance Dixon - both books capture the spirit of what it means to want and to live life through the eyes of innocence which permit us to believe that the only limits in life are those we impose."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I may not be 8 - 12, but I certainly felt like a kid in a candy store while reading this book. My 13 year old daughter and I had a blast trying to get the other to put it down so we could discover all the secrets to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets before the other. It is a wonderful adventure to share with any age child or just to enjoy for yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is truly for someone with a large imagination.It's based upon a wizard named Harry Potter who recently found out he was one.He now attends wizard school but was warned not to because of upcoming danger.He goes anyway and diaster strikes."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"One of the best books I've read! I think that you parents should encurege your kids to STOP watching TV and START reading!I'm 8 and I think reading is fun. Harry Potter books are fun for kids because we usually like fantasies. Thats why I gave it 5 stars.I bet even grown-ups would like it.Have a good time reading the series;I know I sure did!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book! Even though it's ages 9-12, I am 14, and many of my friends like it too...Even adults do! I find the concept of his belonging to the wizarding world fasinating, but some people don't believe that this should be written. Go buy it though! You're crazy if you don't read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"rowling kept me glued to this book all night! i couldn't put it down! you don't need to be a kid to love this wonderful story of magic and mystery."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hey Ya'll! I read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and I think it is a great book! Though it may not be educational, this book has lots of action. J.K. Rowling takes Harry Potter on adventure after adventure in this wonderful book. I hope all of you who read this go out and read this book. I garuntee it'll be at your local library. Well, that's about it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the best book I have ever read! it is exciting, mysterious, and humerous! Some people say it teaches Witchcraft to kids but I totaly dissagree! I recomend this book to anyone! It is so great that even my brother would read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is wonderfully written so that you can't tell what will happen next, especially when you get to the end. It also makes you wonder if there really is a witch world and we are just Muggles, or if there really is a kid somewhere like the heroic Harry Potter. I think this book had more suspense than the first one Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I loved that one also. They say that these books are Children's Books, but I do not believe that to be true. Everyone no matter what age will come to love these great stories about the adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and even to come to dislike Malfoy. The characters in this book are beautifully described so that you can think of people who are exactly like them. I consider Hermoine like myself. J.K. Rowling is a great author and one day I wish to write books as great as her soon-to-be classics."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am reading the Harry Potter books for my Children's Lit class. These books keep you in suspense throughout the whole story. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in even better than the first. You ever says it is for children must not have read it for themselves. This book should not be banned at all. There is nothing wrong with it. These stories are fanasty that is helping to teach children how to stand up for themselves."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is number one on my top ten book list! It has everything: adventure, suspense, and much more. It's too good! Harry Potter was abandoned as a child. He grew up living with his aunt, uncle, and cuz.Then one year he finds out he is a wizard. In this book his rival pulls out a terrible act.Boys and girls are being petrifided one by one. Who is this beast? Who unleashed it? Who will stop it? Read it to find out. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter, book 2, ia an extremly good book. It is full of adventure and exciting events. Harry Potter and his sidekick Ron take on the journey of going bak to Hogwarts after they were warned not to.

You should definitly pick this book up so that you can find out the ending."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter, book 2, ia an extremly good book.

The series is &quot;da bomb.&quot; The books in the series are the best books I have ever read. It is great. I am eagerly awaiting the forth. I am on the third and a quater done, and it is so good so far. I love the mystery at the end. I am buying the new one the first day it comes out. It is so great and has the coolest twists."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, by J.K. Rowling, was an okay book, but it was surely not as good as the first book. In this book Harry starts attending his second year at the Hogwarts School with his friends Ron and Hermoine. They get off to a rough start, and as the year goes on it doesn't get any better. There have been strange attacks on students that did not have two parents that were witches or wizards (the school is for witches and wizards only). Many suspect that Harry is the attacker, so he feels it is up to him to find out who it really is and stop these attacks. But this just gets Harry in more trouble until he succeeds... As I said above, the book was okay, but it was certainly not as good as the first one. It began with a slow and boring start. All that happened in the first three chapters was Harry's summer vaccation was ending with no exciting events and he got ready for school. When everyone is finally reunited at school, it gets a little better. But, for at least the next four chapters there are many events, but they are not written with any juice, and the events themselves are not really anything to be interested in. For example, there are a few Quidditch matches, but they were only exciting in the first Harry Potter book. Towards the end it starts to draw up more suspense and gets better becasue Harry starts taking more risks to find out who the vicious attacker is. For instance, Harry and Ron took Hagrid's dog at midnight, they hid themselves with the invisibility cloak, and went into the Forbidden Forest. Also, Harry went back in time to find out who opened the chamber of secrets the first time it was opened. The best part would have to be at the end when Harry discovers who the attacker is and the school year finally ends. But, the thrill isn't over yet..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I READ THE FIRST HARRY POTTER AND IT WAS GREAT!I'M NOW ON THE THIRD HARRY POTTER AND I CAN'T WAIT TILL THE 4TH,5TH,6TH,7TH,AND THE MOVIE.SO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS &quot;SO LITTLE TIME AND SO MANY EXCITING PAGES OF A HARRY POTTER BOOK&quot;GO J.K. ROWLING!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry is the best character to show up in fiction for a long time.(The next best was also in a series for young adults by Australian author Catherine Jinks. The characters name was Pagan and the series starts with the book Pagan's Crusade)It's truly the characters that capture you in this series. You'll fall in love with the good guys, shiver at the bad guys, despise the weasels like Malfoy.Can't wait for the 4th book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is about Harry Potter(of course) that gets traped in his bedroom at the Dursley's house. But then Harry Potter gets saved by Ron. At the end of the book, Harry Potter goes to the Chamber of Secrets and finds T.M. Riddle or also known as Dumbledore who killed Harry's parents and tried to kill him! This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"We owe a debt of gratitude to our niece Gail Dornenburg, who turned us on to the Harry Potter series last summer. We'd never heard of them, but Gail was so enthusiastic about the books that we went straight to Amazon to order one. When we saw how high the books' sales rankings were, we realized that Gail was on to a phenomenon -- so we ordered all three! Once we finished reading the books aloud to each other, right before drifting off to sleep, we started all over and have been reading them again. (And yes, our order has already been placed for Book #4.) J.K. Rowling's imagination is an international treasure!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that this book is extremely good and I reccomend this book to anyone with an imagination and a sense of fun. I have read all three books in the series so far and they are all very good. Once I picked one up I could hardly put it down. I think the author is extremely talented."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I enjoyed this book even more than the first. The pacing is more even, and the overall story is a far more engrossing read. That said, this is a far darker and more violent book than the first. I'd think twice before giving it to a child under nine, or to anyone unusually sensitive, for that matter.Also, the author attempts to deal with racism in a wizard-world way: children whose parents are not themselves magic are called ''mudbloods'' by others; the epithet connotes that their blood is somehow ''dirty'', and that they themselves are inferior. I'm still split over whether or not the author handles this subject well. Parents may wish to use it as the basis of a family discussion."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets failed to meet my expections after reading Harry Potter and the soccercers stone. It was a book with the same thrilling aspects of Harry Potter and the socceror's stone and Harry Potter and the prisonor of Azcaban, but didn't leave you with same &quot;I want to read this again and agian feeling&quot;."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My journey into the adventures of Harry Potter began about a month ago. Although not an avid reader, I have read the first three titles in their entirety and can hardly wait for the fourth. Here is my frank review: YOU ARE AN UNIMAGINITIVE, INSIGNIFICANT MORON IF YOU READ THE ADVENTURES OF HARRY POTTER (IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER) AND DO NOT ENJOY THEM. On a more serious note, if you read the books and don't think they are your cup of tea, I would love to hear from you and help straighten out any issues in your life that might be contributing to your mental illness. It doesn't matter where you are from, what walk of life or who your brother is. As long as you have the ability to read on a third grade level or better (I am a freshman in college), you will love the books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is one of the best books ever. It's tied with the other two Harry Potter books for the best book of all time"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a big Harry Potter fan and I must say this was the best out of the three. J.K. Rowling has done it again. She explained everything with expert detail. I think that anybody who even at least remotely likes fantasy should read this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's a really great book if you like magic and wizards. I think that it's a great book for all ages. I'm a seven year old boy and I thought it was as great as the first one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"THis book with Harry Potter and his friends was fantastic! The reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5, was because it was slow in the beginning, and there was some violence. It was adventourous and kept me interested throughout it. It leaves you guessing what happens next and there are magical animals in it that you will wish that are real. Someone that will like this book is someone that likes adventures, science fiction and fantasy. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I was first intruduced to Harry Potter books I gotreally into Harry POtter.I was so amazed when I read the first couple of chapters in the first Harry Potter books. Harry Potter and his friends were so amazing and adventures. After that book I wanted to read more of his books so I read The second and third book. I thought that J.K. Rowling was a very talented Authur and very talented at thinking of adventurouse things to put in the book. So here I am, I already read all three of the books and I am waiting for the fourth to come out and I am anxious to read the fourth. I really liked the Harry Potter Books,they should come out with more books like that!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I adored this book! Although it is rated for ages 9-12, I am an adult and found this book one of the most refreshing I have read in quiet awhile. It's innocence brings back memories of the books I read on those long days of summer vacation, while swinging on a porch swing, and being transported to a completely different, magical place by my book of the day. I would recommend this to anyone, especially people with children, as you can both thoroughly enjoy the magic of Hogwarts! Once I read this book, I promptly went out and bought the whole series, and am anxiously awaiting the next one! My advice is, READ IT!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling once again reaches into our imaginaton. I love how she keeps suspense in this story. This book is an exciting sequel. Generally most sequels are not as good as the first. Well this book is just as thrilling and exciting as ever. I recommend this to people who have the first book or for somebody who is just looking for adventure. Eeven though I read this before I read the Sorcerer's Stone J.K. Rowling gives a little insight on what's going on in the first 20 pages. If you loved the first and you're hungry for more this is a must have!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the best book of the three Harry Potter Books.I likedthe book so much! I finished reading it today, and I just couldn'tput it down. It took me two days to read it, and I just love the way that J.K. Rowling wrote the book! It's extremely excellent, and my favorite part is when Harry plungs the hot, poisonous fang, through Tom Riddle's Diary (or Lord Voldemort)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The is one of the best books i ever read.

IVE READ THE THIRD ONE, AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO COME OUT."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a 21 year old college student and I thought the book was great. If it can get your child to read, read it with them. Make your own choice about it. Don't just get your ideas from the screaming conservatives.As far as the witch talk, I'd like to remind everyone of a few titles that are classics: The Wizard of Oz, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, (and that whole series), Matilda, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Hansel and Gretel (and almost any fairy tale), Hamlet, Dracula, Frankenstien, A Midsummer Nights Dream, and many more. Should we burn these books too?Just read the book! Tell your child that it is fiction. How hard is that?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The whole series was full of adventure,mystery,and but of course magic.I absolutely could not put this masterpiece down.I have read tons of books in my 15 years of living but this series consisted of the best books i have ever read.Even my little brother who absolutely dispises reading loved it. I can't help but to give it up to the fair lady whom could touch me so through but a book ."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was not going to write a review, because frankly I thought I would add nothing to all the wonderful reviews JKR got. But to my amazement someone or something thought the book was stupid? How on earth? could someone call this masterpiece stupid?JKR has such a vivid imagination and such a gripping narrative style, that I have to admit I spent the last 36 hours revloving around her first two books, at times I was tired but couldn't put the books down.I am 28 years old and found this book thrilling to say the least.The person who wrote the shameful review is, well, possibly troubled by magic; maybe she had vodoo practiced on her as a child or maybe she is on of Dursley's kin. A first rate Muggle.I am looking forward to the Motion Picture."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really love Harry Potter books!

It was written towards kids, not like alot of other fantasy novels, if you are looking for a good fantasy read for older people, dont pick this, read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm sorry, but what's all the fuss about! This book is dull, and suggests that people are bad, against wizards, who are good. I personally suggest the Redwall book series by Brian Jaques. His books are much better, and more exciting. I also suggest Madeline L'Engle, and C.S. Lewis's books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really was disapointed in the Harry Potter book! There was nothing realistic about this book. It was boring and not any fun to read. I don't believe in things like Muggles or flying cars and I am not interested in things like that either! I don't think that this is a kids book! It is hard to understand.Things like headless people and spells is something all parents try to lead thier kids away from! It is a very dumb book! I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read a portion of the book. It took SO Long! I finally got to the chapter, \\"The Chamber Of Secrets\\", and STOPPED READING! i couldn't stand the book any longer. It was taking so long to get to that chapter, that i didn't even CARE ANYMORE! I suggest seeing the movie, instead of wasting your life reading. I wish the books never came out, but the movies did. My brother loves all the harry potter books, but i hate them. Each time one comes out, he buys it, and spend more than a week in his room JUST READING IT! HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE! Just watch the movie. I don't plan on finishing this book, or for that matter, ever reading a whole harry potter book the rest of my life. Don't waste your money, save it for the movie.-Rita"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I will not let my children read this book. There certainly is a big 'rave' about this series of books, but the influence and ideas it will give children is quite distrubing. There are many books out there that captivate children's minds without witches and the such. Children are what they think, they think based upon what they read.The book itself was very captivating, which is awesome for children, but the content which captivated them is scary.Potter's imagination is awesome, I hope the author will write more books, just on another caliber."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"We have read this book and feel it has no place in the hands of children. This book is at best an introduction into witchcraft.It reaches out to children with tales of sorcery and spells. It glorifies revenge.It puts down family values and their concept. The main character's parents are blown up and murdered. The book states that &quot;Death is the next Great Adventure&quot;. This book is close to being banned in 5 states and rightfully so.Our children in this day in age need to embrace family values and be taught to treasure life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I got two words for you: Terrible book.Need I say more. Harry Potter is an infidel and terrible role model for today's youth. This book is a pure waste of time and further more, it should not be allowed to be read by children - or anybody for that matter - due to its magic, witchcraft, atheist propaganda as well as for its sheer lack of literary value.Read something of real value - like Shakespeare - my mistake - that's probably a little too cultivated for Harry Potter readers.Don't waste your time with this - pure torture."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Audio books are my preferred way of enjoying a book. It's all in the &#34;Theater of the mind&#34;. I can picture what's happening the way I want it to look, not some film maker.I can work around the place while listening to a book series that changed the world.AND the audio books are read by Jim Dale, an award winning man who also does all the voices, after much study. He's the best there is."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"one of my favourite books, I absolutely loved it! I would absolutely recommend it to a friend. I love the series too. This book is a must buy!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"\\"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\\" - Albus DumbledoreI did not enjoy Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as much as I did it's predecessor, but I will still happily grant it 5/5 stars- a testament to J.K. Rowling's fabulous writing. HP and the Chamber of Secrets was filled with all the hilarious moments and magical wonders I have come to expect of all Harry Potter books. This book is the unique one out of the series because it is the only one which intertwines a mystery into the already-thick plot. What is the Chamber of Secrets and what monster lies in it's depths? The intense action and terrifying mysteries will leave you quivering in your seats.I always find the most amazing quotes from J.K. Rowling's writing. I can't help but start my review with one of her quotes (which, not surprisingly, comes from Dumbledore). I have lost count of the number of times I have said this, but I will say it again. Rowling is hands down the best writer I have ever read. The writing in HP and the Chamber of Secrets completely blew me away.We now know who we adore and admire (Harry, Dumbledore) and we know who we despise with all our hearts (Snape, Voldemort). We were introduced to all the characters through the first book in the series, so Rowling can go ahead and get into the action for book two. And that's exactly what she does. The mysterious air really compliments the action in the book, which is peppered in just the right places throughout the book. That's one of my favorite parts of Rowling's work. She doesn't have non-stop action throughout the whole book. She has character development and loads of fun to mix up her stories and make them more interesting.HP and the Chamber of Secret's is all about testing Harry's bravery and valiance. This book really shows us what a phenomenal human being Harry is and makes us fall in love with him even more. On the other hand, we are introduced to Professor Lockheart (the new DADA teacher). What a despicable human being. He is vain, shallow and irritating beyond belief. It was quite the experience to have someone I hate so much be on the good side. I'm ashamed to say I was very pleased when his memory charm backfired and he lost his memory.Overall, another fantastic novel from J.K. Rowling. The perfect sequel to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, this book has it all. Best. Series. Ever."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an immensely fulfilling second book. What Rowling has done here is taken the characters and world she created for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and give them more depth. There is more emotional depth to Chamber of Secrets than there was to Sorcerer's Stone. In Sorcerer's Stone we follow Harry,Ron,and Hermione through a series of light hearted adventures in which we pretty much know everything is going to be okay. In Chamber of Secrets,Harry,Ron,and Hermione face real adversity and real danger and you feel that. Soon After,Harry,Ron,and Hermione return to Hogwarts,students begin to be attacked. Harry,Ron,and Hermione put their effects into trying to figure out who might be behind the attacks but large groups at the school,espescially Huffelepuffs,suspect Harry is the the one behind the attacks and Harry has to cope with large parts of the school being against him. And Hermione has her own worries,she is danger herself because of her parentage. At it's core,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a classic good vs evil struggle and you can really feel the tension between Harry and Tom Riddle when the in the epic climax in the Chamber of Secrets itself. There's a real feeling that Harry is in real danger and that you don't know whether he or Riddle will win. That is one the aspects of Chamber of Secrets that makes it so superior to Sorcerer's Stone. There's also more revealed about Hagrid. We now get more information about Hagrid's past and in the processs what is believed about his past gets him a huge blow when the final attack happens. We get Voldemort backstory as well,who he was when he was at school and such and we also learn that Voldemort is a descendant of a notable figure in wizarding history. It's worth noting as well that the movie version of Chamber of Secrets was the Harry Potter movie that did the best job of book to movie translation. I felt so fulfilled when I walked out of the theater at Arizona Mills mall after seeing Chamber of Secrets for the first time. Chamber of Secrets is a fantastic,fulfilling story and absolutely deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read the first book over ten years ago and only now did I decide to continue with the series. This is a very well written book and it is no wonder that the series is highly popular. I greatly enjoyed the characters, especially the cocky Lockheart, and couldn't help but be entertained of the wizardly world of Harry Potter. I've seen the movies first but the movies don't compare to the books. The books are more descriptive and more adventures occur in them. Now, on to the next book of the series :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My grandson is reading the Harry Potter series, I was missing book 2,(borrow, missing in action) he didn't want to read book 3, I order the book to complete my colletion. He is happy now."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling introduces some cool new things in this book. Dumbledore's room with the pheonix, the Chamber of Secrets under the school with the creature lurking in walls and terrifying students, and new characters like the conceited new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher. I love the underlying mystery; Rowling is a master at conclusions."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Another good book in the series.

These books are great fun, no matter what your age. In fact, if I had to give a criticism of the Harry Potter books, I'd have to say their only drawback is that they eventually come to an end!
