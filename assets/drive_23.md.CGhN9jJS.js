I couldn't figure out why one story was called \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under Justice\\" until I realized that the Squadron Supreme was a witty take-off on the (then) cardboard DC characters of the Justice League. It was particularly amusing when, a couple of years later, Englehart moved over to DC to actually write the JLA, and had great fun with them as well. Englehart was the supreme comics writer of the 1970's and he's still one of the best around today, though he doesn't work as often as I'd like."},{"Title":"Avengers: The Serpent Crown","review":"In this collection, you'll AVENGERS VOL. 1 # 141-144, 147-149. #'s 145-146 is a different story arc because of deadlines I suppose.Anyway, in this collection the Avengers are faced with double trouble: to intercept KANG THE CONQUEROR'S plan to rule the world by going to the 19th century and a crisis in the present time with the ROXXON CORPORATION. Issue # 141 is the set up of the twin crisis, #142-143 deals with the 19th century and 144, 147-150 deals with the climax of the SQUADRON SUPREME saga.THOR AND MOONDRAGON 9with IMMORTUS' assistance)travel back in time to find their teamate HAWKEYE in the western era. They encounter Marvel's greatest western heroes: TWO GUN KID, KID COLT, RAWHIDE KID, RINGO ETC in a struggle against Kang. The final one on one battle between kang and THE MIGHTY THOR was short but sweet as well as when they took the TWO GUN KID back with them to the 20th century.As a kid, this was one of the very first times I have really seen THE VISION against 3 Squadron members including their most poerful member: HYPERION, and quite literally ran over him. The other battles with CAPTAIN AMERICA, IRON MAN , THE BEAST & THE HELLCAT (this is also the very first time Patsy Walker donned the Catsuit)against DOC SPECTRUM, THE WHIZZER, AMPHIBION, TOM THUMB ETC(JLA RIP -OFFS). were also well drawn and quite fast-paced ala GEORGE PEREZ(one of my favorite artists)THE HIGHTLIGHT OF THIS COLLECTION I BELIEVE IS: Thor taking on Kang alone, The Vision taking on HYPERION(marvel's Superman rip-off)and the first appearance of the Hellcat.A good read for any 70's comic fan. It was well beyond its time.Also: DO NOT MISS STRACYNSKI'S SUPREME POWER, starring HYPERION.I have the comic collection, get the TP"},{"Title":"Avengers: The Serpent Crown","review":"Ok i didn't know what to expect from this book, it sounds like a jumble of stuff, in a short space you have a justice league rip off, travels to another world, evil companies ad a whole government turning evil, a trip to the old west with a bunch of old west stars, fights with their worst enemy kang and a finsh against a giant whale man..but they are able to pull it off.the story starts with the teams splitting into two squads, one must travel to the old west and rescue their friend hawkeye, the other has to take down the roxxen company, the tales come together at the end, but the pacing all through it is great, it's a lot of sci-fi fun, time travel, alternate worlds, huge super battles with a justice league copy called squadren supreme.the name of the book comes from the serpant crown, it takes control of the people who wears it, the company owner of roxxen on the avengers earth and the president rockafeller led government on the supreme earth, the avengers have to face the squad and get the crown back to their earth and do something about it before its too late.while they are doing that the other team must rescue their friend in the old west, and run into the time traveller kang, who is holding an old west town hostage, it's a great story and the old west heroes, some who pre-date marvels super heroes like thor and spidey and others, are really fun, the biggest problem..you want more of them and maybe they will release a western trade one day.also in this title is hellcat, a new avenger, she was part of marvels \\"girl comics\\" line in the 40's, their answer to archie and had titles like patsy and her pals, when she lost her book after about 20 years they turned her into of all things a super hero named hellcat, you see how that happens here and it's really good.the book has great art by george perez, a few dated parts, but overall is a heck of a fun read, has some of their best villains, if your an avengers fan get this.oh and the two missing issues were a fill in between the story and they eft them out to keep the flow there, your not missing anything."},{"Title":"Avengers: The Serpent Crown","review":"When I first started collecting comics as a kid, this story arc was one of the first I had in my collection.

It actually tells two separate Avengers stories. The first involves the Serpent Crown (why the hell would anyone wanna wear that thing, anyway?). The Avengers and Patsy Walker go to investigate Roxxon Oil, who have it in their possession. This soon leads to a battle with the Squadron Supreme, which sends our heroes into an alternate Earth. The remaining team ( Thor and Moondragon), get transported into the past by Immortus, where they find Hawkeye (who had been stuck in the past by Kang), and team-up with the heroes of the wild west (including Two-gun kid) to foil Kang's latest scheme."},{"Title":"Avengers: The Serpent Crown","review":"The Serpent Crown is a device than an alien has used to control The Squadron Supreme on their world, and they need help from The Avengers to undo the damage.This produces a great team up and cross world story, and as an added bonus, we have the appearance of the Hellcat, a definite favorite."},{"Title":"Avengers: The Serpent Crown","review":"I love the Avengers, what I ve seen from George Perez on This title , on his classic 70 s issues or later with Kurt Busiek, has always been great. This Tpb, is an exception, Perez Art is undefined, on most cases, I guess this is due to the fact that he was a rookie back then. Nothing on this book gives us a clue of what a great artist he would become. The story was another disappointment for me, I had enjoyed Englehart s cellestial Madonna saga, and expected someting similar, but this didnt happened. This story tries to mix two stories one set on the west on 1870, where Thor , Hawkeye and Moondragon fight Kang the Conqueror, this part was pretty boring, except for the final battle between Thor and Kang.The other story set on the present involves the Avengers against the sinister Roxxon Corporation and its head Nelson Rockefeller, who has manage to get the Serpent Crown , an evil artifact with inmense power, on the midst of it the avengers battle the Squadron Supreme. This story is better than the first , but it s just an average story. In conclusion I dont think both stories blended properly and the product as a whole is mediocre."},{"Title":"Raj: Making and Unmaking of British India","review":"I am not finished with this book - it has rested a long time in that smallest room in the house, and I have read only a page or two at a time. I have enjoyed it greatly (the book). I find it interesting to compare the British experiences there with the US experiences in other parts of the world. I was struck at the history of the British experience in Afghanistan - and how many parallels there are with the US experience there today. I noted with interest that after some rather bad experiences that the British commanders were told that they could take an army into Afghanistan to punish or retaliate but they should on no account attempt to occupy or remain.... And I wondered if whoever advised Bush I may have read of those experiences - but whoever advised Bush II apparently was not quite so well read...."},{"Title":"Blessed Assurance: At Home With the Bomb in Amarillo, Texas","review":"I first read this book in college in a theory of religion class. But don't be put off by that. This is the story of the people in Amarillo TX who build nuclear warheads. Most of the community are born-again Christians who are Rapturists -- they welcome the end of the world. Their story is contrasted with those people in the town and all over who are against nuclear war. It is an unbelievable sociological tale, and Mojtabai writes with compelling impartiality. She tells the whole story in a way that reads like one of the best novels I have ever read. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in human nature. It will blow you away."},{"Title":"Blessed Assurance: At Home With the Bomb in Amarillo, Texas","review":"This readable, accomplished writer author deals with the presence of the Pantex plant in Amarillo, the only final assembly factory in the US for nuclear weapons, warheads and bombs. She presents this as a piece of investigative journalism, uncovering the background stories of some personalities involved, both individual and communal.Mojtabai explores, then analyzes the attitudes of local residents toward the plant. She analyzes in some detail the personal and group philosophies of war, peace, safety, and the future. She gives attention to the views and attitudes of individual members of churches who work in the bomb factory.She looks into the question of safety for nuclear weapons. In this regard she analyzes the views of Amarillo residents. She looks at both the security provided by the bomb as a deterrent and the danger of the bomb as a provocation to nuclear war or an attack on their town as a production center.Mojtabai also provides a fascinating analysis of how religious views relate to this situation. She outlines how many individual Christians and churches accommodated the presence of nuclear weapons, and the future in light of their possible use.Some just dismissed the question and abdicated any personal sense of responsibility or concern. They were satisfied to accept the economic benefits resulting from the enterprise, such as the jobs provided.On the other side, a few churches and Christian activists did oppose both the production and use of nuclear weapons and their assembly in their neighbourhood.In a perhaps unexpected, but relevant, focus, the author explores the various religious views of the End Time of churches in Amarillo. Those with apocalyptic views of how the world would end seem not to be as concerned with the implications of nuclear weapons."},{"Title":"Blessed Assurance: At Home With the Bomb in Amarillo, Texas","review":"The book captures the pioneer spirit of those who have settled this area of our nation and continue to remain.

I assume he'll like it."},{"Title":"Small Animal Internal Medicine","review":"The appearance of this book is rather uninspiring and with its emphasis on National Boards and Clinical Competency Tests it may seem irrelevant for students in the UK. However there are a few clues on the cover which hint at something very useful contained within; e.g. quick, accessible, reference.There are two main parts to the book. The first provides a source of approaches to over 38 different presenting signs in order to assist in diagnosis. Each of these chapters is clearly set out with definitions, causes, clinical findings, diagnostic approaches to help you eliminate and select from lists of differential diagnoses. It is a great provider of easily understood tables of differential lists and possible tests to distinguish between the diseases. The second part works through the main conditions of each organ system and the diagnosis and treatments for each disease. This is done in somewhat more detail than the first part but there are still sufficient diagrams and tables to make the essential information readily available. Throughout the book there are sections of questions to help you revise the previous topics.Although you may not believe that such a large topic can be anything but superficially covered in a book of this size, there is an amazing amount of information here. It's a bit like Mary Poppins' magic carpetbag, it is hard to believe how much is contained within these pages. The authors have been concise not brief. No space is wasted with in depth discussions of pathophysiology or various treatment regimes but relevant preclinical information is covered. OK so you couldn't use it for writing an essay or as a sole provider of information for internal medicine but to help prompt your memory during revision and as a speedy reference this book is far superior to any of the completely comprehensive texts. Don't forget you should never judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Small Animal Internal Medicine","review":"I am familiar with most comprehensive books on Small Animal Internal Medicine but I did not know the National Veterinary Medical Series (intended as a preparation for the National Board Examination).

If you are willing to brush-up these areas on your own, this book is excellent: it gives you all he information you need to diagnose and treat most internal diseases of dogs and cats in the shortest space.

Nevertheless, there are good introductory essays on Tacitus' career, style, and general methods. The commentary focuses on literary technique and structure, not just within Book IV, but within the entire Annals, provides some grammatical aid, and points out many references and allusions to other authors and events, touching as well on major interpretive issues in Tacitean studies. This is the most valuable part of any commentary, I think, and it is particularly well done here. It is so hard and requires so much experience to be able to identify what makes a passage seem familiar, or where that familiarity might come from, or to understand exactly the force of a particular word in the particular way it is used. In that respect, Woodman and Martin are excellent guides, although most readers will probably not agree with all of their comments."},{"Title":"TACITUS","review":"First, I'm not sure if the other reviewer knows what he/she is talking about. It should be mentioned straight off this is only one book of the \\"Annals\\", and is not meant as a history book. This is the latin text meant for latin students. Reading this book will not give you a great understanding of history, as you will likely be trying to disseminate the latin as your primary task. Yes, the Annals are a good read for history courses/fun, but that person would not be reading this version.Second, the reviewer talks about the history of Augustus. Had he/she read this product the author might make note that this is book 4 of the Annals, the one in which Tacitus discusses the flawed character of Tiberius. A completely different person.Anyway, on to the review:Up front, know this is a Latin text that does not include beginner helping aids such as macrons. Furthermore, the text does not distinguish between \\"u\\" and \\"v\\", which afterall were the same letter to the Romans anyways. Therefore, you have to be on top of your Latin a little bit to distinguish such things as the difference between \\"summa\\" and \\"summa\\" - one being the accusative plural and the other being the ablative singular. This is done by context, which is not usually a tool employed by many beginning (or even some intermediate) Latin learners. Some students, like myself, may have used other Cambridge texts in class.Ok, the text. The text is standard Latin. There's about 60 pages or so of solid Latin. A big, intimidating wall of Latin. While there are no macrons, I did find the punctuation to be rather well done and blocks off chunks of the text you can look at in parts. However, this wall of text starts my quibble with this edition.This book is not user-friendly for students or intermediate level readers. I use \\"user-friendly\\" relative to my ability. I have a minor in Latin from a decent program and some amount of independent reading under my belt. I recently read Bolchazy-Carducci's edition of Selections From the Satyricon and found the amount of help to be a bit much. (As a quick overview: lots of vocab help, listing almost every ablative absolute in the first half of the text etc.) I consider myself still learning the language, but by no means do I consider myself inadequate at being able to translate authentic latin with help.On the other hand you have this book. There is absolutely no vocab listing, grammar aids or explanations are extremely rare, and translation help for more difficult passages/word combinations (idioms etc.) is hardly to be seen. The approximately 200 pages of notes is mostly a"},{"Title":"Core Collection for Small Libraries","review":"There are so many children's books on the market today that it is difficult to know where to begin when looking for books dealing with particular subjects.

He agrees not to consummate the marriage so that Serena, on gaining her majority, will be able to get an annulment and manage her own inheritance. Of course, he knows that the annulment is unlikely ever to take place because of legal complications, but he hopes that in the few months remaining she will change her mind and agree to remain his wife.But Serena is a tough cookie. The misery she has endured from her own family members makes her unlikely to easily trust a stranger. However, Ian is a patient and gentle man, as interested in helping the less fortunate (on his part, a school for lower-class boys) as Serena is (on her part, a desire to found an institution for mistreated women). He realizes much sooner than she does that they are made for each other. But he does not know if the bitterness in her heart from the past will ever melt into love for him.I found this a very enjoyable, if not unflawed, Regency love story. The mistakes with characters' names, the lack of closure on the matter of Serena's father's previous marriage, the constant &quot;are you not&quot; at the end of statements, the lack of clarity about what Ian's brother actually wanted when he made his deathbed statement--all of these managed to leave me with a sense of frustration at the end, which is why it doesn't get five stars from me.But you can be sure I will read the tales remaining in Savery's &quot;Six&quot; series (in fact, I have already read the ones taking place before and after this one), primarily because I find them overall delightful romances and secondarily because of my decidedly curious nature...."},{"Title":"Lady Serena's Surrender (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Exaggeration can be a valuable tool in a writer's toolbox, unless it falls over the brink into caricature. This may produce almost the exact opposite effect from that intended by the author. Such is the case with this book. Had only half the references to Serena's fears and insecurities been included, they would have conveyed her ideas satisfactorily and not left the reader with that 'beat-over-the-head' feeling. Granted, growing up as she did, her sense of inadequacy and mis-treatment are not to be wondered at, and the author is to be complimented for tackling the problem of women's rights. But, enough already! Enough.And that hero! Yes, we all say we want warm and fuzzy, but not somewhat stupid with it. How else to account for his actions? On the other hand, it was nice to find characters from previous books mentioned or taking a larger supporting role in this story, and to find the promise that they'll appear again. Another clever note was to have the book contain three weddings: one near the beginning and one near the end, featuring the same couple both times; the latter occasion being the one in which they really meant the words. The wedding in the middle was that of an unusual pair of secondary characters, righting a slew of wrongs, and bringing joy to nearly everyone, including the reader.A bit more attention to the editing would have enhanced the book greatly: missing words and characters referred to by the wrong name add nothing but aggravation. I suspect that most readers will follow the series, however, wanting to see the loose ends tied up -- even if on the installment plan."},{"Title":"Lady Serena's Surrender (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"In short, Serena, who was previously engaged to Ian, who dies, marries Ian's brother, James. Ian, on his deathbed, was making a request to Ian regarding Serena, but before he finishes, he dies. Serena is one of the most insecure women I have read in a regency. She spends practically the entire book trying not to fall in love with her husband. Why, is the logical answer. I think it be really be the thing to love one's husband. And there was no reason for her not to. Just her insecurities and weird characteristics that got in the way of the story.

There have been two attempts at the marriage, and James has always found a way to be suddenly be unavailable. The third time a date is set he suddenly gets sick and dies. He makes his brother Ian promise him something but dies before he can say what it was. Ian assumes James wanted him to marry Serena, and then does.

Part II covers the vehicles themselves, with chapters on light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, self-propelled weapons, and wheeled (armoured) and tracked supporting vehicles. There are supporting data tables, maps, notes, references and a bibliography.Most vehicles are illustrated, all b&w;, some heavily retouched and poorer quality. There are some errors, eg late-war and post-war T34-85's seem to be mixed up, some T34 models seem to be mislabelled, and the KV2 experimental 85mm picture is of an experimental KV2 with 107mm F39 gun per Zaloga.Overall still a great single volume reference - updated with more recently available information and pictures it would be worth 5 stars."},{"Title":"Russian Tanks, 1900-1970: The Complete Illustrated History of Soviet Armoured Theory and Design.","review":"Russian Tanks 1900-1970 is not just another book listing tanks and armoured vehicles. The first chapter of the book starts with concepts that Russia was trying to develop before Revolution. The next six chapters deal with the formation of the tank industry, how real warfare forced the tanks to evolve to meet realistic needs, and tanks of the Nuclear Age.The second part of the book is made up of five chapters that DO list and give details about Light Tanks, Heavy Tanks, Self-Propelled Weapons and so on.The first part of the book is the best part. Watching how tanks, based totally on theory and simple ideas, were replaced by new and more effective tanks as the conflicts with Finland and Germany forced the Russians to rethink their designs is pure delight."},{"Title":"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind","review":"Minsky is well known in the field of cognitive research (AI) and his earlier book was very interesting. However, his latest was a great disappointment to me. Part of this is the fact that I have high expectations for him and the book just didn't meet them; part of this feeling is simply that the book is lacking a lot.It would seem to me if you're going to write about emotions that you would start by trying to understand the biological basis for them. That is, try to resolve the question of their utility - if they evolved as \\"higher\\" functions then they should have a major utility.So the best place to start would be with the biology, medical and neurologists who have studied them. LeDoux's \\"The Emotional Brain\\" is the foundation for this area of research. Oddly enough, LeDoux references Minsky's earlier book; however, Minsky does NOT reference LeDoux. This is very odd since LeDoux's work is the de facto standard.For anyone who has read LeDoux, a number of Minsky's hypotheses and conclusions are erroneous. If you intend to contadict the best theory for actual working \\"emotional based systems\\" then you had better have very strong arguments for why this is so. Such arguments are not within Minsky's book.Instead, we have more vague \\"thought experiments\\" and hand waving about agent-based emotional subroutines. Sorry, this is why AI has not developed anything resembling even the intelligence of a wasp or ant in over 30 years...Go and buy LeDoux's \\"The Emotional Brain\\" if you really want to learn something."},{"Title":"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind","review":"I agree with the reviewer who noted how odd it was that a book titled \\"The Emotion Machine\\" does not discuss Joseph LeDoux, even if only to refute him. But I think that the problem is with the title, not the book. I found many of Minsky's insights very helpful - it is a very good book about how machines think. And if you are not a dualist, then those insights apply to people too. The book is very well organized and clearly written, and helps you think about thinking. I especially enjoyed his discussion of qualia (although he does not use the term), and why he thinks it is not quite the problem that so many philosophers want to make it.Minsky's main take on emotions is that emotional states are not fundamentally different from other types of thinking, and that the entire dicotomy of rationality v. emotion is misleading. He prefers to view them all as different ways of thinking - of utilizing various mental resources at one's disposal, some conscious and some not. He organizes his discussion of difficult material very well, but I wish there was more grounding in the underlying neural anatomy of human emotion."},{"Title":"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind","review":"Early efforts to model human-like thinking with machines using rules were interesting but failed in a number of ways to capture even simple ways that humans think. Marvin Minsky, AI pioneer at MIT, insists that we understand the mistakes and can begin to appreciate how the mind actually works in functional terms from the lessons we have learned. Learninig from our past mistakes, what a novel idea.To put this into perspective, the question of whether a machine model can adequately describe a brain has long been considered in terms of either strong AI or weak AI. Most people find weak AI plausible: computers can solve certain kinds of problems better than humans. We mostly balk at strong AI however: machines can literally think like humans and solve the same kinds of problems just as well.In The Emotion Machine, Marvin Minsky presents a very machine-like architecture that he claims actually represents the way real minds probably work in fundamental respects. That sounds pretty much like strong AI. So a lot of people will reject the concept of this book out of hand. I think that would be a mistake. Minsky has done a very good job identifying plausible specifics of why AI programs have failed to deliver on, where they have actually managed to deliver, and speculates on how we can fill in the gaps.No, he doesn't spend time arguing against Searle's Chinese Room or other conundrums of AI, he just presents his case and gives examples in a clear, simple, accessible way. And I am persuaded that he probably gets a lot right. Probably more than he gets wrong. And that's a lot better than a lot of critics will give him credit for because it goes against both the mainstream disdain for strong AI and the mainstream love of flashy neuroscience images.Minsky skips right on past the issue of connectionist networks vs. semantic networks and simply posits that we had to evolve semantic representations at some point. How is left as an exercise for neuroscientists. There is a lot of \\"details to be filled in later\\" sort of thinking here, so don't look to this book as a detailed physical model of the brain. This is a high level functional model of the mind and I like it.So I claim that this is an important book that seems to promise a 21st century reboot of scientific naturalism as our guiding philosophy for the future. Minsky takes on nothing less than an overall architectural model for the mind in natural terms. It is brilliant. Too brilliant to be appreciated in its time because Minsky makes complex ideas so accessible that the biggest challenge for this book is that people will not appreciate its power. It reads like a simple AI model of a mind, but it is much deeper than that because of the amount of deep thought that has gone into it and the consideration of the weaknesses as well as strengths of previous AI programs.We are currently in the grip of a widespread fascination with poorly understood pop neuroscience, and most readers will be deeply disappointed that this book does not attempt to wrestle with brain science at all. I think that's a strength because it means Minsky is not falling into the weird metaphysical spins that we too often see in pop neuroscience books, especially those by non-researchers and over-enthusiastic under-trained journalists.What Minsky is doing here is simply coming up with a logical model of what a mind has to be able to do to provide the capabilities that we observe real human minds to possess. Sounds simple, right? No, not at all. The reason Minsky has accomplished something special here is that he recognizes many of the powerful fallacies we usually fall into when we introspect about thinking and rely on traditional models. We tend to think of emotions and reasoning as separate kinds of things, and then we talk about how they are both needed and how they interact. But as Minsky points out, both neuroscience and psychology seem to provide us evidence that these are points on a continuum, not different kinds of things. Minsky takes that seriously and builds on it.The result is something amazing that looks like a simplistic mechanical model of the mind but captures some deep insights into how minds really work.The central implication of Minsky's model is an epistemological stance that resourcefulness in human thinking is a matter of switching between different kinds of representations, each used in a different way of thinking, each of which captures something essential about specific things in our world while neccessarily leaving out other details. A mind can't comprehend everything at once. Some decisions simply don't have an optimal answer because they look different from different angles.The key concept underlying Minsky's model is that minds as we think of them had to start with simple rules for recognizing and responding to cues, had to be able to incorporate goals in some form in those rules as well, and then eventually had to be able to recognize kinds of problem and activate appropriate ways of thinking. It makes sense to think of this in terms of logical levels of recognizers and responders, and importantly, what Minsky calls \\"critics\\" and \\"selectors,\\" where each new level provides some way to resolve conflicts that arise in the level below it.So conflicts in our instincts can be resolved by learned rules, conflicts in learned rules can be resolved by deliberation strategies, and in turn levels with different kinds of representations of the problem and eventually the problem solver and their own ways of thinking. Once the problem solver can represent themselves and their own thinking, we have the power to shape our own thinking in meaningful ways.I'm really not doing justice to this book in this review, because it's power is in the details of his examples and how they illustrate the architecture at work. Suffice to say that I think if you find a functional architecture of the mind of interest, I highly recommend this book. I think it gives a much more fundamental understanding of how minds most probably work than any amount of flashy recent brain scans, and certainly more than untestable holistic and quantum mechanical theories will ever tell us until we better understand the functional design. Neuroscience in the future will, I believe, be filling in the details of a framework very much like this one."},{"Title":"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind","review":"Progress in the design and creation of intelligent machines has been steady for the last four decades and at times has exhibited sharp peaks in both advances and applications. This progress has gone relatively unnoticed, or has been trivialized by the very individuals who have been responsible for it. The field of artificial intelligence has been peculiar in that regard: every advance is hailed as major at the time of its inception, but after a very short time it is delegated to the archives as being \\"trivial\\" or \\"not truly intelligent.\\" It is unknown why this pattern always occurs, but it might be due to the willingness of researchers to engage in philosophical debate on the nature of mind and the possibility, or impossibility, of thinking machines. By indulging in such debates, researchers waste precious time that is better used dealing with the actual building of these machines or the development of algorithms or reasoning patterns by which these machines can solve problems of both theoretical and practical interest. Also, philosophical musings on artificial intelligence, due to the huge conceptual spaces in which they wander aimlessly, are usually of no help in pointing to the right direction for researchers to follow. What researchers need is a \\"director\\" or \\"set of directors\\" that are familiar with the subject matter, have both applied and theoretical experience in the field of artificial intelligence, and that eschew philosophical armchair speculation in favor of realistic dialog about the nature and functioning of intelligent machines.The author of this book has been one of these \\"directors\\" throughout his professional career, and even though some of his writings have a speculative air about them, many others have been very useful as guidance to those working in the trenches of artificial intelligence. One can point to the author's writings as both inspiration and as a source of perspiration, the latter arising because of the difficulty in bringing some of his ideas to fruition. It would be incorrect to state that the author's ideas have played a predominant role in the field of artificial intelligence, but his influence has been real, if sometimes even in the negative, such as his commentary on the role of perceptrons.There are intelligent machines today, and they have wide application in business and finance, but their intelligence is restricted (but highly effective) to certain domains of applicability. There are machines for example that can play superb chess and backgammon, being competitive with the best human players in this regard, but these machines, and the reasoning patterns they use in chess and backgammon cannot without major modification indulge themselves in performing financial prediction or proving difficult theorems in mathematics. The building of intelligent machines that can think in multiple domains is at present one of the most difficult outstanding problems in artificial intelligence. Some progress is being made, but it has been stymied again by overindulgence in philosophical speculation and rancorous debates on the nature of mind and whether or not machines can have true emotions.Humans can of course think in multiple domains. Indeed, a good human chess player can also be a good mathematician or a good chef. The ability to think in multiple domains has been christened as \\"commonsense\\" by many psychologists and professional educators, and those skeptical of the possibility of machine intelligence. It is thought by many that in order for a machine to be considered as truly intelligent, or even indeed to possess any intelligence at all, it must possess \\"commonsense\\", in spite of the vague manner in which this concept is frequently presented in both the popular and scientific literature.The nature of \\"commonsense\\" is explored in an atypical manner in this book, and in this regard the author again shows his ability to think outside of the box and phrase issues in a new light. This is not to say that advice on how to implement these ideas in real machines is included in the book, as it is not. But the ideas do seem plausible as well as practical, particularly the concept of a \\"panalogy\\", which is the author's contraction of the two words \\"parallel analogy\\". A panalogy allows a machine (human or otherwise) to give multiple meanings to an object, event, or situation, and thus be able to discern whether a particular interpretation of an event is inappropriate. A machine good in the game of chess could possibly then give multiple interpretations to its moves, some of which may happen to be similar to the interpretations given to a musical composition for example. The machine could thus use its expertise in chess to write musical compositions, and therefore be able to think in multiple domains. On the other hand, the machine may realize that there are no such analogies between chess and musical composition, and thus refrain from attempting to gain expertise in the latter. Another role for pananalogies, which may be a fruitful one, is that they can be used to measure to what degree interpretations are \\"entangled\\" with each other. Intepretations, which are the results of thinking, algorithmic processing, or reasoning patterns as it were, could be entangled in the sense that they always refer to objects, events, or situations in multiple domains. A panalogy, being a collection of interpretations in one domain, could be entangled with another in a different domain. The machine could thus switch between these with great ease, and thus be effective in both domains. It remains of course to construct explicit examples of panalogies that can be implemented in a real machine. The author does not direct the reader on how to do this, unfortunately.The author also discusses a few other topics that have been hotly debated in artificial intelligence, throughout its five-decade long history, namely the possibility of a conscious machine or one that displays (and feels!) genuine emotions. The nature of consciousness, even in the human case, is poorly understood, so any discussion of its implementation in machines must wait further clarification and elucidation. Contemporary research in neuroscience is giving assistance in this regard. The author though takes another view of consciousness, which departs from the \\"folk psychology\\" that this concept is typically embedded in. His view of consciousness is more process-oriented, in that consciousness is the result of more than twenty processes going on in the human brain. An entire chapter is spent elaborating on this view, which is highly interesting to read but of course needs to be connected with what is known in cognitive neuroscience.It remains to be seen whether the ideas in this book can be implemented in real machines. If the author's views on emotions, commonsense, and consciousness are correct, as detailed throughout the book, it seems more plausible that machines will arise in the next few years that have these characteristics. If not, then perhaps machine intelligence should be viewed as something that is completely different from the human case. The fact that hundreds of tasks are now being done by machines that used to be thought of as the sole province of humans says a lot about the degree to which machine intelligence has progressed. Whenever the first machines are constructed to operate and reason in many in different domains, it seems likely that they will have their own ideas about how to direct further progress. Their understanding of ideas and issues may perhaps be very different than what humans is, and they may in fact serve as directors for further human advancement in different fields and contexts, much like the author has done throughout a major portion of his life."},{"Title":"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind","review":"I am currently reading various neuroscience, emotion, psychology, and even anthropology books.

The long awaited sequel, portions which have appeared on his website since the mid-1990s, starts out with an interesting title- implying emotion is an interesting and essential component of cognition. Several other articifial intelligence researchers agree- that language and robotic interfaces wont be effective unless they capture emotional nuance. However, only a couple of chapters address emotion, while the rest deal with general topics in cognition and artificial intelligence. Unlike Society of Mind I found few new ideas in this survey.The other major problem with the book is its choppy flow. It reminds of a power point presentation in outline form. Many, probably too many lists, diagrams , and quotations break up the sparse prose making it slow reading. Its like a set of lecture notes not entirely fleshed out.

Routine stuff like making mental models of the world, design plans,pursue goals and feel desires aren't all that routine, when you think about it. And the way it all plays together - from simple, instinctive kinds of thought to more complex forms, such as consciousness or self awareness - is obviously very complex.It would be very easy to get stuck in too much detail or to be too superficial. But somehow Minsky finds the right balance. So overall, the Emotion Machine is a brilliant introduction to how our minds work.Often he will give us an idea about what must be going in computational terms, and then shield us from the usual deluge of ''neuro-technical'' terms. Because (in his own words) ''research on the (actual nitty gitty of the) brain is advancing so quickly that any conclusion one might make today could be outdated in just a few weeks.'' In one reviewers words: ''The Emotion Machine rewards careful reading. You'll learn a lot about how your mind works, even if you won't be all that much wiser about what is actually going on within your brain.'' :-)Nevertheless, the book is obviously based on the latest advances in computer science, psychology, neuroscience, engineering etc. And certainly, his book is not a bad place to start if one wants to be a little wiser on what goes on inside our heads.A wonderful book.-Simon"},{"Title":"The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind","review":"One of the great pioneers and researchers in Artificial Intelligence world Marvin Minsky takes on this work the deconstructing of our emotional Mind, Consciousness, Self in the hope of providing a kind of algorithm for artificially creating the Artificial Feeling Intelligent Being Machine of the future. Or that's in any case how I interpret what he is doing.He looks at various mind- functions such as goal-making, resourcefulness, the way pain becomes suffering, and engages in explorations of the subjects aimed at providing understanding. He in doing this uses students' queries and replies, and also quotations from the best minds he can find who address the problems. The result is amusing if difficult chapters, interesting forays into providing better insight into how the old machine inside us, or upstairs from us ( just joking) happens to swoon when it hears 'Moonlight Sonata' or cry when it is told that it has dirtied the floor with crumbs after the better- half has just spent two hours washing it.I take what Minsky has done as a kind of scientific post- modernism, a reconstruction and breaking down into various narratives what obviously mysteriously operates as some kind of whole.To give a bit of flavor of what he is doing I take a piece from his website in which he summarizes chapter one of the book.\\"Summary: This chapter addressed some questions about how people acquire the goals they pursue. Some of these are instincts that come with our genetic inheritance, but others are subgoals that we construct to achieve other goals that we already have. I also conjectured that some of our highest-level goals are produced by special machinery that lead each person to try to adopt the values of other persons who become what I call that person's \\"Imprimers.\\"Imprimers are parents, friends, or acquaintances to whom a person becomes 'attached,' because they respond actively to one's needs--and they then can induce special feelings in us, such as guiltiness, shame, and pride. At first, those Imprimers must be actually present, but older children form \`mental models' of them, and can use these to evaluate goals when those imprimers no longer are on the scene. Eventually, these models later develop into what we call by names like conscience, values, ideals, and ethics.\\"If you like the sample you should go for the whole book.

So far this has not been notably successful. You have to give Dr. Minsky credit though. After a brief introduction he goes into a chapter titled 'Falling In Love.' That's an emotion that neither poets, philosophers, psychologists, nor - perhaps especially nor - computer scientists can understand. I certainly don't feel that this computer I'm typing this on loves me.Dr. Minsky is trying, in this book, to analyze emotions, and to do so in a way that may lead to thinking about Artificial Intelligence. Indeed he is trying to bring 'commonsense' to machines. He has devised some new and different ways to view emotions that really make you think about your own view of the world.

It is almost like he is pretending to not experience these mysteries himself, so that he does not have to seriously engage the question of how/why our brain/minds do these things, and under what conditions other machines might.

The author takes on the impossible taskof teaching machines human emotions. In doing this, he accomplishesthe task in a very rudimentary manner. The book would be more helpful ifit articulated how the knowledge engineer could go about designingMinsky's ideas into a practical artificial intelligence algorithm.The need for common sense is a composite of the experiential domain unique to all of us. It is the function of knowledge engineers to develop the raw data which make up and refine the AI engine. This work attempts to quantify universalist notions of perception and feeling utilizing some very simple formulae.A criticism of the work is that there isn't sufficient test data to confirm the rudimentary elements contained in the data sets put forth.In a real time environment, we capture this information via communications network-polling. Learning is formulated using a rigorous process of trial, error and correction . The challenge is to incorporate the correction processes into the polling software so that the same errors aren't made again . Minimally, a process must be in place to identify errors on a timely basis and refer them to a problem escalation center or an internal self-correction algorithym.Problem escalation systems are limited by the inability to articulate every possible error condition which the system might encounter. How wouldMinsky handle complex emotional problems/issues scientifically?An artificial intelligence system with an emotional component could behelpful in space exploration. Such a system could assist in amelioratingthe environment of loneliness and helplessness accompanying space travel.Once outside the earth's atmosphere, the environment contains phenomena unfamiliar to our earth science and the experiential domain in typical scientific systems. For instance, what happens when a martian spaceexploration vehicle encounters a new mineral not on our current periodictable of elements? How would an AI system handle this new phenomena?Obviously, the AI system would be required to refer this condition to aknowledge engineer for further study and unique system polling.Our instinct involves a complex process of self consciousness, deliberation and reinforcement acquired via repeated learning/repetition. Higher order learning seeks to take if/then conditions and act iteratively according to a hierarchy based upon materiality. For instance, the most important goals have a higher order in the accomplishment hierarchy than the lesser ones.How would an artificial intelligence system handle emotional maturation?This work provides a good start for the artificial intelligence algorithym development.

This is because -- like all animate behavior -- the existence of self is uniquely keyed to the fact of animate autonomy.In other words, the greatest of behvaioral conundrums is perhaps the simplest. In order to to decided what to eat, do or where to go, self provides that unique user perspective to allow the necessary illumination of what inbuilt needs remain unmet and which are in the most immediate need of meeting.An effective engineer, Mother Nature has put into excellent service the process of emotion which allows the quick, effecient recording of the relevant information.In his classic work The Astonishing Hypothesis, Francis Crick said that self was nothing more than the current state of our neurons and ganglia. Richard Dawkins has repeatedly shown that those neurons and ganglia recieve their current structure through the explanable process of natural selection.

But it is very helpful speculation if you are interested in the subject. Not all is simple reading especially if you have not been exposed to it before. My own opinion was well advanced by reading this book and I too have agreements and disagreements. Minsky properly suggests that looking at the mind in a too fragmented way will stop us from understanding it. I too see the mind as a complex whole of concepts, processes, and most of all interactive neural resonances. Minsky on the other hand then goes on to fragment the mind's functioning into 20 different capabilities and offers proposals how they work, but enough how they might interact. His perspective is still too fragmente, but then he suggests that uilding those functions into software might create an artifical intelligence.My own understanding was the most enhanced by his description of how motion and sensation form an expectation loop, meaning that each action has a connected sensation response that leads to another action and so on. This motion/sensation mechanism is built into neural nets as are all other functions of the brain. It allows us to act without abstract thought.The connection of motion/sensation with abstract thought (often referred to as reason or logical thinking) and emotions requries the contemplation of the human limbic system and neurotransmitters. There I miss quite a few points to be made that Minsky missed.I also disagree with his expectations into AI. It is this complex resonance between action/sensation, abstract thought and emotion/feelings that creates not only our human experience, but also our intuitive capability. Therefore that will not be emulated by an artificial intelligence mechanism as it lacks our human biological experience that shapes us so strongly. I suggest Steven Pinker'sThe Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Naturefor a better understanding of how we become humans.My own thoughts of what an AI computer might turn out to be like and how cruel and distorted too rational human beings can be you will find in my own novelDeity. Cruelty is not emotional it is rational.Overall 'The Emotion Machine' is a great book on the subject and well worth reading if you want to expand your own thinking.

For anyone else it is a horrific bore. There are hundreds of books in cog sci, robotics, AI, evolutionary psych(EP) and philosophy offering far more info and insight on cognition than this one. Minsky is a top rate senior scientist but it barely shows here. He has alot of good references but they are seldom discussed in any depth and there is lots more left out than included on the subject of AI, cognition and the mind. Like nearly everyone in cognition, AI and EP research, he has no clue that Wittgenstein laid out the high level structure of our psychology and made penetrating comments on minds and machines some 3/4 of a century ago. His works are a virtually untapped source for cognitive scientists. Minsky has clearly not kept up, with many of the refs and much of the discussion of primary interest about 20 years ago (see Gazzinaga's 'The Cognitive Neurosciences 3'for an update). And, he has no grasp at all of intentional psychology from the philosophical side (see any of Wittgenstein's works or Searle's brilliant 'Rationality in Action') nor of evolutionary psychology from the experimental and observational side (see Buss-The Handbook of EP). yet these contain many of the high level descriptions and search routines he is seeking. The very basic outlines here of the ideas used to approach AI research seem like they could all be discovered in a short semester by reasonably bright high school students. And of course, there is the materialist/reductionist bias looming above it all, as expressed in the title. In spite of all the work by Minsky and others, machines do not have anything recognizable as intentional psychology and we have very little idea how to give it to them. That is why the best robot in the world has less practical intelligence than an ant (or even an amoeba).

For myself however, though given the jacket wording, back cover comments and site summary indicated otherwise, I felt that the book was not valuable to me.If you're interested in the mind and aren't scared away by some mathematics and scientific method, go instead to the works of Penrose and Hofstadler.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Stealing Henry","review":"Does running away get you any closer to finding yourself?For the first nine years of her life, Savannah had her young mother Alice all to herself. They were close and carefree as they traveled across the USA, living somewhere for a little while, until the itch to move had to be scratched again. Savannah does not know who her father is, but that's okay with her. Their family of two suits her just fine.During Savannah's childhood, Alice went through a string of boyfriends. However, as Savannah is about to cross over into double digits, Alice falls for Jack. They get married, have a little boy, and plan roots. Suddenly, the family has doubled in size. The road trips end - and the abuse begins. Jack likes to drink. He does not seem to like Savannah.By the time Savannah is in high school, her stepfather has lost his job, her mother has lost the spark she once had, and her half-brother Henry has learned to listen in doorways before coming in the room, for fear of walking in on an argument. One night in the kitchen, it becomes too much for Savannah. She hits Jack with a pan (not to kill him but to knock him out), tells Henry to pack some things, takes the car keys and leaves with her little brother in tow.Stealing Henry is more than what the title implies. It is about family and about survival. The story impressively alternates between present day, following Savannah's attempt at escape, and 1986, when Savannah's mother was a teenager. The modern part of the story takes place over a matter of days, keeping up with the swift pace of Savannah and Henry as they go across the country.The characters and the stories they tell are memorable. The dialogue is realistic, especially that spoken by Savannah, who doesn't hold back. She is remarkably selfless. Her love for her brother and her mother shines in everything she does. When Savannah realizes that her mother is not who she once was, the revelation alone is heartbreaking, but the writing makes it even moreso.I highly recommend Stealing Henry, especially to those who love books by Sarah Dessen and Melissa Lion. Those who enjoyed Falling Through Darkness, Carolyn MacCullough's first novel, will not be disappointed by Stealing Henry. In fact, they may enjoy Stealing Henry even more. I know I did."},{"Title":"Stealing Henry","review":"Like \\"Falling Through Darkness,\\" MacCullough's first book, \\"Stealing Henry\\" mixes fascinating characters with a touch of suspense. I just couldn't put this book down. The plot shifts between Savannah's flight from her abusive stepfather and the story of Savannah's mother's doomed first love. The characters are complex and appealing, and you can't help but be drawn into their lives. You find yourself rooting for Savannah the whole way, terrified for her when her stepfather seems to have tracked her down and crossing your fingers that her friends and extended family will protect her.A fantastic novel! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Stealing Henry","review":"As in her first novel, Falling Through Darkness, MacCullough has crafted a beautiful novel with prose that sings. Her characters are vivid, the dialogue pitch perfect, the situation very real, and the resolution hopeful but realistic. All in all this is a terrific read from a very talented writer. I look forward to her other books."},{"Title":"Stealing Henry","review":"The night Savannah brains her stepfather Jack with the frying pan is the night she decides to leave home for good. It doesn't matter that she has no money and her eight-year-old brother Henry to take care of. It doesn't even matter that her stepfather will probably follow them. Savannah can stand a few obstacles as well as she can a slap or two. What she can't stand is the idea of becoming like her mother Alice.Alice used to be someone Savannah admired, someone she could look up to. But that was another life when Alice was still looking for her own future and finding nothing she expected.Savannah's life wasn't always about listening before entering a room and not making eye contact or talking back. Her childhood homes could fill a road atlas. Savannah and Alice traveled all across the country before the fateful day their car broke down and the party stopped for good.Savannah and Henry are journeying to a house they've never seen. Eighteen years ago certain events conspired to drive Alice to leave that same house for good; events that would eventually determine the course of both Alice and Savannah's lives in Stealing Henry (2005) by Carolyn MacCullough.Stealing Henry draws readers in right from the beginning with a shocking opening line and a truly evocative cover (designed by Rodrigo Corral--the mastermind behind the US covers for the Uglies series). Nothing about Savannah's life is easy and it's simple to assume reading about her won't be either. But the opposite is true. MacCullough's lyrical prose pulls readers in, quickly making Savannah and her unreal life completely believable.Even passing scenes of the local emergency room, Alice's current place of employ, are skillfully written with a high degree of authenticity. Everything about this story is evocative and compelling.I read Stealing Henry shortly after the van incident and a generally not peaceful time in my own life. Reading about Savannah and her own journey was somehow entirely appropriate for that situation and often comforting. Much like MacCullough's later novels, this story is always optimistic. Even at her lowest, Savannah remains hopeful; the writing itself becoming both peaceful and reassuring.Possible Pairings: How to (un)Cage a Girl by Francesca Lia Block, The Secret Life of Prince Charming by Deb Caletti, The Great Gatsby by F.

I slipped out the back door, wearing the backpack, carrying the rest, breathing in that dried pine needle scent, feeling my way step by step to the carport. Silently, I loaded everything into the pickup before hopping in, turning the key, and shattering the quiet. A minute later I was cruising down the winding main road, accompanied by Elizabeth Reed, headed in the direction of Truckee.At five thousand feet there are still dirty mounds of snow alongside the road, cleaner accumulations in the adjoining woods. An hour later the sky had become light, revealing rows of snow- and evergreen-covered mountains stretching to the horizon, one of the closer ones scarred by a few long white gashes down the side which are ski runs. Joining up with Interstate 80, I occasionally passed an eighteen-wheeler but otherwise had sole possession of the road. At Donner Pass I glanced over my shoulder at the long, dark lake, the wooden tunnels over the railroad tracks, and the rush of spring melt over a cliff.Descending from the mountains the drifts change from snow to housing developments outside Sacramento; the accumulations there are of drivers on the road. Two hours on the Interstate and I veered off into the hills south of Napa. A handful of stately wineries punctuate the miles of vineyard trellises pulled tight like the warp on a loom. The fog surrendered the hilltops and fled just before I reached them. Drifts of orange California poppies, alternating with yellows and rust reds run through the green of spring pastures in the coastal hills as I approached home.Sure, I get burnt out on sitting in the car for too many hours, but it's one hell of a pretty country we have. Despite all the places I've seen overtaken by progress and humanity in my fifty years, I still don't begin to take for granted what a wonderland we're so fortunate to inhabit.\\"And in the end they traded their tired wingsFor the resignation that living brings.\\"--Jackson Browne, \\"Before the Deluge\\"Savannah spent the first half of her life wandering around this beautiful country with her mother, Alice. She's got miles of memories about all those places they'd seen across America. I'd expect that in all that time they also gotten a taste of Donner Pass and of restored Old Town Truckee. Maybe they even got to visit the little community near Plumas-Eureka where I spent the last couple of nights.But Savannah and Alice's life on the road came to a halt years ago when their car broke down on the Jersey Turnpike, and they were \\"rescued\\" by Jack. Now Savannah has spent years in the same place, dealing with her abusive stepfather Jack, and helping care for her little brother Henry. Alice seems to always be off at work and oblivious to what is going on at home. But things are changing again for good because Savannah has had enough. And she loves her little brother too much to even consider taking off and leaving Henry to deal with Jack by himself.\\"Jack's body is blocking her vision, but she doesn't have to see Henry to know he's close to tears. Jack swings around, and now she can see her little brother, standing half in and half out of the kitchen doorway. Henry is flushed and sweating, on the verge of being sick.\\" 'What's the matter, buddy?' Jack says, his voice still too loud and jarring, but now forcefully bright. He holds out his arms as if waiting for Henry to run to him.\\"But Henry is digging one toe into the splintered doorframe. 'I heard yelling,' he says, and Savannah knows he heard a lot more. Like her, Henry has learned to listen in at doorways before entering a room.\\" 'No one's yelling,' Jack says, belatedly trying to lower his voice. He advances two steps toward Henry.\\" 'What were you doing, then?' Henry says. He sounds like he needs to clear his throat.\\" 'Are you crying, bud?' Jack says, and now his voice is dangerously quiet. Savannah closes her eyes, listens to Henry swallow, knows they are lost.\\" 'No,' he squeaks. 'I just...thought...'\\" 'Jesus Christ, what a...'\\"But Savannah doesn't wait to hear the rest. It seems that the time stretches and fades, replaced by something cold and hard and crystallized in her mind. She snaps back in to hear Henry sob, to see Jack take another turning step away from her, giving her all the space she needs to curve her fingers around the hot handle of the skillet. She does not feel the now boiling butter foam across her skin, although she will wonder later at the red blisters on her wrist and forearm. Instead, she feels a rush of blank air, of nothing, as she slams the pan up like a tennis racket, through unencumbered space, and into the side of Jack's head.\\"Interspersed with the story of Savannah and Henry on the run is the tale of how Alice and Savannah had first come to live their nomadic life and how a relationship from the past can play a role in the present and future.Buckle your seatbelts. STEALING HENRY is one heart-pounding ride. YA thriller joined with a bit of mystery and a healthy dose of treachery make STEALING HENRY a trip you don't want to miss."},{"Title":"Stealing Henry","review":"There's a lot to like and dislike about Stealing Henry. The beginning of the story is not at all how you would expect a story such as this to start; Your thrown right in the middle of Savannah's life with her abusive father and her decision to run away from home with her little brother, Henry towing along, completely obliging to the idea himself. As the story rolls on, you are gripped with panic and fear that Savannah might be caught in her daring escape from home to someplace safe, away from her father. Her mother Alice, is no longer the person she once was; Alice is now a fearful, and meek wife of an angry man not at all like he was when she met on the day her car broke down. She does nothing to help her daughter, for she is rarely home, and is certainly thrown for a loop by her daughter's latest stunt. The author crafted some interesting characters for the story to revolve around;They're all quite the individuals to my surprise, diverse in their own ways. Savannah and Henry are without a doubt my favorite characters in the book. The description of the places the duo travel to is very vivid without too much detail and the strain and anger the sister is under is truly felt through the storytelling.The only problems I have with the books is that the characters tend to drop the \`F'-bomb every other sentence when speaking to each other. The book wasn't so descriptive of sexual content in the story, but it's the most I've read about in a book I've borrowed recently, for sure. Several chapters, placed between \\"present\\" chapters, depict Alice's \\"past\\", her life in her hometown, and \\"present day\\" chapters shift between things Savannah did with her mother and life with Jack before returning to the predicament she faces. While the insight on Alice's life is interesting, I really can't bring myself to feel anything for a woman who want stand up to her husband who hurts her children. Plus I think I would've liked if the chapters concerning Savannah and Alice's pasts were placed at the beginning and not so much as in between chapters for an easier grasp of their lives. And I think the thing I disliked the most, certainly, was the way the book ended {SPOILERS AHEAD}.Savannah ending up living with her aunt and Henry having to go back to living with an unhelpful mother and abusive father (sucky). All in all, Stealing Henry is an enjoyable piece of fiction, worth giving a try. 7/9/05 ----- [a 4 out of 5]"},{"Title":"Closing the Cosmic Eye","review":"This was a good book with a so so begining. Too much about how Bates got into the situation he was in, was left out. Where did he get a ship that could travel that far?"},{"Title":"Closing the Cosmic Eye","review":"This latest Outlanders adventure - Closing the Cosmic Eye - is the most hardcore sci-fi-ish storyline to date.Written by the illustrious co-author Victor Milan, Closing the Cosmic Eye has a fantastic start with explosive action/adventure with the ever cool Team Phoenix battling against two warring factions, now joined by their own version of little Domi, a dark-haired teen tribal girl who has been adopted by the team. Now beset by nearby marauders, as well as being betrayed by their newfound allies they had just freed in their last adventure a couple of books ago, they are soon rescued by their new friends of Cerberus in a climatic battle that was fun to read.Then about 75 pages into this pretty much streamlined storyline, it all of the sudden goes into major cosmic hardcore science fiction proportions. Which is real cool on one hand, but much too rushed and sometimes hard to follow on the other. It all of the sudden turned into a Star Wars kind've story instead of Outlanders. Which is fine if things were more clearer and not seemingly rushed to a quick conclusion. This really needed to be a duology or trilogy to flesh it all out.But, still in all, there were tidbits of greatness throughout this galactic adventure. Tons of alien species warring amongst one another. (Too many, perhaps...?) Like a couple of other Victor Milan's novels and storylines, the overall storyline ideas and concepts are awesome and triple cool, but some of the executions seemed either hard to follow or just plain rushed for completion.Victor Milan's new book has created a new cosmic threat so large that it makes Mark Ellis's main alien bad guys - the overlords - look like mere pests that could be easily destroyed like stepping on a bug. Only the keenest of readers could detect these hints of this upcoming alien threat in his past books, starting with Uluru Destiny and Lords of the Deep.I loved the teaming up of the Cerberus warriors with Team Phoenix. They clash sometimes, and have tensions, but still manage to show respect for one another in a number of ways. And the idea of having two groups of warriors coming from past and future earth is just very neat. I wish Team Phoenix would have their own series. Like in his past 80's postholocaust Guardian series, without aliens or muties, Victor Milan has grown as a writer, becoming more of a hardcore fantasy/sci-fi writer than a straightforward adventure writer. But when he does this, he seems to cram too much in one book to swallow. Therein lies the rub.The main two alien warring factions were gigantic in size and scope, and was sometimes hard to follow and picture in my mind. Sometimes I was picturing something between a cross of Outlanders with Aliens movie and tie-in novels. Nothing wrong with that. Just needed some more cultivation, fleshing out and details.As in a couple of other Outlander Milan novels, the ending was too abrupt and Closing the Cosmic Eye felt rather rushed. By the ideas of having the Cerberus crew and Team phoenix stuck in a far away galaxy, exiled from earth, made me want to continue turning the page. Having Lakesh and Philboyd finally finding a way to get the two groups to come back home to earth, with Team phoenix deciding to stay and fight in a bigger war for the galaxy, makes me wish Gold Eagle would develop a series of Team Phoenix battling alien overlords throughout the galaxy with these myriad mixed alien races. Now THAT would be a great, fresh and exciting series to read!But giving this a 3.5 star review is just my personal chioce. Readers who love the more Star Wars and Star Trek type novels, will surely enjoy this even more than I. C'mon Milan, write another Deathlands novel. Give us a more hardy sci-fi-ish adventure in that series.Or just another gem of raw survival with brains like you did in Deathlands: Vengeance Trail. It really needs it."},{"Title":"FOC: Freedom of choice : short stories of freedom from sexual bondage","review":"This is the worst book ever written.

I do wish there had been more devotion to the \\"casitas\\" section of middle-class homes and less to buildings dedicated to government or business; and perhaps more photographs of interiors.

This book is great for someone with programming experience and just a little OOP knowledge. It serves as an excellent overview of all the things that you can do with C# with enough detail for you to try and explore things on your own. It does not provide really deep information in any of the subjects but it seems to give you enough to say \\"hey I can do that\\" but having to go elsewhere for the exact details on how you do it.The book does have it's share of typos - what programming book doesn't.

For example, this book didn't actually show me how to populate a List&lt;T> from a database. In the real world that's what I needed to be able to make a real app in VB6. (Of course I was using collections for VB6.) And all those examples about cows and animals are cute but once again I don't see why they don't use something more realistic.

The head of all IT a Halliburtin was my best pal in college and he told me they were laying off developers. So I swalloed my pride, got network + certifies. Was going on to CEH.

I was ready to take the security test but I advised my company examforce, I'm having a a migraine or two every week. My doctor told me to blow it off; I was so tense I was a stroke in the making.

As a professional DBA with some development experience (C, Perl) but no exposure to C# or .NET, I felt the authors efficiently introduced the concepts and specifics I needed to actually understand these complex topics.I liked the comparisons to Java, VB, and C++, since I have a passing familiarity (but no *real* experience) with all of them. The examples were short, teaching the point of the chapter or section as briefly as possible. While missing the feel of a \\"real-life\\" example, it accomplished the goal of demonstrating the underlying concept well.I'm about a third of the way through (in one long weekend while attending to family), and am enjoying the tome far more than I expected to.

It is both a very broad and deep view of C# and .NET, covering more than most other books. It has good explanations of things like delegates, properties, indexers, and differences between C# and java, C++ and other languages. The section on ADO (SQL Database classes) is especially good, tho it goes pretty fast. This is a professional book, not for beginning programmers, but especially good if you know java or C++ already (I know both, so it helped even more).Between this book and the Microsoft web site, I now have a firm understanding of the basics of C#, and a start in learning a good chunk of .NET. Much more to do on learning .NET, of course.CONS: The problem with the book was a lack of quality control -- many more errors in the code snippets and some detailed explanations than there should have been -- all someone has to do is copy them into a program and try compiling them, and verify it at least compiles! Some were corrected in the downloadable code, but still a lot that weren't (I got tired of submitting errata reports). There were even some simple speling errors (sic) that a simple spell checker could have caught! Jeez guys, come on!I was forced to go to the Microsoft web site and get accurate data on many occasions. Lost confidence in Wrox.I got the impression that much of the data had started in one of the other C# books, got edited, and now there are holes, references to code and items that don't exist, etc. More a fault of the editors than the original authors.Wrox -- put some pressure on your quality control people!

I give this book a big thumbs up in getting me up to speed in C# 2.0. It is a BIG book - 1540 pages and is heavy enough to leave dents in your legs. The authors do a good job of explaining C# from start to finish. There is also a tremendous amount of what I will label as 'tips and tricks' throughout. Here's my big reasons to get this book:* It's big and covers so much from the C# world in an \`applied' manner* It covers all the core C# items and then expands out to areas that are less covered in other books - such as working with Active Directory or GDI+* Covers working with SQL Server 2005 quite nicely* Even covers futures such as working with WCFBasically if you are a developer in the C# world of .NET - then this is something you would want next to your keyboard."},{"Title":"Professional C# 2005 (Wrox Professional Guides)","review":"This book is a decent introduction to the C# language, in a very slow, very hold-your-hand sort of way.

If I had this in electronic form, I'd love to see how many times the phrase, \\"The idea is that,\\" appears in this book. I even saw, \\"The thing is that,\\" which should never appear in writing.

Just like the publisher said, their books are written for programmer by programmer. There are not that many chit-chats in Wrox's book, just to-the-point programmer's talk. This book certainly reflects that principle.However, I find it super difficult to follow the book content while studying the example source codes.There are merely any cross references of the code snippet in the book to the example source code supplied. (It will be a great help if the book can point out something such as this following snippet is from example code xxxx).Most of the example codes are poorly written. They are presented with a few .cs files instead of a decently organized solution/project file. This makes studying the inner logic a lot more difficult since I have to re-make them into solution/project files so I can use the VS.2005 IDE to debug the program in order to understand better.I am sorry to say that this book is a bit of an disappointment.I hope they will improve in their next edition."},{"Title":"Professional C# 2005 (Wrox Professional Guides)","review":"As far as i've read (only read about 80 pages in the middle of the book)...It's a massive reference about every aspect of .Net.Everything is is handled, like windows forms and asp.net but also generics, windows services,...It's a good guide if you search some information about all different area's in .Net.

The author was one of the leading experts on elasticity and plasticity, producing a classic text that covers stress, strain and plastic flow. It uses classical vector and tensor approaches, but no finite element analysis (which had not been developed when this book was written). The book therefore is restricted to closed form mathematical solutions, but they cover multiaxial as well as uniaxial problems. There are excellent discussions of Mohr's circle and how it is used to solve problems. Another feature of the book that I find very informative is the inclusion of brief historical comments and pictures that highlight the development of mechanics. Be warned, however, that the fracture that is referred in the title is that due to plastic overload. There is no discussion of modern fracture concepts, such as fracture mechanics.I recommend this book to those interested in the classical, 19th and early 20th century approaches to mechanics. While these approaches are still valid, computer based approaches have largely superseded them. However, a firm grounding in these classical approaches lets one more fully understand the state of stress, strain and resulting deformation, as opposed to just reading a computer output."},{"Title":"Theory of Flow and Fracture of Solids, Volume One","review":"Seller shipped book in time and in the condition specified.The book is a great reference and teaching tool for the development of classical equations involving plastic yielding of solids and differences from the elastic states.

My new mantra: Be all you can be, just don't join the Army. Listen to the Tom Joyner Morning Show (TJMS) instead. I'M JUST A DJ BUT...demonstrates how Joyner is rich is spirit, advice and generosity.Believe it or not, Tom Joyner didn't wake up one day and suddenly realize he is a millionaire, he worked hard for his money and still does. In fact, his slogan is: \\"The hardest working man in radio, the fly jock Tom Joyner\\" holds a lot of truth. He dedicated countless hours of service, even when he wasn't sure about what he was doing; to always (not sometimes) make a good impression. He is \\"fly\\" because he once flew daily from Chicago to Dallas to work on two radio stations. Talk about dedication to the profession.Joyner speaks openly about issues with his weight, the road to syndication, marriage, parenting, the Tom Joyner Foundation, his crew, his commitment to Black people and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). In fact, he's received plenty of backlashes for wanting to help ONLY Black people. Why not cater to your people? I imagine him on his soapbox, preaching his gospel to those who didn't agree and saying something like, \\"oh well, I'm going to do it anyway.\\" Now that's a man who is comfortable with whom he is, no airs about him. Money didn't change him; it only changed how he spent it. He had a plan; he stuck to it and is now reaping the benefits of his labor. Sure, he made some mistakes along the way, but to err is to be human. Consistency is learned by seeing and doing. It's cyclical and it's up to you to keep the wheels turning and passing on the lessons and good habits.There are so many lessons obtained from reading I'M JUST A DJ BUT... In this book, Joyner reiterates points he's always talking about on his morning show. The pages are dog-eared and highlighted and soon to be passed on to my teenager. Don't sleep on good advice, even if it doesn't give a fool-proof plan on how to get more money. This is not about how to get rich quick; it's about how to work hard to get what you want and how to maintain it once you have it. Keeping a leveled head helps too.Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review"},{"Title":"I'm Just a DJ But...It Makes Sense to Me","review":"My first thoughts about Tom Joyner's claim that he's just a DJ mirror my thoughts about 'O' saying she's just a..., but I digress. With a supporting cast of who's who in African American entertainment, Tom Joyner shares some infectious memories from being raised in Tuskegee, Alabama to his nationally syndicated The Tom Joyner Morning Show.Joyner, with what has become his humorous trademark, shares his meager beginnings as a DJ in Alabama and of a struggling, hustling student at Tuskegee Institute. But this book is far from a humorous undertaking. The message that resonates from the pages is that dreams are the springboard to life and a burning passion is the wind beneath your wings. It was those dreams and that passion that propelled him to reach beyond roadblocks, racism, and restitution. He talks about his weight, his family, his crew and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). And he shares his feeling of pride because of his dedication, hardwork and accomplishments.I'M JUST A D.J. BUT...It Makes Sense To Me is a candid, pensive and lively read. Joyner lends three distinct rules 1)learn your craft, 2) know your competition, and 3) let jealousy be a motivator to improve or join forces. He has no problem getting high-ballers to appear on his show now, but his allegiance is to the people who believed in him before he became 'The Hardest Working Man In Show Business'. In step with his DJing background, the chapters are titles of songs which carry a message. This book surprised me; it was a good read.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"I'm Just a DJ But...It Makes Sense to Me","review":"I just finished Tom Joyner's I'm Just a DJ but..., Mr. Joyner is anything but just a DJ. He is an entrepreneur, activist, entertainer, employer and most of all, a GIVER.This book magnified the things we already knew about the author, he is a man who is about the betterment of his people. Tenaciously, he works constantly toward that goal.In his memoir/self help book, Joyner gives practical advice on achieving success, raising children, finding your passion and more. All of this is given to readers through his simple yet intelligent pros. This book is filled with wisdom and down home wit.I'm sure there will be those who criticize his unwavering loyalty to African Americans first and foremost. This novel shows that Mr. Joyner is not anti-anything. He is pro-black and apparently believes that charity begins at home.No matter what the race, color or religion, I highly recommend I'm Just a DJ but... to anyone who has a dream that is bigger than their current circumstances.

There are lots of suspects with lots of motives, and Jarvis must narrow the field down to just one. This is an under-read series that deserves a wider audience. If you like your mysteries both cozy and procedural, this is the series for you. The author has well-drawn characters, a strong detective with smarts and savvy, and plots to keep you guessing."},{"Title":"Casanova Crimes (Seventh in the Quirky Elena Jarvis Mystery Series)","review":"While I usually begin a mystery series with book number one, I picked up Casanova Crimes out of curiosity. I found it completely enjoyable. It's not great literature, but there's interesting characters that we get to know outside of their immediate plot involvement, an intriguing crime with plenty of suspects, and an ending I really didn't anticipate. Elena Jarvis, the detective-star, is likeable, easy to relate to, and has a believable mix of qualities for a far-West-Texas character. The university and one of the professors in the story are somewhat on the edge of believability, but a little suspension of disbelief will suffice to get you through it. It's recommended light reading. I have purchased another in the series already."},{"Title":"Casanova Crimes (Seventh in the Quirky Elena Jarvis Mystery Series)","review":"While I enjoyed every book in the Elaina Jarvis series, Casanova Crimes was the best of the bunch.

This story of kidnapping and international intrigue has all the makings of an exciting and involving tale. Unfortunately, Mahoney has managed to turn this one into a dull affair. McKenna and Sanchez, the recurring heroes, are in their usual position of command over events, but the plot twists and casual conversation are about as exciting as bird watching. Mahoney has done better."},{"Title":"The Protectors","review":"I like Mahoney's stuff because it's mind candy in a familiar setting. In order for mind candy to work, however, it must be at least minimally plausible. The willing suspension of disbelief just doesn't work here. Unlimited funds, international absolution of all sins and the treatment of foreign countries like they were just another NYPD precinct dosen't cut it. Character development is lacking here and so is the usual cast. While The Two Chinatowns gave usual protagonist Detective Brian McKenna's partner (Detective Cisco Sanchez) center stage, The Protectors gives short shrift to all of the previous supporting roles. Okay reading for a long flight, but just not the grabber I've come to expect from Mahoney."},{"Title":"The Protectors","review":"This is a continuation of the series featuring NYC police detectives McKenna & Cisco. Dan Mahoney,a former NYPD captain, with 25 years on the force, writes well and authoritatively. For my personal taste, his main characters are a bit too perfect.The plot of this novel, involving kidnappings by Basque terrorists, did not seem plausible. Mahoney always seems to manage to interject some political bias into the story. To my reading,he painted most of the terrorists rather sympathetically. My preference is just a good page turner without political messages."},{"Title":"The Protectors","review":"IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED DAN MAHONEY'S BOOKS FEATURING DETECTIVES BRIAN MCKENNA AND CISCO SANCHEZ BUY THIS BOOK.

He analyzes what is new in media art by balancing recent works and historic media development, and so retells art history as media history. An interdisciplinary study in art history, media history, and new media art, the cross fertilization enriches his analysis and helps clarify the essence of immersion and Virtual Reality. Beyond Grau's analysis, I was thankful to see so many artists involved - many hot names. This book will be valuable for both practitioners and theoreticians. Hopefully there will be a paperback soon for students."},{"Title":"Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion (Leonardo Book Series)","review":"The unique approach to handing the history of \`virtual art' is scholarly and innovative, undermining popular conceptions of the notion of \`virtuality'. I would have appreciated colour plates, since the subject matter often pertains to the study of many forms of visual art. A glossary of terms also would have been helpful. The addition of these to elements would make the book much more accessible to readers who are introducing themselves to these concepts and artworks.Broad in breadth and depth, Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion traces the history of virtual art through studying the history of \`immersion' and \`illusion' in the arts, and relates these ideas to the current developments in \`virtual reality'. It is unlikely that the general public, or even most arts professionals, would consider the panoramic frescoes of ancient Pompeii a precursor to the 1980's notion of goggled cybernetic digitalia, nor the recent developments in transgenic art, yet this book includes very convincing arguments that link these ideas to the development of today's virtual art. Self-proclaimed as the \`first' to link art history and immersive visual culture to the field of contemporary digital environment-based art experiences, this innovative and convincing research is laid out before the reader in an intellectual, yet accessible fashion, complete with diagrams and illustrations to illuminate key ideas. Many interesting works of art are chronicled here, placed within a contextual framework that demonstrates the significance of the ideas and technology supporting the works. Gathering this information in a print format also allows these works to live on and influence other thinkers outside of directly experiencing the works, which is often not technically possible, given the temporal nature of many immersion-based artworks. Ideas do not develop in a vacuum, but through the dialogues of overlapping discourses, combined with critical thought. Grau demonstrates that virtual art is not exactly new, and it satisfies a basic human desire for experiencing the \`other', whether through looking at panoramic paintings of mythology or faraway lands, or designing a prototype Holodeck (Star Trek). Unexpected parallels abound, making this a very informative read that may forever change the reader's interpretations of classical art history as well as of virtual reality.It is likely that Grau reaches the academic arts audience he sets out to reach with this book, as is demonstrated by the numerous references to this book online, in various journals, blogs, and academic websites. This focus on art history as media history would be thoroughly appreciated by Marshall McLuhan fans, as well as art historians who specialize in media studies. Artists and historians interested in 3-D modeling, avatar development, online immersive environments, transgenic art, and historical instances of illusion in the arts will also find this book a valuable and up-to-date resource. This book would make a welcome addition to a University library, a gallery or artist-run centre's library, or the personal collection of savvy technophiles."},{"Title":"Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion (Leonardo Book Series)","review":"This book is an excellent rendition for electro-visual labs.The work is perfect if you are looking for new ideas on interiordecorating for the home.

When did that happen?\\" But William Saletan's conservatives are the \\"pro-choice conservatives\\"; right-to-life activists call them liberals and politicians call them moderates. These swing voters, conservative but not radical, pro-choice but pro-restriction, have dictated the terms of engagement in the abortion war from the late 1980s on. And Saletan's well-written account of abortion politics since that time gives no indication that the conflict is over, or will be any time soon.Bearing Right begins its narrative in Little Rock, Arkansas, 1986. Pollster Harrison Hickman is leading a focus group on a proposed amendment to the Arkansas constitution to ban public funding of abortions, while the strategists of the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) watch from behind a darkened glass panel, discussing how to turn the values of the Arkansas populace against the popular amendment. Remarkably, they succeed.Despite voters' widespread disapproval of public funding for abortion, Hickman found a pair of key weaknesses: women were far less likely to support the amendment when rape entered the picture, and men reacted strongly when the amendment was portrayed as government intrusion into private family decisions. The resulting media campaign based on Hickman's insights marked the beginning of a dramatic shift in the terms of the public discourse on abortion rights. Pro-choice activists embraced the language of libertarian conservatism, the first slip onto a politically expedient slope that would gradually erode the meaning of \\"choice.\\" They soon found that their ungrammatical new slogan, \\"Who Decides-You or Them?,\\" was just as useful to their opponents for enforcing patriarchy and limiting the rights the poor and the young as it was for defending abortion rights generally. The only possible answer to the question was \\"you,\\" but different groups had very different ideas of who, exactly, \\"you\\" referred to.The story of the internal workings of NARAL is relevant to a wide array of scholars, activists, and general readers. For political scientists and historians it presents a compelling and personalized case study on rhetoric, special interests and the meanings of populism. The strategy decisions of NARAL and their consequences underscore the importance of what questions are being asked and in what contexts as competing interests try to define the \\"will of the people.\\"As Saletan points out in his less-than-subtle way, the abortion war highlights the pitfalls of sacrificing principles for expediency: inevitably, once the terms of debate are shifted toward the middle, especially in a disingenuous way, the double-tipped pen of rhetoric will write both ways. By 1992, recruiting Barry Goldwater to help defeat an Arizona ballot measure that restricted abortion rights, \\"pro-choice activists had reached the summit of victory stripped of the cumbersome weight of much of their agenda.\\" \\"They had conquered the middle ground,\\" Saletan concludes, \\"and the middle ground had conquered them.\\" More interesting for activists and ideologues may be Saletan's discussion of \\"the right to choose life.\\" Ironically, as pro-life and pro-choice rhetoric converged into a libertarian chimera of ideals and politics, it was the common ground that lost out. Within the framework of the public debate, in which abortion rights were protected by keeping the government out of personal, family (not individual) decisions, there was little room for protecting the rights of minors or working women to carry pregnancies to term against the respective demands or threats of parents or employers.Unfortunately the intriguing NARAL story, based on organizational records and interviews, gradually dissolves into the broader context of the recent history of national abortion politics, essentially a distillation of fifteen years of news specials and newspaper clippings. The narrative loses momentum and coherence as it disconnects from the personalities and details of NARAL, and the issues spread from bans on abortion funding and government interference to parental consent laws, rape and incest exceptions, dilation & extraction/partial-birth procedures, cloning and stem cell research, and beyond.Bearing Right is hardly adequate as a general account of abortion policy and politics; it leaves far too much out. The role of jurisprudence is mentioned occasionally but largely ignored, discussions of state abortion laws are unsystematic, and there is no analysis of the formal positions and ideologies that inform abortion activism. Even if the premise in the title is granted, the question of how the war was won is only partially answered. But what this book does do, it does very well. Saletan's extensive experience as a political correspondent shines as he analyzes the choices and public positions of activists and politicians, and though his biases are obvious, his work makes a strong enough attempt at a balanced treatment that it can-and should-be read profitably by combatants on either side, and the civilians in between as well."},{"Title":"Bearing Right: How Conservatives Won the Abortion War","review":"This is an extremely readable and well-written recounting of the course of the politics of abortion from the perspective of the &quot;sides&quot; of the issue. As such, it's probably bound to tick off both &quot;sides&quot; at one point or another -- and I wouldn't take extreme negative reviews seriously, because they don't really appreciate the depth and clarity of the analysis. While I might quibble with some of the details, there's no denying it's a very well-researched book and one that, unlike most political tomes this side of Al Franken, can be read without feeling like you're stuck reading a textbook. My only real complaint is with the cover -- once again, a picture of a full-term pregnant woman to frame a book about abortions done months and months earlier, and this one with a little suggestion of female anatomy -- not helpful in taking the book seriously. But don't take this book by its cover -- if you're interested in genuine thoughtfulness and a little inside baseball on the give and take of an issue that touches most of the hot buttons of American politics, this is the book."},{"Title":"Bearing Right: How Conservatives Won the Abortion War","review":"This was completely different from everything I've read about this issue before. The details about what goes on behind the scenes are amazing, the polls and focus groups and how every word you hear from the politicians is gone over with a fine tooth comb to spin the public. I highly recommend for anyone interested on either side or in politics generally."},{"Title":"Bearing Right: How Conservatives Won the Abortion War","review":"Reviewer Humbug obviously doesn't see more than one facet to conservatives. For the sake of a manageable title, Saletan didn't say \\"anti-government\\" or \\"libertarian\\" conservatives, but once you start reading the book it's clear. It's the best analysis I've seen of abortion politics; I've long felt that both sides were framing the issue wrong. In my view it should be about helping women with the resources to carry their children to term, the pro-life feminist position. Saletan captures that dynamic pretty well - pro-choice feminists reluctantly using the libertarian stick to win, in effect giving power over the issue to people (and legislators) who think abortion should be legal but constrained by sensible restrictions through democratic institutions, not the courts."},{"Title":"Bearing Right: How Conservatives Won the Abortion War","review":"Mention the word \`abortion' in casual conversation, and you are likely to find yourself in the midst of a heated debate, whether it is over legality, restrictions, the rights of minors, or parental control. However, the debate within the pro-choice movement about reactive and proactive strategies is often overlooked. William Saletan's book, Bearing Right: How Conservatives Won the Abortion War describes the internal struggles faced by key players in the pro-choice movement in the last 20 years.Bearing Right examines the critical players- both individuals and interest groups- in the abortion rights movement, the frame of abortion rights activism, the impact of rhetoric on that frame, and the role of increasing conservatism among individuals that identify as pro-choice. Saletan explores key ballot measures, court cases, legislative initiatives, and elections that have shaped the strategies of the pro-choice movement. Saletan's book recounts the critical history of the pro-choice movement in the United States in an honest and frank manner. While Bearing Right is easy to read, its contents will outrage any loyal pro-choice activist, like myself.Bearing Right starts the reader out in Arkansas in 1986, during Bill Clinton's reign as governor. Saletan describes the costly success of pro-choice efforts to defeat Amendment 65, which would have limited public funding for abortion in Arkansas. The campaign against this ballot measure did more than just kill an amendment in one state; it laid the groundwork for the messages of the pro-choice movement for decades to come.Bearing Right provides a detailed analysis of the language used to convince constituents to vote for or against particular candidates and/or legislation, and the reasoning behind employing particular slogans, such as \\"Keep Big Government Out of Bedrooms\\" (p.24). Saletan shows how the frame of a message can influence not only the outcome of a particular campaign, but also the strategy of your opponent. Bearing Right describes the pro-life movement's careful and clever use of pro-choice language and strategies to achieve their own goals.Saletan describes conflicting views of pro-choice big-wigs, who frequently make concessions in order to win a short-term goal. Saletan's book paints a grim picture of Kate Michelman, Executive Director of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) from 1985 to 2004. Saletan scrutinizes over Michelman's decision-making regarding NARAL endorsement and involvement in various campaigns across the country. While seeking to provide an in-depth analysis of critical players in the pro-choice movement, Bearing Right does little to acknowledge their hard work, turning each success into a calamity.Bearing Right also explores how pro-choice candidates, such as Virginia Governor Doug Wilder, spun their views to win an election. Even though Wilder identified as pro-choice, he approved of legislation requiring parental consent for minors seeking an abortion. Bearing Right describes Wilder's position on abortion and parental consent as the reason why Wilder won the election. Saletan describes Wilder's campaign as a crucial juncture in the pro-choice movement, introducing the concept, and power of a pro-choice moderate. Bearing Right highlights the anxiety of being pinned a liberal, and the ways politicians have crafted their image to avoid that label, especially in the context of abortion.Saletan tries to concentrate on the trend towards conservativism within the pro-choice movement, as evidenced by the title of the book. However, it's no secret that pro-choicers have crafted their messages to appeal to the politically moderate population. The title should have read, Bearing Right: how the pro-choice movement sold out the liberals. Also, while this trend is important to highlight, the more interesting facet of the book centers on the role of rhetoric and messaging. In addition, Saletan's title suggests that the abortion war is over; I would argue not only that the abortion war is not over, but also that the pro-choice movement is in need of an army of troops to come to the rescue.Saletan's chronological account of pro-choice campaigns helps the reader understand how critical court cases and elections coincided. Saletan refers the reader back to earlier initiatives that influenced the messaging of later campaigns. However, Saletan spends significantly more time describing the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s, devoting only the last quarter of the book to the last 10 years. While earlier events laid the groundwork for the strategies of the late 1990s, the unbalanced treatment underemphasizes the importance of recent pro-choice activities.In its concentration on the late 1980s and early 90s, Bearing Right omits some key influences on the pro-choice movement. For example, Saletan does not even mention the advent of the internet, which has had a significant impact on all social movements. Websites and email have completely altered advocacy in both positive and negative ways. The internet has changed the face of communication, one of the main components of Saletan's book. While he did not have to spend an entire chapter on the topic, at least some mention of the internet would have informed the reader that Saletan is living in the 21st century.Bearing Right ends rather abruptly, leaving the reader hanging on regarding what happens next. While Saletan states that the book \\"suggests new ways to think not just about abortion but also about politics, dialogue, and the communication of ideas\\" (p.1), Bearing Right merely provides ways of thinking about the debate, rather than offering concrete solutions. Pro-choice readers will undoubtedly put the book down frustrated. While critique and analysis are important, so is vision, and Saletan provides none.Despite these drawbacks, Bearing Right is a critical read for anyone involved in the pro-choice movement. While it may be difficult for key activists to swallow, this book forces the reader to evaluate the meaning of being pro-choice, and to think long and hard about making certain concessions to win short term goals. While Saletan does not point this out explicitly, Bearing Right emphasizes the need for long-term goals in the pro-choice movement. Bearing Right would also be a good book for individuals interested in the role of rhetoric and politics- particularly candidates running for elected office, since Saletan focuses on the impact of frames and messaging.The pro-choice movement is in desperate need of inspiration. We have been on the defensive ever since Roe v. Wade in 1973, and the majority of Americans have sat back and watched while the right to abortion has been chipped away with restriction after restriction. Now that South Dakota has passed legislation outlawing abortion, maybe people will wake up and smell the coffee. As we continue on this fight to define and advocate for abortion and women's rights, Bearing Right offers not only essential historical background, but also a way of examining the parameters of abortion rights and rhetoric. But you will have to draw your own conclusions about the next steps to take."},{"Title":"Bearing Right: How Conservatives Won the Abortion War","review":"&quot;Pro-choice conservative&quot; is a contradiction in terms, whether you're pro-choice or conservative or neither. If conservatives had &quot;won&quot; the &quot;abortion war,&quot; then abortion would be generally illegal (which it isn't). Period. Only a complete ignoramus would take a book like this one seriously. If you fall into this category, you may also want to explore books on the &quot;conservative domination of the media&quot; and the &quot;conservative domination of the judiciary,&quot; neither of which exists outside of the fevered fantasies of a few far-left paranoiacs (if you're a Maoist, even the New York Times looks right-wing). Not to mention books about UFOs, werewolves, Atlantis, and how the Apollo moon landings were faked. Wake up and get real; or just go back to sleep instead of wasting your time on this sort of nonsense."},{"Title":"Escape from Alcatraz","review":"Escape from Alcatraz would be more appropriately named The History of Alcatraz. On most levels, the book is well put together. The number of misspellings is grotesquely unacceptable, but the content is reasonably thorough.The book begins at the discovery of the San Francisco island by Spanish settlers and continues through the closure of the prison. The book documents each of the attempts to break out of Alcatraz. Unfortunately, no inmate is confirmed to have escaped alive from The Rock. Many of The Rock's most famous inhabitants are discussed including Al Capone. I particularly enjoyed the stories of how the inmates passed their time. Bootlegging took on a new meaning in Alcatraz when inmates made pruno. Pruno often included such exotic combinations as milk and gasoline.The book is concluded with the closure of the prison. There is no doubt that Alcatraz was a brutal prison that drove some men insane and others to suicide. While it was not a deterrent to crime, it was an effective punishment for crime. Had the condition of Alcatraz not deteriorated so much since the Civil War, it may still be punishing criminals for there crimes."},{"Title":"Escape from Alcatraz","review":"Escape from Alcatraz depicts the full history of this infamous prison stronghold. It reflects how life was on the Rock and details the circumstances when and how 23 convicts attempted or succeeded in escaping from the island prison - the latter few never to be ever seen or heard of again. If you are interested in Alcatraz you need go no further than reading this book - it is really that good !"},{"Title":"Escape from Alcatraz","review":"J. Campbell Bruce tells the story of the famous island in San Francisco Bay from its \\"discovery\\" in the late 1700's to its decommissioning in the 1960's. Understandably, the story focuses on the lurid period during which Alcatraz was a brutal prison for America's most difficult prisoners. Given its reputation for inescapability the story of Alcatraz features several daring (and some not-so-daring) attempts to escape. Receiving special attention is the attempt by Frank Morris and two accomplices that may or may not have been the sole successful escape from the Rock. The Frank Morris story, with undoubted debt to this book, later became a legendary motion picture under the same name as this book.While far from exhaustive, Escape From Alcatraz provides a brief and interesting history of Alcatraz. Some fascinating stories are given only brief mention, e.g. the story of the children of Alcatraz's employees who were raised on the island, most of the relevant players and events are touched upon. The book's special focus on mobster-era prisoners and, especially, possible escapee Frank Morris are understandable and, in fact, quite well done. The narrative of the Morris escape, in particular, reads like a potboiler. Some of the discussion of Alcatraz notables, however, feels a bit gossip columny - more name dropping than content. All in all, a good and quick read for anyone looking for only a brief dip in the frigid waters surrounding Alcatraz."},{"Title":"Escape from Alcatraz","review":"I have always been interested in and fascinated with anything that took place on Alcatraz.

This classic is reasonably comprehensive in scope, Bruce hails in his understanding of the inter-workings of Alcatraz.Overall, I found the writing style and prose of the author engaging. Bruce's account details the escape with depth and the entire history of Alcatraz in modest but rich detail.

I thought it would be a good book for info on that breakout.It is much more than that. This book surprised me in two ways.First of all, as a nonfiction book, I did not expect it to be written so that it reads like a novel. It is really well done. I was captivated from the first by Mr. Bruce's description of Frank Morris being transported to Alcatraz to begin his life there as a prisoner. I started turning pages and was transported along with the prisoner - through the rain and fog to that dismal prison.The second surprise was all the history Mr. Bruce put into the book that went way beyond just this one escape. The book turned out to be a real bonus in that regard. He sketches the history of the island and the area, and then goes into some of the background history of Alcatraz.It's a great read all the way around."},{"Title":"Escape from Alcatraz","review":"The Escape from Alcatraz is a good read it takes about fellows that tried or did escape from the place and it also talks about the hard life living in alcatraz"},{"Title":"Escape from Alcatraz","review":"Most people know of Escape from Alcatraz from the movie staring Clint Eastwood.

Beginning with its discovery and subsequent use by Native Americans, the book takes us through the island's history as America's &quot;unescapable&quot; prison.The books most recognizable chapter, by far, deals with the mystery shrouding the prison's most famous escape attempt.

If you CAN finish the whole book, you won't care about any of the characters - prisoners or prison staff.The short vignettes on, it seems, every prisoner who ever attempted to escape from Alcatraz, all sound the same.I can't even say anything more about this book, because it is so boring and badly written, that I'm annoyed at myself for attempting to read it in it's entirety.I finally gave up."},{"Title":"Escape from Alcatraz","review":"If you ever plan to visit Alcatraz, one of the most famour prisons in the United States, then this movie is a \\"must see\\".

We tend to put things into categories in most areas of our lives. We put people into categories by job (architect, teacher, sales, carpenter, hamburger-flipper), religion, and other things. Unfortunately, that leaves out the individual person who never fits the whole stereotype. This book is great at looking at people from only a visual perspective and having the individual describe the complexity of the various parts that make up that person. The visuals are photographs of real people like the one on the cover with a description by the person. What I really like is the surprise I get when I read the description after I have seen the person. There are consistently parts of the person I would have never guessed."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"\\"Part Asian, 100% Hapa\\" is one of those books that is so simple, yet so complex. I was fortunate enough to see Kip Fulbeck recently and in all honesty, it was one of the most impactful presentations I've ever seen. This book and the Hapa Project was the focus of his presentation, and unfortunately, this book only serves as a supplement to what I've seen.I'm going to combine some of the things Fulbeck said and \\"Part Asian, 100% Hapa,\\" since the point of the book is the message. Fulbeck said during his presentation, something along the lines of, that he didn't like being classified as a diversity speaker since it was about the stories of the individuals. The point is, each page tells a different story. When asked, \\"what are you?\\" each person wrote a story, that you can compare with how they classify himself or herself. It isn't about diversity or the boxes in which we put everyone. It is about the individual story, and each page captures this message perfectly.Fulbeck also said something along the lines of him and Frank Warren (Post Secret) met once and they came to the conclusion that they had the best gigs. Basically, everyone else creates the masterpieces and they just do the collecting. The idea behind this book is truly a masterpiece. We all need to hear the stories of the people around us.My only disappointment was the fact that I thought the introduction and preface were somewhat \\"superficial\\" and I didn't think they did the book justice.If you get a chance to see the Hapa Project see it. In the meantime, pick up this book.J.Stoner"},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"The illustrations themselves speak louder than words and its a good teaching tool to help people of different ethnic backgrounds that have mixed race in them, especially parents of two different cultures who are married with kids who are mixed race to teach them and show them there are people out there in the same situation as them.

A wonderful portrait of mixed races with simple photographic portraits."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"I wish everyone in New York could see this book, understand it, and stop calling me and people like me \\"Chinese\\" (I am half Japanese and half a mix of French, Irish, Swedish, Cherokee and Navahoe). This book should also be given to all the mixed people out there who deny anything but their minority side (e.g., Halle Berry calling herself \\"Black\\"). Let's all start realizing that mixing races and cultures is a HEALTHY thing, and to stop denying the parts of ourselves that are \\"different\\"!

I usually skip that section and come back to it at the end. After staring at it for a solid half-hour, I hastily pick something and put the paper out of my sight. I try not to think about the answer I chose, and the ancestors I denied. My answer differs every time.Half my family views me as white (just \\"white\\" - because white people have no ethnic backgrounds or interesting cultures, right? There's no English, Irish, Dutch, German, Swiss, etc. - it's just \\"white\\"). The other half views me as some strange Mutt they don't quite know how to interact with.I'm sick of being too white or not white enough. This book helped me realize I'm not the only one."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"You will enjoy this book if you:- enjoy books that use a lot of pictures and few words, but still says A LOT, you will enjoy this book.- enjoy subtly humorous fictionYou will REALLY enjoy this book if you are multi-racial (or married to someone who is).I am Vietnamese, Irish, and Polish, and I have been labeled as Japanese, Latin-American (my last name is close to Guillen), Chinese, but mostly as \\"what are you anyways?\\"I have lived and experienced the advantages and disadvantages of being multi-racial, as will my children.There is one page in this book where the photographed subject states something like \\"I am like every person in the world in the year 2050\\". Given the cultural melting pot being created by the Internet and increased travel, that is probably just about righ.I would also encourage readers to check out the author's (Kip Fullbeck) web site.It has some very funny content / videos about the subject."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"I couldn't tear my eyes away from these stunning portraits of mixed-race people and the hand-written contributions from each person that went with them. As a hapa myself, this book filled me with comfort to see so many other people like me, fascination with the many similarities and differences among us, and laughter at the clever comebacks to the ever-present question \\"What are you?\\"I grew up in rural Canada as the only hapa (and only person with Asian blood other than my father and brother) for miles around, so my fantasy would be to go back in time and make this required reading for all the people who didn't quite know what to make of me. Short of that, this is still a great book, which illustrates simply and beautifully how the concept of race obscures so much more than it illuminates. Highly recommended for hapas and anyone with a hapa in their life!"},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"Great book -- I just wish it was longer! I gave a copy to my sister, who has two daughters adopted from China -- so although her kids are 100% Asian, it is likely she will have Hapa grandchildren. I also gave a copy to a friend whose husband is from the Phillipines and has 3 beautiful Hapa children --- they liked the book so much, they bought copies for their children and grandchildren. Beautiful photography, and wonderful insights into being part Asian, 100% Hapa, in an anglo world. My favorite quote is from the boy who said he is 'part Danish, but I usually don't tell people that because they think I am a pastry'."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"Being hapa myself I definitely could appreciate everyone displayed in this book.

I bought this book as a fathers day gift for my husband who is always asking why our first son looks nothings like him (he is Irish) and i am Hawaiian-Irish-Portugese.I only wish that the title of the book was more inclusive of Hawaiian and Pacific islanders who are also Hapa and originated the term."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"I came across this book at a race exhibit that I went to recently and could not pull myself away from it. I fully enjoy seeing other folks who are like me in the sense that we are obviously not just black or white or a combination of both. I also loved reading people's stories and thoughts on being \\"Hapa\\" and fully related to people always asking \\"What are you?\\" This book is must have for all \\"Hapa's\\" and a must see for all who are not."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"I am so glad that I bought this book for myself and my little sister.Growing up, I always felt out of place. Caucasians saw me as asian, and asians saw me as caucasian. When every exam you take at school asks you to check a box for your coresponding race, but you feel your race is not listed, what do you choose? It's very clear as to what I am not, but what exactly DOES that box labeled \\"other\\" mean?This is a wonderful book full of beauty and humor. It gives those that lie in the spaces between clearly defined boxes a feeling of belonging and pride."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"My new and beautiful great nephew's heritage is Japanese, French-Canadian, Portuguese, Puerto-Rican, Slovak, English, Irish. His Japanese grandmother sent this beautiful book to her daughter, his mother. I was very moved when reading it. The photographs are lovely; the sentiments are simple, yet profound. It is a celebration of the wonderful diversity in our world. This book would be a lovely gift for anyone who is part-Asian, but it should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"Who knew that the hapa were a large group?

And in case you are wondering, I am 100% white."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"A friend bought this for my daughter when she was born. My daughter is four now and increasingly pulls it down from the book shelf and asks me to read it to her. The other day she asked me to put her in the book so I used the last couple of blank pages to insert her photo and let her write her name and draw a picture.

He is half caucasian, half Japanese and his photo is even on Kip Fulbeck's website!! This is a great book, because there's so many variations of being Hapa. Originally in Hawaii in meant somebody who was usually half white, half Asian, but Kip's book has shown how that term has expanded. This is a great book for anybody who likes to study faces or for those who are Hapa or who knows anybody who is Hapa. I bought it for my son so when he gets older, he can see people that share his similar background. Kip shows Hapas of all ages. It's fascinating to study the faces and to find out what their ethnic background is. And each Hapa has a handwritten comment which reveals a bit of their personality to the reader. Being biracial seems like a unique experience...being the mother of a biracial child is also quite unique, and I'm proud of my son's heritage. Interestingly, Sean Ono Lennon, a \\"Hapa\\" from very famous parents, writes the Forward to this book. This book is a great example of \\"Hapa Pride.\\""},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"Fascinating book. It gives a very stark image of a person of mixed ethnicity on one page and the person's own comments handwritten on the opposite page. Some of the subjects gave very in depth statements of identity. Others wrote down thoughts from the moment. I bought the book because I'm likely to have children with mixed ethnicities. I wanted to see how others viewed themselves and some of the common issues that they face in responding the ever frustrating question of \\"What are you?\\""},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"I'm half Japanese and half Euro (German, Swede, Scottish) and I sure wish this book had been around when I was a kid many moons ago.

Having grown up Hapa in the midwest in th 60's I often felt like I was the only one around. Then when my family moved to Hawaii (my dad is Caucasian military, my mom Chinese) in my teens I realized that what I had been missing all along was a community.Part Asian 100% Hapa gives you that. It gives you a sense that you are not alone and that everyone is dealing with the same struggles of fitting in and finding out who we are. I'm 46 now and I showed it to my daughter who is 7 and she loves it as much as me especially the pics of other kids. She doesn't think about race and that's great. She just likes the book because it's about people being who they are (and she thinks it's funny too). I get tired of all the race talk and about who is this and that. This book is just honest and down to earth.I also saw the accompanying photo show at the Japanese American National Museum in L.A. and it is phenomenal."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"This book is really quite amazing. It brings a few good questions to mind, as well as realizations. It is interesting to read the responses to the question \\"What am I\\", especially from the children who all have a beautiful, raw way of expressing themselves, some in pictures, some in scribbles and some in blatently obvious answers, as if the kid would look at you and say \\"what am I, I'm a kid, duh\\" It really makes you think twice about asking people \\"what are you\\"."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"This is an amazing piece of work: Simple yet sublime.

It's a picture book of a few hundred people of various mixed race. I highly recommend it for anybody that's ever asked a person of mixed race \\"what are you?\\"It's already spawned a couple of interesting conversations with my wife and four-year-old daughter. Even though she's only four, she's already encountered the stupidity of strangers and well-meaning-ignoramus-friends as they question whether or not I'm really her father (I'm hapa and she has her mom's lily-white complexion and blue eyes/blonde hair)."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa shines a much needed spotlight on the changing face of America.Though multiracial individuals comprise at least 7 percent of the U.S. population, according to the 2000 Census, people who are mixed or \\"hapa\\" nevertheless tend to be ignored in society's ongoing conversation about race and race relations. Kip Fulbeck thoughtfully puts a stop to this wallflower phenomenon by placing the faces of mixed-race people front and center in this intriguing and artistic new book.The old proverb is true: a picture does tell a thousand words. Here, each face relays an unflinching, often fascinating tale about its owner. The result is a candid glimpse into a growing population, and also, a generous and quite touching photographic exploration of the feelings, observations, and struggles that make each of us -- in the end -- universally connected."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"A short time ago, my wife and I had our first child. Our daughter is 25% Irish, 25% German and 50% Chinese. As I understand it, this would qualify her to be included in Mr. Fulbeck's delightful little book as my child is 100% Hapa.Hapa is a term that I had never heard until recently but one with which I am becoming more and more familiar. I've always felt my heritage to be important and I want my child to be proud of who she is. So I have been making an effort to learn more about the Hapa community.I don't know how much practical information I picked up from this book. On the other hand, the portraits are beautifully done--I love the consistency of the images which only serves to bring out the uniqueness of each face. I also love the self-expression of the hand-written comments by the portrait subjects themselves on each facing page. It's amazing how much emotion can be expressed in just a few lines.As the years go by, it seems the distinctions between the races get fewer. As the world gets smaller, we are truly becoming a melting pot. We may be a long way from a color blind society, but it won't be long, I think, before the \\"mixed\\" race people become the majority. With them, I celebrate this beautiful expression of their pride."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"Kip Fulbeck has created a community for those of us who identify ourselves as wholly members of our communities, but who are often not perceived by others as fully included. We are the exotic, the other, the mixed -- the products of the melting pot. We are as different from one another, as alike, as complex, as unique, as are other people of other backgrounds -- which is to say, as much as is true for anyone (of any ethnic heritage), we hapa can not be defined by our ethnic heritage, nor can we dismiss the great influence our varied heritage has exerted on our personal identities. It is lovely to have these truths acknowledged. Thank you, Kip Fulbeck. This work of art has been carefully crafted, and is deeply meaningful. While some of the references -- visual and otherwise -- may not be fully understood by those who have not experienced life as a hapa, or as a hapa of a particular generation, nevertheless I think that everyone will discover something new and beautiful within these pages. This is a rare gem. Not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"For so many years I felt like I never fit in, mainly because I grew up in the midwest. I wish I had this book back then.

Kip Fulbeck's intro lays it all out there and Sean Lennon's writing is funny. I also like what Paul Spickard says at the end when he analyzes the artistic format and writes about how some people probably won't get it. This book made me cry. The photographs are beautiful but it's what people write that really got me."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"I am 1/2 Japanese, 1/4 Scottish and 1/4 American. This book made me cry.

At the time he was selling his book, Paper Bullets, which I highly recommend. I value my autographed copy. Today he was on CNN promoting this book and it's truly worth the money. My only wish was that CNN had discussed his credentials or even allowed him to read a bit from one of his books. Kip is intelligent, engaging, real, and a person who illuminates a room. I'm marrying an Asian American man and our children will be Hapa. I'm forever thankful to Kip for his books.This is a must read, as is Paper Bullets."},{"Title":"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","review":"I expected more.

I mean, *not one* single page of citations/ footnotes. Nor did he stick on some specific topic and go about addressing that, as opposed to writing in terms of sweeping generalities. Not helpful.I KNOW that this will be fodder for Black Studies Departments across the country and it is going to be yet another one of the things that makes the problems in black education WORSE.If this book were acceptable as authenticated information about what really DID happen in black education up to the time of publishing, it would be a guide to explain what is happening to this very day.As it is, I can't see it as much more than the prototype to some of the foolishness that infects the discourse on black education today.A better choice to read would beUp From Slavery: An Autobiographyby Booker T. Washington. His diagnosis was accurate and speaks to things that are still happening today (as in, black people not realizing that the purpose of education is to improve earnings potential and not something that is done for its own sake is what accounts for their lower educational return on investment)."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"It's bewildering to realize just how recently this treatise was written, given the archaic language and obsolete rhetoric. Woodson does a thorough job of renouncing the organs of oppression and discussing just how pervasive the oppression seeps.

However, historians will likely appreciate reviewing the perspective as an indicator of the range and development of civil rights rhetoric."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"This has been great enjoyment, also helps me understand why people say and do certain things.

Woodson was an educational prophet. One can feel his passion written and still remains true for such a time as this.

He writes, \\"When you control a man's thinking, you do not have to worry about his actions,\\" \\"know your proper place and stay in it,\\" or \\"The educated Negro prefers to buy his food from a white grocer because he has been told the Negro is not clean.\\" If these few quotes do not register, some words in this book will eventually speak to your soul, if a member of the African American community.I give this treasured book a thumbs up!!!"},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"This was a special request for a Christmas present.

However I can relate to lots of the issues in regards White Tutors trying to teach black students about European history and infact dismissing most of the actual black historical achievements as insignificant- but we (I hope) are aware of that, and do read between the lines whenever information is put out there, as that is standard in a white dominated society."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"This book written at an earlier time helps us understand the present situation of some of our African-American neighbors.

Woodson is the historian who created Negro History Week which became Black History Month.The most memorable qualities of this book are that it teaches the power of education. It illustrates how an improper education makes a people unfit to solve their own problems AND how a proper education leads to freedom. Read this. It could save your life."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"This book ought to be required reading for every teacher, educator, administrator, and parents who intereact with children of African descent. Woodson's work helps us understand that African peoples are truely mis-educated. We largely receive an Eurocentric or White middle class, elitist education that by and large does not serve the needs of our communities. This mis-education creates a serious identity crisis on the part of African youth and it causes many Black &quot;educated&quot; middle class people to spend more time trying to reach the consumer American Dream rather than working toward a real self-determination agenda of African peoples. Thus it's of little suprise today that most African students never enroll in a course on African/African-American studies. In fact, these courses are becoming more rare in high school and colleges across the nation. Even with the current renaissance of Black literature in this country, the study of African/Black culture, politics, and spiritual life are rarely discussed. In Woodson's words: &quot;Real education means to inspire people to live more abundantly, to learn to begin with life as they find it and make it better, but the instruction so far given Negroes [and still today] in colleges and universities [and elementary and secondary schools] has worked to the contrary. In most cases such graduates have merely increased the number of malcontents who offer no program for changing the undesiriable conditions about which they complain. &quot; Woodson's book is clearly not out-dated. In fact, it reads as if it were published last year, instead of 1933. I would like to close this response to Woodson's work with another classic quote from him: &quot;If you control a man's thinking you do not have to worry about his action. When you determine what a man shall think you do not have to concern yourself about what he will do. If you make a person feel that he/she is inferior, you do not have to compel him/her to accept an inferior status, he/she will seek for it. If you make a person think he/she is a justly outcast, yoiu do not have to order that person to the back door, that person will go without being told, and if there is no back door, the very nature of that person will demand one.&quot;"},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"I read this book in 1992 for a Black Studies program while attending SUNY New Paltz. Woodson's knowledge is as poignant today as it was in the 30's when he originally wrote the material. It is one book that post-reading, the reader comes away with a totally different perspective of Black thought. I highly recommend this book to every American, but especially to scholars interested in the historical disparities in U.S. educational system as it relates to African/Latino Americans today. Mis-Education of the Negro is a treasured classic within the pages of written history. Without this book, a large &quot;chunk&quot; of the puzzle concerning contemporary affirmative action policy debates would be amiss. Woodson offers much needed answers &amp; solutions and encapsulates them in a style that is still very much relevant today. No doubt, 5 stars across the board!"},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"While reading this book so many things that Cater G. Woodson said back in the 1930's are still going on and are true today. For example, blacks who invest so much faith in the wrong community/political leaders, blacks religious leaders who drive their big expensive cars and give the wrong message to our people and how blacks will not buy from other blacks because they don't want to see him/her get ahead in their own community. Also knowing how blacks have problems taking orders from other blacks in supervisory position.The thing that most influenced me in this book is that we as black people need to take an aggressive approach to changing and leading our community. We as black americans need to stop looking to white people for our solutions, because we already have the solutions to many of our problems. And last of all we should stop hating one another and start appreciating the great ideals in our community. What makes this book so great is that it shines the spotlight on what is wrong in the black community, but also on ways of how to fix the things that are wrong in the community concerning education, poverty, job creation, business creation and self sufficiency."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"Before picking this book up to read I was aware of the knowledge I needed on African American's in the Education system. After reading it I felt empowered and sad. Empowered because now I had a little more knowledge and saddened because now I know what was kept from me all my school years. It amazes me how we were not taught any of our history not even in college. It also amazes me how people got away with not educating us.Dr. Carter shows us how 30 years ago the system was designed to keep us ignorant and as experiments. Quote from Dr. Woodson &quot;Negroes, being objects of charity, have received them cordially and have done what they were required.&quot; To this day they are still using the same system but I think we are smarter now and know where the resources are to get what we need.Reviewed by Missy"},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"Mr. Woodson speaks in an almost prophetic tone in this masterful work. This book spoke as a warning in 1933 and it speaks now as a witness to what happens when a people, in general, does not cultivate its own fundamental and progressive thoughts.

This book was my introduction to my continuing studies of African American history, and I recommend that anyone beginning their studies begin with this book. There will be many instances when you will nod your head in agreement with what is stated, and other times when you will learn things about your own behaviors that you could not previously understand. The only reason that I couldn't give this book five stars is because it is a scholarly text and it is a little difficult for less sophisticated readers."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"_The Mis-Education of the Negro_ was first published when jim crow was the law of the land and our schools and military were segregated. Seventy years later institutionalized racism is gone, but African-Americans are still in many respects second-class citizens. Why this is so is scathingly shown in Woodson's classic book.No one is without blame - white or black - in this mis-education, Woodson argues. The public school system largely run by whites does little to celebrate or recognize African-American achievments, essentially teaching young African-Americans that they have little to contribute. Even those white teachers who genuinely mean well and want to help African-Americans do a disservice to the Black community by not being culturally competent, essentially attempting to teach African-American students to \\"fit in\\" to white society. African-Americans who have become successes in business do not hire other African-Americans continuing to relegate them to lower social status. Even African-American churches do not escape Woodson's criticism, as he claims that they do little to celebrate or recognize the uniqueness and rich cultural heritage of Americans of African descent. Woodson believes this scandalous state of affairs continues to prevent African-Americans from realizing the \\"American dream.\\" Only by recognizing the uniqueness of Black culture and encouraging the African-American community to support itself (rather than tear itself apart) will real social and economic change begin. This, of course, must first start with education.Certainly many things have changed since this book was first put into print, due in part to the efforts of people like Woodson (the individual responsible for first, Black History week, then Black History month). Yet clearly there is much left to be done. As Cornel West wrote, \\"Race Matters.\\" Yes, it does - Woodson saw this over two generations ago and began to do something about it. One can only hope more Americans - black and white - will read this landmark book and begin to act accordingly."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"I read Carter G Woodson's land mark book for the first time when I was in Jr high school and I thought he was anti social towords African Americans, I read it again for the second time when I was in my twenties and I got angry.

Dr. Woodson brilliantly lays out his case which is still very relevant today in 2013, as the demographics of the US continues to shift into more of an America being a mixture of minority groups without one group dominating the other. As a result the educating of a culture or people begins with understanding of one&#8217;s own history and the contributions of that culture to America and to the World rather than what the dominating or oppressive group wants you to know thus, limiting your thinking and potential.

At that time, we still had segregation and blatant and in the open discrimination.I'm not saying we are past all of that now, but this book's thesis that Africans-in-America need a separate education system and that going to schools run by whites is designed to keep them subservient doesn't hold water today. For one thing, the board of education in many cities of the USA has many Africans on them. And how can we expect African education to come from public school? We don't live in Africa- we live in America, whether we like it or not.I believe our kids MUST learn about Africa, but don't blame the school system for that. We can educate them by revitalizing something called THE COMMUNITY! Through it, we can have education centers, where our community elders bestow wisdom and learning on the youth, just like in Africa. Parents and clergy can help too. Provide kids with African media- books and videos. The internet is an amazing resource as well.We have so many ways to supplement the education kids get from the public schools.

It very well may change your mind about your opinion of this work and others like it."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"Every Negro should read this book and be re-educated. Actually, the book is not just for all Afro-Americans but for all \\"minorities\\" such as Chicano, etc.This is a great book; especially it is to be read by those Negroes that are in public office making decisions that can change the fate of members of the so called minorities in America.Currently there are Negroes appointed to positions where they have to make decisions in cases like for Civil Rights, Discrimination, Courts of Justice, etc. However, those Negroes are not making the correct decisions in their cases, they have to work on, because they are mis-educated.There are Negroes that are actually punishing minorities, including their own members, by applying, blindly, rules and policies that have been created to keep minorities at the bottom of the ill social strata created in America. Not to say, but tue, those policies and laws were designed to exclude minorities from the American society because, in the background, minorities are not considered made of human beings but they are just \\"minorities,\\" or beings of an inferior capacity.Thus, those Negroes \\"in charge\\" cannot use their own barred intelligence to see their own wrongdoing in their use of the policy or law; they think, in their stage of mis-education, that as Negroes they would be doing something wrong in a system where they are placed precisely to make decisions and serve justice but in paradox they actually hurt minorities.I think this book brings to retrospection the self-identity of every Negro. The reading puts them in a \\"Y\\" path where they must make a decision on which path to walk on for the rest of their lives to assure that those labeled minorities in America should not be treated as minorities but just as citizens with equal rights to those of any other citizen despite color, origin, gender, age, and any other classification used in America to discriminate against other than whites (OTW).I recommend this book for a five-star rating; this for the value and significance that it aids in assuring that the intelligence of the Negro will be used in America for good cause.\\"Other Than White\\" (OTW) Copyright 2000-2002 Guillermo Ramirez."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"I stumbled upon this book while researching a different subject.

The greatest strength of this book is that it shows us not only the strength of a proper education, but also the negative imparts of an improper education. This book is still relevant today. Few books have so masterfully challenged the minds of both the mis-educated and the mis-educators as 'Mis-Education of the Negro' has done, by calling on society to be humble, accept its errors and choose new directions in education.

He must be sufficiently enlightened to determine for himself whether these forces have come into his life to bless him or bless his oppressor. After learning the facts in the case the Negro must develop the power of execution to deal with these matters as do people of vision.\\" ~ Carter G. WoodsonCarter G. Woodson proposed this notion in the context of outlining a plan for advancing racial education through the development of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH). In this sentiment, we can discern a challenge from Woodson to begin interpreting historical phenomena in a manner that establishes its measurable utility for influencing black people to claim full agency in altering their own condition. While making a comparative reading between this text and \\"The Souls of Black Folks\\", conversations I encountered with others led me to the conclusion that many have not afforded the most popular single thesis by Woodson the thorough examination required. While the language is often less florid than DuBois, the analysis offered here is no less comprehensive and lends itself to neither imitation nor repetition of the facts elucidated previously in \\"The Souls of Black Folks\\". Through his work as a historian, Woodson uses an incisive reading of the history of Negro education from the Reconstruction period forward to bolster the argument that it has been improperly administered by others to the detriment of black people. This injustice would only be resolved when we took ownership of creating the input and defining the outcome.While the text opens by focusing its attention upon the process of miseducation, Woodson expands the diameter of the discussion markedly with each new chapter to display how this process takes root in each aspect of Negro life impacting the church, political ambitions, business sector, vision, and leadership. The argument he constructs finds him squarely balanced between Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey. While he endorses the fierce work ethic Washington sought to make the hallmark of black people, he rejects a servile acceptance of the permanent social underclass. His devotion to an educational system which nourishes black identity and intellect at every level builds upon the work of DuBois, but he admonishes educated Negroes to pair their higher learning with the grassroots service still being performed by those lesser educated. In practice, this pairing of ideas and implementation would form the framework for an independent community enterprise. Throughout the text he exudes the fierce nationalism exemplified in the Garveyite philosophy, but differs upon the subject of repatriation.Amongst the most astute observations offered here comes in a discourse on Marxism where he states \\"History shows that it does not matter who is in power or what revolutionary forces take over the government, those who have not learned to do for themselves and have to depend solely on others never obtain any more rights or privileges in the end than they had in the beginning.\\" The insight Woodson offers on this matter would later prove prescient when we saw our leftist alliances of the Renaissance crumble upon the realization that they held no serious desire to address racism within their ranks. This other facet of miseducation arising in the black community then being the dynamic adoption of new philosophies with no strategic or tactical analysis of merit or usefulness. In summation, Woodson offers us one of the many early attempts at developing a black social theory which draws upon the most valuable assets our community while exhorting us to take serious measures in addressing its liabilities.His legacy of Negro History Week which later evolves into Black History Month is not born of a desire to give either ourselves or America a concession that equality has been achieved nor are we to be cavalier in our observance of this milestone. Negro History Week was to be a first stage towards the objective of building black institutions that could both educate children in their history being overlooked and afford them opportunities and avenues to expand upon that legacy. Cases in Arizona and Tennessee have given us a clear lens into the peculiar quality of American forgetfulness which occurs when a synthesized and complete historical record is not the way an educated mind is measured. As this forgetfulness becomes more pervasive, we must return to the work of Carter G. Woodson, Lorenzo Johnston Greene and the pioneers of varying strains of Black Studies whom arose post-Civil Rights for a template that will guide us back to the goal of establishing independent systems of education where the curriculum is not dictated to us, but decided by our own best assessment of the needs of our communities.Bobby Wright offered us possibly the most sage insight on our renewed ethnic education debate in stating \\"Education is a political dynamic and for a people who have no social theory, reading, writing and arithmetic should be much less important than what is written and read.\\" \\"The Miseducation of the Negro\\" is an opening gambit in helping us to shift that political dynamic in another direction, but only if we read it again with a far more critical eye than we have applied in the past for miseducation has implications which extend far beyond the classroom."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"Essence Magazine was not over exaggerating when they said that The Mis-Education of the Negro should be in the library of every African American household!

It points out the falilures in African American society, at all levels, as their failure to look honestly and objectively,at American life, in general, and how the promise of the American dream has failed all of its citizens. Rather than point to this main failure, it is easier for everybody to point at African Americans and see their so-called failures instead of looking at the entire general falilures with its crime, greed, lack of morality, thirst for money, etc. Until Black people take this book to heart we will be a lost people in this land of iniquity.

That the book was written in 1933 should make it a shame that Black-haters like David Horowitz spend all their energy abolishing Black studies and positive discrimination (in his racist, anti-Black books (Hating Whitey ; The Race card, etc.) Now there are many other books by African authors, some quite deep such as P. C. Luthuli's The Philosophical foundations of Black education in South Africa. And even some book by some friendly whites who accept to understand the problem and the need for a separate, all-black education system, I mean Jacqueline Irvine's Black Students and School Failure. A good recent African and practical book is Wilson's Awakening the Natural Genius of Black Children. Let's praise people like Woodson, he showed the way for freeing us from the slavery of our minds and souls.

They are the first to put it down. Tru dat?I love this book. I think it is a must read for all those of African descent. He tells the truth about the educated class of blacks. However, he seems to fighting some feelings of elitism and imitating white culture himself.For example, he complains that when blacks become educated according to white society, they abandon their native church or they join or create more refined (white like) churches among themselves. They no longer feel comfortable in such a spirited environment. Yet he criticizes the black masses for \\"gettin the spirit and hollering and screaming.\\" Then he uses as an example that the Anglican Africans in the islands, who have a white washed type of services, are quiet, sombre and dignified. In essence, they have lost their Africaness and act like a boring white congregation. They have imitating their masters perfectly.This book speaks so true.

It was not as dynamic as was the uproar about my reprinting Stolen Legacy, by George G. M. James, but the message was clear: \\"you have no right to print these books without permission.\\"While I was of no doubt that I had a perfect legal right to republish the books, the moral right caused me to take a good look at my motives. The first motive was that both books, \`Miseducation...' and \`Stolen Legacy' were priceless as for as the information needs of Black people. Even today, there are few books on a par with them, that can pull the covers that hide the facts about our true history. When the Reparations Movement moved into high gear, these two books, along with Message to the Blackman, by The Honorable Elijah Muhammad and Reparations, Yes, by Dr. Imari Obadele, Atty. Chokwe Lumumba and Professor/Atty Nketchi Taifa were essential for a thorough understanding of why we were demanding to be paid Reparations, now.These books tell in the clearest language and context possible about the evidence of what was taken/stolen from Black people. And of course, there is yet to be any book that outlines the legal case for reparations, like Reparations, Yes! When one adds the essence of The Message to the Blackman, The Spiritual Dynamic, you then have the three major component aspects of the what the Liberation Struggle of Afrikan people is all about. The true Black history that is taught in Mis-education of the Negro & Stolen Legacy is essential to fully understanding Black history.Mis-Education of the Negro is easily one of the most important book of all time. Now that Post Traumatic Slavery Disorder (PTSlaveryD) has been properly diagnosed, there has also been an increase in the demand for Mis-education of the Negro. This is for good reason; some 75 years before the phase PTSlaveryD) was coined, Carter G. Woodson wrote the book that told in the clearest language possible, how Black people were \`educated' to live in contradiction to their own best interest. This is what the disorder called Post Traumatic Slavery is: a mental condition that cause a people to be other than of sound mind - especially when it comes to their own interest, or the interest of their own kind.Carter G. Woodson tell clearly that this was by design and purpose: Black people were \\"mideducated\\" to behavior in our best interest.The book explains the behavior that caused him to title his book \\"The Miseducation of the Negro. Number one is the fact that our people acquire the education, proscribed by other people, that openly slants the educational processes to their own self interest. And they do so in total disregard to how it injures Black people. For while there is much in the processes that benefit the truly educated, the mixture of falsehoods, lies, distortions, omissions & etc. poisons the minds of the unsuspecting. Simply saying that Black people are a subject people so have no choice, is not a sufficient answer. It was not sufficient in 1934. And it is not sufficient in 2006.In this book, Carter G. Woodson lays the blame for our behavior squarely at the feet of the Black professional. Time after time he gives examples of the ill behavior that is because of the Miseducation of the Negro. Number one, here, is that the professional Black man and woman, for the most part, do not take personal responsible to come back to the community and help in the processes to lift this people. Instead, he takes jobs in the poisonous systems, where he presides over the continued Mis-education of his own kind.Carter G. Woodson, today would lambaste super rich black people who build football and basketball stadiums, rather than institutions that would help in the \\"Re-education of Black people.H.

It highlights the fallacies in what we were taught about ourselves and praises the strides and triumphs that we made as a people. Carter G. Woodson not only highlights how he feels \\"we missed the mark\\" and \\"drifted away from the truth\\" about our strong heritage, but he also comments on the ways in which Blacks have divided and caused dissention without the leading of any outside force.Please understand that this is not an anthology of hate or criticism of White Americans, but rather a commentary on the many facets of the Black American's education, socially, psychologically, spiritually, and academically. He cites many White Americans who were instrumental in the building and funding of schools and trade programs to aid the plight of, at that time, the Negro.There are many interesting facts in this book and many components that will make you ponder over how even in 2012, so many things are still the same."},{"Title":"The mis-education of the Negro,","review":"Wow, as a young black male who has recently come to see just how mentally deaf, dumb, and blind I am, this really opened my 3rd eye.

W. Garrod in 1956. As I began to read longer poems like Endymion, I found the small font size distracting. Also, Garrod's commentary and footnotes are rather limited. I rate this Oxford edition as only three stars as better editions are readily available.You might consider Selected Poetry (Oxford Poetry Library, 1996 and 2000 editions) that is edited by Elizabeth Cook. To confuse matters a bit, there is now a 2001 version, also edited by Elizabeth Cook, with a different title: John Keats: The Major Works (Oxford World's Classics). These newer versions may contain more extensive commentary and footnotes than the earlier Garrod edition.I do have recommendations for two books with which I am quite familiar.The first is Complete Poems and Selected Letters of John Keats, published by Modern Library Paperback Classics in 2001. It contains an excellent introduction by Edward Hirsh and good footnotes by John Pollock. Five stars.My other recommendation is The Complete Poems, Penguin Classics, edited by John Bernard. This Penguin Classics edition has been a standard Keats text for several years. Five stars."},{"Title":"GREAT MYSTERIES: AN ILLUSTRATED SURVEY OF THE UNEXPLAINED.","review":"This large format book contains 188 pages of text and photographs as it attempts to cover almost every aspect of anything associated with mysteries.

Whilst there is some interesting information to be found here and there, just as the reader begins to get absorbed in any particular subject, so the book moves on to the next.In many cases the photographic captions are difficult to find and in some cases the pictures themselves are not well reproduced.Altogether, I was left with the overall impression that this particular author did not really know his subject and had merely cobbled together a wide-ranging selection of mystery subjects.NM"},{"Title":"The Private Roots of Public Action: Gender, Equality, and Political Participation","review":"so I'm going to have a really hard time using this in my class that I bought it for because it doesn't have pages within the kindle.

The authors have been involved in music performance and teaching all their lives, and have collected a wide variety of stories from all types of music -- classical, jazz, gospel, rock, country, etc. -- the kind of stories that catch your attention in the morning and stick with you all day!

There are six days each for the Beatles, Beethoven and Mendelssohn, five each for J.S. Bach, Brahms, Handel and Tchaikovsky. Albeit Jewish to his death, Benny Goodman's life is described on 3 dates. There are many other musicians' lives in this book: Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Lowell Mason. Kavanaugh, a composer, conductor and ordained minister, ends this with an excellent index and glossary of six pages; here he explains very concisely terms from camp meetings to motet, and various styles of music.

Initially I was annoyed, but it quickly became everyone's favorite book (despite the ripped pages).The book really captures the essence of the little/big sister relationship. Now that my second daughter is the BIG sister she likes it even more. She can relate to both the big and little sister aspects of it, while my eldest and youngest daughters also enjoy seeing themselves through Pham's characters.Pham's illustrations really capture the personalities of the sisters in the book and the nuances in their relationship. The text is short enough for younger children and engaging enough for older ones. My oldest enjoyed this book when she became a big sister at age 2.

This is a book for all ages and is a wonderful keepsake for any sister out there. The illustrations display the unique personalities of each character and make the book even more enjoyable.I am a teacher and I use this book in my classroom. This is only one of the many books I read to my students about family. The kids absolutely love it because it relates to their own lives.

A thoroughly entertaining read."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"A review by Dr. Joseph SugliaWith his imposing fourth novel, Giles Goat-Boy: or, The Revised New Syllabus (1966), John Barth stopped writing stories and started writing stories-about-stories and stories-inside-of-stories. The \\"meta-fictional\\" dimensions of the novel are apparent from its first page onward. A \\"Publisher's Note\\" informs its readers that Giles Goat-Boy is rumored to have been generated by WESCAC, a super-computer that-as one learns later in the text-has \\"commenced a life of its own\\" [86] and taken over a mythical Super-University. According to the logic of Giles Goat-Boy, the horizons of the University are the horizons of the universe, the \\"microcosm\\" stands for the \\"macrocosm\\" (a conceit derived from Joseph Campbell); it stands to reason, then, that WESCAC, having completely taken over the universal University, would have produced the very text that we are reading. This clever \\"meta-fictional\\" device displaces the individual voice of the author, of course, but also reflects the sources that make its writing possible. If the author wanted to write a work that refers ceaselessly to the conditions of its production, he succeeded. A sprawling epic about mythological heroism in an age of all-consuming computerization, Giles Goat-Boy resembles the infinitely self-referring spreadsheet of a constantly self-renovating and self-activating linguistic super-computer.Giles Goat-Boy is many things. It is a Bildungsroman that charts the gradual socialization of an individual subject. Raised by goats, messianic savage George Giles strives to become the new \\"Grand Tutor\\" of the University and reprogram WESCAC. In fact, it is George who is reprogrammed. Following the classical form of the Bildungsroman, the novel ends with the disappearance of the hero's identity insofar as he is absorbed into the computer's complex machinery. Deep within Axis Mundi, the belly of the computer, George submits to WESCAC his student identification card. In doing so, he loses his name and remerges as \\"The Founder.\\" Like Wilhelm Meister, George's character is stamped by an external authority that grants him his socially reconstituted selfhood and, thereby, his validity.Giles Goat-Boy is also a complex theological and political allegory. The University is a stage upon which various world-historical conflicts are dramatized and enacted. \\"The Quiet Riot\\" allegorizes the Cold War. The Campus Riots are the world wars. The Bonifascists represent the National Socialists; the Moishians represent the Jews. The West Campus represents the West; the East Campus represents the East in general and the Soviet Union in particular. WESCAC is the atomic bomb. \\"New Tammany College\\" represents America. Getting \\"flunked\\" is equivalent to damnation; passing is equivalent to salvation. The \\"Dean O'Flunks\\" refers to Satan; the \\"Old Founder\\" refers to Jehovah. Each of the oppositions mentioned above is dialectically synthesized at the novel's close.Most importantly, however, Giles Goat-Boy is an extraordinarily elaborate practical joke. As with most postmodernist works, the reader doesn't quite know whether to take any of its meanings seriously, but suspects that one shouldn't. Allegory, for instance, is merely one of GGB's many language games. Perhaps one should take \\"J.B.\\" at his word when he says-or is alleged to have said-that \\"language is the matter of his books, as much as anything else, and for that reason ought to be \`splendrously musicked out'\\" [xvi]. Nonetheless, one of its reputed authors maintains that the book should not be dismissed as \`a work of fiction': \\"Excepting a few \`necessary basic artifices'\\" Stoker maintains, GGB is \\"neither fable nor fictionalized history, but literal truth\\" [xi]. This is also doubtful. \\"Literal truth\\" may not refer to a truth on the other side of language, but rather, a linguistic elaboration or fabrication of truth. \\"Literal truth,\\" in this context, would be a truth that is composed of letters.Giles Goat Boy is a world of veils and yet these veils do not mask deeper verities. As authoritative as it might appear, GGB abdicates its own presumptions of authority. The \\"Publisher's Disclaimer\\" disclaims-or, at least, problematizes-all of the book's claims. According to the \\"Disclaimer,\\" the alleged author, \\"J.B.\\" renounced his authorship. He claimed that he is merely the editor of the manuscript in question, which was tailored by one \\"Giles Stoker\\" or \\"Stoker Giles.\\" The latter claimed, in turn, that he is the editor of the manuscript, which was manufactured by the automatic computer, WESCAC. The computer also renounces the book's authorship. GGB's authorship, it would seem, is infinitely regressive. No one wants to admit having written the thing.Barth's future meta-narratives (Lost in the Funhouse, Chimera, Letters) will become increasingly more involuted, vine-like, and entangling, increasingly more extravagant, bombastic, and bloated, and increasingly more irritating, self-fascinated, and densely imbricated. Some readers, overpowered by Barth's stale verbiage, will bow to his turgidity. Others will remember, wistfully and nostalgically, Barthes' real masterpiece, The End of the Road -- a sour and cruel novel, to be sure, but also an infinitely more powerful and engaging one than Giles Goat-Boy. Whereas The End of the Road comes about like the shock of a physical hammer-blow, reading Giles Goat-Boy is a bit like having one's mind EAT-en by an all-embracing cybernetic parasite.Dr. Joseph SugliaP.S. I gave this book a rather low rating because of its execrable, nearly unreadable prose style."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"This book really blew me away. Adventure is probably my favorite genre, and to find something so dense with meaning, heart and creativity, it was like a god send. 5 stars all the way"},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"the first review listed here was pretty good. too bad the web site is defunct. seeing only one review, i just had to be number two :)... i dont remember how i happened to try to read this book when i was 13 back in 1970, it was probably lying around the farmhouse of my literary uncle. Dont remember much about it, but for some reason parts of it have stayed with me, the vision of literary gloss upon gloss recursing to the depths of infinity still surfaces in my consciousness occasionally. Read this about the same time as Vonnegut's 'Sirens of Titan', which, fwiw, was a more influential book for my emerging world-view, and somehow their themes seemed to overlap in visions of futility and complexity. This book probably made me lose any desire to pursue an academic career. Now, at the middling age when i read practically no nonfiction, and all my reading is work-related and hyper-technical, this is one of the nonfiction books i am pondering rereading, along with 'The B! oomer Bible', as examples of books i kind of dismissed at first reading but have somehow stayed with me, and which i feel may have some relevance for the work-aday phase of my life's journey."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"This was my favorite book by Barth so far, so far being as far as Sot-Weed Factor (a close 2nd), Chimera, and Lost in the Funhouse. This was also the 1st book I read by Barth, which may have something to do with it, but nonetheless it is well worth the dense English of a prose master."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"Let me state right now that this is not a review of the text but a review of the 'product' I received.The copy I received in June 2011 is obviously a print on demand copy but there was no indication of this on Amazon's product details. The print quality of the cover is appalling, streaky and patchy, and the final trimming is off-centre. In additon, the type script is fuzzy and lacks sharpness and clarity - as an 'older' reader this is not just frustrating but spoils the pleasure of reading. Having worked in the print industry perhaps I'm too picky but it should be a requirement that Amazon specify if they are selling a print on demand copy.... suffice to say I would never buy one again! I will look for second hand copies as a preference in future.Never thought I'd complain about a bookseller... soooo disappointed."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"this, my friends, is an enormous piece of crap. it's huge and boring. the floating opera by barth is good, but this is absolute crap, one of the worst things i have ever read. the characters and the parables are so transparent as not to maintain an interest in the story.there is a lot going on, but it's just so hard to care for it. the literary style of the book is bad,nothing remarkable about it. it's just plain uninteresting chronological narration (not that chronology is bad in itself).this book should be relegated to the darkest depths of literary history, where it belongs. such profound boredom should never more harass the innocent reader."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"Wars are riots. The Nikolyan Revolution led to the rise of the Bonifacists. Enos Enoch gave the Seminar-on-the-Hill and threw the Business Administration concessionaires out of Founder's Hall. The Siegfrieders killed the Moishians (the Chosen Class). Giles must descend into the belly of WESCAC and change its \\"AIM\\" programming. He is the Grand Tutor, he thinks, as do some others.A recurring concept and concern of this book is the question: does what Christ says indicate that the is the Christ or is whatever Christ says the truth because he is the Christ? In other words, is the yardstick a correct measure because it matches our concepts of inches and feet, or do we assign authority to the yardstick and follow its caprice?I know many people find Barth great fun, and a lark, but to me he is not funny. His message is bleak and amounts to giving a thumbs down to life."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"First, let it be said that John Barth's work is hilarious and that Giles Goatboy is his best, in my opinion. Much of the humor is rooted in his insightful view of life, love, and the seeming futility of it all. Giles Goatboy offers up the microcosm of academia as the stage upon which the Greek tragedy of all our lives is played. The only real redeeming features in Barth's worldview are the laughs he rummages out of the ashes of nihilism, and his wicked, self-deprecating sense of humor. However, his works ultimately offer up a depressingly futile vision of life. His humor makes his perspective palatable, in fact, tasty, but I often find myself hoping that for his sake, Mr. Barth has more hope than his novels portray"},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"It took me a couple of starts to get past the first twenty pages of this book, but the persistence was well repayed. Over the course of a few works (Sot-Weed, End of the Road, Letters) Barth was one of the great powers of modern literature. Goat-Boy finds him in peak form. The longevity of his computer/campus framework, and the wisdom of his \\"if it ain't broke\\" philosophy are subject to worthy discussion, but anybody who can get away with slapping a Lord Buckley styled hipster take on Oedepus Rex right in the middle just to show off his emense skill is beyond bold. Brazen in all the best ways."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"This was my first exposure to Barth but based on this it certainly won't be my last. I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, but what I can understand I find myself liking quite a bit. For those who have no idea about this book, it's basically the &quot;quest&quot; of Giles to reprogram the evil WESAC computer that is messing with the New Tammany College campus and even that brief blurb isn't enough to give this book ample justice. The plot is mostly straightforward, to me at least but the layers of satire that wrap around everything give the book greater depth, just when you think you've got it pegged as one thing, Barth gives a sly clue and it all shifts. Is it merely a big joke on the Cold War, or a comment on our culture in general. Or neither. The novel encompasses religion, sex, culture, war, just about everything you can think of and the humor is dark and bitter and at the same time hilariously funny, Giles is the perfect narrator and his observations are both hugely innocent and slyly subversive. The ultimate quest of stopping the computer becomes unimportant when you consider the events that it takes to get there and if there's any book with a more real yet wildly fantastic set of characters, I haven't read it, just when you think that he's treating them all as one big joke, a stray comment or an action reminds you that these are supposed to be real characters. As you can probably tell, this is a novel that you can't go in with any preconceptions, and if you do a lot of it will probably be lost on you. It's a massively dense read and took me almost two months (not because it was difficult, that weird time thing you see) but never once did I think of not finishing it. Definitely worth the time put into it and you can get the time, don't hesitate!"},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"If I'd picked this book off the shelf having had no familiarity with its author, I have no idea how I would've felt about it. But I was already an enthusiastic fan of The Sot Weed Factor and some of Barth's earlier and later fiction when I read this one, and my knowledge of Barth's astounding narrative and comic capabilities made this book seem a little depressing. Now, I give it 5 stars with no qualms, mostly because of its originality and humor, but I still don't know exactly what to think about it. At the very least, it's something new (even 30 years later) and worth your time. For first-time readers of Barth, however, I strongly suggest The Sot Weed Factor. It isn't as self-indulgent or anti-novel as this one (not that those qualities are necessarily bad in the hands of Barth)."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"John Barth is as good a prose stylist as the US has produced, and this book shows it. In the first third or so of the book Barth makes the language cavort, caper, dance, sing. And it is very funny. But unfortunately the joke gets old fairly quickly. The allegory, amusing enough when its underlying conceits are introduced, gets stretched thinner and thinner, to the point where it finally gets agonizing. All through at least the second half of the book I was just waiting for it to end. On the whole, I found two of Barth's other novels,The Floating Opera and The End of the Road, much more rewarding reading, although the prose doesn't quite scintillate the way it does in the early pages of this book. Give it a try, but if at some point you find it getting a bit grating and wonder if it might get better, lay it aside and get something else to read, because it will only get worse."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"This theological, philosophical, sociological m&eacute;lange of political (Cold War or \\"Quiet Riot\\") satire, of a sort, wordplay and quasi-Bildungsroman and whatever else it may or may not be, all coded into a cutesy academese, didn't do too much for me---except make me laugh, along with it, not at it.I think one of the other reviewers was spot on in assessing Barth's version of Oedipus Rex, or, excuse, \\"Taliped Decanus\\", to be the summit of the book. As for the rest of it, I think the best way to read it comes from GGB (the character, not the book) on page 207, in my copy:\\"It was not my habit to think in a directed manner, but rather to brood on whatever images came to mind as were unbid: not to manipulate and question them, but to attend like an interested spectator their links and twinings...\\"And brood Barth does upon every philosophical, theological, sociological, political (no doubt I'm leaving something out here) link and twining in the universe or \\"University\\", but all in good fun with enough high jinks and drollery to keep one turning the pages.Occasionally, Barth will even hit home with a moving passage like the following:\\"\`Anastasia...' The name seemed strange to me now, and her hair's rich smell. What was it I held, and called Anastasia? A slender bagful of meaty pipes and pouches, grown upon with hairs, soaked through with juices, strung up on jointed sticks, the whole thing pushing, squirting, bubbling, flexing, combusting, and respiring in my arms; doomed soon enough to decompose into its elements, yet afflicted in the brief meanwhile with mad imaginings, so that, not content to jelly through the night and meld, ingest, divide, it troubled its sleep with dreams of passedness, of love...\\" p.616Read \\"blessedness\\" for the academese \\"passedness\\".All things considered (or at least most of them), a jolly fun read, once one has mastered the academese argot. But, really, The Sot-Weed Factor is much more lively and fun and furthermore, not encumbered with quasi-satire and an entire argot to which one must accustom oneself. This book, by comparison, is just too...you know, the \\"P\\" word."},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"Giles Goat Boy is prefaced by 25 pages of introduction, including a disclaimer of sorts by \\"The Editors,\\" who seek to warn readers that the book they're about to begin is decidedly bawdy, disturbing, irreverent, flabbergasting and probably without literary merit. Though lengthy, these introductions are great fun, and only serve to entice and encourage the already adventurous reader. This is particularly important because the first 100 pages of the book are actually fairly uneventful, a long slow pastoral unfolding of the early episodes in the Goat Boy's life and world. Without the introduction's promises of the mischievous burlesque to come, I might not have kept reading. And that would have been a mistake.The narrative finds its stride when our would-be hero embarks on his inevitable journey, and what had in the early pages been a somewhat awkward and anachronistic style becomes a mythic mode for masterful storytelling. Giles Goat Boy is allegorical epic in which the \\"the University\\" serves as a microcosm of the universe, and where \\"Graduation\\" or \\"Commencement\\" represents some notion of enlightenment, liberation, earthly salvation. Though colored by lively historical satire and heroic farce, the book's themes are ultimately existential, even spiritual.Each of the principal characters seeks to \\"Graduate,\\" to discover modes of perception and behavior that will enable them to transcend their narcissistic limitations and become fully self-actualized. Their bungling, over-analyzed attempts to untangle repressions and overcome obsessions makes up much of this baffling, hilarious, ribald and psychologically complex tale. The book often reflects the preoccupations of the decade when it was written, and Barth's approach is mostly intellectual. All the while, the pages are littered with surprising insights, delightful mishaps and a certain uncommon wisdom.At its heart, Giles Goat Boy is a zany and uniquely engaging adventure story, one that's playfully aware of it's own symbolism, subtexts and archetypes. In fact Barth seems incapable of leaving any aspect unexamined, and the narrative does get a bit carried away with itself sometimes. In a 2001 Bookworm Interview, Barth admitted that the book is longer than he wishes it was. His undertaking is so provocative and ambitious, however, that like the struggles of its multifaceted characters, the book is remarkable in both its successes and its failures. A Plus!"},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"I suppose it is inevitable that, as the post-war boomers approach the big six-zero over the next decade, we will see a tidal flood of tender, soul-searching narratives. Boomers want to understand rather than simply experience life, and most have been frustrated by life's refusal to obey our expectations.John Barth seems to have made such soul searching his life work, and I seem to have followed him book for book, life experience by life experience over the years.A clever &quot;academic&quot; writer (read: &quot;he writes like a dream but his wit sometimes overwhelms the story&quot;), Barth has addressed boomer experience and frailty .Seeming to be five to ten years ahead of boomers, his books have ranged from the tragedy resulting from a terribly botched abortion (long before we openly spoke of this horror), through the visionary and usually misguided quest of the idealist (Sot-Weed Factor and Giles Goatboy), the terrible pain of realizing one is an adult (the clever but exhausting Letters), to more leisurely and accessible mid-life reassessment as protagonists take &quot;voyages&quot; on the emotional seascape of middle age (Sabbatical, Tidewater Tales, Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor, Once upon a Time...).Each five years or so, I eagerly await his newest offering, devour it, and then feel frustrated when his literary games seem to detract from his story.But, then, each time I realize (as if for the first time), the essential nature of his writing. Like the age-old games from which his writings spring (the quest/redemption stories of the Iliad and Oddessy, the &quot;doomed&quot; prophet stories of the Old and New Testaments, the mistaken identity games of Shakespeare and thousands of authors since, and the metaphor of story as voyage and voyage as growth from Chaucer, 1001 Nights, etc), Barth plays his games to remind us that the act of story telling *is* the experience, it *is* the reason we read: the experience of hearing ghost stories around the camp fire remains with us long long after we have forgotten the actual story.And then I remember that, as a reader, I have no more &quot;right&quot; to expect neatness and closure in a Barth story than I have the right to expect neatness and closure in my own life. Try as we might, our own work, our own story is always in progress. And like Barth's beloved Tidewater, the ebb and flow of our own story defies our attempt to capture to master it.In the end, life and Barth's stories remain as delightfully cleansing as the tide itself.KRH www.umeais.maine.edu/~hayward"},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"On aesthetic grounds (though they pale before the moral), the work is objectionable: the rhetoric is extreme, the conceit and action wildly implausible, the interpretation of history shallow and patently biased, the narrative full of discrepancies and badly paced, at times tedious, more often excessive; the form, like the style, is unorthodox, unsymmetrical, inconsistent. The characters, especially the hero, are unrealistic. There never was a Goat-boy! There never will be!"},{"Title":"Giles Goat-Boy","review":"This is not one of Barth's greater works, but it thoroughly exploits his many gifts.The reduction of the American Cultural Revolution to a Campus is a \\"nifty\\" idea - one which almost succeeds due to Barth's overwhelming prose and typically complex plot, but ultimately falls into the same philosophical category as a couple of stoners theorizing that each atom of their finger is a world of its own.Ultimately, this novel is dated in a way that Barth's other works are not (which is ironic, considering the specificity of some of the other works' temporal settings). One cannot separate this work from the 60's. The whole metaphor upon which the book is based is fairly trite. Of course, if you like \\"Earth in the Balance,\\" \\"The Population Bomb,\\" or \\"The Sirens of Titan,\\" then you'll probably absorb \\"Giles Goat Boy\\" into your own worldview and then go off on a pacifist riot through San Francisco.Perhaps it is somewhat disappointing to see Barth lay aside his precious nihlism in favor of sweaty luddite pot-philosophy. It is certainly nice to see Barth avoid this tendency in his later works.Compared to the disappointing \\"Letters: A Kind of Novel,\\" which is artistic to the point of unreadability, or \\"Chimera,\\" which is lacking in anything but the curiosity of being a Playboy pick, \\"Giles Goat Boy\\" is irresistably entertaining. The intricacy of the plot is vintage Barth (and of course, the whole \\"heroic cycle\\" thing is present, if you choose to reflect upon it). At moments (as in The Sot Weed Factor), Barth reveals glimpses of the perversions that he is to reveal more fully in later works (Somebody the Sailor, for example), but they are not as central to the story as they might have been.All told, I would agree with other reviewers and suggest that those new to Barth steer clear of Giles Goat Boy until they have digested some of his other works. It is a fairly useful thing to understand Barth's structural tendencies when reading GGB, and an introductory reading of this book first is too likely to convince the reader that Barth is just another 60's type who writes a good piece of filth."},{"Title":"Tribes *OP","review":"(Note: Additional stars may be applicable.

(An early version of the game was called &quot;Darwinopoly.&quot;)The game is played on a very simple board with four regions (plains, hills, swamp, forest) each of which has a different variety of plants and animals to hunt or gather. Much of the playing surface is occupied by charts and tables, e.g., a timeline to determine how far along your kids are toward maturity.In each round, players decide whether they're going to spend their time hunting, gathering, guarding children (there are hyeanas about), and making craft items (baskets or spear points). Also, they decide who they're going to sleep with! Successful mating means the female character gets pregnant, of course.This is a VERY social game. Lots of arguing and bargaining occur. The games I've played (I was a playtester) were all VERY enjoyable. The game is successfull in that, from a simple set of game rules, _social_ rules emerge._Tribes_ isn't something you'll play super-often. It's something to have fun with once in a while. The good news is it's easy to learn, so you can spring it on friends and acquaintances who might not normally be into a role-playing game. Add another half-star if this doesn't bother you."},{"Title":"Tribes *OP","review":"This is a game by David Brin and Steve Jackson. It's fairly cheaply made - consisting of a thin black &amp; white rulebook and a cardstock sheet of counters which you have to cut out yourself. But they weren't expecting to sell the game to the masses anyway. In short, it's a simple simulation of tribal life during the stone age. You hunt, gather, procreate and try to survive. If you're interested in anthropology or fairly quick and simple but interesting games, give it a try."},{"Title":"Tribes *OP","review":"Interesting documentary style storyline.

Now I finally know what my flying dreams meant! (I never understood this--and other dreams I've had--until reading Ms. Lawrence's book.) Reading the celebrity dreams was also a lot of fun and very fascinating. I've learned from hearing Ms. Lawrence analyze dreams on the radio--but reading the book taught me even more about myself and the entire subject of dream interpretation. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dream Keys","review":"Lawrence's &quot;Dream Keys&quot; is an extremely well written treasure offering up some of the best analyses since Freud's &quot;Interpretation of Dreams.&quot; And Lawrence's dreams are from celebrities, so its an interesting read all the way. Voyeuristic, maybe. But I couldn't put the book down. Afterall, who wouldn't want to know what Jackie O dreamt before she met John Kennedy, what Madonna dreamt during her pregnancy, and what Luciano Pavarotti dreamt before his performance of Othello. I was amazed that Mark Hamill dreamt himself &quot;walking the sky&quot; years before he played the part of Luke &quot;Skywalker&quot; in Star Wars. Better still, the book introduces a new concept of &quot;actualized&quot; dreams that shows how we can interpret conscious actions as dream symbols in our everyday lives. In conclusion, the cover art, although commercial, in no way represents the intelligence within this mighty little book. Lawrence somehow manages to spoonfeed us--what would oftentimes be heavy academia--with humour and great style."},{"Title":"Dream Keys","review":"This book taught me so much about analyzing my innermost thoughts.

Most psychologists are borderline worthless, and most self improvement books and tapes offer only superficial advice. Robbins goes to the very heart of the matter-- to the very things that shape our lives from the inside out.I've listened to this program perhaps six times through, and each time it rings more and more true. However, without applying these tools, there is little gain. The opportunity provided is limitless, but must be acted upon fully. Robbins stresses action in each session, and does an excellent job of formulating a series of bite-size actions that take you down his well-laid path.He really has done his homework, and puts most everyone else in the fields of psychology and self improvement in a distant second. Bear in mind, this is coming from someone who has dug into this area for years, and who once thought Robbins was nothing more than a info-mercial huckster. That is until I gave this program an honest chance. Yes, he is a hopeless salesman, but he really has something to sell.He is a master in seeking out, collecting, boiling down, systematizing and teaching the keys of personal achievement.

(Nice mindset, huh?)Well, I guess I passed the test because after I listened to the first tape, I couldn't stop. I had to have the next and then the next and then all of the sudden I was 30 days into the program and I was a different person. Every part of me had changed - THE PAST DOES NOT EQUAL THE FUTURE!Together we became so enthralled with Tony's work that we started attending his live events.

You know, I 'should' do this. Or, I 'should' do that.

I went out and bought Unlimited Power and Awaken The Giant and ordered Personal Power from Nightingale-Conant.Person Power is the most powerful personal development program available in the world. After trying just a few of Tony's techniques, it was easy to see why so many successful business people, trainers, actors and celebrities openly recommended Tony Robbins and with so much enthusiasm.I sincerely believe that anyone who properly follows this program will achieve results that heretofore seem impossible.

Well, Tony teaches you how, by teaching you the power of state, the power of questions and focus, how to anchor to positive state (a crucial thing!) and make the state automatic!Many times before i tried and tried to think and be positive, but i just couldn't do it! Until the day I learned about the power of STATE from Tony and NLP. If you can get into a state, the thought tendencies and emotions will flow out automatically from that particular state! So if you're really always depressed and low, you can't just go and change by thinking positive... you'll need to change your state- then positive thoughts will flow naturally!

Anthony Robbins is a great coach who helps you and motivates you to change the things you want to about yourself. He helps you to think differently about things, to re-program what you connect to various things. For instance, if you want to lose weight, figure out something that would be fun for you but at the same time give you exercise too. He helps you realize that we all do things because of pleasure or pain. And that if we link certain things to more pleasure than we will want to do that thing even more. On the other hand, if the pleasure isn't as strong as the pain, you might feel at that time than you'll probably wait until the pain is so strong that you have to do it right then.

When people hear of Tony RObbins, they think PP2 and his infomercials. In my opinion , it's also the best he has(Get the Edge sucked, Time of your life was boring)but this one is pretty good. I think the simpliest way to review it is in Pro and Cons.Pro: 1.Goal setting is great. It is very motivating listening to him while writing your goals. 2. He is entertaining. Ive listened to others, and they just lack the charisma and energy of Tony. 3. Overall, the format is laid out well and the transitions are smooth.Cons: 1. Places too much of an emphasis on money. Im skeptical about his whole getting rich stuff. 2. Too much rambling. Too many personal stories about himself, too. 3. Too much namedropping. I don't need to hear how rich and wonderful he is over and over.That just about sums it up for me. There is some good info, but a lot of it is BS. He also promotes his seminars way too much. A few plugs here and there are OK, but he plugs them at least once on every tape. That got on my nerves.

He gives you great tools - tools which are not complicated, but more like \\"ah, ha! I can do this!\\" and shows you how taking control of such things as what you are focusing on to create your reality, questions you ask yourself (one of my favorite CDs), and much, much more......tools which can create a compelling future, tools which you can use immediately to take yourself out of negative states. He gives you a journal for taking notes and doing simple, supportive exercises. It occurs for me as learning things for my mind which are just as valuable as learning the best diet and exercise to create optimum health in my body. Highly recommended.

To this day, I have my doubts about most of them. Anthony Robbins is a different story altogether, and these tapes prove it. Robbins lays out, in detail, a strategy to being successful in all facets of life including financial, love, overcoming fears,etc. He does this not by taking the easy \\"just be positive\\" approach, but by illustrating how to change your physical and mental state to take on the challenges of everyday life. It's funny. Listening to the conviction and passion in his voice on these tapes, which I listen to when I'm driving in my car, almost seem as musical and lyrical than a song on a radio. Mr. Robbins comes off not so much like a mulitmedia, multi-millionaire celebrity, but as an older brother who has the gift to influence and find the strengths in you that you didn't know you had.

Having said that, unfortunately it didn't really work for me. There are several reasons. First, I found myself disagreeing with most of what he said. For example, I have been suffering from major depression for over twelve years. After listening to Tony, you'd think that people are depressed simply because they manage their physiology poorly, i.e. they slouch their shoulders, hold their head down, speak in a slow and sedated way, etc. Sorry, but major depressive disorder is a serious medical and psychiatric illness, not the result of slouching one's shoulders. Second, he says that if you ask yourself great questions, your brain will automatically focus on finding better answers or solutions to your problems. Maybe, maybe not. It may be equally likely that my brain could realize how impossible and hopeless a situation really is, and that there's nothing I can do about it.These are just a few of many other objections I had to Tony's ideas. Of course, as others have pointed out, there are many good points to this program. One of the most beneficial for me was identifying beliefs and values. He does a good job of explaining their importance in directing one's life. Also, to me there's something about Tony's voice that's unlike anyone else I've ever heard. You can hear a unique passion, drive, and energy from his voice. If they prepared the exact same package with someone else's voice, it would be a totally different experience, and I don't think I would feel motivated at all.After all is said and done, it still boils down to taking action. And by disagreeing as much as I did with Tony, I couldn't bring myself to take action. It's like any other self-improvement book or tape -- it won't really work unless you follow what they tell you to do. And if you have philosophical objections to what they're telling you to do, then the chances of that program working for you have pretty much gone down the drain. I'm not saying it can't be helpful for you, as there are thousands or maybe millions of success stories to contradict that. I am just saying that it won't work for everyone, since it didn't work for me."},{"Title":"Personal Power II (Volumes 1 thru 12)","review":"Keep in mind that Personal Power 2 is the first and only Tony Robbins program I've tried. Tony Robbins and his programs appear to have helped a lot of people. I wish I was one of them. I've literally tried doing this program repeatedly in the course of the last 3 years with no success. I believe the reason is lack of structure. He ATTEMPTS structure with this program, but loses sight. For instance the first assignment is to do 2 things that you've been putting off that you can start right away. And the second assignment (which is done the day after as it is a 30 day program) is to do FOUR things that you've been putting off the same way. Now if I knew at the beginning that in the first two days I would have to begin 6 projects I would've chosen little things like - cleaning my desk instead of the projects I chose because there was no way I could begin 4 more projects the next day due to the size of the projects I picked the day before. He should've been more specific. There are many examples of this lack of clarity throughout the series. He announces that each audio for the day is only 30 minutes, but in reality many of them are 45 minutes...which shows more of the lack of structure. I expected to be able to hear these during my breaks and found that often I could not finish listening during that time.I also found the CD's incredibly repetative. There were quite a few days where it seemed like I heard that lesson before 5 times. It was a bit much. Especially if you want to listen to this over and over during the course of your life which I imagine you do considering how expensive it is. (I got the CD version instead of the cassette one which was $160 at the time). I found it annoying that I would have to listen to 30-45 minutes of psychological babble before I could get to the \\"meat\\" which was the assignment. Now don't get me wrong- He makes valid points and a couple of the excersises are GOLD, but at the end of the 30 days you're supposed to have reached a specific goal and here's where the program fails. In the course of the assignments you lose track of what that Goal is or what it should be because of the lack of structue. For instance later in the coarse he adds as an assignement that you lay out a financial plan and do that for the rest of the coarse... But what about the goal I had in mind from the beginning of this coarse that I've been doing? Again if he was clearer about the fact that your goal shouldn't be something so huge that you can't do it AND also do assignments that have nothing to do with it I would've started the program differently.In short- I tried this program several times and now have to just settle for the fact that Tony can't work for everyone. If you're extremely unorganized and overwhelm easily and therefore need structure more than you need motivation- this program might not be for you. I'm still going to sneak a peak at his other programs to see if they're a better fit, but if not I'll find what works. One thing can't work for everyone."},{"Title":"Personal Power II (Volumes 1 thru 12)","review":"Use to like him when I listened, is good for getting you fired up.

It is an excellent introduction to that art, plus it discusses important topics such as the role of qigong (chi kung) and internal force in Taiji practice.Especially for beginners or those who are new to the art, I recommend reading the preface, the first two chapters (on Tai Chi as a martial art and on the concept of yin-yang), Chapter 6 (the importance of chi kung) and Chapter 12 (&quot;Enriching Daily Life with Tai Chi Chuan&quot;)."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Tai Chi Chuan: A Comprehensive Guide to the Principles and Practice","review":"This book is an excellent overview of all the styles of Tajiquan, including forms, martial applications, weapons, and qigong.

Many authors mystify this art to the point of folly, but Mr. Wong presents Tai Chi as the straight forward, efficient martial art that it truly is. Though this book lacks, in my opinion, a proper discussion of the actual use of chi for combat, it presents solid, logical descriptions of the mechanics involved as well as their underlying philosophies. This book is good for someone who wants a thorough overview of the various (popular) styles of Tai Chi Chuan, and especially valuable for the experienced martial artist who is looking at learning some of the internal aspects of boxing. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Tai Chi Chuan: A Comprehensive Guide to the Principles and Practice","review":"Aside from WKK's typical need for a better editor with a more daring hand, this is a worthy addition to any Taiji practitioner's library.As for the one reviewer's comments about WKK's honest modesty on his Taiji lineage status, I would just add the following consideration: Taiji comes from Shaolin inasmuch as it was developed there much the same as all other Chinese martial arts can be said to have been developed at Shaolin Temple. So, to quip at his lack of a lineage in Taiji OUTSIDE of the supreme martial arts college throughout all of Buddhist China's history makes little sense to me. I have a Shaolin master and I know that he was trained in Taiji and his Taiji is very good and very particular, in fact. So to have had a good Shaolin master is to a large extent to have had a good Taiji master. Taiji is a major course of study within the Shaolin warrior monk's curriculum. So, to have actually had a Shaolin master teach you Taiji is a supreme bit of good fortune, indeed. WKK merely states that his Shaolin master was not of a distinguished Taiji lineage, which is not much of a detraction given that the master in question teaching WKK WAS a Shaolin master, which typically should by all reasonaing be better than a master of of Taiji that is removed completely from the Shaolin system for several generations.Also, WKK does not say that you should learn Taiji without an instructor, period. He says his book is a self-teaching device for those who are already under the instruction of a qualified teacher, or for someone who otherwise would have no instruction whatsoever.Though WKK obviously is well-versed in terminology and applications of Taiji, that is not the sole purpose of this book. He goes into historical background and explication of theory behind the techniques in Taiji combat and other areas. The areas on direct instruction on application seem pretty darned good, nontheless. Most Tai Chi instructors these days will be exceptional if they have familiarity in Tai Chi combat beyond the basics of elementary push hands. The bottom line is, yes of course you need an instructor if you can find one. He never contradicts this truth, he merely is providing good knowledge on Taiji for those who need it. Teachers invariably don't teach one-on-one exclusively, they teach a whole room full of students for about 2 hours or so. This book helps you to find out things you may never get the opportunity to even ask your sifu.If you can get past a few boring moralistic/sentimental-sounding sections here and there, and a charactistically dry presentation style overall, WKK is an extremely respectable resource on Taiji for most of us. He means well when he is boring, and he is informative and helpful most of the rest of the time. Most importantly, his information tends to be accurate, and is consistent with the Shaolin understanding of martial arts, which for most mainland Chinese experts is paramount mark of distinction."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Tai Chi Chuan: A Comprehensive Guide to the Principles and Practice","review":"I like this book a lot because the illustration and detailed movements helped me much bet ter than other books I've read in Taichi. Of course, having an instructor is better than reading a book, but if you don't the chance to take a Taichi class, BUY THIS BOOK!

I never thought much of martial arts books that used illustrations to show forms, but this book manages to pull it off. If you want to learn about Tai Chi Chuan, or are currenty practising it, BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Tai Chi Chuan: A Comprehensive Guide to the Principles and Practice","review":"I had previously read sifu Wong's excellent book on kung fu, and when I saw this one, I had to try it too.Sifu Wong's book is the most eclectic and complete book so far I've seen on tai chi. It lives up to his goal to present the complete art with all its facets, as he states in the introduction. Although he points out that volumes could be written on the topic of each chapter, a book covering all the relevant topics even briefly would still be of value. And I think he has succeeded very well.I also appreciate his humility. In a world of macho and all too often egotistical martial artists, Wong admits that his strong suit is really his kung fu, and knows less about tai chi. But he was motivated to write the book to benefit those students who might be able to do tai chi, but are unable to undergo the rigors of kung fu training.The book presents all the main aspects of tai, from the physical representations of the forms to the more abstruse spiritual matters, which I'd never seen really discussed much before. There are extensive discussions of chi. Since I have studied both wu and yang styles, I especially enjoyed his presentation of the chen and hou styles, which I have never studied, and the two short forms, the 24 and 48 move ones, as I have only done the long ones. He also discussed the two wu styles, which are not related.I also enjoyed his presentation of many of the martial applications. There are several detailed sections where he illustrates and explains these, and I learned some new applications there. Also, even better, there is a section on multiple attack sequences, which is the only time I have ever seen that illustrated and discussed in a tai chi book. Wong points out that this sort of continuous attack practice is essential and also free style practice in order to truly be able to fight effectively, since a determined attacker is unlikely to simply use one technique.Wong is also quite firm on the point that tai is primarily a martial art, which often gets overlooked today. All in all a very fine tai chi book that should be useful to the beginning and advanced student alike."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Tai Chi Chuan: A Comprehensive Guide to the Principles and Practice","review":"I am a beginner to the study of Tai Chi Chuan, and I was looking for a book that would satisfy my overall curiosity of various aspects of Tai Chi Chuan.

Packed with so much information I plan to read it a second time and will use it as a reference frequently. Do you want to learn more than just the health aspects of Tai Chi Chuan? Then this book will explore the martial art, the history, the physical, and the philosophical areas of Tai Chi Chuan to help you get the most out of it's practice.

It is very relieving to have a text in fluent, not translated, English, written by someone of the culture. The historical section is a treat for those who enjoy knowing the whys and wherefores. At this point - I am still working on the applied portion of the book, as learning a physical art from a book is... shall we say, less than a straight forward affair.If you are a beginning student of Eastern Philosophy, Martial Arts, Budo, Tao, Meditation, or Tai Chi - you will find the book well written. Understand that learning how to move from a book will be difficult. However, were I starting out all over again, I would want this book on my shelf for side notes and insight beyond my physical instructor.If you are an accomplished student - this is an excellent book to expand your insights. I look forward to re-reading this book several times as I and my martial skills age."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Tai Chi Chuan: A Comprehensive Guide to the Principles and Practice","review":"Wong Kiew Kit's \\"The Complete Book of Tai Chi Chuan\\", by the author's own admission, may not be truly complete, but it does cover a lot of ground from history to philosophy to training techniques beyond the forms. In the never-ending debate over whether Tai Chi Chuan is a martial art or a form of Chi Gong, Sifu Kit comes down clearly and unapologetically on the side of Tai Chi Chuan as a martial art. For this reason, those looking for a book on the energy work aspects of Tai Chi Chuan may not be pleased with this choice. It does cover Chi Gong aspects of Tai Chi Chuan, but they recieve short shrift compared to discussion of push hands and applications. On the other hand, those interested in a discussion of the martial arts applications and the minutiae of movement will no doubt gleen much of value.It should be noted that all illustrations are line drawings, some of which are small and crude. Those expecting detailed photographs will not be pleased. However, anyone who thinks they can learn anything about Tai Chi Chuan (be it as a martail art or as energy work) or any other martial arts from pictures in a book is sadly mistaken anyway. The pages of sequence drawings (and list of form names) may be useful for students.What was, perhaps, most interesting to me was the discussion of how the various strains (Yang Style, Chen Style, Wudang, etc.) developed and what major points separate them. As someone who only has experience with one style (Yang style), it was interesting to hear about the focal points and a bit of the history of some of the other styles.It should be noted that the author is, by his own statement, primarily an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu, so some may want to focus there limited reading time on authors whose martial arts careers have been spent on Tai Chi Chuan. However, I found the book to be a good overview of a range of topics, and Sifu Kit seemed to me to write authoritatively and comprehensively on the subject."},{"Title":"Lexicon of musical invective;: Critical assaults on composers since Beethoven's time","review":"Of interest to the most serious listeners of classical music. The author, Nicolas Slonimsky, was a composer, conductor, and author/editor of Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians and was the most thorough chaser after obscure biographical information ever known. This lexicon compiles spiteful reviews of music from the 1800s to the middle of the twentieth century. It is essentially a look at the music critic's mis-judgment of the new and innovative music of their time."},{"Title":"Lexicon of musical invective;: Critical assaults on composers since Beethoven's time","review":"The ill-informed and pompously long-winded &quot;12x88&quot; completely misses the point. It doesn't matter what Slonimsky says in the Forward - the content of the book is hugely entertaining and in many cases hilariously funny. And &quot;12x88&quot; doesn't seem to realise that a good deal of the most vituperative attacks on music came from other composers, frequently of equivalent eminence, so condemning or praising &quot;critics&quot; leads nowhere.Also it is not clear the previous reviewer has any clear idea what he means by &quot;atonal&quot; music. Is aleatoric music, which may be &quot;tonal&quot; or not or beyond such classification, included ?And what about much baroque music, that also creates little if any emotional involvement ?"},{"Title":"Lexicon of musical invective;: Critical assaults on composers since Beethoven's time","review":"...is a \\"fresher\\" expression for Nicholas Slonimsky's introduction, \\"Non-Acceptance of the Unfamiliar,\\" to this howler of a compendium of musical criticism.In a nutshell, this book is a collection of excerpts from reviews, commentary and correspondence regarding the music of forty-three composers over a 150-year span, beginning with Beethoven and ending (approximately) with Bart&oacute;k, Schoenberg, Shostakovich and Stravinsky. While most of the composers are well-known, some (Henry Cowell, Roy Harris, Wallingford Riegger, Carl Ruggles, Edgar Var&egrave;se) are hardly household names. For the most part, the commentary closely follows, in time, the premieres of the works described. (In some cases, this may be years after their original premieres. It often took, in times past, years for the works to get from \\"the country of origin\\" to the venues that were the domains of the reviewers and critics. History - and this book - have shown that this extra time was not necessarily an asset in evaluating the works more accurately.)A quick page count by composer shows that Wagner (at 27 pages), Schoenberg (at 20 pages), Stravinsky (at 19 pages), Strauss (at 16 pages), and Debussy (at 15 pages) come under the greatest critical scrutiny, or, in retrospect, the greatest \\"fear of the unknown.\\" Surprisingly, other \\"true revolutionaries\\" come off somewhat better: Berlioz (at 5 pages), Mahler (at 4 pages), to name two. Even \\"universally-loved\\" composers who wrote music which these days is commonly considered accessible don't escape the critics' wrath: Bizet, Brahms, Puccini, Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky are some who didn't exactly become accepted overnight.It's not as if these music critics \\"who blew it\\" didn't know their field appropriately. More than a few (C&eacute;sar Cui, George Templeton Strong, Virgil Thomson, to name three) were themselves composers, writing about the new music of their contemporaries. Others (Olin Downes, long-time music critic of the New York Times, Henry E. Krehbiel, similarly of the New York Tribune, and Philip Hale, similarly of the Boston Herald) were highly-respected music critics of their time, not normally given to \\"blowing it\\" as far as making a bad call against a new piece of music was concerned.But that is what this book is about: \\"Blowing it, major-league big-time,\\" usually with style and panache to spare, as well as all the buzzwords and \\"tricks of the trade\\" that suggest expertise. Then, along comes the unsuspecting reader of \\"the next morning's dailies.\\" He (or she) reads the critique, and the die is cast: Wagner (or Strauss or Stravinsky or Debussy; enter a name of your choice) has just composed music that is: cacophonous; caterwauling; noise, non-music; not fit for human consumption (pick one). The reader has fallen victim to this \\"expert opinion.\\" It is hard to shake this initial \\"expert\\" impression. It may take years. It may never happen. And it might have been the fault of the critic in the first instance.There is one significant omission, perhaps curious only to those who are unfamiliar with some of the other \\"alter egos\\" which Slonimsky had: Charles Ives. Now, Ives was America's first \\"modern\\" (or, in terms that I think fit him best, our \\"first-and-only romantic pre-post-modern\\"), and his music just barely found acceptance within his lifetime, even if this acceptance came many years after he stopped composing and was quite infirm due to a variety of ailments. Slonimsky had been a friend and champion of Ives well before Ives's music caught on with the concert-going public, and I like to think that omission of Ives as a subject of such invective was a conscious decision on the part of Slonimsky, perhaps as a gift from a friend. But it is also true that much of Ives's music went unperformed during his lifetime, thereby escaping the invective it might otherwise have garnered.I almost thought that there might be a second significant omission, that of Hector Berlioz as music critic (something which he did for the better part of forty years). But the index at the back of the book did turn up one comment of Berlioz's (in a letter [dated 1861]), brief but to the point: \\"Wagner is evidently mad.\\" By 1861, Berlioz and Wagner had already known each other quite well for some six years or more. Berlioz - despite trying hard - couldn't fathom the chromaticism in Wagner's \\"Tristan und Isolde,\\" this despite the fact that Wagner wasn't at all bashful about borrowing some of Berlioz's better ideas in his \\"Romeo et Juliette\\" for \\"Tristan und Isolde.\\"Also curiously absent is any mention of twentieth-century British composers (Vaughan Williams, Holst, Britten, Brian, Bax and so forth). Neither Slonimsky nor Peter Schickele (of P. D. Q. Bach fame, and the writer of a fresh Foreword to this edition) posits why this might be so. There is no shortage of criticism by British critics; they have plenty to say about the musics of composers of other countries. And sheer accessibility cannot be the explanation; the Fourth Symphony of Ralph Vaughan Williams hardly fits the mold of \\"instant acceptance and accessibility.\\" Curious.It wouldn't surprise me if every working composer already has a copy of Slonimsky's little masterpiece tucked away for \\"rainy day\\" encouragement. And if they don't, they ought to. Music lovers would do well to read how initial critical thinking can affect acceptance of new music, and how critical opinion can change \\"once the dust settles.\\"But those who stand to benefit the most from reading this book, as a cautionary tale, perhaps, are the working music reviewers and critics. They (or at least their predecessors) are the ones whose flawed judgements at the time have not withstood history's judgement, resulting in these screamingly funny \\"critiques.\\"Good for much more than just a laugh or two! Pick your favorite composer. He's probably been picked apart by someone anthologized in Slonimsky's screamer.Bob Zeidler"},{"Title":"Lexicon of musical invective;: Critical assaults on composers since Beethoven's time","review":"I first heard about Nicolas Slonimsky's collection of scathing reviews of brilliant music on a 1992 episode of the radio show Schickele Mix, the first time that a radio show prompted me to rush out and buy a reference book. It was difficult to find a copy of the book then, and even more difficult later when it went out of print, so how nice it is to have it back in print in this new edition, and how even nicer that the new edition contains a new forward by the same Peter Schickele whose radio show introduced me to the book all those years ago.The radio show turned out to be but a small sampling of the many hundreds of classical music reviews that were collected by Slonimsky into this volume. In its entirety it is really amazing how many different negative reviews have been written about music now often considered masterpieces, and what amount of wit and creativity went into these insults. However, the radio show had the advantage of being able to play recordings of the music along with the reviews to highlight the disparity between how we hear these pieces today and what they sounded like to selected critics when they were new. So although many readers may gain amusement merely from reading these reviews, much as my friend who watched Siskel and Ebert just for the enjoyment of hearing them argue, they are much more amusing and insightful if you are somewhat familiar with the composers and music reviewed or if you pick up some recordings of the pieces described. It would be even better if it was possible to get an audio version of this book with music samples, perhaps based on that radio program.This is not a book for reading straight through in one sitting, but for checking out a few reviews at a time. One of the best features of the book is an &quot;Invecticon&quot;, a type of index where you can look up key phrases like &quot;incomprehensible&quot;, &quot;pretentious rubbish&quot;, or &quot;savage modernistic mockery&quot; and find a list of composers described as such with the page numbers of their reviews. Mr. Schickele's new forward puts this all in good perspective.I was, of course, exaggerating before when I said that all of the works described here are clearly masterpieces and implied that the reviewers were therefore incorrect in their opinions, but I'd like to point out a significant importance of this book, the fact that it provides ample evidence for a sobering thought, that in this age where a Broadway show can close after 6 days due to one negative review, there is always the remote possibility that the reviewer might be wrong."},{"Title":"Lexicon of musical invective;: Critical assaults on composers since Beethoven's time","review":"A favorite book by all of our music school staff members, this collection of witty and razor-tongued &quot;reviews&quot; by critics is sure to please the classical music lover!The introduction by Peter Shickele (a.k.a.

It's handily arranged in alphabetic order by composer, so while listening to, say, Bela Bartok's first piano concerto, you can amuse yourself with a 1928 review from the Cincinnati Enquirer:\\"Mr. Bartok elected to play his composition dignified by the title Concerto for Pianoforte and Orchestra. Note the ommission of key. Ultra-moderns cannot be bothered with such trifling designations ... It has been said that the Concerto is based on folk tunes. They have been successfully concealed. Only tonal chaos arises from the diabolical employment of unrelated keys simultaneously.\\"A 1913 review from the Boston Journal manages to make unprophetic judgements about two composers in one go:\\"For the most part the latest symphony [the Sibelius Fourth] from the pen of Finland's foremost composer is a tangle of the most dismal dissonances. It eclipses the saddest and sourest moments of Debussy.\\"In addition to these citations, Slonimsky offers his own analysis of critical tendencies in the opening essay \\"Non-Acceptance of the Familiar\\". To the elderly among the old critics, Slonimsky notes, new music always seems louder than what they are used to. They also often resorted to linguistic similes, comparing new music to \\"Chinese\\", a then-handy symbol of incomprehensibility. He gives some general anecdotes about the world of music reviewing, such as a Russian journalist writing a review on Prokofiev's \\"Scythian Suite\\" before the concert even took place--he was fired when the review appeared but the piece had actually be taken off the programme at the last minute. There's even an index of Invective, so if you want to find all reviews making use of the terms \\"Hideous\\", \\"Grunting\\", or even \\"Feeding Time at Zoo\\", you'll know which pages to turn to.Though the work is entertaining, it's no essential addition to a home library. You can read it in an hour at your public or university library. Also, the work was never updated after 1965--it ends with the generation of Bartok, Webern, and Varese--and so those hoping to read invective against Boulez, Stockhausen and others won't find it here."},{"Title":"Lexicon of musical invective;: Critical assaults on composers since Beethoven's time","review":"Slonimsky has gathered a collection of bad reviews written about works by now-revered composers (Beethoven, Debussy, et al.)It's a revelation to see how poorly these folks were regarded--at least by some--in their own times.Well worth a browse."},{"Title":"Lexicon of musical invective;: Critical assaults on composers since Beethoven's time","review":"This book is an inspired piece of iconic significance, butnot in the way the author intended. What he DID intendwas to poke fun at music critics for their supposed&quot;non-acceptance of the unfamiliar.&quot; Well the critic's advocate is a roletoo easy to adopt: how could anyone other than a clairvoyanthave known that such and such a composer would go onto be lauded as a genius? Nay, the all-too-obvious benefitof Slonimsky's hindsight, almost in itself discredits his viewpoint,genius though he most certainly is. For what becomes clearsoon after starting the book is that the shock value andthe novelty wears off. What does NOT wear off thoughis something Slonimsky never intended to protray (becausehe was no clairvoyant himself and could not project the declineof the linguistic standards in journalism subsequent tohis generation): that is the wonderful and eloquent beauty ofof the prose these music critics had. Their ability to describemusic, and its effect on the listener, by using seemingly endlessamounts of imaginative and hilarious simile, and other figurativelanguage is breathtaking; it's a bountiful joy to read, indicative ofa time when critics had the guts to say what they felt withoutthe stodgy attitude found in the cliche-ridden dross often foundin today's journalism.After a while -- once the reader is able tocast his mind back to a time when music wassupposed to embody truth, beauty, reason,and be presented by ordered use of harmony,melody and rhythm -- it is not difficult at all toagree wholeheartedly with most of what thesewriters complain about. For much of Wagner's musicDOES INDEED sound like an &quot;inflated display of extravagance.&quot;Webern's serialism DOES often &quot;call to mind the activityof insects.&quot; Schoenberg DOES &quot;torpedo the eardrumswith deadly dissonance.&quot; And on and on. Only a Philistineuniversity professor (who equates fame with musical quality)would refuse to admit it.&quot;...vacillating and fluid harmonies........this music is indeterminate,vague, fleeting, indecisive, deliberately indefinite.............withoutmuscle or backbone......grey music forming a sort of sonorous mist.....&quot;That (written in 1910) is the most clear-minded, honest description of Debussy'smusic you will ever read. But you won't read this kindof opinion now, because in the classical music world,once a composer is famous, he is then off limits tohonest assessment. Only the performance receives analysis.To be able to see what people thought AT THE TIME,is a priceless opportunity Slonimsky has bequeathedto us, regardless of that he did not intend it.These review excerpts are nothing less thana testament to the integrity and sinceritythat was once (a long time ago!) represented by menof the critical pen. The Lexicon should be a required item on the shelf ofeveryone who calls himself a writer in the field of theperforming arts. Then maybe scribes would bemore respected."},{"Title":"Lexicon of musical invective;: Critical assaults on composers since Beethoven's time","review":"When most people think of the world of classical music, they think of stuffy, staid, reserved, and often pompous people. This book shows that Slonimsky could throw water balloons at the whole genre that \\"should\\" be approached with \\"reverence\\" and get a good laugh.And he does. No matter how you look at it, weather the reviewer was being pompous himself, or even if the composer deserved it (personally, I wouldn't mind if someone were to rake Offenbach over the coals), this collection does exactly what Slonimsky intended. It makes us laugh.Mind you, I love classical music! I get just as much of a thrill listening to Beethoven as anyone, and Vaughn Williams is a personal favorite. But they were human beings, not demigods. They probably never took themselves as seriously as most of the classical music world does (except maybe Wagner). This book is a refreshing and welcome change from the stereotype attitude of a dusty, embalmed world of self-aggrandizing fops who take themselves way too seriously - and are getting what they deserve."},{"Title":"Lexicon of musical invective;: Critical assaults on composers since Beethoven's time","review":"This is a very interested collection of negative musical reviews of all the great composer and their masterpieces.

It has all the critical articles written at the time that now famous composers first presented their pieces. i.e. Beethoven's ninth symphony was panned!It helps that I was once a student of Nicholas Slonimsky, the author. Fascinating and fun."},{"Title":"Paeans","review":"Your titled book of Paeans, is a wonderful account of your walk with God. I watched you spend time with God, silently praying and talking in order to receve. The many nights and days that you stayed awake and recorded, as the rest of the world silently was asleep. I remember a day in 1996, when you told me that God had called you out, to keep a diary with Him. Your book of Paeans is most encouraging, and I would recommend it all who wish to be encouraged in FAITH. In your book, you journeyed in faith into the realm of God's creation. It is clearly written and evident in your writings that God is alive and well. Now I find myself seeing God in everything I see each day. I am proud of your accomplishment, in the writings of PAEANS. God bless you, as you encourage others with your writings."},{"Title":"The Civil War in Spain 1936-1939","review":"I'm surprised to find out that this text is so unknown. It is a collection of \\"letters, official reports, court proceedings, reporters' dispatches from the battlefronts, diaries and captured archives\\" and is edited by an eyewitness to the saga; Robert Payne.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"Belleruth Naparstek is a major proponent and renewer of guided imagery. This tape is designed to help you feel better - no matter how you are feeling right now. One of the very best self-help tapes I know of, from one of the real experts."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"Towards the end of tape religious imagery is used. Something about imagining yourself in the hand of god.There is nothing wrong with that, but I felt that the tape should have had a warning on it for people who do not share the author's religious beliefs."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"I just recently got this CD and I am pleased with it. It is just what I expected, calm guided imagery and affirmations. I found it very relaxing and plan to listen to it nightly to both relax from the stress of the day and to put positive life-affirming thoughts into my head. I have to admit, when I first heard Naparstek's voice I didn't like it but within a minute or two it grew on me with it's calming presence. For some people, the guided imagery and affirmations may cause strong reactions. I was actually surprised by this even though Naparstek forewarns the listener that this may happen. I think it is important to seek help (psychotherapy, medication) for depression outside this CD. This is not a cure for depression. I do think it is a wonderful tool that can be used in one's own home to help though. I highly recommend this. I plan to try some of Naparstek's other CDs in this series as well."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"This tape has helped me so much in my battle with depression.

The tapes really work!"},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"After the first listening you feel the visual imagery guide is like a good friend. The experience is the most warm, loving and caring I have ever had with imagery. I quickly found my safe place and the journey to and through my safe place left me smiling and ready to laugh.The Affirmations are just as good. I was amazed! Over Twenty minutes of building affirmations. Now that I have listened for some time now, I like this CD as much as I did the first time."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"Belleruth Naparstek's soothing voice itself is a valuable aid to relaxation and calmness. The guided imagery is extremely helpful in centering oneself and in becoming relaxed. As Belleruth says in the introduction, you may find that it will ease you right into restful sleep the first few times you listen (especially if you listen at bedtime, as I do). It's worth the effort to stay awake, though, to follow the suggestions in the imagery and also to listen to the affirmations. I would highly recommend this audio CD, as well as another CD by Naparstek on coping with stress, to you if you are willing to take the time to be open to new ways of healing yourself."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"By far Belleruth's tapes are the best in applying guided imagery to health and healing. Her tapes inspire as they help you focus your mind on healing your body. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"I have reviewed a number of guided imagery and relaxation tapes and i loved it better than any of the rest!"},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"I have several of the Health Journeys guided imagery recordings by Belleruth Naparstek, and they are all very helpful. This one is definitely helpful when my antidepressants are not helping my depression enough. It is very relaxing and allows me to feel like I am helping to heal myself a little (if you have depression, you know how helpless you can feel at times). I use the guided imagery while lying in bed, then I use the affirmations portion while driving to work.Again, this CD is very helpful, but there are two things to be aware of. First, if you have several similar concerns (e.g., anxiety, depression, self-esteem problems, sleep problems) and you purchase these CDs, they will have very similar scripts. You may be able to just buy one and use it for several purposes. Don't expect a vast difference between the imagery for anxiety and depression, for example.Second, the reviewer who mentions the religious bent is correct, but this should only bother you if you are a strong atheist (God is only mentioned once at the very end of the affirmations portion)."},{"Title":"Health Journeys: For Anyone Concerned with General Wellness","review":"By far Belleruth's tapes are the best in applying guided imagery to health and healing.

Dr. Cathryn has such a wonderful way of writing, it almost feels like she is having a dialogue with you. I found that as I was reading, I would have a mental question, and low and behold, within the next section she would address it, just like she knew what I was thinking. Her advise is practical and realistic, and she presents it in a very non-judgemental way, which makes it very easy to read all of the different sections, even those that may not seem applicable (yet!).I originally bought the book to address sleep issues, but have been very pleased by all of the other issues she addresses. She provides very simple instructions to follow to correct this all too common problem. And they worked!!

Until I read Dr Tobin's book, I thought pressuring my daughter to stop thumbsucking would work. But Dr Tobin gave me a whole new way of looking at the situation. I realized it's my daughters way of comforting herself, and that until she felt ready to give it up, my pressuring her was not helping. As Dr Tobin says, \\"It's her thumb!\\" One day, I asked my little girl, \\"Do you want to stop sucking your thumb?\\" She said, \\"No daddy. I like my thumb, a lot.\\" So, I stopped playing the heavy. I don't know if it's a coincident or what...but once I backed off, my daughter virtually stopped sucking her thumb.

Each book in the series introduces a set of new vocabulary and uses it in different ways and orders throughout the book. Each volume lets readers improve on their previous reading level by maintaining a consistent theme and characters. They can feel that they are doing better with each passing page. It helps to make reading autonomous as students can progress at their own pace and build their knowledge as they go. A helpful table of vocabulary can help students and teachers alike to review and practice and monitor vocabulary building. The only criticisms I might make is that it is for beginners so don't expect it to last long and it is a little pricey to build the set. Young readers will rapidly progress beyond these books, but maybe that is success. An occasional return to the books will provide review and pleasure. I use it with young second language learners and it works well. Some other readers start at too high a level for older students who are tackling English for the first time. This series is not intimidating."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Tycho","review":"The Trouble with Tycho (1961) was the seventh book published by Simak. Weighing in at 115 pages, it is a novella rather than a novel.Like in many Simak books, the hero is not a King or Prince. Simak is uninterested in any game of thrones. Jackson is a small town boy on the moon, sent there by a syndicate of the businessmen from his home town and trying to make it rich. While on his normal business, he runs into Amelia in a broken down lunar vehicle. Amelia is on the moon trying to finish something that her brother started, and not getting very far in the process. Together they see a chance to finally make it big by venturing into the forbidden moon area known as Tycho.The novella is faster-paced than many Simak books. Ultimately, however, it has the same preoccupations and focus. I wish that I could have known Simak as a person. He wrote so many novels in his long career and in each and every one he ultimately reaffirms the choice to be human and to live.Simak fans will not be disappointed, although it is probably not the place to begin with Simak. Unfortunately, the Ace edition is full of editing errors."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Tycho","review":"Chris is a twenty-seven-year-old down-home boy who is trying to hit it rich on the moon as a prospector. He's just getting by however when he stumbles upon a disabled vehicle that has been hit by a meteorite that is/was being operated by Amelia Thompson, and is baking in the lunar sun. It turns out that Amelia's on her way to the fabled, legendary, and feared Tycho crater on a desperate attempt to make it big.The Tycho crater is considered cursed by those on the moon as it is a place where people have been known to have gone, but who then never come back. Realizing that his backers wouldn't wait forever for him to strike it big, he decides on a desperate gamble; to go with Amelia to Tycho. His fears are realized when he gets back to base and finds that his contract has been leased out to Chandler Brill by Chris' backers. Brill wants to do research on a particular form of native wildlife, and this will distract Chris from getting to Tycho and to get back and help Amelia. The story then becomes a wirewalk as Chris has to juggle his new charge and his trip to adventure. Then things go really wrong.Simak's fiction was changing by the time that he first wrote and published this. He was beginning to rack up accolades for some of his more insightful and mature fictions. He had already published the City series of stories, the novelsRing Around the SunandTime and Againand stories like 'The Big Front Yard', 'Crying Jag', and 'All The Traps Of Earth'. The upcoming sixties would be a golden age for Simak with the Hugo award winning novelsTime Is the Simplest Thing (Collier Nucleus Fantasy & Science Fiction)andWay Station,The Goblin ReservationandThe Werewolf Principle, the two novels that would grandfather in the modern urban fantasy movement, and the classicWhy Call Them Back From Heaven?.\\"The Trouble With Tycho\\" was originally published in Cele Goldsmith's October 1960 issue ofAmazing Stories, October 1960 with Complete Simak Novel *The Trouble With Tycho* (Volume 34, No. 10)an issue that sported a great cover by the great Alex Schomberg, and which would later turn up as part of an Ace Double with A. Bertram Chandler. This one hundred and fifteen page novella is more of a throwback to the more innocent, and linear plotted action stories that were the mainstay of pulps like \\"Thrilling Wonder Stories\\" and \\"Startling Stories\\". And with encampments with names like Coonskin and Hunkadory, I'm sure that this story had an influence on Larry Niven's \\"Known Space\\" stories.Simak was a professional newspaper man, like his fellow Wisconsinite writer Jack Olsen, and he had a deceptively intimate, unromantic, and matter-of-fact style that instantly puts you at ease, and that sucks you right into his stories. However, if you're expecting something as good as the previously mentioned stories you'll be disappointed. This is a fast-paced adventure, full of likable characters, action, mystery, romance, and alien close encounters and landscapes. Not Simak's best, but it is a lot of fun, and a good throwback to the fictions of the forties. If you're unfamiliar with his stuff, and you like pulp fiction, this novella would be a good place to start. It would also make a good read for any young reader who's just starting to sample the science fiction genre. I can't help but think that this would make a good movie, but that probably won't happen. This review pertains to the 1976 Ace paperback with the great Michael Whelan cover."},{"Title":"The Trouble with Tycho","review":"Typical Clifford Simak work with a fast pace, lots of action, and interesting characters."},{"Title":"A Passion for Golf: The Best of Golf Writing","review":"I don't know, it could be just me but I think that they could have done a better job of keeping your attention.

Indeed, a very short introduction, with only a minimal evocation of maths background. But there is enough qualitative explanation so that you can understand the broad historical development. From the Caesar Cipher to a Simple Substitution Cipher to a Vigenere Square Cipher. Then, the text goes into modern ideas, all of which involve using computers to encrypt and decrypt. Notably the invention of the public key system. Truly quite different from all that preceded it.There is also a brief foray into quantum computing. Here, it is mostly conceptual; discussing the possible potential, since current implementations are very rudimentary. The text has no mention of man in the middle attacks and how to guard against these. Pity. Because while this is a very hard attack to perform, if it can done, then it is very hard to defend against. One of the promises of quantum computing is that it inherently offers a simple detection, based on quantum interference by the attacker."},{"Title":"Cryptography: A Very Short Introduction","review":"This book is good at first part, which provides the basic understanding on cryptography.

The authors are clearly knowledgeable but manage to make the information provided accessable to the beginner. There are simple examples to acquaint you with some of the principles of coding and breaking codes. This is a complex subject and some of the ideas will take you into deep water. There is an excellent bibliography that one can refer to for more technical details. The book would benefit from a glossary of acronyms as some of the terminology was hard to keep straight. There could have been a little less discussion of key management. Over all a very useful and informative book."},{"Title":"Being Positive: the Lives of Men and Women With Hiv","review":"A very good read for positive and negative people, although the research and interviews were done in America, it is all equally relevant to the Australian community and elsewhere in the world.

The author's growth from Calvin the grandson of a sharecropper and son of a hard-working but un-educated roofer to Dr. Mackie Phi Beta Kappa, tenured professor, and business entrepreneur is a veritable roadmap of success (especially for young black men). \\"A View from the Roof\\" provides its readers with the skills to accelerate their spiritual, educational, physical, and emotional growth. Dr. Mackie uses humorous and poignant anecdotes to drive his messages home. Every chapter ends with clearly enumerated steps to achieve any of a number of objectives from conquering fear, to accepting and inviting criticism, to becoming a master of your \\"craft.\\" Although Dr. Mackie has a PhD in mechanical engineering, the text does not read like an academic treatise. Instead, the reader flows from page-to-page effortlessly. I plan to purchase copies of \\"A View from the Roof\\" for all the young men I work with. I highly recommend this book for anyone with a desire to succeed or help others to achieve their goals."},{"Title":"A View from the Roof: Lessons for Life & Business","review":"Dr. Mackie recently spoke at the company for which I work, and I read his book prior to his presentation. The book is a collection of stories and wisdom from Dr. Mackie's father and his own experiences. It's refreshing to read about someone's authentic experiences. He doesn't paint his father as a saint or as an ideal role model but as a real, flawed human being, who was wise in the ways that matter.

Every young person should read this book."},{"Title":"A View from the Roof: Lessons for Life & Business","review":"In ten easily readable lessons, Dr. Calvin Mackie inspires his readers to achieve more than they dreamed possible. \\"A View from the Roof\\" provides as its subtitle promises, \\"Lessons for Life and Business\\". Through a series of powerful personal vignettes, Mackie tells how his father transformed what could have been a bleak childhood into a character developing adventure. Mackie reveals how to instill discipline and orchestrate personal and professional success.

I read a couple of poems in the bookstore and decided to buy this book. The powerfulness of her poetry and her insightfulness didn't hit me until I read through the entire book at home. Her language choice, use of imagery, intelligence and style are unique and refreshing. Her poems are neither vulgar nor profane. These poems will give you hours of quiet reflection or hours of debate with your friends. Do you think you understand what the poem is about? Re-read it again and pay careful attention to the title of the poem or the language used; you'll realize that you probably missed the full meaning of the poem the first time around. I cannot wait for her next book of poetry.

Alison, who died 18 years before the time of the play (Dec 31, 1899--incorrectly stated to be the last day of the century, which, if true, would mean that either the 19th century only had 99 years or that the first century only had 99 years, since there has never been a year 0) is a principal figure in the play. She apparently had love for a married man and did not succumb to it, in contrast to Elsa, the daughter of Mr. Stanhope, who is horrified by Elsa's action in contrast to Alison's and to his own. The play well deserves the Pulitzer it won, altho some of the dialogue would never appear in a play of today, I presume."},{"Title":"Learn Hungarian for English speakers;: Colloquial Hungarian,","review":"This a 1964 book, and not only are its examples somewhat out-of-date, but its typograpical layout is infuriatingly old-fashioned. Placing items in a sequence all on the same line makes for difficult reading, separating them with carriage returns would make for much better reading. The use of quote marks is frsutrating.That said, the teaching is supurb but fast-paced. Each chapter starts with a set of notes (each numbered, and the author makes extensive use of forward- and back-references to previous notes, which is really great), then a word-list, introducing new words and phrases, then a reading in Hungarian, a set of sentences to translate into Hungarian, and finally exercises. All exercises and reads have translations.And example of the quaility of the teaching is that is differentiates between you (singular) and you (plural) without the need to use those paranthesised suffixes: it uses thou and ye. Old-fashioned but remarkably effective.The notes are discrete units of grammar, presenting a single concept per note.The word list is absolutely wonderful, giving the word, but also its root and some other examples that make use of this root.For example, the intended entry is k&uuml;l&ouml;n&ouml;sen - especially. After this we see, in parentheses, the following:k&uuml;l&ouml;n - apart; k&uuml;l&ouml;n&ouml;s - singular; k&uuml;l - outer; k&uuml;lf&ouml;ld - foreign; f&ouml;ld - land.Also: mozi - cinema is the main entry. After this we see:mozg&oacute; kepek - moving pictures; mozog - move; k&eacute;p - picture; k&eacute;pvisel - represent; k&eacute;pes - able; k&eacute;pez - form.It also gives related words: e.g. after the entry for szerelem - love we see szerelmes - in love, szerelmes p&aacute;r - courting couple).It gives important notes about exeptions: after r&eacute;gi - old, we see &ouml;reg - old [man].When the use of a word is grammatically alien to the Englishman, this this noted: it is noted after the the word mellett that this is a post-, not preposition.The readings follow two friends, Mr Szab&oacute; and Mr Feh&eacute;r, during one's visit to see the other. The reading has a colloquial translation. The exercises are a series of statements and questions that must be translated into Hungarian.My complaints are as follows:The typesetting, as mentioned.The book is so old-fashioned that it omits the second person (you), and all conversations are held in the third person (he - the polite way to speak in Hungary), until very late in the book, when they are all thrown together (almost like an after-thought). I have never used this, every Hungarian I have spoken to uses the you form.The book's subtitle is \\"Colloquial Hungarian\\", and it is true to its word. However I would prefer if translation of the readings and exercises were NOT translated colloquially, but literally (with a gernal translation in parentheses). In my opinion it's more helpful to the learning of grammar to see the literal translation.It also omits to explain why a verbal partical splits from its root.It's a fast-paced book that is definitely not for a beginner, but for someone who's been learning for a few months. It's the most thorough book available."},{"Title":"Learn Hungarian for English speakers;: Colloquial Hungarian,","review":"This is an older text and not very lively.

He isn't a genius, but he's remarkably precocious for his age. I was asked to read books in this series because my brother requested that I write a book for my nephew for Christmas 2005. Frankly, the thought terrified me, as I've only written for older children and very mature, topical adult non-fiction.Reading this book brought me back to the delightful days of Encyclopedia Brown. As I've never been the most clever person in the world (another reason to be terrified to write a book like this - I'm not sure I could craft a credible mystery), I rarely figured things out before Encyclopedia Brown did.None of these children have the mental acuity that Brown did, but they all possess one indispensable character trait: perseverance.The story is well told, well illustrated, and fairly flawless in its execution. A famous author is invited to come to town for a book signing, but doesn't show up. As Dink, the central character in this story, received a letter from the author stating that \\"Short of being kidnapped, nothing will keep me from coming!\\", he is immediately suspicious - as all children would be - that the author was kidnapped. Within that letter is the first clue, and I'm embarassed to say that I missed it. In fact, I missed every single clue - although in my defense, I really wasn't trying to puzzle anything out. (That may be an excuse...)Ron Roy did a very good job of providing just the right amount of clues, the right amount of intrigue, and he peppered the story with characters that would be intriguing to children. I say - bravo! Job well done."},{"Title":"The Absent Author (A to Z Mysteries)","review":"Another of the great A to Z Mysteries.

In the first installment, the Absent Author, we meet the young team of accidental sleuths: the well read and thoughtful Dink (that's Donald David Duncan when his mother means business); neighbor Ruth Rose (who dresses in pink, utilizes keen powers of observation, and initiates the climactic discovery); and best friend Josh (whose appetite, comic relief, and quick thinking rounds out the team). Confronted with the disappearance of their favorite author (Wallis Wallace), the trio assembles clues, follows leads, and eventually unravels the mystery. Early readers will appreciate the young detectives' savvy in piecing together the seemingly complex puzzle. Parents and teachers will notice the author's skillful portrayal of young people's mature interaction with both their peers and a broad spectrum of adult characters. Author Roy lays a clear trail of clues, steadily reinforces key discoveries, and cleanly closes the circle in less than 90 pages (including a fair smattering of helpful black and white drawings). Fortunately, he also sprinkles humor throughout the dialogue that pleases both young and old readers. Parents frustrated by the counter-culture mentality that promotes Rugrats and South Park will appreciate that Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose respect adults (yet know when to question authority), speak clearly, read and think, care about others, and work together to achieve their goals -- it's refreshing for young readers to be exposed to inquisitive, well mannered role models. Try the Absent Author and, while you're at it, pick up the sequel, the Bald Bandit. My son is already clamoring for the Canary Caper, and I doubt we'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Absent Author (A to Z Mysteries)","review":"I wanted to get a beginner's chapter book for my almost 6-year-old daughter. I thought about Junie B. Jones or the Magic Tree House series, but I was turned off by Junie's poor grammar (or at least the author's attempt to make her sound like a \\"real\\" 6-year-old), and by the Magic Tree House's female character being \\"dreamy\\" while her brother was \\"logical\\". This book managed to avoid those caveats, while still being an entertaining read for my daughter. I wasn't sure at first if she could follow a chapter book on her own, with illustrations only appearing every 3 pages or so, so I read her the first two chapters last night. This morning, the first thing she reached for was that book. Instead of getting up and watching Saturday morning cartoons, she sat in bed, ate a banana, and finished her new book.

The only 'problem' is we are a bunch of readers in my house and my youngest frequently earns the title of 'contrary-boy' as he will specifically choose to do things his own way. I have (multiple times) feared he would balk at reading just to be different. Thankfully, it hasn't gotten that far but he does balk at reading a lot of the books his brother was interested in at the same age (Pokemon--no loss there, Magic Tree House, Boxcar Children etc). On the other hand, he will try some of the books his older brother will read NOW, like the Wimpy Kid books.In any case, trying to find a book series he will like, that are age appropriate, and he won't ignore because I'm too happy about it can be a challenge. No \\"hey look honey at the wonderful book isn't it great!!!\\". More the \\"eh, a book, I'll just leave it here and maybe you'll like it\\".Now, oddly enough, my older son declined reading the A to Z books--I can't remember if they were offered to him too early/too late, or he just didn't like them. I decided to give this one a try and my youngest absolutely adored it and finished it in one sitting.

Pyle uses the langauge of the times in a most beautiful and authentic way that sends a thrill through any book-lover and sets the scene for the thoroughly merry and enjoyable adventures of Robin Hood and his companions.This is no sad or tragic tale (for the most part, the epilogue is enough to draw tears)this story tells of the more lightsome side of medieval life.

There is a lot of fighting and drinking and singing, which was all part of the joy of reading it.

One will discover this book provides an ocean of emotions and entertainment. Some of the adventures you will laugh at because of the hilarious sly side to Robin Hood and his band of merry men. If you want hilarity and laughter this is an excellent book. Adventurous excursions are also plentiful in this book. Some may want blood and guts adventure but this book provides more of innocent adventures that include wit, charm, strategy, and deception.When considering this book one will encounter older English language. This though does not stop one from enjoying the adventures in each part. If you struggle with older English read for a couple of chapters and you will easily get the hang of it. Also older English provides more of a sensual and realistic feel to the story because this is a medieval tale. The wording puts you in that time frame.It contains some pictures to help the reader formulate an imaginative image of that time. Although if you are expecting a picture book this is not it. When comparing this to other books it is an enjoyable laid back story. I laughed in many parts because of Little John, Robin Hood, and other members of his group's funny comebacks with extreme wit.I highly recommend this book for various purposes. This book can be for children to adults. Read it parts not just chapters. Each part is a riveting tale in itself. It may seem slow in some parts but will pick up quite fast. At the end of the book you would wish the story would continue but to all things comes an end. Enjoy it and I am sure you would even want to re read in the future."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"This is a fine retelling of the Robin Hood story, with all the familar characters (Robin, Little John, Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet and the rest, minus Maid Marion). Pyle has done a great job of bringing together the many legends and writing a coherent tale with language that speaks to the old period, but is easily understandable by modern readers. Kids, and adults letting themselves be kids for a while, will enjoy Robin's bold adventures and narrow escapes, the triumph of good over evil (most of the time), and the happy flouting of authority. Adults may want to read these stories with younger kids, explaining what conditions were in those days. Without this, young readers may be puzzled why Robin was constantly stealing from, and harassing, the priests and authorities of the day. Discussion will prevent young readers from taking away the wrong message. Pyle gives some discussion, but perhaps not enough, to justify Robin's behavior."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"This is another book we like to make available whenever the grandkids come around.

The assignment was 1 chapter for the week but I finished it over the weekend. The look on my tutor's face when I told him I finished it is something I'll always treasure.Howard Pyle's book is the first book that I got lost in. The story sucked me in and Robin's adventures were my adventures. Oh and the language.... parent's don't worry about the old english - it's poetry and if your child has half a brain, they'll get used to it quick enough. The writing is pure magic and every child will wish he could feast in the woods of Sherwood with Robin and his merry men. I wanted friends like that...I wanted adventures like that... The last chapter moved me to tears and I distinctly remember closing the book with that last illustration burned into my heart...\\"Here lies...\\" I felt apart of something special and then went on to discover other great Robin Hood authors like Parke Godwin... which led me to the Arthurian legends... good times. This book is pure magic and I've reread it over the years saving it for my child. The bindings falling apart but I treat like a family heirloom.

That beloved volume has been around the world with me, and I still pull it off the shelf and read it at least once a year -- which makes at least 28 readings to date -- and it never grows stale. Pyle's use of archaic language somehow makes the tone more intimate, as if you are really there with him, wryly observing the comings and goings of a strangely innocent if somewhat brawl-happy breed of men. Tom Sawyer would have thrived in Pyle's Sherwood. Charming, lilting, engaging, he makes his characters come alive, and creates a tale adults and children will cherish together -- my young children and my agemate friends laugh aloud with me at yet another retelling of Little John's adventures as a barefoot friar. I drew tears from a college oral interpretation class with Robin's death scene. I fell in love with Robin and his men as a child, and was drawn from that to study history and linguistics.

He inlcudes them all, strong and courageous Little John, brave Will Scarlet, musical Allan a Dale, and sly as a fox, good ol' Friar Tuck. Howard Pyle includes all of the great adventures like the time when Robin Hood ran into Little John at the river. They ended up having a fight to see who could knock the other into the river first. They had to fight on a log that was spread across the river. He also includes Robin Hood winning the golden arrow in Nottingham's archery contest. The time after time that Robin Hood and his men out-smarted the sheriff and his men and the time after time that Robin Hood and his men manipulated those rich people into giving them money and the times that they stole it.I would recommend this book to anyone who first off loves to read, or whoever loves to read about Robin Hood and his Merry Men and anyone who likes action and adventure."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"We have read, watched, and listened to several versions of Robin Hood, as both my sons (7 and 5) are big fans. We have been able to enjoy these stories as a family. The narration speed of this version, however, is so fast that my husband and I can't relax and enjoy it, and my younger son can't understand it. I understand that it's adventure and that the speed of the narrator should reflect this, but this is just too fast. I was quite surprised, as we've listened to a lot of books on tape and have never had this problem before. After listening to only a few minutes I feel as if I'm going to get a headache.

This is the image you will get in the book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood.The main character Robin Hood is an English outlaw that is wanted by the Sheriff of Nottingham. He steals from the good and gives to the needy. This book tells of the many action packed adventures and describes how he escapes the sheriff's clutches.One of the many things that makes me keep turning the page is the amazing action. For example, on page 24 when Robin is locked in an epic battle with his future first hand man. Another example is when Robin sends one of his men to spy on the Sheriff but gets caught and Robin has to make a very daring rescue. Another reason I love this book, is the authors vivid description of how Robin cleverly tricks the tinker out of his warrant. The author also gives a step by step description of all the fights that occur in this book.In addition, this book has extremely detailed illustrations. For instance, on page 24 you can tell that Robin and Little John are both tired and happy. Another example of these beautiful drawings is on page113. You can see that Little John is hurt and jealous.In conclusion, to this book review I want you to know that this book is for people of all ages and any reader will enjoy it! This review by, Max Powers"},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"I thought this was a great book! It was exciting and made me want to come back for some more. The story was very easy to follow. I would read this book over and over again and still not get tired of it. I thought the plot was especially good. Though there were many different characters in the same spot at times, I thought that the large amount of characters gave this book a twist. This story in particular is very interesting and is sometimes comical. It is about Robin Hood and his group of Merry Men hiding in Sherwood Forest from the Sheriff of Nottingham.Whenever the sheriff sends someone into Sherwood Forest to catch Robin Hood, the man either ends up converted to the group of Merry Men or he ends up running out of the forest with arrows whizzing by his head.

The book is a story about a man named Robin. Robin was a woodsman with the best bow and arrow shot in the land. Robin was an outlaw to the sheriff, but a hero to the people of Sherwood Forest. Robin is a good man who steals money from the rich and means people and gives it all to the people who need it most. Throughout the story Robin faces many different conflicts. Walking through Sherwood Forest Robin bumped into very large who was known as Little John. Little John is a woodsman who is known for being very handy with a bow. Little John refused to let Robin pass, so they battled and sure enough Robin won. Little John and Robin become friends and battle the Sheriff and the nasty mean King together throughout the story. A ways into the story Robin gains more incentive to battle the king with Little John and his people. Robin wish's to win the heart of the most beautiful lady in the land, the princess. Overall I though this story taught good morals to the young. To not be greedy and give to those who need the most. This book has plenty of action in in so dont worry about trying to stay awake.

(Referring to Kindle edition).Howard Pyle was the first person in the modern era to collect all the Robin Hood ballads that had come down from the midieval era and put them into a modern format, structured as stories and so forth. Essentially every version of Robin Hood in the past century has drawn on Howard Pyle's Robin Hood as its major source, and reading this book is the best way to understand why the minor characters in (for example) Kevin Costner's \\"Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves\\" are named things like \\"Will Scarlet\\" or \\"Much the Miller's Son.\\"I was given this book to read as a child, and it was and still is one of my all-time favorites (although I always avoided reading the final chapter, which Pyle even warns his readers they may want to do). The elevated, pseudo-elizabethan style even helped me later on -- when I got to Shakespeare in school, the language was easy for me, because I'd been reading Howard Pyle since I was eight.The problem with this ebook version is that it doesn't contain the illustrations, though. And that's simply unforgivable. Howard Pyle is today better known as an illustrator than as a writer. He was the art teacher who taught people like Arthur Rackham and N.C. Wyeth. His illustrations are immensely rich and detailed, and as full of period accuracy and background research as his writing was. It's an unforgivable shame to miss them.Versions of this book can be found online free with illustrations. Don't bother with this version, as it doesn't have them. Reading this book without the illustrations is like taking an oscar-winning film and just listening to the sound with the screen blacked out. You can do it, but why?EDIT: There are now many Kindle versions of this book, all cross-linked so they share reviews. Currently at least, none of the free versions have illustrations; the 99-cent version marked \\"illustrated\\" does appear to have most of them, but severely cropped, without many of Pyle's marginalia and scrollwork."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"Who hasn't heard of Robin Hood and his merry band of outlaws in Sherwood Forest? In this book you meet them all - including the powerful Little John, courageous Will Scarlet, musical Allan a Dale, and sly Friar Tuck. Howard Pyle offers what is probably the most complete and best collection of Robin Hood tales. All the old favorites are included - Little John and his quarter-staff toppling Robin into the water, Robin winning the golden arrow at Nottingham's archery contest, and the Sheriff being outsmarted in numerous attempts to capture Robin. But these are just the tip of the iceberg - this book is chock-full of entertaining merry adventures.The medieval setting is portrayed beautifully, including the vast gulf between the upper and lower classes of society, the corruption and greed of the nobility, and the hypocrisy of the medieval Roman Catholic church where religion has degenerated to mere outward rituals. Even the language is somewhat antiquated, which initially seems tedious, but persevere because you will soon find that this an enjoyable and essential addition that heightens the heroic atmosphere of the story. But the medieval setting is not presented without a social commentary - Pyle shows that the unbalanced social structure inevitably resulted in the oppression of the poor and weak. It is left to Robin Hood and his men to take justice into their own hands, and fight nobly for the cause of the downtrodden. Such justice is accomplished in a questionable manner, because the notion of robbing the rich to help the poor implicitly endorses civil disobedience. But the more important theme of seeking justice and maintaining truth and right is in itself a noble one. With Robin Hood, we find ourselves wanting justice, and being prepared to make unselfish sacrifices in order to achieve it. When justice is done, it is actually the greed and corruption of the nobility that has led to its own destruction and ruin.But the real attraction of this gem are the enthralling exploits of Robin Hood and his band of merry men. Howard Pyle presents Sherwood Forest as a rather glamorous utopian world where feasting and song abound, where it is never winter, and where the ale rarely runs dry. Robin Hood clearly represents a form of hedonism, and in his company there is never a lack of action, adventure, or for that matter - ale. But it's not the beer that attracts us to Robin Hood, it's rather his bravado. There is no end to the accomplishments of muscles and mind, as he and his merry band outwit all comers by sheer physical skill in archery, wrestling, swordmanship, and quarter-staff combat, or by outsmarting them with deceit and disguise. To our delight, Robin's brawn and brains always come out on top at the end.Howard Pyle's collection of Robin Hood's merry adventures is a classic that is constantly entertaining and exciting - one that you'll want to own and read over and over!"},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"It pains me to read the reviews here by people who bought this book looking for the Disney fox. This is a legend, folklore, not fairy tale. It's closer to Beowulf than Beauty and the Beast. The language is fantastic, poetry! I read it first when I was very young, fourth grade maybe, but I enjoyed it then as much as I enjoy it now. The language is an obstacle for the first two pages, maybe three, but, after you acclimatize yourself to it, it creates a unique mood and atmosphere. This book is one of my all time favorites.

I wasn't too sure about it at the onset, but after a couple of chapters, I fell in love with the language and the silliness of the characters. It was like reading an intellectual comic book... I didn't feel like I was slumming and my time was well spent. I'd love to reread it (and I never do that) just to savor every sentence.It's amazing how contemporary Robin Hood is. The merry men are just a bunch of slackers (Robin included) who just want to drink ale and give somebody a good beating. It's the best non-violent violent book that you can find LOL..."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"In the late 1800s, an American author and illustrator named Howard Pyle collected many old ballads and legends of Robin Hood and edited the text into one cohesive novel. His collection was targeted towards the children of the day, and he included many illustrations in order to set the mood of Robin Hood and his band of merry men. Unfortunately this Kindle edition doesn't contain any illustrations! This is a major bummer, and I truly feel it detracts greatly from the experience of this book.Putting the illustration issue aside, The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood tells the story of folk hero and philanthropist Robin Hood, who famously robs from the rich to give back to the poor. We follow his adventures through confrontations with Little John and Friar Tuck, and his ongoing feud with the bad guy: Sheriff of Nottingham.These stories are classics, and as a result the prose is obviously not contemporary - it can be tough to follow at times. If you give this book to your kids, expect to do some translating. Here's a sentence from the first few pages of the book:\\"Now,\\" quoth Robin, \\"will I go too, for fain would I draw a string for the bright eyes of my lass and a butt of good October brewing.\\"In general the dialogue is more difficult to follow than the action. Now this writing isn't completely impenetrable, but I can see how it would be difficult for a youngster in 2010. It may even be tough for some adults! Just something to be aware of before you dive into this book.I still enjoy this book, but I have to admit that this lack of illustrations is a major blow. The price is right, and if you're into the classics - then you'll probably enjoy this book illustrations or not. Personally though, I'd pick up a version with the artwork."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"\\"This Townsend Library classic has been carefully edited to be more accessible to today's students.\\"...somehow I missed the description of this when I ordered this particular edition. It is entirely misleading for this book to claim to be written by \\"Howard Pyle\\" as it has been cut, slashed and dumbed down as to be almost unrecognizable. The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood is a beautifully written work, composed with beautiful language - that's how it should be read and enjoyed. It is not an easy read, but not every beautiful thing in life is supposed to be easy.If you're looking for a cliff notes version of the story, purchase this edition. If you're satified with the shell of a story, great, this is for you. If you're looking to purchase and enjoy \\"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood\\" by Howard Pyle this is absolutely not it."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"I only add to the many splendidly written reviews because I am surprised none of the reviews have mentioned the illustrations. I hope these editions still contain Pyle's original woodblock styled illustrations. Howard Pyle was first and foremost a great and renowned illustrator. He chose a woodblock print style for this book as well suited to the material, and the illustrations are detailed, well researched and evocative.The fake \\"medieval English\\" is extraordinarily well-done; it adds to the charm and period flavor while using the few archiac terms with such precision that anyone can infer their meanings, yet one would be at a loss how to replace them with modern terms. As to the thematic content of the book, much has been made of the heroic aspect, but I find just as appealing the comedic turn of the book. The epilogue is certainly heart-rending, the first writing ever to have drawn tears from my eyes (I believe I was nine), but there are many more other episodes that are truly and splendidly funny. Last, the key to Robin's success in Pyle's retelling of his exploits, as much as his skill with a bow and his wit, was that his initial reaction to any stranger or strange situation was friendliness and generousity."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"This is the best version of Robin Hood I have read. The dialogue is so authentic, and the stories may be read separately or simultaneously. Either way, the tales make one large story; the story of Robin Hood. The prologue doesn't ramble like some do, and it does well in explaining why Robin is outlawed. While the Sheriff is very serious and deadly, Robin tricks him so easily and merrily quick, but, like civil gentleman, makes sure not to over-annoy him.The illustrations are very detailed and authentic as well.From the back:The beloved adventures of Robin Hood come vividly to life in this wonderful illustrated version by Howard Pyle. Deep in Sherwood Forest, the legendary Robin Hood-the brave, good-humored outlaw- proves himself the best in England with his bow. Here are all the exciting tales of how Little John, Will Scarlet, Alan a Dale, and Friar Tuck joined his merry band of men...Robin Hood's breathtaking escapes from his arch enemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham...and one hilarious escapade after another, filled with quick action, scheming villains, and great surprises. Days of old bursting with pageantry, knights, and beautiful maidens return in a superb classic story.I also recommend the Story of King Arthur and his Knights by Howard Pyle. It's just as well written and illustrated."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"Seldom does one come across such a fresh, delightful storyteller as is Pyle. His use of language archaic even in his day brings a sense that perhaps Will Scathlock himself, &quot;as full of tales as an egg is of meat,&quot; sits at your shoulder reeling off his master's merry adventures. In these days of complicated plots and subplots, of heros beset as much by thier own angst as foes, this book shines as a gem of uncomplicated reading pleasure for all ages. Though some may feel the language too dense for younger readers, I would highly recommend Pyle to any parent. True, he/she may have to put up with a few &quot;I wot's&quot; and &quot;Marry, methinks,&quot; but this seems to me harmless enough, and though there is violence, there is also consequence and remorse. Finally, unlike some books for young reader, this book will probably find itself in the parent's hands as well"},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"Robin Hood is an adventurous, quick-acting book which changes emotions really quickly. Robin Hood is an archer who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. The Sheriff of Nottingham, along with Prince John, is plotting to take Robin Hood to jail and steal all of his money. Then there's Robin Hood's girlfriend, Maid Maiden, who loves Robin Hood and wants to marry him.I think it was a great book.

Having said that though I found that, after a couple of chapters, my translation moved from conscious to sub-conscious thought and the more I read the more that I really started to appreciate the book.What made this book really appealing to me was that it spawned countless other stories, books and movies over many decades and it was great to read the Authors original words which, in many cases, cast Robin Hood in a slightly less flattering light than he is typically portrayed in later media.A little bit of research on Wikipedia is highly reccomended if you are at all interested in how the Story of Robin Hood evolved.I reccommend this book, it's one of those books that make you feel better educated for having read it."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"As this is a classic I thought I'd have a read of it.

Many of the words are no longer used, so it was good that I had it in the Kindle which has a built in dictionary.Very entertaining.Special thanks to the folks who converted it to digital and to the folks at Amazon for letting us download it for free."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"Acutally, this is a book review and no place to stir up controversy as to which ebook reader you should be currently using. I have been a \\"Kindler\\" since the good old days of the all plastic K1, and my K2 reader has seen so much use the plastic case is about to come apart from all the drops and dings. I love Amazon and all things Kindle. The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood is no exception.I began reading this particular tale with the free Amazon download of The Adventures of Robin Hood (Note they took the Merry out) which I believe like all their free ebooks are simply ones made available thanks to project Gutenberg. While I was reading and getting my first impressions of the book, I wondered about other peoples impressions, and began to look at some reviews. I noticed one poor chap's complaint about how this book would never be the same as the original paper book since it lacked all those wonderful illustrations.Not sure if I believed him, I picked up this copy, which includes the \\"Merry\\" and illustrations to boot.And then I bought an iPad.I really don't want to make this about the iPad, but I have to. I wanted to read this ebook on the iPad (at least some of it) because it was new, and so I did, using the Kindle app. The problem is that this book contains many many many archaic references which I feel most people don't understand, but just choose to skip over. I can't stand that. I need to know what all these weird words mean, and not just chock it up to obsolete colloquialisms. The problem is that the Kindle app has no dictionary yet, even though it has promised one \\"soon\\" since it has been available for the iPad. Even the latest version still has no dictionary, but it did improve it a lot.So, that left me unsatisfied.So, I tried iBooks, and I found something startling. On iBooks, they have all those free Gutenberg titles that Amazon has. Only they have chapter indexes, while pretty much all the Amazon titles don't, which is so frustrating. And, this version, the Merry Adventures of Robin Hood comes complete with illustrations. And it is free. It seems like even the formatting is almost perfect (not true for free Gutenberg Kindle books), like they took time and made all the free books really look like paid books. The iBooks dictionary is very complete concerning archaic terms, and is a million times easier to use when looking up a word due to the touchscreen.Needless to say, I finished this book on iBooks, since I could find no reason to go back to Kindle or even the Kindle app until they improve it.***Spoilers***Well, until I read this book I never realized how totally fabricated the Robin Hood movies have been. Maid Marian plays such a minor role (I believe she was mentioned once) and Robin Hood doesn't split an arrow right down the middle, but a lot of the stories are familiar. Robin and his merry band in Lincoln green have a good time drinking beer and eating venison and squatting in the king's forest.The basic MO was to find a guy who had too much money (an arbitrary case by case decision), and then bring them back to camp, offer them a feast (roasted vension and beer generally, maybe some Malmsey) and then have them pay for it, usually by dividing up all their wealth into three parts; one part for the owner, one part for Robin's band, and one part for some sort of charity. When the band comes across a newcomer with a problem, but not too much money, they usually offer their assistance and in return, the newcomer usually joins the band. Sometimes they go on random trips out of boredom just to see what they come across, and other times, Robin sends his men on missions. Most of their time, however, seems to be spent making merry, practicing archery, swordplay, and quarterstaff...oh, and don't forget feasting and drinking beer.The Sherrif of Nottingham is charged by the king to arrest Robin, but his band of men, his warrior's prowess and his cleverness allow him to evade capture, although the Sherrif, being none to competant and his men being cowards certainly helped Robin's cause. Robin, basically having the most talented fighting force of his day is a law unto himself, and his law is to offer help to the helpless, and to procure funds from those overburdened with coin and redistribute the wealth.The book concludes with Robin's service to king Richard, eventually granting him the title of Earl of Huntington, with his best men given special duties, and other granted the titles of the king's rangers. Eventually, under a new king, Robin finally gets to return to Sherwood forest, and feels so homesick he gives up his title and stays. His band is temporarily reunited with his band for a last stand in the forest which is won, but the loss of life causes Robin to fall ill. Robin runs to a nunnery to find healing, only to be betrayed by someone he helped in the past. Before he dies he summons Little John, whose great strength gets him to Robin's side before he dies, and Robin shoots an arrow into the forest and asks to be bured where it lands. A tearful ending.In general, in this telling of the tale, the bad guys are generally high ranking memebers of the church, and this theme is continued by Robin being killed by a nun. This theme is an interesting one, as Robin and his band seem to promote ideas which would have seemd vulgar to the church at this time (but really not vulgar today).I would detract one star for some of the language which slows down the reading, and also the general lack of any romantic interests for any of the main characters.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"Being a fan of adventure fiction, I could not ignore this truly vintage tale. This is the story of many of the adventures of Robin Hood and his merry men. I must say, as usual, the movies can't hold a candle to the book. Hollywood has also chosen to ignore Robin Hood's attitude toward the church and clergy, which were important issues in his day. Written in the 18th century, it takes a little getting used to the language, but it quickly becomes part of the ambience as Robin Hood, Little John, Friar Tuck, and the scores of merry men began to charm me.Like all good storytellers, Pyle pulls us in with glamour first, making us fall for Robin Hood and his good, stout yeomen for their light spirits and good deeds, before showing us their darker side, taking us along while they rob the rich, after first seducing us with the laughter and free-flowing ale after the fact. The story reads like a fairy tale, with Robin Hood and the merry men doing a lot of lying around in the grass waxing merry when they aren't feasting and sucking down mass quantities of ale and good, stout March beer. Of course, given the times, everyone drank beer, ale, or wine nearly all the time. Why not? They walked everywhere.Naturally, Hollywood has also played up the romance angle between Robin Hood and Maid Marian, but in this book, Robin's lady love gets barely a mention. Females aren't totally left out, Queen Eleanor being an especially engaging character, but mostly these are stories of battles and games of skill played out by men, done with good humor that even had me laughing out loud.This book has stood the test of time and deserves respect for that, but it is also engaging even today. It was easy to transport myself to the English woods of the thirteenth century when life was simple and one could avoid the law simply by changing his clothes and adopting an alias. With some enigmatic actors and a script that stayed true to the book, this would make a wonderful movie to outshine all those other namby-pamby Robin Hoods. It would be fun to see these stories on the big screen with some quality talent. I guess, though, I will have to be content, as others have for centuries, with my imagination to see the vivid characters in this wonderful book in action."},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"I am a young writer but I still know that this book was a wonderful book and should be read by evertone who can get there hands on it. I must admit, I have not read any other books by Pyle, but from this one I think that it will be worth my whil to read them and find out if they were as good as this one was! So, if you are bored on a Saturday or Sunday aftern-noon, go see if your local library has this book and pick it up. You should be pleased with that decision!"},{"Title":"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (Golden illustrated classics)","review":"This story took place during the sixteen hundreds.

One of his best stichts, he tells us, is \\"The Board Room.\\" Our protagonist is also an alcoholic and snotty rich youth who appears to be rebelling against mom and dad by wooing a Catholic girl. But he eventually \\"loses her to Catholics\\" - his words. He doesn't see that his own self-center alcoholic butt might be part of the problem. By \\"Catholics\\" he means the tightly-knit culture of Catholics at this time in Germany. One could interpret this book as an anti-Catholic screed. I'm not sure what the point was in the author writing this book in Germany in 1963 so soon after German persecution of people of another religious faith. By calling this work an anti-Catholic novel, I mean the protagonist dislikes, criticizes, and makes fun of Catholic theology and religious customs, and even the dress of religious leaders. In a literary sense, it's a book with good characterization and it holds your attention despite the low level of plot."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"The book was in ok shape but very old looking. But then again, it was priced appropriately. Arrived very quickly."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"I am giving \\"The Clown\\" 3 stars, not because I didn't find that book to be good, but rather in comparison to other masterpieces I had a pleasure to read in the past (\\"Cairo Trilogy\\" by Naguib Mahfouz might be the example) so in that matter I agree that Nobel Prize for H.Boll was not fully deserved.For me this is simply good book with clever observations by the narrator of certain people in post-war German society, he had acquaintance with, as well as heart-capturing love story.Unfortunately I didn't find Boll's narrative to be on the highest level of linguistic beauty, but at the same time I enjoyed simplicity of his detailed observations and thoughts about surrounding reality, events and shredded memories from his past.Contrary to some other readers, I don't hold any sympathy for the main character of the book. I found Hans to be pathetic, self-pitying, unreliable and extremely immature human being, whose life-actions are mostly based on revolt against emotionally deprived, hypocritical family and social norms. He seems not to realize that decisions and acts in life have their consequences for which, as an adults we must be responsible, without accusing the others. Narrator's critique of the catholic group is rather poorly validated. I had a problem to find any particular faults with above, except maybe refusal of financial support for Hans, but at the same time, no one in its right mind (regardless of religion) is going to give any money to young, irresponsible, heavy drinker with wealthy family ties.Contrary to the common reviews of \\"The Clown\\", I didn't find this book to be a good analysis of the post-war German society, since it is populated with very limited circle of people, but rather psychological dissection of twisted, individual relationship with love, friends and toxic, emotionally abnormal parents."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"If your looking for a sad book...well you've found it. The book falshes from past to present with a hint of our furture. Boll takes the reader on an emotionle suicide. The character(the clown) faces problems with the world, his parents and himself. I say this book is a must read for any reader."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"I sure do agree that Boell is a witty author. Yet I believe that the characterizations in this entertainig novel are constructed somewhat too weak to leave a remaining impression and render it more absorbing."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"This book is a little strange, Heinrich B&ouml;ll seems to me to be a somewhat strange man. Anyway the book is about the nazis, the cathologic religion and love. The main character Hans seems to always be in conflict with everyone. But he is quite outspoken, for one example he is playing with some Hitler jugend in nazi Germany and then he exclaimingly call them nazi-swine! Now that's kind of bold isn't it? This book reminded me about some of the works by Georges Bataille, in it's irrational selfdestructiveness."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"This book purports to be about West Germany after Hitler. I had expected to see a detailed and devastating critique of the hypocrisy, hollow reconciliation, and reconstructed memories of the past that were common in Germany after 1945. While these themes do appear in \\"The Clown,\\" this novel is really about Catholicism (or specifically German Catholicism in the 1950s)The main character spends most of his time recalling his life with his Catholic ex-lover, Marie, and/or harping upon her sanctimonious circle of Catholic intellectual friends. One could easily gain the impression that this book is steeped in anti-Catholic invective. However, it is important to know that the invective, such as it is, is directed against a very specific stratum of postwar German society: the politically conservative and politically active, wealthy, pro-industrial, Catholic, moralist elite of the Rhineland in the 1950s and 1960s. As a result of its highly specific milieu, it is even hard to make generalizations about the state of society in all of West Germany after World War II.Not all of West Germany was Bonn. Not all of West Germany's elites were Catholic. And the extreme emphasis on Catholicism obscures what could have been a damning critique of Germany's failure to face its past honestly and to engage in sincere reconciliation with Hitler's victims. Instead, \\"The Clown\\" seems to be a strident critique of Boll's own religious and social environment."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"Boell unmasks the empty form of class society. The figure of the clown who stands desperately alone with his true feelings and ideas against a Catholic society which takes him away his love, Marie, is the greatest story I have ever read. The original German title was &quot;Opinions of a clown&quot;. You will read this more than once."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"One of the finest books of the superb Boll, the Clown is a demonstration work. Superbly mixing pathos and humor, the bittersweet life of Boll's narrator - this is a work told in the 1st person - shows off a master writer's craftsmanship as his tragic character attempts to hold his life together. The narrator's omnipresent self-doubt dominates his every thought and act: human vulnerability is probably as well captured here as anywhere in fiction - the hero attempts to survive through dogged determination to hold on to his skills and pits his fading artistic persona against the edginess of ever present failure and ultimate collapse. Following the narrator as he runs through his routines over and over again the reader comes as close as possible to the alternate universe of the clown.A memorable book!"},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"(I'll qualify that this is more of a recommendation than a review.)Stumbled upon Heinrich Boll while reviewing past winners/laureates of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Curious that I had not heard of him...Where to start with such a novel? Boll captures much in this short book.While this novel is certainly a social critique; it is less an ATTACK on society (religion, capitalism, etc) and more of a resigned discussion of society's absurdity.Just read it."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"This book exudes sadness and pain from the first line until the last. The most strong portrayal of what occurs when society takes form over substance, and how choosing the latter to live your life will not make you immune to having your heart broken and being misunderstood. Actually the most probable outcome is that you will end up being beaten since most humans hate to have a mirror place in from of them if it can show them how they really are.Heinrich Schier has been abandoned by his &quot;wife&quot; actually she was your living with him, but the fact that during some time he did not want to marry through a catholic ceremony, plus his deeply ingrained rejection of double standards, sends his life spinning down, to a place were he does not know upon which values he can reconstruct his life."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"Heinrich Boell's \\"Ansichten eines Clowns\\" is a fresco of postwar Germany, a very different landscape than today's. Boell's generation were tortured by remorse - and justly so; remorse humanized them. This is a novel about pain, loss and ethics: individual ethics and collective ethics; about how Hans remains faithful to his beliefs to the bitter end, about how Marie takes the path that she has to take. Together with Guenter Grass's \\"The Tin Drum\\" (published four years earlier), the \\"Clown\\" is the greatest novel of the Erhard period."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"I have read several other reviews, and I had a different take on this book. To me, the book is first and foremost a romance, a tale of lost love, like The Great Gatsby or Lolita. Like both those novels it shows the flaw of devoting your entire life to one romantic love, because no relationship is perfect, but perfect romance demands nothing less. In all three books the heroes find out what happens if, like in the T. S. Eliott poem, the woman says, \\"That is not it, at all.\\"Meanwhile, the side issues of his profession, his relationship with his family, and the society around him are brilliantly and imaginatively illustrated, with many great details. He calls his mother and his attitude towards her changes when she answers the telephone in her \\"comittee voice\\". Our hero's powerful imagination allows him to smell things over the phone. The book is full of a thousand great details like that, and a dozen wonderful characters, kind and cruel, all of them real, and great comments on professionalism and family and life. I think people make too much of the setting in post world war II Germany, frankly, the same way that they say The Great Gatsby is about the roaring 20's. The story is a romance told so brilliantly that it highlights and makes comments on the setting, but the story is about the romance, and love, and it is a great book."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"Some friends recommended this book to me. I started reading without having any expectation about it. But the book really surprised me. All of us go through this crisis moment at sometime in our life. But the way in which he is going through his life till that point and his final decision is so natural. You dont' feel like some things are happening because the author wanted it, rather everything is so as that is the natural way for them to happen."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"The Clown is a thought provoking novel, dealing with powerful themes. On the surface this is the story of Hans Schneir, moderately successful clown, who's long time girlfriend has recently left him. Intertwined with this story are reminiscences of Hans' past, reveling his hatred of his mother, the political elite of post-war West Germany, and the Catholic Church. With sharp humor Boll eviscerates these hypocrites, who, while today proclaim they fight for tolerance and reconciliation, are the same people who only yesterday fought to cleanse the German soil of the Jewish infestation. But as we come to know Hans Schneir more and more intimately we begin to wonder if we can trust his assessment. It becomes obvious that Hans' hatred is wrapped up in his own personal loss, and even more obvious that Hans is incapable of taking responsibility for his own failures, instead casting blame on all those around him. There can be no doubt that the hypocrisies Hans loathes are real, but are they the true origin of his disdain? Is his hatred of Catholicism justified by a domineering Church which he see as forcing its values on society as a whole, or is it the same kind of reactionary hatred which led to the rise of Hitler and National Socialism? Perhaps it's both. And that's the beauty of Boll's masterpiece"},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"The Clown is one of the most amazing books I've read, and definitely my favourite this year. The novel is written in a style that along with being deeply painful, is strikingly intelligent and humorous. The inability of the young man to fit in with his own society, an outcast and the helplessness of a nonbeliever in love with a devout, of a child who has lost his sister to the war, are the themes dealt with in the novel. About post-war Germany, it seems that the author has a lot to say - the country struggling to find a new identity, Nazi-guilt, religion and post-War German consciousness.I have heard people mention that the scope of the book is too narrow, the intended audience and the people who can relate to it. But doesn't everyone have something they are/should be guilty about, every person and every country? Someone they have lost and the whole question of religion. I think, when put in to the right context, the book can be about any society, about any of us. It's a must read and I see myself re-reading this book many times!"},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"I took this book thinking I would find a mad clown criticizing everything around him. I don't know why this idea. But I found a story of a person whose life is breaking in pieces. He has been abandoned by his girlfriend to marry another guy, this is his current pain in the story, but you can see also the wound left by his dead sister, the hate for his stupid stupid mother and the hole he is falling in, searching for someone to borrow money from. From the beginning I had the sensation Hans was an middle age man, when he really is 27 years old.I don't know if is just how I perceived the character, or the writer tried to give Hans that characteristic, or he failed to give us a correct 27 year old young man. the fact is that the world he lives in looks in decadence, as if everything is collapsing, the whole city, the whole world; it looks he's about to suicide for the lack of reasons to stay here. He has nothing and he does not know how to get up, nor even seems to want to get up. It's a sad story of a person who at the end, has virtually no one to cry with, or to be supported by."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"This book captures magnificently the feeling of being down and out and rootless. It is set specifically in post World War II Germany and describes well what surely were the feelings of many. But the sense of loss, alienation, lack of love, religious doubt set forth in the book go much deeper than that.The book is told first person by its hero, a clown, Hans Schneir, who has enjoyed some success but has fallen to the state of pennilessness and drink after abanonment by his love, Marie, and an injury. The stuff of which romantic novels are made, but also the stuff of realism and symbolism too. Hans is from a wealthy but emotionally impoverished family who establishes a romantic liason with Marie, a young promising student who abandons her studies for him. She in turn ultimately leaves him based in part on her attachment to Catholicism. Schnier is an unbeliever but a&quot;monogamous&quot; unbeliever and can't adjust himself to the loss of Marie. He looks to friends, family, and others for comfort but finds none. Schneir says near the end of the book in an important passage &quot;If our era deserves a name it would have to be called the era of prostitution. People are being accustomed to the vocabulary of whores.&quot; This theme is pervasive to the book together with hints about a way out. For example, in the course of a pivotal discussion between Schneir and his father Schneir alludes to and rejects the possibility that he must &quot;lose [his] soul -- be totally empty, then I can afford to have one again.&quot;The book is full of flashbacks from the narrators part interspersed with his reflections on his current actitivies and situation. His thought center on his own spiritual and emotional poverty, on the loss of Marie, his ambivalence towards religion, and the attempted change among Germans following their defeat. In some ways, the book and its end remind me of Schubert's great song cycle, Die Winterreise. The translation seems to me not of the best but it serves to convey the book. This novel is thoughtful, moving and worth reading."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"Heinrich Boll's 'The Clown'is an impassioned, tragic, poetic fable of innocence and purity in a world of hypocrisy and double-dealing inhumanity. The Clown is a hugely life-like figure; his pain bleeds through the paper, his tears smear the words. He is an artist, destroyed by loss and betrayal, an artist who has reached the lowest point of his existence and now despairs in the knowledge of his own pathetic tragedy.He phones for help or consolation as he huddles in his terra cotta apartment, swelling with nausea, a bruised knee, a headache, and a broken heart. He tilts back his cognac and sucks on a drooping cigarette, brooding over his loss, and trying to distinguish between fact and fiction, reality and his own frantic imagination.'The Clown' is brilliant social commentary; philisophically aware, lucid prose- it exposes the heart of post-war German schizophrenia, delving into the dogma and denial which plagued the nation, infecting it with a warped sense of itself. It is a tragedy of heart-rending pain; the clown's mask cracks and a tear carves a furrow through the white flakey paint. His coffee spills on his slippers amd he clutches his knee, his hands shaking in loneliness."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"Rash as it is to say this is the finest novel I've ever read. It is Catcher in the Rye for adults and it's depth of feeling is unsurpassed. Boll is a magnificent writer and translation in no way diminishes his gifts. The creativity, an example would be Schnier's ability to smell odors through the phone, is remarkable. I couldn't put it down either the first or the second time that I read it. Yes, it is depressing, but there is much joy in it and it gives a reader a tremendous opportunity to reflect on the realities of his or her own life. I could not recommend a book more highly."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"The Clown is a very fast-moving story told in the first person by Hans Schneir, who is a clown. Hans is a delighful character, incisively cynical about the &quot;new&quot; Germany and its transparently selfish citizens in a way that leaves you more amused than depressed. Boll's attention to the fine details of life make the book specially fascinating, because they make Hans (and the other characters) so believable it's as though you are right there, watching them. The book is a fantastic voyage into another person's despair, where humor, shameless honesty and hopelessness rub elbows as they do in reality. I have just finished The Clown, but I am not ready to shelve it. There's too much that I love about it."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"This is one of those rare books I come back to again and again: beautifully and unpretentiously written, and honest to the core. It is a biting critique not only of postwar German society, but of hypocrisy in general (religious, romantic, and otherwise). It made me cry and it made me laugh; I can offer a book no higher praise.I am not normally a big believer in fate. But as it happens, I first read this book after finding it on top of an abandoned car during a rainstorm. I'd just been dumped by a longtime girlfriend under circumstances not too dissimilar to those of Hans Schnier. I won't say the book saved my life, but it made me feel a lot less alone in the world."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"As &quot;Billards at Half-Past Nine&quot; is a brilliant social commentary in a personal setting, &quot;The Clown&quot; is a brilliant personal commentary and heart-wrenching lament in the context of a critical new German society. Hans Schnier is a pathetic, hearbroken clown, whose poverty consists of a bankrupt heart. By the end of the novel, his only choice is to sit on the curb and strum his guitar for change. Boell crafts an image of a man willing to do anything for love, and is suspicious and afraid of the world around him after his personal world collapses. In lines such as &quot;Think of the clown who weeps in the bath, and whose coffee drips onto his slippers,&quot; Boell reveals his mastery of capturing the human spirit through poignant narrative, aided greatly by Leila Vennewitz' brilliant translation. This is a must-read for anyone who knows Boell or has any concept of love and the human spirit."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"I read this book years ago (on a plane ride) and it has stayed with me as few other books have. It cuts to the heart of something that is wrong with our culture, maybe with all of our civilization; specifically, I mean the habitual hypocrisy and the over-riding need to self-rationalize. Of course, this theme has been treated before, but I have never seen it done with the simplicity and eloquence with which it is done here.The story is perfect somehow: a woman leaves her husband, a decent man (the narrator), for someone who is more powerful within the Catholic Church, the same Church that ostensibly preaches \\"blessed are those who are meek for they shall inherit the earth.\\" By focusing on these smaller acts of injustice and hypocrisy (rather than on the overwhelming horrors of Nazi Germany), Boll brings what happened in Germany into a focus that I had never seen before.When I hear George Bush talk about \\"spreading freedom\\" while suppressing democracy at home or condemn \\"evil doers\\" while condoning torture, I think of this book. It captures the emptiness at the heart of the mealy-mouthed pieties that afflict our civilization with a economy and grace that is unique."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"Heinrich B&ouml;ll (1917-1985) was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972. I have the impression that he is one of the more deprecated Nobel laureates, one of those most frequently cited as undeserving. I believe, however, that he can stand with the last three Prize winners (Lessing, Le Cl&eacute;zio, and Mller). I also think that THE CLOWN, though not great literature, is worthy of a Nobel laureate.The narrator is Hans Schnier. He introduces himself as follows: \\"I am a clown, official description: comedian, no church affiliation, twenty-seven years old * * *.\\" (That is as straightforward as his narration ever is.) Hans is the estranged son of a wealthy German family. As WWII came to an end, his parents sent off his older sister Henrietta, then 16 years old, to join an anti-aircraft crew; she never returned. About age 20, Hans ran off with Marie, who came from a working-class background. Hans refused to marry Marie, in large part because she wanted to be married in the Catholic Church and he could not bring himself to guarantee that their children would be raised Catholic. For about six years they traveled from city to city in Germany as Hans plied his trade as a mime or clown. As the novel begins, Marie has left Hans, he has taken to drink, he has allowed his performances to deteriorate to the point that he has become the laughingstock of the critics, and he has returned to his hometown of Bonn, flat broke. The novel consists of a compressed time frame of one evening as Hans phones around to family and acquaintances trying to raise some money, interspersed with flashbacks to moments from the past and with Hans's frequent diatribes.One of the themes in THE CLOWN, which was published in 1963, has to do with the repression of the Nazi past in then-contemporary German politics and society. For example, when Hans calls home, the phone is answered by his mother, who had been a staunch supporter of the Nazis, willingly sending her daughter to help defend the Reich. Now she answers the phone, \\"Executive Committee of the Societies for the Reconciliation of Racial Differences.\\" Hans is offended, and asks to speak to her daughter (the long-missing Henrietta). His mother responds, \\"I suppose you can never forget that, can you?\\" Hans replies: \\"Forget? Ought I to, Mother?\\" Hans/B&ouml;ll cannot forget the Nazis and what they did, both large and small. Meanwhile, many other former Nazi supporters are now being lauded as champions of liberal democracy. For B&ouml;ll, this was a familiar theme, a hobbyhorse of sorts, and my guess is that it was primarily due to this motif in his writings that B&ouml;ll was deemed politically worthy of the Nobel Prize.But the more prominent theme of THE CLOWN has to do with the institutionalization of morality. This theme is played out primarily in the context of a group of earnest Catholic activists, who, at least as Hans sees matters, scuttled his union with Marie. They brainwashed Marie with \\"metaphysical horrors\\" and \\"principles of order,\\" so that she finally turned away from Hans to take up with another earnest Catholic, Heribert Zpfner. Hans then sees himself as \\"a kind of opposite number to Henry the Eighth: he had been polygamous and a believer, I was monogamous and an unbeliever.\\" B&ouml;ll's critique of the \\"liberal\\" German branch of the Catholic Church is scathing. More broadly, his target is people who adopt the values and morals of an institutional group, whether religious or political in nature, rather than exercise their own personal conscience.And there is more. For instance, through the figure of Hans's father B&ouml;ll has much to say about the absurdities and inherent immorality of capitalism and the acquisition of wealth for its own sake. THE CLOWN is a fecund and provocative novel. What complicates it, and paradoxically rescues it from becoming some sort of screed, is its unreliable narrator.I first read the novel about 35 years ago. I find it still worth reading, despite its being addressed to strains of society prevalent in 1960's West Germany. Indeed, it is not difficult to find in today's United States analogous movements to institutionalize morality and to revise, or sanitize, history. (Note: I understand that in 1985 B&ouml;ll wrote an epilogue to THE CLOWN. My copy of the book was published in 1971, so I have not read B&ouml;ll's epilogue.)"},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"I made that word up, in the honorable German tradition of patching words together as if they thus existed as a single entity, a 'Ding an sich.' The three component words are: War Hypocrisy Accusation. If I've understood this furious book correctly, that's what it amounts to. I read it in German - Ansichten eines Clowns - in a yellowed old paperback that's been waiting for my attention for at least twenty years, but B&ouml;ll's writing style is blunt and I'm sure it would be just as blunt in an English translation.Clowns, dwarfs, agoraphobic pianists, incarcerated juvenile sociopaths: the first-person narrators of German novelists of the post-war generation have a lot in common, which is to say, their anomie. In B&ouml;ll's version, Hans Schnier is the clown, and an embittered alienated vengeful Pagliacci he is! Most of his bitterness is directed at two targets: his wealthy family and their circle of war-cronies now eluding the truth about themselves, and the German Catholic 'hypocrites' who have so willingly exploited the post-war blend of economic recovery and spiritual depression. Hans's non-ritualized marriage has failed; his Marie has run away with a prominent Catholic figure. Hans has taken to booze. Most of the narration depicts him moping in his empty apartment in Bonn, calling his old friends and relations to ask for help in conversations that inevitably dissolve into accusations and confrontations. Hans himself is the only real character in his narration; all the others are seen by the reader only through Hans's bloodshot eyes, yet all of them have the sort of ugly plausibility of faces in a painting by Max Beckmann. One might expect such a story to end with suicide, as Hans's recollections of his earlier life become more and more fragmented and frenzied. In short, this is not a cozy novel to read at the beach, in any language.It's interesting, in a grim way, to note that current American fiction has turned to narration by characters who are outsiders: autistic, demented, of limited intelligence, drugged, defiled in one way or another. Shall I invent another German compound word? How about \\"Selbstgerechtschuldgef&uuml;hlanklage\\"? (PS: see correction in comments below. \\"Selbstgerechtigkeitsschuldgef&uuml;hlanklage mit Schlag, bitte!)Many of my German acquaintances are skeptical of Heinrich B&ouml;ll, and I wonder why. Possibly it's the danger of being awarded the Nobel Prize, and being perceived as not quite worthy of it. Certainly German Catholics must feel viciously targeted by this novel, though it's fair to say that the Clown is just as contemptuous of other faiths, including Leftism, as of Catholicism. There's a nasty negativity in this book that anyone might prefer to reject, although it's devastatingly justified. I'd love to hear other reactions to this book, especially from German readers.Americans! If this review prompts you to read Heinrich B&ouml;ll, one thing I'll request of you: don't read The Clown as simply a depiction of the anxieties of post-war German society. Take it to heart. Like a performance of Hamlet in modern clothing, The Clown could easily be rewritten as a contemporary tragedy."},{"Title":"The Clown","review":"A grim post-war novel abounding in fatalism, doubt, sarcasm, loss and survival, Heinrich Boll's exploration is a true literary masterpiece that could make one almost wince in its no-holds-bar truth offering. The life of Hans Schneir, a down-on-his-luck, melancholy, incisive clown could represent any human life after surviving and living the day-to-day economic and emotional traumas hatched by war and the idiocy of policy that brings it about. What is normalcy after war? In most cases it is the love of a future wife and the co-creation of a family, for when one is in a war-and for survival sake-must sometimes end a human life, it is natural that the desire afterwards would be to help bring about life, as well as the beauty surrounding it. But for Hans Schneir, that is not the case, for he is encased in a cocoon of soulful hardness, an all encompassing iciness of mistrust, cynicism and destroyed ideals. Whereever he looks, he sees people manipulated by guilt, best exemplified by his mother, a former Nazi sympathizer who ultimately evolves into a kind of champagne activist while serving as president of the Executive Committee of the Societies for the Reconciliation of Racial Differences. He sees people who can not deal or cope or who are wounded with life, as is the case with his brother, Leo, who converts to Catholicism and then enters and is ultimately stashed in a seminary. All the time while German citizens flounder in their varied emotional states, Hans has two things which keep him stable, his unbending emotional hardness and his lover, Maria, who, as well, drifts away from him while gradually embracing the ideals of a Catholic neophyte named Zupfner. Hans Schneir's resolute closeness versus Maria's relentless openness casus the two to clash in many ways. Where he sees hypocracy and weakness, she sees Truth and possibility. Yet, to Hans, that is exactly what she is supposed to see and fall into, another trapping created by man to make a big power machine (the Church) even bigger. Thus he loses her, and she becomes the \\"first lady\\" of German Catholicism-Pg. 176. As all that Hans holds near and dear to him slowly drift away, the one thing that he clasps onto is his art, the talent of pantomime, whereby he immitates those in his environment: politicians, religious leaders, people who use other people and institutions merely in order to feel a sense of worth. But as he acts out the truths that he sees yet things that people do not wish to see, he even fails at his art, for who wants to see a sad clown? In the end, he struggles along, fighting to incorporate snippets of hard truth into his life, truth that nobody wants. Heinrich Boll is indeed the grand master of exploring the harsh truth of human behavior and how humanity uses a veneer of politics and God in order to not confront itself."},{"Title":"Language of love: The personal odyssey of a deaf gay man (Rain City Projects)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this play.First of all, I applaud that there was a play written about a Deaf gay man's search for love, which was unheard or unexplored in 1993 and prior. In \\"Language of Love\\", Albert Rose is a Deaf Jew who grew up with his Deaf parents and a hearing grandmother. His parents have been pressuring him to settle down, have a family, and have a stable career.Unknown to the family, he meets Peter, a black gay doctor. As their relationship develops, several issues arise, such as coming out, communication barriers, interracial relationships, gossips, and familial expectations.However, I was concerned about a few things. I compare this play to Medoff's \\"Children of the Lesser God\\" play. As a former actor in \\"Children of the Lesser God\\" at a community college, I see the Language of Love as a somewhat gay version of Children of the Lesser God. Both address Deaf/hearing relationships, love, and communication barriers.First off, in the beginning, there is a description of how the stage should be set. It bothers me that both Language of Love and Children of the Lesser God do not involve props but rather black background and \\"modular props\\", such as boxes that function as walls, seats, and other furniture.Secondly, both plays use shadow characters. These characters sign and/or voice for the main characters. Real Deaf actors may not be able to articulate clearly. Real hearing actors may not know ASL (American Sign Language). Therefore, shadow actors/characters are used in the play. The problem is that shadow actors/characters can be utterly confusing for the audience, both Deaf and hearing. In Language of Love, the shadow characters would be more confusing because they're given additional lines that are separate from the main characters.Thirdly, all relationships are hard work. Deaf/hearing relationships are unique and have their own share of challenges. However, the message in both plays seem to be that Deaf/hearing relationships do not work because they cannot understand each other's language and world view.Language of Love was about a Deaf gay Jew's journey in love, relationships, identity, coming out, and self-worth."},{"Title":"The Miracle of The Sacred Scroll: A Novel Hope and Inspiration","review":"This was such a powerful book!

However, until fairly recently most of what we know about the second and third generation of Christians came to us through the writings of the subsequent generations, and there was very little interest in finding out what the \\"Apostolic Fathers\\" had to say in their own right. The last couple of centuries have seen reemergence of interest in these early writings, and today the interest in the early Church is perhaps at a long term high.\\"Early Christian Writings\\" is a remarkable collection of several works by the prominent and well-known Apostolic Fathers: Clement of Rome, Polycarp, Ignatius of Antioch, etc. We discover that the faith and the themes that these writings represented were indeed a product of orthodox Christian thought, and easily reconcilable with both our own theological understanding and the New Testament writings. The writings bear all the signatures of the tumultuous times during which they were written. This manifests itself by the choice of themes: preparation and expectation of martyrdom, issues of church discipline and strife, organizational matters and the episcopal nature of the Church, and attitudes towards immoral behaviors that are prevalent in the pagan world. The writings are very inspiring and well worth reading.I am not familiar enough with the original language(s) in which these works were written to give any meaningful comment on their translation. However, I do have some serious issues with the Kindle edition of this book. It seems that the book was re-formatted for the electronic edition using some kind of OCR software: there are many silly errors and mistakes, which are clearly the results of improper optical scanning. (My favorite one was the recurring reference to the \\"Spirit of the Lard.\\" [sic.])Aside from the obvious historical and theological value, this slender tome is of particular relevance for the Christians in the modern world. We live in the age that is increasingly hostile to the Christian thought and ethics, and it can be tempting to give in to despair or adopt a siege mentality and withdraw from the world entirely. However, it is important to remember that the early Church faced a very similar set of circumstances, and the lesson from that era are incredibly relevant for the situations that we find ourselves in today. For that reason alone this book carries incredible value for all practicing and thoughtful Christians who want to have their voices heard in the contemporary society."},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"The book came in a timely fashion.

This would make a excellent addition to the library of anyone interested in early Christianity.The texts included in this volume are 1 Clement; the 7 epistles of Ignatius to the Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, Smyrnaeans, and Polycarp; the epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians; the Martyrdom of Polycarp; the Epistle to Diognetus; the Epistle of Barnabas (despite what one of the previous reviewers says, it's included in this volume); and the Didache.Conspicuously absent are the Shepherd of Hermas and the fragments of Papias. Both have usually been considered Apostolic Fathers, and I am a little baffled at their omission.Other recommended Penguin Classics: &quot;The Jewish War&quot; by Josephus, &quot;The History of the Church&quot; by Eusebius."},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"Early Christian Writings is an excellent collection of the works of the Post-Apostolic Church Fathers. It is for anyone looking for literature that opens a window into the Post-Apostolic Early Church. The epistles included are The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians; The Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, Smyrnaeans, and to Polycarp; The Epistles of Polycarp to the Philippians; along with the Epistles to Diognetus and Barnabas. The book also includes the Didache and the martyrdom of Polycarp. For some reason Louth did not include the Shepherd of Hermas and the fragments of Papias, though he does mention them as being part of Cotelier's collection of writings by the Church Fathers.If you are interested in the writings of the Church Fathers, and have never read such a collection, you can have some enjoyable and moving reading ahead of you. In reference to his pending martyrdom Ignatius writes, \\"I am His (God's) wheat, ground fine by the lions' teeth to be made purest bread for Christ\\" (Romans 4). He also says, \\"To die in Jesus Christ is better than to be monarch of earth's widest bounds. He who dies for us is all I seek; He who rose again for us is my whole desire\\" (Romans 6). The Epistle to Diognetus contains a vivid and compelling description of the early Christians. The second half of the Didache is full of interesting guidelines and instructions to the early believers on such things as baptism and fasting. Louth includes some good commentary about the fascinating account of the martyrdom of Polycarp.The translation by Staniforth is very readable. The introductions by Louth are interesting, helpful, and well written. The notes following each book provide the author's commentary of the passage, assistance on difficult passages, insight into the mindset of the writer, important historical information, and other resources for further study. These early church writings are available on the Internet but I have not found any Internet sources that provide as good a presentation of the writings as Early Christian Writings. The inclusion of The Shepherd of Hermas and the fragments of Papias would have made it a more comprehensive collection. Despite this exclusion, for those looking for such a collection, I recommend Early Christian Writings."},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"This collection is a decent collection and translation of the Apostolic Fathers for the general reader. I have two gripes though.One is that the Shepherd of Hermas is not included. I would imagine this was because of its length, but the collection seems woefully inadequate without it.The second is that the verse and chapter numbers are not given in a form that makes them the least bit usable when looking up passages that are referenced in other books.For research purposes, I would recommend the Loeb Classical Library editions or the excellent one volume reworking of the Lightfoot edition available from Baker Books edited by Michael Holmes.But if you're not out to be the next Jarislav Pelikan or J.N.D. Kelley, then this should do just fine for some interesting and inspiring reading."},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is one of those paradigm-changing books. At least, its the one that has brought me closest to converting from Baptistic evangelicalism to Orthodoxy (or, to a lesser extent, Catholicism).The letters of St. Ignatius were particularly troubling - in a good way. I was taken aback by his hardcore bishop-and-eucharistic centered theology, as well as his clearly defined tripartite form of church government of bishop, priest and deacon. His letters, which also powerfully attest to the martyr spirituality of the early church, really caused me to re-think whether congregationalism is right interpretation of Scripture. I mean, exegeting the Scriptures alone doesn't seem to yield a single conclusion, but to have a record of an episcopal form of church government from a bishop who was purportedly acquainted with the Apostle John... well that's got to count for something, right?All of the works in this volume are elegantly translated, and would do any Christian a world of good to read, especially evangelicals who are wanting to be introduced to the writings of the Church Fathers and who don't know where to start. Without question, this is the book to begin with, for the best, and earliest source materials, in an easy to read, yet intelligent, translation."},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"Since I'm only beginning to study the history of the early church, I can't comment on the omissions other reviewers here cite as this book's major flaw. But I can say that the documents included in the book offer the average reader a fascinating insight into the beliefs, pracices and history of the earliest post-Apostolic church. And for religious polemicists, these documents show that it was not a congregationalist, Sola Scriptura, Sola Fide church that enshrined the right of the individual believer to interpret and practice the Faith according to his conscience. This was a hierarchical, sacramental, united church which believed in the necessity of works in addition to faith and believed that its gold standard of truth and teaching authority resided in the Apostolic succession of its bishops. Since some of the Church Fathers included in this book had actually known the Apostles or men who had been taught by the Apostles, this view of Christianity has to be given the greatest weight as that intended by Christ. Roman Catholic apologists specifically will also find support in the First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians (circa 96 AD) in which the bishop of Rome involves himself in the affairs of the Corinthian church and adjudicates their dispute. Whatever your religious perspective though, this book is a wonderfully informative glimpse into a age most people only know about through the filter of technicolor Hollywood epics (Quo Vadis) or the bare-bones hagiographies of martyrs."},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"A couple of reviewers mentioned the omission of Hermas and Papias in this edition. The editor also has omitted the so-called Second Epistle of Clement - not by Clement but still recognized as the oldest Chirstian sermon we have - apart from the Homily to the Hebrews, of course (Heb. 13:22).Omissions like these are sad because the books omiited were key documents that influenced the Fathers (esp. Hermas and Papias). 2Clement also preserves some interesting \\"agrapha\\" - sayings of Jesus not written in the canonical Gospels.Why were these omitted? It is a short book that would not have been greatly enlarged (less than 100 pages) by the addition of these three works that are always included in other editions of the Apostolic Fathers."},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"This book contains many post-apostolic writings of the early church. Most were written very soon after the apostolic age however. The translation and footnotes are for the most part rendered in modern English and flow well. The footnotes and introductions to each book are helpful. This would be a good book to buy if you wish to begin studying the early church."},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"1 Peter 3:15 states \\"...Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect\\"This book is a valuable resource on two fronts for the Christian that wants to learn more and defend the faith.First, these writings give great insight to the issues and challenges confronting the nascent church. To me, the most entertaining and eye-opening of all the writings is the letter from Polycarp to the Phillipians. According to many sources, Polycarp was a student of the John the Apostle and is unwavering in defending the faith and the importance of the church maintaining its adherence to Biblical teachings....as true today as it was two thousand years ago.Second, these writings are important for refuting the spurious claims of those that would attack the validity of the Bible. I come in contact with a number of atheists and agnostics and often hear from them that \\"the New Testament wasn't even written until 200-300 CE\\" (or AD for us traditionalists!). I can't BELIEVE how often I hear that particular piece of misinformed garbage! This book is just one of many ways to refute that claim.Specifically, both the writings of Polycarp and Barnabas quote from the New Testament - not refer, but quote...as in word-for-word...verbatim. This is especially true for Polycarp - heck, he quotes from both the Gospels and the Epistles so much that I bet if there was a \\"fair-use doctrine\\" back in the early 100's he would have pushed the limits!Of course, I'm exaggerating a bit but in Polycarp's letter to the Philippians there are 14 quotes from the New Testament...books that some claim were not written until 150 years after Polycarp's death!The fact of the matter is that I just don't have enough faith to look beyond the overwhelming evidence of the validity of the New Testament..and this book is a well-organized and informative collection of a small piece of that body of evidence."},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"'Early Christian Writings' is a collection of various epistles, as well as an account of the martyrdom of Polycarp, a religious leader for 1st century Smyrnea. The language is beautiful and eloquent, worthy of any Christian library. Literature is noncanonical, although professionally accepted as authentic 1st century Christian writing.I wholesomely recommend this book to all peoples, and, were I a minister, would encourage my congregation to partake of the wondrous sustenance it bears for the soul.Peace to you in His name,RSM"},{"Title":"Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin Classics)","review":"Why isn't this book on every evangelical seminary's guidebook to help us avoid many of the false teachings of the modern cults and churches? After studying in seminary and being mostly influenced by Dallas Seminary's Lewis Sperry Chafer and majority of trusted pastors of the last 150-200 years (Charles Spurgeon, Charles Swindoll, Graham, Kenneth Wuest, D.L. Moody, Matthew Henry, G.Campbell Morgan, J. Vernon Mcgee, and host of other popular writers), this is the first time I have known that we have actual writings of the early church pastors in such an easy to read guide format.How the faithful looked at their impending martyrdom is beautifully seen in \\"the letter of Ignatius to the Church in Rome\\" and in Pastor Polycarp's martyrdom written down by the faithful for our edification. It is amazing how their view of faith included trust in Christ all the way to the end, just like John Wesley taught.It is awesome to know that the early Church always baptized in the name of the Holy Trinity as I read in the last pages of this book, in \\"teachings (didache/gk) of the apostles\\".It is awesome to read that worshipping Christ as God was a normal practice of faith among early Christians from the beginning and how much these trusted pastors exalted our LORD's words and life, death and resurection as the foundation for all Christians.Surprisingly, our early church also saw great significance in the life of Christ as they saw our imitation of Christ's Perfect life to be a holy goal of every Christian every day of our lives. They did not interpret \\"be ye perfect as your Father in Heaven is\\" allegorically or as pre-Grace-dispensational in any way. To them, good works of Love motivated by Faith in Christ's Perfect Life and passionate suffering at the Cross, with His victory over satan through death and Resurrection, was a much stronger emphasis of the basis for our Salvation than simply saying a \\"magical\\" 4 laws or sinner's prayer to welcome Jesus in our hearts. The early Church's view of God's Grace is clear: \\"By Grace you are saved, not by your own doing, but by the will of God in Christ Jesus\\" spoken by Polycarp, the trusted disciple of John called and appointed to lead the Church in Smyrna. However, it is also true that they took Paul's words in Galations 5 as Holy Scripture and took all of Christ's words inline with James' letter, rather than show an adverserial relationship between Christian good works and our faith in Christ. To them, Christ's calling to holiness, His perfect obedience through the pains of the cross, revealed faithful calling of the Christian to live holy lives as part of our salvation, rather than as a separate past/present/future salvation message that I have heard by majority of our teachers in the past 200 years.I was surprised to read that John Calvin, Martin Luther, and John Wesley, honored many of these early Christian writings and always taught reading them for edification and Biblical understanding as PART of our sola scriptura belief, and they never intended that anyone should read the scriptures and privately interpret it against the writings of all these early church pastor's teachings. No wonder all Christians everywhere agreed for majority of the first 1800 years of our faith on the significance of Baptism, Holy communion and hosts of other early church practices and beliefs and none of them tried to use \\"saved by Grace unto good works\\" as beyond what the early church taught, that there are jewish cereminial laws we were freed from unto Christian good works in Love.The view of humility in Ignatius truly is humbling against majority of our teaching in the western culture, since he would never want any believer to independent of the Apostolic Christian Church to exalt oneself above the honest teachings of the Apostles and trusted pastors of the early church.I would highly recommend this translation. Easy to read and follow without liberal antiChristian slants from some other early church books. The print material is also easy to read unlike the glaring papers used by Meier's Eusebius edition and there is not much antiChristian antihistorical Christian bias one finds in some of the early church translations."},{"Title":"Dostoevsky's Taboos (Artes Liberales, Bd 2)","review":"As a non-literary type, a psychotherapist, I found this book to be a revelation. Dr. Meerson, in a brilliant tour-de-force analysis, reveals not only the existence of taboos in Dostoevsky's works, but what those taboos are. This is tricky as the writer in the preface points out; after all we could claim that since the characters never speak about pink rhinoceros', this is the taboo. But Meerson makes a different claim: a careful analysis of the text reveals a pattern of hints, omissions, interruptions in narratives, and other devices. By comparing these interruptions, by pointing out what is omitted in many places, we begin to see an emerging outline of a taboo. Even more striking is her ability to show how Dostoevsky lures us into identifying with various characters, thus implicating us in those taboos. For anyone interested in psychoanalysis and literature, this book is essential reading. It is full of fascinating insights, and her methodology of analysis has tremendous implications for analysts and therapists as an approach to analysis of the process. For those fascinated by the interpersonal school, this work has much to add to the writings of Donnel Stern and his elaboration of selective inattention and unformulated experience. For those interested in the role of projective identification in literature, this book illustrates how Dostoevsky achieved this and what his purposes were in doing so. Her careful analysis of the literary devices which induce us to identify and thereby become implicated in taboos against knowing and speaking has great implications for therapists. For what is therapy, in a certain sense, but overcoming the taboos against knowing and thinking which we come to share with the patient? Embedded in these shared taboos, only gradually through dialogue do we extricate ourselves. Meerson's work shows us how this happens in a literary context."},{"Title":"Dostoevsky's Taboos (Artes Liberales, Bd 2)","review":"Meerson's revelatory book focuses on what Dostoevsky, his narrators and characters do not say, the omissions which signal their pain (Raskolnikov's inability to pronounce to himself the word &quot;murder&quot;; the younger Karamazovs' refusal to recognize Smerdiakov as their brother). This is not, however, a &quot;deconstructionist&quot; move: it is precisely the holes in the text which create and reveal the values pervading Dostoevsky's novels. Meerson's hermeneutic is both an elaboration and a critique of Bakhtin and some of his followers: &quot;polyphony&quot; is not just a free-for-all in which we all get our say--and the the world remains just as we found it, or merely turned upside down. It is a transforming experience in which we are implicated in each other's most secret thoughts and desires. &quot;Everyone is guilty before everyone,&quot; says Father Zosima, &quot;everyone is responsible for everything.&quot; What makes people human and therefore deserving of love, even if they are murderers, madmen or scum, is the fact that they have &quot;sore spots.&quot; It is not only the sympathetic characters who have something to tell us. Whatever people regard as too sacred or too scary to talk about, even to themselves, signals the existence of a value. No taboos, no values-- and vice versa! Nor does the reader get off scot-free. We readers are not confronted by some discursive argument or plot, proposed by author or cahracter, which we can then accept or reject. We are ourselves sent down into the labyrinth of Dostoevsky's narrative, stumbling over our own resistances and obtusenesses. The revelation of value when it does hit us is then all the more powerful. Meerson's analysis will be most effective if you are familiar with or have recently reread (not a bad thing!) the works that she discusses. If this book does not change your life, it will change the way Dostoevsky changes your life."},{"Title":"U.S. Open","review":"First the cover of the book is not the one with Lleyton Hewitt (as shown), but instead it is one with Pete Sampras shaking hand with Andre Agassi. So the cover already makes the book very attractive, setting the tone for its content. The best part of the book is not the text but the photos, which actually are the essence of it. Most of the photos are in color, very few in black &amp; white. On the 120 odd pages of the book, there are photos on absolutely every page. So the book is well 'illustrated'. The book covers the recent history of US Open tennis, going back to the Arthur Ash/ Billy Jean King era of the 60s, and ends at the 2001 US Open. The photos gives the reader a clear indication of the major faces and important moments at the Open over the past three decades. I like the entire book, but what stands out is the section on the few select distinct champions of the recent past, including McEnroe, Evert, Connors and Sampras. Just a few made it to the section, which is not surprising because they have performed consistently over the years at the Open that they were all champions of multiple titles at the Open.I was tempted to give the book 5 stars. The text and the photos are all excellent, with a hard cover. But the binding lets the book down. The pages are coming loose even as a brand new book because the binding is so weak. Nonetheless, it has to be one of the best books ever published on US Open."},{"Title":"Esther a Woman of Strength and Dignity","review":"The entire Great Lives Series are biographies on individuals of the Bible. They are wonderful books because they can be read at many different levels. This book, on Esther, is no different.On the surface level one can read this book and learn a lot about Esther. The next level reveals the character of God, and another level teaches the reader application for their own life and relationship with God.This book is entirely about Esther, but doesn't have anything to do with Esther. Through reading this book one learns about Esther, her experiences, and the era she lived in. Yet what we are really learning are principles that remain constant for all people and all time. Some of these are: waiting on the Lord, the invincibility of God despite his invisibility, and self- constraint through the holy spirit. Like the parables Jesus used, the story of Esther's life is merely a tool God uses to portray His will. This is something Charles Swindoll has discovered, and I believe his intent in writing this book is to help us discover the same.One of the great aspects of this book is that it is part of a series and each book in the series addresses different lessons and characteristics of God. These books introduce life- changing application we might otherwise miss in our regular bible reading and therefore, can greatly enhance our time in God's word."},{"Title":"Esther a Woman of Strength and Dignity","review":"Swindoll continues his legacy of writing great books with \\"Esther: A Woman of Strength and Dignity\\". This is the second volume of the biographical series he has written on various Bible characters. In Esther, he describes the life of Esther and the Book of Esther which indicidentally, is the only book in the Bible that never mentions God by name. However, when you read the Book of Esther, you can defintitely see God working behind the scenes as the drama plays out.Among the important points covered in the book are:1. Be quiet and know that God is God and be convinced that He is at work.2. God is not in a hurry and is not a slave to the human clock (I particularly struggle with this one).3. Some things are important enough for us to stand alone on. One person can indeed make a difference.4. Stand alone and be courageous no matter what the cost!5. God notices us when no one else does. God is impressed with a humble heart that comes to Him on His terms.6. 2 things to consider when discovering how God works.7. 3 principles for being sensitive to God's interventions.8. God can break down any wall. No one, no matter how stubborn or strong-willed, can resist God and win.9. 3 principles from the Book of Esther that we can learn for our lives.10. 4 things that happen when we wait on God.Read, enjoy, and be encouraged to know that God loves you and knows what you're going through even when others do not!Recommended."},{"Title":"Esther a Woman of Strength and Dignity","review":"We are doing this as a Ladies Bible Study at our church and it has been wonderful.

I found this book to be very inspiring and uplifting. It is the story of a woman, though her humility, grace and strength, with God's help saved her people.

He is a God of surprises and we are only to trust and obey Him and He will do amazing things through us."},{"Title":"Esther a Woman of Strength and Dignity","review":"This second book in the 'Great Lives' series is excellent!

Here was a woman who had to make a decision to be silent and let her people die, or to stand up and do whats right. It's extremely interesting that God is never mentioned anywhere in the Book of Esther, but as Charles Swindoll points out, He is working \\"behind the scenes\\" in all of the lives involved in this powerful book.

You do feel very encouraged after reading this book. It's main focus is on God's providence and soveriegnity over our lives. Esther is the ultimate example of that.However, I do have a few critisms that would benefit anyone who plans to get the book. First, Chuck does tend to derive alot of principles from the text that you may not necessarily have looked for when you read the book of Esther. I understand why he does this, to allow the reader to sympathize with Esther's character. Second, at times it seems Chuck is making Esther an ideal that we all should follow, that's okey to a certain extent. Third, he really didn't spend much time on the historical background of Esther's time, which I think would allow the reader to understand where she was coming from. (We supplimented that information in our meeting.) Fourth, he did not need 12 chapters to write about principles from Esther. The last two were good, but not too necessary.With that said, I think this book is a great read for Christians who want to learn about applying God's word personally to their lives, and as a good read for those times when you can't get into a heavy study in the Bible. Esther is a refreshing book that offers much hope and encouragement to those who read it."},{"Title":"Esther a Woman of Strength and Dignity","review":"Charles Swindoll won my heart long ago.

I found it overly simplistic, even for that level, and left my students with too many loose ends.

These characters feel deeply and live vividly, being born, loving, hating, and dying in technicolour.Their stories will draw you in and shake you up, and leave you feeling like you've gained something: insight, or perhaps a connection to an emotion you once felt.

Fountas and Pinnell offer suggestions for effectively helping readers and writers who are not meeting &quot;standard&quot;.

I am a teacher of children with mild to moderate learning disabilities who plans on using this book as a springboard to teach Language Arts to 4th and 6th graders this fall. This summer, this book has proved to be a priceless resource in teaching reading in a summer school program for learners who are able to decode, but have a difficult time making the connection from print to meaning.I have literally seen my classroom transformed as I have engaged the students in minilessons, conferences, group sharing and response journals all for the purpose of building a community of learners. Taking this book, and utilizing a constructivist approach, my classroom has become a place where each child is valued, encouraged to express him/herself, take risks, and celebrated for their unique perspective on the world.Like I said, I have been using this resource for teaching summer school to children from regular education classrooms, but I am certain that my students who are on IEPs, for one reason or another, will also be intellectually stimulated by these, and many more methods this book has. I will be curious to see how end of year results compare with the baseline data I take in Aug. and Sept.I am quite certain that Guiding Readers and Writers Grades 3-6 by Fountas &amp; Pinnell will make a difference."},{"Title":"Guiding Readers and Writers (Grades 3-6): Teaching, Comprehension, Genre, and Content Literacy","review":"If you have been wanting to convert your classroom into a reading/writing workshop but haven't known how to start, _Guiding Readers and Writers: Grades 3-6_ is the book for you! Authors Irene C. Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell have created a comprehensive manual for establishing a reading/writing community -- a place where students can spend two and a half to three hours a day engaged in authentic reading and writing.Teachers who are already using a workshop approach are likely to find much in _Guiding Readers and Writers_ that will make their job easier. Even teachers of younger and older students will find many practical suggestions to implement.Fountas and Pinnell see the goal of language arts instruction in the intermediate grades to be the creation of lifelong readers and writers. They structure the language arts class in a three-block framework: a sixty-minute reading workshop, a sixty-minute writing workshop, and a thirty- to sixty-minute language/word study segment (including spelling, vocabulary, decoding, and more).In addition to providing a treasure trove of information, Fountas and Pinnell have produced a book that is remarkably readable and user-friendly. The two-column format is extremely helpful. In addition, frequent headings, bullet points, and graphics help you to efficiently get the information you need.With photos and other graphics, Fountas and Pinnell show you how to organize your classroom, your materials, and your time for a reading/writing workshop. The authors provide step-by-step instructions for getting started (in a few instances even offering a sample script). They provide scores of suggestions for minilessons, and they recommend more than 1,000 books for classroom use. In addition, each section includes techniques to use with struggling readers and writers. The book even devotes a section to the \\"testing genre,\\" helping students develop strategies to maximize their performance on standardized reading tests.Furthermore, _Guiding Readers and Writers_ includes sixty-five appendices (nearly 150 pages)! Fifty-three of the appendices are reproducible pages that the teacher or the student can use for planning, record-keeping, assessment, analysis, etc. Most of the remaining appendices comprise lists of recommended books. A list of 1,000 books is repeated -- organized once by title and again by level._Guiding Readers and Writers_ will help you rekindle the passions that originally prompted you to become an English teacher -- and it will show you how to share those passions with your students. Focusing on the vital elements of communication is likely to produce the best year ever -- for you *and* for your students."},{"Title":"Guiding Readers and Writers (Grades 3-6): Teaching, Comprehension, Genre, and Content Literacy","review":"This is an excellent resource for every intermediate grade teacher. It is also one of the few books that I am keeping from elementary education program. Fountas &amp; Pinnell are leaders in this area of educational theory. Their research and work is cited and quoted in books across the field. This is probably their finest example of the program they have designed.These two professors have designed a literacy framework that really works. It keeps kids interested in reading and learning, while not being too difficult for the teacher to implement or to assess. The book is so well written - there are guides everywhere and the illustrations and diagrams are actually useful (not just taking up space)! I highly recommend this book for any and all intermediate teachers. Many of their concepts can be adapted for older or younger students with relative ease.Why 5 stars?:I have seen the ideas of Fountas &amp; Pinnell and it really works. Of course, they have designed a utopian classroom in their book, but it is possible to achieve a strong literacy framework with the help of this book. I know I will be using it.

If you teach grades 3-6, it is a staple...must have!"},{"Title":"Big game and big game rifles","review":"Taylor writes extensively and expertly on the rifles and ammuntion used throughout his life as a professional hunter and perhaps as inter-war Africa's most notorious poacher. Since many of the sporting cartridges he used are obsolete this book is a valuable reference work for the student of the big game sporting rifle. Unlike many ballistic technicians Taylor repeatedly comments on bullet performance and that a sporting rifle bullet must be used according to the designer's intent. It is the fisrt such book I have read that repeatedly and forcefully cautions against using too-powerful rifles and too-tough bullets on game because of the danger of the bullet passing through the target animal to wound one or more behind it.All the more interesting is the fact that Taylor's experiences span the black powder express days, the rise of smokeless powder express rifles and the advent of small and medium bore high velocity &quot;magnum&quot; sporting cartridges. He provides sad comments on dead sportsmen who placed too much faith in high velocity magnum small bore rifles.Taylor is one of the few African hunter-authors who has great experience with the famed .600 Nitro Express. His comments are enlightening, and tame the beast, so to speak.Taylor has strong opinions on rifles. He favors double rifles above all others, is fond of single shot rifles and does not like bolt-action repeaters. He speaks, of course, as one who shoots from very close range and admits that things are different in North America. He praises the excellent marksmanship of hunters from the USA who use scope-sighted, bolt action repeaters. He labels the USA as a nation of riflemen."},{"Title":"White Terror: Cossack Warlords of the Trans-Siberian (Cass Military Studies)","review":"OK, I'm weird. I love this stuff and have been saving up to buy this book anbd finally did. Mr. Bisher adds to the literature of the Russian Civil War in Siberia using primary sources, many of them heretofore available only in the original Russian, and does a magnificent job of ferreting out the details. The reason this book is important is twofold: 1) It helps illuminate a period and a geography heretofore ignored by all but a few scholars which was singularly important in the post Geat War period not simply for the Russian Civil War but also the postwar international scramble for position. (2) The Bolsheviks had to have Siberia to make the Russian Revolution work for them because of the natural resources so desperately in short supply in European Russian following the war which is why the failure of the Kokchak government was essential to the sustainable formation of a Bolshevik government, and hence to world history across the remainer of the 20th century (e.g., World War II, Cold War, you name it). The price is somewhat daunting, but I urge anyone interested to include this study in his collection as a sine qua non of underrstanding how the seminal (or, perhaps the Semenov?) events in Siberia 1917-1922 caused the world to be the way it is now."},{"Title":"White Terror: Cossack Warlords of the Trans-Siberian (Cass Military Studies)","review":"This is a groundbreaking study. The Russian Civil War was still fought in Siberia and the Far East long after it was officially \\"over\\" in the Russian heartland. The book is elegantly written and meticulously documented. The mastery of sources is remarkable, considering that many sources are in Russia and therefore can be notoriously hard to penetrate. I kept thinking - how did this guy with no prior academic credits manage to turn so many stones? Found all these extinct local newspapers - hadn't they all been burned upon reading (in woodstoves), torn up for smokes, or later destroyed as evidence?I spotted just a couple of errors. On page 133 the Bolsheviks \\"converted Russia from the medieval Gregorian calendar to the modern Julian one\\". It was the other way around: old Julian out, modern Gregorian in. On page 151 Rumanians are listed among the \\"east European Slavs\\". Rumanians are not Slavic people, they speak a language of Romance (Latin) origin. These inaccuracies are peripheral to the story and can be easily fixed in the next edition.For now, there is only one, and the price tag just kills you. Probably a limited publication, I don't know. That makes it hard to find even in academic libraries (I tried). Too bad, because this monograph is a reliable, unbiased source of knowledge, and great reading to boot."},{"Title":"White Terror: Cossack Warlords of the Trans-Siberian (Cass Military Studies)","review":"Not since Marx, Lenin or even Putin, has a book been written that captures what is in the hearts and minds of the average \\"Russian\\".The author, James Bisher, comes from literary stock not seen in ages.

I cannot compare this rich work to other works I read.Patrick R. Zini"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Within this work, Mr. Lewis is quick to point out the inherent difficulty with regard to the concept of love facing individuals whose native tongue is English. That is, it is easily recognized that there exists an extreme deficit when one applies the same word to describe the sentiment shared with one's spouse, as well as their favorite food. In such extreme cases of difference in terms of the word's application, clarification is hardly needed and might be written off as an embellishment about that which one feels about, say, strawberries or chocolate. However, other instances are more difficult to write off as a poor choice of words; such as, love for friends, family, a spouse, and God. One must surely agree that the sentiment in each of these instances of love can exist and be experienced in significantly different ways. While love is the umbrella under which all of these sentiments rest, they are, as far as most people can tell, very different things. That being said, it is lucky for the reader that Mr. Lewis, almost immediately, circumvents the language barrier and begins to illustrate the foundational understanding which must be apparent for further exploration of the concepts of love to proceed. For those who have struggled with this, even the simplest concept of love's significance, as this reviewer has, the first chapter alone is worth the price of this work's purchase.Building upon a necessary base of knowledge, Lewis begins to explore the nature of love beginning with that love which might be the gray area between the words love and like, or either of the two, as spoken in the English language. Lewis continues his endeavor by tackling what people often consider the more significant forms of love such as friendship, erotic love, and the love of and for God. While no attempt will be made here to convey the significance of the final chapter regarding actual Love in fear of diluting a brilliant message, each of the chapters leading up to that point share common threads. That is, Mr. Lewis illustrates the difficulty which can be had with love in any form if left to our own devices. This illustration is achieved in the author's typical fashion of profound analogies and appeals to common experiences. One can be certain that while this recognition of the volatility of human love is of extreme importance, it is the overriding concept that only by surrendering these loves to Love that one can achieve happiness, solace, and purity in Love which makes this work unquestionably valuable to those that are fortunate enough to read it."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"\\"The Four Loves\\" is one of C. S. Lewis' lesser-known, but most important writings. In a brief 156-pages, Lewis captures the essences of \\"AFEC\\": Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity.From the Koine Greek of the Bible, affection is \\"storge,\\" friendship is \\"phileo,\\" romantic and/or sexual love is \\"eros,\\" and charity or love for God is \\"agape\\" (self-giving, unselfish, other-centered, grace love).Lewis' remarkable achievement is his integrative, balanced, and holistic approach to love. Many theologian-philosophers tend to emphasize one (\\"agape\\"), demonize another (\\"eros\\"), minimize a third (\\"phileo\\"), and misunderstand a fourth (\\"storge\\").Lewis not only correctly interprets all four loves while giving each their validity and importance in their respective spheres; he does so in his renowned pithy, provocative, philosophical, and practical style.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" \\"Soul Physicians\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends.\\""},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This is the finest book I have ever read on love outside of theBible. Lewis' insights on friendship define what true friendship is and cautions us that those who we call friends for lack of a better word have value and admonishes us not \\"to desparage silver because it is not gold\\". He encourages us that if natural love is to see eternity, it must be committed to Charity Himself. An excellent book and profitable to everyone."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"While the English language includes the four types of love under the heading of one word, the original languages of the Bible are more specific in distinguishing between the particular kind of love discussed in the Scriptures. The four loves Lewis covers in this book are: affection, friendship, eros, and charity.In the early part of Genesis God tells us it is not good for the man to be alone. Eve was created to meet this need. Anyone who denies this reality is denying the truth of what God said. We are not just spiritual beings, we live in a body and we need other people.Consider one's love for his or her home country. Lewis argues that this is a legitimate love. In citing Chesterton, he explains that a man not wanting his country to be ruled by foreigners is similar to him not wanting his house to be burned down in that the reasons are too many to list.Affection comes from the Greek word &quot;storge&quot; and refers to the kind of love found between a parent and child or child and parent.Friendship, he says, is the least jealous of the four types of loves. He makes an observation worth noting, &quot;those who are going nowhere can have no fellow-travelers.&quot; Frienship strengthens us.Eros is sensual love. The stimuli gains and sustains our attention. We become totally focused on the object drawing us toward it. He reminds us that St. Francis did not respect this part of his humanity, calling his body &quot;Brother Ass.&quot;Charity is selfless love. &quot;We were made for God. Only by being in some respect like Him, only by being a msnifestation of His beauty, lovingkindness, wisdom or goodness, has any earthly Beloved excited our love,&quot; Lewis writes.Jack Lewis helps us to gain a clearer understanding of the different ways we love. This book isn't just for the sake of acquiring more knowledge, it helps you to express your love more fully after having gained that understanding."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book was first published in 1960, and as such, I'm sure a lot of people might say \\"Hah. It is out of date. We've learned a lot about love since then!\\"To which I would reply, \\"No we haven't. There's nothing new, really.\\"The subject matter of this book is just as applicable today as it was back then. And just as applicable as it was fifty years before Lewis wrote it, because it deals with timeless meanings and principles of love, albeit, from a decidedly Christian perspective.He begins by distinguishing what he calls Need-love (based on need, such as the love of a child for its mother) from Gift-love (selfless, the kind of love we attribute to God, or to a loving father), and then divides love into four categories, based on the four Greek words for love.Each word is treated in its own chapter.Affection (storge) is described as fondness through familiarity, especially between family members or people who have otherwise found themselves together by chance.Friendship (philia) is a stronger bond that exists between people who share a common interest or activity. I love the part where he said In this kind of love, as Emerson said, Do you love me? means Do you see the same truth? - Or at least, \\"Do you care about the same truth?\\" The man who agrees with us that some question, little regarded by others, is of great importance, can be our Friend. He need not agree with us about the answer.This kind of Friendship goes beyond mere Companionship. It's like a celebration of common ground, between people of similar interests and compatibility.Then there is the Greek word Eros, which is love in the sense of 'being in love'. This is distinct from sexuality, which Lewis calls Venus, although he does discuss sexual activity and its spiritual significance in both a pagan and a Christian sense. He warns that if Eros is elevated to the status of a god, it has a tendency to self-destruct or at least not deliver what was promised or expected. However, he praises (to the rooftops, really) the proper (indispensable) function of Eros and Venus!Charity (agape) is a love towards one's neighbour which does not depend on any loveable qualities that the object of love possesses. In this final chapter, Lewis presents quite a challenging and well-reasoned argument against living a life of \\"self-invited and self-protective lovelessness.\\"Overall, I think it a tremendously relevant book.In probably the most radical statement found in the entire book, he says \\"The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.\\""},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"There is really some dynamite material in here. C.S. Lewis explains in typical style and clarity all that is right and wrong with love. Dealing with affection (that warm, fuzzy, it-sure-bugs-me-how-you-twiddle-your-thumbs-but-it's-endearing-in-a-funny-sort-of-a-way type of love you experience after knowing people for a while), friendship, Eros (romantic love, not to be confused with Venus (sexual passion), which is only an element of Eros), and charity, the highest of the loves, Lewis explains the glory of each, and the temptations that arise because of the glory. Much of the book is just hilarious, since he points out little faults common to us all, and he makes it easy to laugh at ourselves. But he also offers much practical advice, good for understanding and enriching our relationships.Main thesis of the book: If you make love God, love becomes a demon. Love is a great gift from God, but because love is so lovely, it's a great temptation to serve it as the whole end and purpose of life. But if this occurs, love becomes a demon, and turns against you. Keep God at the forefront of your mind and your relationships, and love can be kept rich and sweet in its proper perspective."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I approached this writing with some prior experience and formal study of love. Consequently, I cannot judge with complete objectivity, how one might feel about The Four Loves if this was one of their first exposures to the concept. The book made perfect sense to me and was as captivating as any of Mr. Lewis's writings. While the book was not entirely ordered in the way that I would have liked, he adds his own concepts to the Greek notions of agape, storge, philos and eros. These additions help to explain the Greek notions to the modern reader and are at least as meaningful. They even suggest further ways in which to better understand that extremely nebulous word. He sees much farther in matters of loves than the typical modern writer. His knowledge of Renaissance and Medieval literature and history gives him a deep well of insights from which to draw and reveals how deficient the English language is in some basic areas of humanity despite having over 1/2 million words.Lewis points us clearly in the direction of Christianity and the necessary selflessness it prescribes. Until we are truly selfless in attitude and not only in deed, we miss the Christian point of view.I like the way he makes me think. This was my second Lewis book, after Screwtape, and it firmed my resolve to read more."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book will tell you. It discusses in depth the four different kinds of love. It's classic Lewis; it inspires the reader and delivers deep insight in laymen's terms.The text is a treasure chest embedded with jewels like this:\\"God, who needs nothing, loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures in order that He may love and perfect them. He creates the universe already foreseeing - or should we say \\"seeing\\"? there are no tenses in God - the buzzing cloud of flies about the cross, the flayed back pressed against the uneven stake, the nails driven through the mesial nerves, the repeated incipient suffocation as the body droops, the repeated torture of the back and arms as it is time after time, for breath's sake, hitched up. If I may dare the biological image, God is a \\"host\\" who deliberately creates His own parasites; cause us to be that we may exploit and \\"take advantage of\\" Him. Herein is love.

Lewis discusses Love, with the ancient wisdom of experience, as well as a lifetime of thought in a uniquely loving way. He does not sugar coat love, and that is loving indeed.Full recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Book Summary (From the Back Cover)In this candid, wise, and warmly personal book, C.S. Lewis describes the four basic kinds of human love - affection, friendship, erotic love and the love of God. He explores the possibilities and problems of the love between parents and children; the love of men for other men and women for women; the love of men and women for each other; and the love of God that enriches all love. Lewis also explores the questions of sex, possessiveness, jealousy, pride, false sentimentality, good and bad manners in loving, and the need for more laughter between lovers. There are risks that accompany the rewards of love, the author cautions, but he recommends taking them, since \\"hell is the only place outside heaven where we can be safe from the dangers of love.\\"Book HighlightsWhile this is considered to be a minor work of C.S. Lewis, it nevertheless treats the broad subject of love in a concise, yet profound way. Lewis begins the book with an introduction to the subject where he comments on the differences between what he calls \\"Need-love\\" and \\"Gift-love\\". He describes the nuances of the two terms and how they will relate to future chapters that deal with affection, friendship, erotic love and the love of God. He concludes, \\"The human loves can be glorious images of Divine love. No less than that: but also no more - proximities of likeness which in one instance may help, and in another may hinder, proximity of approach. Sometimes perhaps they have not very much to do with it either way\\".In the opening chapter \\"Liking and Loves for the Sub-human\\", Lewis makes a further distinction between the types of loves. He says, \\"Need-love cries to God from our poverty; Gift-love longs to serve, or even to suffer for, God; Appreciative love says: \\"We give thanks to thee for thy great glory.\\" Lewis touches on the love of nature and the love of country as non-personal loves. The love of country consists of different elements: the love of home, love of the deeds of heroism, the belief that our nation is inherently superior to all others and the sense of obligation that our nation can help and ought to help other nations lift themselves up. Finally the love of country means that we love our country simply because it is our country. In each type of love, Lewis presents his criticism.In the next chapter, Lewis treats affection. He notes both the good side and the bad side of affection. If we are too affectionate toward others, then we may idolize them or seek to control them. It could also result in co-dependency. If we are too affectionate toward the things of the world it can result in idolatry. Lewis comments, \\"They may work for ill as well as for good. By itself, left simply to follow its own bent, it can darken and degrade human life\\". The good side is that affection is natural and normal and a gift of God to his creatures. It enriches our appreciation for the world and for others. It helps us to show affectionate love towards all kinds of people and things. In fact, a sign of maturity is the ability to appreciate such a variety.On Friendship, Lewis says that, \\"very few modern people think Friendship a love of comparable value or even a love at all\\". Friendship seems to be marginalized by modern men. Lewis touts both the benefits and dangers of friendship. One very profound point of friendship is that, \\"in each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out\\". In other words, we grow in friendship when we have a group of friends. Seeing how our friends react to others, helps us to appreciate them more. Some other points he brings out are that friendship is strengthened by adversity and friendship must be centered around a common interest. One danger Lewis points out is the tendency to form exclusive groups or cliques. This must be guarded against. Lewis concludes the chapter, \\"They are, like all beauties, derived from Him, and then, in a good Friendship, increased by Him through the friendship itself, so that it is His instrument for creating as well as for revealing\\".On Eros or \\"being in love\\" or romantic love, Lewis makes the point that Eros may or may not be accompanied by Venus (sexual expression). He writes that Eros is exclusive, \\"Now Eros makes a man really want, not a woman, but one particular woman. In some mysterious but quite indisputable fashion the lover desires the Beloved herself, not the pleasure she can give\\". He notes the danger of Eros in that one may try to constantly to please one's spouse to the point of being too preoccupied. The Beloved could possibly supplant the place of God in our life if we are not careful. Lewis says that there is both a grandeur and terror of love. There is a very real risk of rejection. It is a mutual revelation of ourselves and therefore inherently risky. As far as the danger of Eros, Lewis says that the real danger is that we will idolize Eros itself. It is the idea that Eros can be used as an excuse for unfaithfulness. True love makes vows, so the danger is that we will break our vows to our Beloved.Finally on Charity, Lewis Lewis writes profoundly, \\"Do not let your happiness depend on something you may lose. If love is to be a blessing, not a misery, it must be for the only Beloved who will never pass away\\". It is a point well taken. Charity is the highest love because it is the one that lasts into eternity. Lewis goes on, \\"We begin at the real beginning, with love as the Divine energy. This primal love is Gift-love. In God there is no hunger that needs to be filled, only plenteousness that desires to give\\". This is a crucial point. God is the source of all loves. His love is a part of himself, one of his many perfections. He has many perfections which we only faintly understand, but love is not the only one.Lewis relates Divine Love to human, natural loves. He says, \\"In such a case the Divine Love does not substitute itself for the natural - as if we had to throw away our silver to make room for the gold. The natural loves are summoned to become modes of Charity while also remaining the natural loves they were\\". So there is room for the natural loves, as long as we keep in mind that God's Divine Love is the source and justification for them.Book RecommendationIt probably goes without saying that I would recommend this book. Lewis' insights into the subject are many. He helps us to put love in its many variations in its proper context and expression. Our natural inclinations to love are gifts of God. They are graces or gifts to men. He calls us to a higher Love. A Love that is eternal. A Love that purifies all the other natural loves."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis never ceases to amaze me. He makes understandable Christianity in the culture in which we live. He takes my breath away in how simple he can make what seems beyond comprehension. I recommend any of his writings to anyone desiring a better understanding of God and His love for us."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This was a gift, but I think I'm going to ask to borrow it! I've read it before. It's worth reading again."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"THE FOUR LOVES (1960), by C.S. Lewis, has enough thought provoking ideas for all of one's lifetime. Lewis is the author of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and was a close friend of J.R.R. Toliken, the novelist who wrote THE LORD OF THE RINGS, when both were on the faculty of Oxford. This little book by Lewis is a lesser known, but perhaps his best advice for all generations, which he also gave as a lecture. One can hear the audio version of his presentation which is available from Amazon.com. It provides a lasting memory of his ideas with special emphasis on the words in proper spoken English. In this account of \\"love\\" he distinguishes between likings and loves for the sub-human and then goes on to describe four human characteristics of love with their separate Greek meanings as: Affection (storge); Friendship (philia); Romance (eros) ; and Charity, unconditional love (agape). Perhaps the love to seek -and is almost within grasp - is friendship, which was also the subject of the 44 B.C. classic by Cicero, \\"De Amicitia\\" (friendship, based on the Latin word for love, amo, amare, amatus). In reading Lewis's categories of love with perseverance and refection one can hope for a friendship, as Cicero extols, that can exceed storge and eros, and might be a basis for discovering agape, the most difficult love to find. This C.S. Lewis lecture together with Cicero's essay provides material for a life time of reflection and aspiration.H.

Some parts are very datedand don't translate well to modern life."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The book is divided into four sections...the four biblical loves.Four biblical loves are described by Lewis in a simple and direct format. The Four Loves was published in 1960 just three years before Lewis' death and after his romantic interlude. The book reflects a lifetime of experiences.Eros...an obsession for most people, receives extensive coverage but is superceded by agape. Agape love,as the scripture tells us in 1 Corth 13, is unconditional and the purest form of love.I picked up \\"The Four Loves\\" in the army airfield library as a light reading book for my daily train commute...and then...the unexpected happened:I expected a quick read due to its small size and large print, but was unexpectly convicted by the discussion of \\"need love\\" as I fought with the realization that most of my personal experiences with God have been conditional and ego based. If we are honest there is little true agape in our lives.Does God create need love as a basis for the other loves? A recent brush with death, on autobahn A3 near frankfurt, showed me that need love always directs our attention towards God. I had been drifting into a carnal attitude towards my wife for quite a while...that day I came upon a sudden traffic jam. Looking into the rear view mirror I saw an quickly approaching pharmacy van driven by a woman looking down. I prayed to Jesus. She looked up at the last minute and hit the brakes. My car a Ford Focus 2007 withstood great shock, and activated its airbag. I walked away with only a sore back. Needless to say I have started praying actively. The need love has renewed my agape love.The Four Loves...ideally found together in marriage, an idea which Lewis overlooks: affection, eros, friendship, and charity. An idea I overlooked until recently.An interesting side note in the book is the remark C.S. Lewis made about George Orwell. Lewis correctly stated that the characters in \\"Animal Farm\\" were more human than the human characters in \\"1984\\". The two writers worked for the BBC during the same time when they were both famous.They had to have met frequently, yet there is no record of any dialog between them except for initial hostile barbs from Orwell in his reviews and later the one above from Lewis. Lewis initially wrote many good things about Orwell but to no avail...apparently the culture war between them was too great.An easy read...but possibly with distressing insights mining the reading path.

From the simplest types of love that center on mere feelings and general liking, to ones with a deep sense of sacrificial giving, Lewis explains the nature of the types love so that the reader can understand the appropriate love in the right situation, and understand how to express love more consistently.By describing definitive types of love, Lewis argues that knowledge of love, particularly for believing Christians, will lead to a better experience in exercising the types of love in their right context. Lewis illustrates his teaching by using concrete examples for each of his definitive four types of love, while giving special note to loves directed towards sub-human things. Affection, friendship, eros, and charity are what Lewis lists as his types of loves going from leastt to greatest in significance.Lewis, especially when examining love for things subhuman and eros, deeply attacked the sentimentality and nostalgia that mistakes pride for love for sacrifice. The modern split to love either the rational man or a pantheon of natural things is shown to be a deep misunderstandings of what love really is. Ultimately, man makes the mistake of trying to assign love to things that have value in them and to treat things that have no value in themselves, like a nation-state, with unnatural love. For eros, Lewis shows that since many modern men have rejected the call of the One who is love, erotic love has become a very serious, selfish thing. We would only have to look at the so-called sexual revolution to note than man has taken the most playful and needful type of love and turned it into something that is serious and that is treated as if it can be rejected as easily as if it were never needed in the first place.For today's church, the four different types of loves call all believers to reexamine their feelings of love in their homes, ideas, families, communities and marriages in the light not only of the love of Christ, but of Christ as love."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I first encountered this book in a college Theology class - I'll be honest I didn't read as much as I was assigned.

These tapes are also the only professional recordings of the actual voice of C.S. Lewis which we still have, and as such are a priceless treasure. His voice sounds a little like Winston Churchill's and his droll sense of humor sparkles throughout. Though not a Christian myself, I find a lot of inspiration in Lewis's thoughts. I know that whenever I reread any of his books from now on, I will hear his rich, warm, dry baritone voice in my head."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis has made a priceless analysis of love. My experience of reading his book &quot;The Four Loves&quot; (friendship, affection, eros and charity) and comparing it with other books on the subject, is that Lewis uses a fresh (to me) approach. It is like looking through a beautiful diamond. I have observed the diamond several times before, through people like Gerald May, Donald Goergen etc, but have not looked through that particular face of the diamond's prism that Lewis shows.I liked &quot;friendship&quot; where the love of a particular subject can bring two or more people together in a love. I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Eros&quot;. Lewis calls that &quot;love&quot; that is purely genital sex, and the love that leads up to this, &quot;Venus&quot;. He says that Venus is part of Eros. &quot;We must not be totally serious about Venus, and if we are serious about her we can do harm to our humanity&quot;. And &quot;Venus is a mocking, mischievous spirit, far more elf than deity, and makes game of us. When all external circumstances are the fittest for her service she will leave one or both lovers totally indisposed for it. When every overt act is impossible and even glances cannot be exchanged - in trains, in shops and at interminable parties - she will assail them with all her force. An hour later, when time and place agree, she will have mysteriously disappeared, perhaps from only one of them. ......&quot;In Eros at times we seem to be flying; Venus gives us the sudden twitch that reminds us we are really captive balloons ..... on one side akin to the angels, and on the other to tom cats. .... St. Francis called his body 'brother ass'..... It is impossible for anyone in his right senses to either revere or hate a donkey. An ass is a useful, sturdy, lazy, obstinate, patient, loveable and infuriating beast; deserving now the stick and now a carrot; both pathetically and absurdly beautiful. So the body. .... The fact that we have bodies is the oldest joke there is&quot;.Lewis goes on to emphasise that none of the &quot;natural&quot; loves can survive without agape love, that is the love that comes from God, which Lewis calls &quot;Charity&quot;."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I have now read this book three times - twice for school courses and once for personal reading. With each reading I find that a deeper understanding of the subject is obtained. This book is a great examination of the human heart, the different types of loves and how they each interact. Lewis examines: Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity. In each of the first three categories he shows both good and bad examples of that form of love, or in other words, the love and the perversion of that love.Lewis states: \\"Let us make no mistakes. Our Gift-loves are really God-Like, and among our Gift-loves those are most God-Like which are most boundless and unwearied in giving. All the things the poets say about them are true. Their joy, their energy, their patience, their readiness to forgive, their desire for the good of the beloved - all this is a real and all but adorable image of the Divine life.\\" p.9 This is the ultimate in love; this is when our love comes closest to God's Love.Lewis gives us a great study in love, what love is, what it means to truly love and some of the pitfalls of love gone askew.

I didn't expect it, but reading this book caused me to examine the types of love in my life, both in giving and receiving, and after doing so, lessened so much of the heartache I had before reading its pages.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wonders what love is, or if love is even worth having."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Many individuals think that Mere Christianity is the flagship work of Lewis, which is understandable, however I really believe Lewis is at his best in this book.His overall tone and voice throughout the entire book convinces you of the material and points without ever really seeming like Lewis is even really trying to convince you of anything but is just expressing deep truths that we've always known to be true but never really discovered them.It's easy to see how Lewis has influenced so many authors and thinkers over the years and continues to be an influential thinker and writer well into the 21st century.If you look at some of the new writers of the 21st century who will probably shape Christianity and the literary world themselves, they have each been influenced by C.S. Lewis.If you've never read Lewis or have only read the Narnia series, you must begin diving into his non-fiction books because he is a well of wisdom and insight that will be around forever, as a writer and as an influence on other writers.This book will help reveal to you the many different aspects of love in life."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"There have been many good things and helpful reviews already written about this book so there's no reason for me to go on about how wonderful and insightful it is. My comments are more directly related to those who have a wish (or are assigned) to read Aristotle's work &quot;The Nichomachean Ethics&quot;. I read the Ethics for a philosophy discussion class my freshman year and was intrigued by mush of what Aristotle had to say about love and human behavior. While it is a very insightful work, the Ethics is extremely difficult to read, and takes much time and pastience.About a month after completing the Ethics, I happened to pick up Lewis's &quot;The Four Loves&quot; in my college's bookstore, and I couldn't put it down. What surprised me most upon reading it, however, was that much of Lewis's understanding of the human loves came directly from Aristotle. I went back and reread the Ethics and found (not surprisingly since Lewis was a classics scholar) that for his understanding of friendly and passionate love (for Aristotle philos and eros), Lewis's arguments followed Aristotle's very closely, and were much more clear and easy to understand. On top of this, his additions of affectionate love and agape or godly love (a Greek thought to be sure, but not in Aristotle's time), expanded upon the notions of love and offered a fuller treatment than Aristotle.I say all this not to disuade anyone from reading Aristotle or thinking that Lewis was an Aristotle knock-off, on the contrary, both these these works should be read, and in opinion my opinion they complement each other very well and aid the reader in more fully understanding both works: understanding Aristotle because Lewis presents many of his same arguments only more clearly, and understanding Lewis by seeing the evolution and expansion of his thought from the Greek concepts.And even if you don't feel like tackling Aristotle, &quot;The Four Loves&quot; is a work worth reading in and of itself (just don't think that you can get away with substituting this work for the Ethics, since the Ethics goes far beyond a discussion of love)."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Lewis' genius in all his writings shows forth as piercing insight in warm and delightful prose, and he brilliantly succeeds in this book. There has been more written on love than perhaps any other topic, but the vast majority is mindless drivel or hormone driven blindness or sentimental fluff or philosphical madness. Lewis will have none of that: he sets forth the nature and varieties of human and divine love, and through his keen insight allows us to see ourselves, others, and God better.His basic franework for the book is looking at love through the four different kinds of love that the Greeks defined. He devotes chapters to the \\"natural\\" human loves of storge, the love of family affection; philia, the love of friendship; eros, the love of sexual love and romance. He looks at their characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. He also looks at love through a three fold division between need-love, gift-love, and the love of appreciation.Lastly, he examines agape, the selfless love of charity. In some of the most beautiful passages he ever wrote Lewis describes how agape perfects our natural loves and prepares us both to truly love God and be like Him. \\"When we see the face of God we shall know that we have always known it.\\"Leading a life marked by love is not a matter of just reading a book, but understanding the nature of God and the nature of love. This book is welcome wisdom in leading such a life."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Read the book for yourself! It has everything about love in it. For me, it was a step in the healing process. The world confused me about my sexuality and the types of love. This book cleared the questions and has equipped me with the knowledge to press on as a child of God."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"In general I have been pleased w/ Kindle books, this book edition is unfortunately terrible. It is more that just punctuation errors, there are parts of sentences missing. I am very disappointed that such a fine book is unreadable in the kindle edition."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote this book late in his life after he had experienced love with a colleague in writing. He gives sound advice that I believe applies to a broader base than his usual Christian readership. The four loves are: Affection, Eros, Friendship, and Charity. Each type of love has a chapter dedicated to a fuller explanation.My favorite section is the one he wrote on Friendship. I think he is honest about limitations we place on who becomes our friends. Many believe any two people can become good friends, when in reality, this is just not so. Friends are people who share some vision or passion in life. That vision or passion is the cement of the common bond. Lewis had deep friendships with interesting people, such as Tolkien. He even elaborates on his own experiences with such companions.Charity is the true form of love. Charity is the deepest form of giving our feeling, freedom, and even our very selves, to each other and finally, to God, whom Lewis calls \\"Love Himself.\\" There is wisdom in his admonition that love is not easy or cheap. Work, loss, and sacrifice often accompany the application of true love, which is charity.Unlike other works, such as \\"Miracles\\" or \\"Mere Christianity\\" where logic sets the primary pace, \\"The Four Loves\\" is a book where Lewis brings much of his experience to light. This is not, however, to say that Lewis does not apply logic to experience. Rather, Lewis uses logic to makes sense of experiences in his past to try and uncover truths about love.In writing about love, Lewis articulates some significant moral, social, and psychological truths. Most importantly, he shows that love itself is not God. Love exalted to divinity becomes a \\"demon,\\" as he quotes one of his contemporaries. Love is only a part of the greatness of our complex lives, not the full of it. \\"The Four Loves\\" is another insightful masterpiece by C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"As with every other volume in this series, THE FOUR LOVES, proves to be yet another major success. It is philosophy, it is theology, it is profound, intelligent, and inspiring. C.S. Lewis discusses the four loves - that is, Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity - in the most brilliant manner. Philosophy like this will attract the attention and interest of anyone, regardless of their prior opinion on philosophy. For once, I felt like it actually mattered; whereas most other philosophy works I have read seemed quite far away from the business of \\"living a good life\\", which was philosophy's first goal. This is practical, useful, and usable.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C. S. Lewis is not only one of the 20th century's finest minds, he's also amazingly perceptive of human behavior. This well-written description explains so clearly the four kinds of love and with such accessible illustrations from real life. Most eye-opening for me was the chapter on \\"affection\\" where I began to understand for the first time why we moms think we are so misunderstood; in actuality, our \\"affection\\" (storge) for our family has gotten out of hand! You'll need to read in order to understand. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"CS Lewis does a wonderful job defining the four Greek words for Love. I would recommend this book most highly to the man (women are less likely to make this error) who thinks he needs no friends. Lewis shows the importance of friendship to a good life."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Supposedly this is the only existing audio of the voice of C.S. Lewis. Originally, I was hoping to find audio of his famous radio talks which later became his book \\"Mere Christianity\\". Even though this wasn't exactly what I was looking for, it is phenomenal to hear the voice of C.S. Lewis. The Four Loves should be recommended reading/listening for every engaged couple. For those of us who have been married for some time, his book sheds beautiful light on what our relationships should look like.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"In the introduction, Lewis discusses the differences between Gift-love and Need-love. He explains that although our Need-loves may be demanding and greedy, they are good and necessary because there is little danger that they can be made into gods. They are not near enough to God, by likeness, to be twisted like that. The highest does not exist without the lowest and a plant has roots below as well as sunlight above.Chapter 2: Likings And Loves For The Sub-Human, is a discussion of Pleasures of Need versus Pleasures of Appreciation. The types of love explored here include patriotism and love of nature. The next chapter: Affection, deals with the humblest love as Lewis calls it. He refers to literary works like The Wind In The Willows, Tristram Shandy, Emma and others to demonstrate the good and the bad manifestations of this kind of love.Friendship is explored in Chapter 4, again with reference to literature, including inter alia Ralph Waldo Emerson. This section includes an interesting discussion of the word \\"spiritual\\" - which is nowadays often used as substitute for \\"religious\\". Lewis reminds us that there is spiritual evil as well as spiritual good. The next chapter deals with Eros and he points out its aspects of glory and its playfullness, with reference to books like Anna Karenina and 1984, and certain passages from scripture.The final chapter is titled Charity and includes an interesting view of a passage from the Confessions by St Augustine. Lewis notes that the Gift-loves are natural images of God whilst the Need-loves are correlatives (not opposites) of the love that God is. When God is admitted to the human heart, He transforms our Gift-love and our Need-love. Conversion is necessary for our natural loves to enter the heavenly life.The main lesson of the book is the importance of Charity. Without it, all three of the aforementioned types of love may become distorted and even dangerous. Although this little book provides great insight, I have not found it to be as accessible as his masterpieceMere Christianityor his comforting book titledThe Problem of Pain.Sometimes his arguments are hard to follow and his views and examples of certain types of love are coloured by the English culture of the period in which he lived, thus not always universally applicable. The book would also have been a better reference source if an index had been provided. Besides these minor comlaints, The Four Loves is still a great read that provides valuable insight into the human condition."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"It was wonderful to actually hear Clive's actual voice and put a little more of the man behind all his words.I was left with the impression of an ascetic academic.

An excellent piece of writing."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I think most of the people who purchase Lewis' non-fiction do so because they are interested in his take on Christianity. One of the odd things about this book is that Lewis doesn't make it clear how he decided on these four Greek words. It turns out that the New Testament doesn't use the word eros or storge. This means that the New Testament usage is actually closer to colloquial English usage that you might guess from this book. I assume he chose these words because classical Greek philosophers classified love in this four-fold way.When Lewis discusses friendship in this book, he gives it a rather odd definition that no longer seems appropriate in today's world, and probably even in his time almost no one except a university professor have. Lewis' concept is that a friend is someone with whom you share an arcane interest. It is an interest so rare that when you meet someone with a similar interest, your reaction is \\"What? You too?\\" Now that most people live in large cities and many have access to the internet, finding someone with an interest in say Wagnerian Opera isn't nearly so hard as it might have been for Lewis, who hated London and large cities. I think for most urban dwellers today, the people whom we consider friends are not so much those with whom we share a rare hobby, but people whose company we like and whose lives we are interested in hearing about.If you are a hard core Lewis fan, you will probably enjoy this book, but if you are new to Lewis, you might have more fun reading something else like Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, or The Great Divorce."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book is exactly what I have expected! It's about the true love, it's meanings, explanations and everything you need to know about many different kinds of love, such as love between friends, between man and woman, between parents and their kids etc. If you are interested in the subject, don't think about buying it. Simply but that book!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Though C. S. Lewis was a bachelor most of his life, he never lived alone. And the people with which he shared his home were far from perfect. In one of his letters, he writes that he often came home with a feeling of dread, because he was afraid of the horrible conflicts that had arisen in his absence. A peaceful home was something that Lewis did not experience very often.This - apart from his literary input - provided him with ample examples of what different kinds of love are like and what their corresponding weaknesses are. Especially the weaknesses. It does not come as a surprise, then, that \\"The Four Loves\\" is filled with everyday examples of human weaknesses, many of them in a home setting.As in his other writings such as \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" Lewis makes his observations of human nature with a keen eye and articulates them eloquently, focusing in this book on the themes of affection, friendship, romantic/erotic love, and selfless love (in the original sense of \\"charity\\").About romantic love, for instance, he says that oftentimes it \\"extenuates - almost sanctions - almost sanctifies - any actions it leads to. When lovers say of some act that we might blame, \`Love made us do it,' notice the tone. A man saying, \`I did it because I was frightened,' or \`I did it because I was angry,' speaks quite differently. He is putting forward an excuse for what he feels to require excusing. But the lovers are seldom doing quite that. The confession can be almost a boast. In extreme cases what their words really express is a demure yet unshakable allegiance to the god of love.\\"Strong words.

For instance, 'metanoia' is usually rendered as 'change of heart' but is more like 'a long dark night of the soul followed by a repentant altar call and acceptance of Justifying Grace.'Thus it is with our English word love, which subsumes not one but FOUR words from Koine Greek: \\"storge\\" (affection), \\"philia\\" (friendship), \\"eros\\" (sexual or romantic love) and \\"agape\\" (selfless love).THE FOUR LOVES lets you join C.S.

There he adds the spice of both Testaments: From giants Jacob and Esau and Isaiah to St. Luke, St. John, I Corinthians and Paul's words on Gift-love and Need-love.Similiar to the \\"Weight of Glory,\\" Lewis views his contrasting ideas, \\"addressed to our condition\\" as rivalry between the self and the human Other.

These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written.Mike London 10-3-2012]The Four Loves were originally recorded as broadcasts for the radio, and because of Lewis's frankness on the sexual nature of Eros, some of the supporters of the company did not want to advocate this. Lewis told George Sayer it is very surprising that a nation who peddles such voluminous pornography, and here Lewis speaks of America, that they would object to a Christian discussion on sexuality.Sexuality makes an essential part of human nature, and God intended it as one of his most blessed, and highly unusual, gifts to two people who are very deeply in love and wish to express this love in a very intimate way. That is why a person must be married for sexual activity to be divinely approved of, for anything else lessens the activity's purpose and makes a mockery of it. Tim Lahaye has found in surveys conducted by him that religious people are generally the most sexually satisfied individuals. Lewis is quite consistent in the portrayal of the sexual nature of men and women and God's purpose for it. The whole institute of marriage, like any other gift of pleasure of God's, shows us God's love for mankind.Charity, or agape love, stands as the most intense and the deepest kind of love, because it is the love between humanity and God.Lewis goes on to deal with the other two types of love, friendship and effect, and each of these four types of love are presented with such clarity of thought that after a reader is finished with this book he/she has a much deeper understanding of the loves in general.Affection, one that is not generally counted as a love, is a necessary requirement for happy living, for if one has no affection then their life will be utterly miserable. Friendship, for Lewis, stands as the most unnatural from a biological standpoint of the four loves, but also one of life's biggest blessings. Lewis valued his friendships all of his life.It is truly a remarkable book.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".)"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"A very thoughtful and insightful work on the many facets of love.

Lewis is one of my favorite authors, and I consider his \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" to be two of the finest books written in the 20th century. But I must admit that some of his stuff is rather grueling to read. \\"The Abolition of Man\\" was one of the more laborious that I've read, and though not to that same extent, I would categorize \\"The Four Loves\\" similarly.To be sure, \\"The Four Loves\\" offers some fascinating insight into the four different types of love that Lewis describes: affection (family love), friendship, eros (romantic love), and charity. His analysis of these different loves helps to explain how and why we can profoundly love different people in substantially distinct ways. I especially appreciated some of his critique of how modern assumptions about romantic love have created vastly dysfunctional and destructive patterns of relationships. I was able to borrow a few quotes from the \\"Friendship\\" chapter for a sermon that I recently preached about relationships. And Lewis is always Lewis, finding clever ways to explain very profound ideas and putting words to things that we've all felt in the past but have previously been unable to articulate.However, \\"The Four Loves\\" was definitely more laborious for me to read than most of Lewis' other work that I've read. Several of his main themes (the distinctions between \\"need-love\\" and \\"gift-love,\\" for instance) were so abstract that I really struggled to follow his reasoning. And even when I was able to decipher what he was saying, I struggled to understand how his ideas even mattered. Lewis' gift as an author is taking high-minded, intellectual stuff and bringing it down to earth, to make it accessible to normal folks like me. I just never felt like \\"The Four Loves\\" ever really landed, but instead stayed in the philosophical stratosphere. It's a fine and decent book which offers some interesting food for thought about the nature of love. And there are definitely some sound bites that provide great quotes to share in various contexts. But I'd easily recommend a dozen other book by Lewis before I'd point someone in this direction."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I first heard of C. S. Lewis in 1964 when I attended Bible school. I read THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS and found it somewhat interesting, but at 19 years old, I didn't appreciate the breadth and depth of his work. My interest, however, was re-kindled in the early 1970's. I was at a point in my life when I was making relationships with people more important than my relationship to God. Through the suggestion of a friend, I started reading Lewis again. How I found this book is a whole story in itself, but suffice it to say that I found it useful and spiritually helpful.Lewis discusses four loves: affection, friendship, eros, and charity with \\"Charity\\" being the biblical sense of the word and not the modern one of helping the poor (although that can be included). He even devotes Chapter 2 to likings and loves for the sub-human. Lewis is nothing, if not thorough.As he discusses the four loves he talks about \\"need\\" love and \\"appreciative\\" love, discussing how one is not necessarily superior to the other and, in fact, we need both. He brings this into many places in his discussion of the loves.The part I appreciated the most was that he always leads the reader back to the fact that he or she needs to give these \\"loves\\" to Christ, and to always keep God central. He shows the good and the bad that can happen with each love if allowed to run rampant.You may or may not agree with every point Lewis makes, but it is valuable, Christ-centered reading. It was of great spiritual value to me in my own growth as a Christian."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I just can't get enough of C.S.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I find so much comfort in this book. C.S. Lewis once again brings his keen intellectual analysis, and his profoundly honest introspection to bear in this, his unique Christian interpretation of the complex subject of love. Often when reading Lewis, I find that I have to put the book down every couple of minutes, and just ponder and analyze exactly what he's saying, and it's the same with this one. His descriptions and analysis of the affection between people and their pets, co-workers and family members is spot on, his take on the deep and profound nature of real friendship rings true, his summary of the unbridled power of romantic/erotic love will strike a chord with anyone who has been in a passionate love affair (for better or worse), and his take on the selfless love of mankind in general, and God ultimately, gives us a needed dose of perspective.I love the fact that Lewis was so educated, and so familiar with the religious and philosophical traditions of the West specifically, and the world in general, and that he has a deep understanding of and respect for those non-Christian traditions. He most certainly did not come to Christianity through an ignorance of, contempt for, nor fear of other traditions. I find it sad that so many non-Christians have an image of Christianity as a narrow-minded, bigoted tradition hostile towards other religions---reading C.S. Lewis will dispell that. I feel greatly indebted to C.S. Lewis for helping me on my journey, and The Four Loves is one of my favorites of his.

Lewis, \\"The Four Loves\\" spans diverse life stages, offering golden wisdom not only to mature singles and married couples, but even to teenagers sorting out keys to friendship and romance.Three themes are especially powerful tools for shaping rich, reliable, safe and empowering relationships, whether in friendship, in romance or in the family: 1) Relationships are destiny; 2) Extreme conformity is no act of love; and, 3) Controlling personalities eviscerate themselves and others.1) RELATIONSHIPS ARE DESTINY: Lewis notes that friendships can be schools of virtue or schools of vice, as life companions tend to pipe into our lives their strongest traits and block out qualities alien to their nature. Thus we absorb wisdom, love for truth, courage and faith from virtuous friends, who also buffer us against self-inflicted wounds, corruption and spiritual inertia. What marital grief is saved for those who absorb this Lewis tip before locking in for life!2) EXTREME CONFORMITY, SUBMISSION OR CAPITULATION IS NO ACT OF LOVE. Mindless self-surrender, notes Lewis, can amount to idolatry for those who relinquish control a mere human that should only be yielded to God. A woman who is to a man as a child is to an adult, adds the author, destroys hope even of genuine friendship. Furthermore, \\"a man would have to be...indeed a blasphemer,\\" charges Lewis, if he accepts for himself such sovereignty over another person's life.3) CONTROLLING PERSONALITIES EVISERATE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. At extremes, both \\"need love\\" and \\"gift love\\" are used by covert-controllers. A \\"tyrannous and gluttonous demand for affection,\\" notes Lewis, consumes not only the object of love but also the ravenous heart searching to be fed, rather than to love. Equally treacherous, notes Lewis, are those who exploit \\"gift love,\\" such as \\"Mrs. Fidget\\" who slaved away for her family day and night. By giving them so much that they did not need, indeed, did not want, she put them in her debt, so they could hardly rest for jumping to please this woman who \\"lives for her family.\\" Such a family colludes to sustain an illusion of warmth, while secret resentment simmers against those whose \\"love\\" leaves others impoverished emotionally. After her death, there were \\"astonishing\\" changes in the family, reports Lewis, as the husband could laugh, the children enjoyed staying home, and \\"even the dog, who was never allowed out except on a lead is now a well-known member of the Lamp-post Club.\\"Lewis notes that more overt controllers may seek to isolate partners from other relationships, clinging to \\"love\\" in ways that excludes others. But a wife who alienates her husband's male friends may create a spouse not \\"very well worth having; she has emasculated him,\\" warns Lewis. Such a partner may accept this fate or go underground, adds the author, creating a secret life beyond spouse control. As a family counselor, I note that marital affairs commonly evolve out of desperate but treacherous attempts to salvage personal identity and escape a controlling partner. As Lewis observes, controllers inevitably lose what they seek to control, as those they strive to master are spiritually annihilated or driven away.Through \\"The Four Loves,\\" C.S. Lewis has given us a remarkable roadmap for safe, empowering, destiny-shaping relationships. In an era of disposable spouses, children and friends, we more than ever need such wisdom for relationship radar, spiritual protection, and at times, for survival.REVIEWER: Beverly Hubble Tauke, LCSW, is author of \\"Overcoming Sins of the Family\\" and is a Virginia-based family counselor and lecturer."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"By splitting human love into four basic categories, C.S. Lewis creates a stunning and convincing commentary on our existence. Throughout the text, the question &quot;Which love is closest to God's love?&quot; is strung. Lewis does an amazing job at answering this question, and the book comes full-circle in the end and proves that &quot;to love is to be vulnerable&quot;. The Four Loves digresses quite far from where C.S. Lewis normally writes. Discussions include detailed definitions and explications of the Greek gods and how they relate to our lives. Still, this book is 100% Lewis. An essential book for the &quot;thinker types&quot;, and a must for any fan of C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"CS Lewis can take a difficult issue and boil it down to something remarkably simple--that's the beauty of his writing. Here Lewis tackles love--the most simple, the most complicated, the most pleasurable, and the most painful of all our emotions. He approaches his subject with uncanny insight, and divides this passion, what we call love, into four types: affection, friendship, eros (sensual love), and charity. Then, starting with affection, Lewis proceeds to tell us just what we thought we could never understand.I am not a flowery, luvvy-duvvy type of guy. I don't find it all that amusing to sit around and talk about emotions. But Lewis's writing is different--he takes the subject of love to a higher level, and examines what it is that makes us feel the way we do and, more importantly, how that can bring us closer to God.This book, like many of Lewis's works, is a case for Christianity. But even without that approach this book is invaluable, because Lewis can make you understand WHAT IT IS to love. In short, you can learn how to love better, and how to make your dealings with others much more meaningful.CS Lewis is different than most theologians (he would have hated to be called that). While many concentrate on doctrinal matters, Lewis explores everyday life. What he teaches are good, solid morals--the things that will make you a better everyday person. This book is highly recommended for a good look at what we call Love."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I approached this writing with some prior experience and formal study of love. Consequently, I cannot judge with complete objectivity, how one might feel about The Four Loves if this was one of their first exposures to the concept. The book made perfect sense to me and was as captivating as any of Mr. Lewis's writings. While the book was not entirely ordered in the way that I would have liked, he adds his own concepts to the Greek notions of agape, storge, philos and eros. These additions help to explain the Greek notions to the modern reader and are at least as meaningful. They even suggest further ways in which to better understand that extremely nebulous word. He sees much farther in matters of loves than the typical modern writer. His knowledge of Renaissance and Medieval literature and history gives him a deep well of insights from which to draw and reveals how deficient the English language is in some basic areas of humanity despite having over 1/2 million words.As Lincoln said, &quot;With malice toward none, with charity for all,&quot; Lewis points us clearly in the direction of Christianity and the necessary selflessness it prescribes. Until we are truly selfless in attitude and not only in deed, we miss the Christian point of view.I like the way he makes me think. This was my second Lewis book, after Screwtape, and it firmed my resolve to read more."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This is in my opinion C.S. Lewis's best nonfiction work. The premise has been done before, but rarely with the sort of insight given here. His overviews of Affection and Friendship are much too often overlooked and glossed over as unimportant, but here they're given a status they really deserve.The section on friendship, and the idea that people are bonded through mutual passions, and his grim statement that people who are just looking for a friend will never find one, was spot on. Friendships are formed as an extension of a passion for something bigger than the individual. A mutual cause drives people, whether they be sports fanatics, a tribe pining for survival, or art critics.The pitfalls he explains for the loves such as lust, bigotry, elitism, etc. are self explanatory, but it's also practical. Friendships are exclusive by their very nature, and there's nothing intrinsically wrong with such a thing. Eros is most certainly exclusive. He emphasizes that we can't be friends with everyone, love everyone with Eros, but we can love everyone with Charity, the final section of the book.One could write a book three times longer and not come close to the depth portrayed in this little book. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"One of the things I like most about college are the lectures of a really erudite professor. It's such a joy to hear someone with a dazzling array of experiences and insights speak on his subject of expertise. These 4 talks are the closest most of us will ever come to sitting in a Cambridge classroom and hearing the one and only C.S. Lewis talk and talk about a subject of intense and intimate interest to just about all of us: love. While perhaps of lesser aesthetic quality than Plato's \\"Symposium\\", it is, nonetheless, far more insightful and USEFUL (That's not to say Plato is not useful; far from it! It is precisely BECAUSE Plato is so eminently insightful and useful that I consider this to be just about the highest compliment one could pay Lewis's work, and a compliment which is richly deserved!). Lewis's unparalleled understanding of human nature; his ability to illustrate the true significance of often overlooked, seemingly trivial things; his use of disparate and always apt illustrations from literature, history, psychology, life, philosophy, and religion; the way in which the highest and the lowest are always placed in right relation in his account of things; all these hallmarks of Lewis's genius are on full display in these lectures on the four types of love: domestic affection, friendship, erotic love, and Christian charity.In fact, Lewis's understanding that these various types of love differ not only in degree but in kind enable him to avoid many of the apparent problems of Plato's account. I would recommend that Lewis's \\"Four Loves\\" and Plato's \\"Symposium\\" be read back-to-back and then criticized in light of each other, and then reread back-to-back again. Listening to them both (there is an excellent line of dramatic readings of Plato's works by Naxos audio-books) is very helpful, for one gets something different from hearing a lecture than from just reading notes (even if they are an exact transcript of the lecture). Also, Lewis's talks differ slightly in content from the book, and the differences, while slight, are somewhat instructive.One can truly listen with rapt interest and amazement to these talks over, and over, and over, and over, and..."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"If you have only read \\"The Four Loves,\\" you haven't heard all that Lewis had to say on the subject. The audio version, read by Lewis himself is shorter than the print version of this book, but it includes material not in print. It takes a few minutes to get used to Lewis' voice, but soon you feel that you are sitting in a room with him as he tells stories and talks about what he has learned from his experiences of the four loves."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis's short _The Four Loves_, published near the end of the author's life in 1960, is worthy companion for a long afternoon or evening of reading and meditation. Lewis discusses in both an enlightening and light tone the four forms of love in ascending order: affection, friendship, eros, and charity. As a preliminary to this discussion, Lewis also describes likings and loves for \\"sub-human\\" (that is, loving a cup of tea or loving nature). The work is a philosophy of love that draws upon Lewis's own day-to-day observations, the writings of well-known and lesser known philosophers, and the works of artists. All of these types of love lead to an insight that these natural loves--that is, the loves that make up our daily lives--intimate a much large love, that of God for humankind. For Lewis, these natural loves are themselves not enough. Lewis describes a form of Christian love based on Jesus's own sacrifice and the unknowable mystery of God's love. This is the majesty of charity.One basic principle of Lewis's work is the distinction between Need-love and Gift-love. The Need-love has to do, for Lewis, with \\"a craving to be loved,\\" which is akin to a child's longing for the love of his parents'. Instead of disparaging this type of love as wholely selfish, Lewis describes how this type of love, while limited, is \\"the accurate reflection in consciousness of our actual nature.\\" Lewis writes that \\"we need others physically, emotionally, intellectually; we need them if we are to know anything, even ourselves.\\" Lewis acknowledges the human condition sympathetically. Gift-love, by contrast, has its ultimate expression in Christ's death on the cross. This is an active, selfless love. Lewis characterizes Gift-love in its ordinary expression as \\"that love which moves a man to work and plan and save for the future well-being of his family which he will die without sharing or seeing.\\"Lewis's book is filled with wise observations. The chapters on affection and friendship, which are the least religious in nature, are superb. The comments about divine love are engaging, as well. For example, in describing human beings' craving for God's help, he writes, \\"Man approaches God most nearly when he is in one sense least like God.\\" Here, Lewis points out that often humans turn to God or spirituality in type of deepest despair or wretchedness. Later, he quotes a line of verse, \\"The Devil was sick, the Devil a monk would be\\" to highlight how in need people will search for god, not out of sincerity per se, but in a desperate longing to be saved. In chapter one, Lewis draws an analogy between a traveler's journey being not always straight in path and the journey toward God. For example, a traveler who is near to a village in physical proximity, say staring down on the rooftops from a mountain crag that he can almost touch with his hands, may need to follow a path that takes him much further from town before bringing him closer to it (for instance, as the path winds slowly down the hill).Most of Lewis's observations about love speak to all religious traditions as does, arguably, the recognition that human love longs for more than its natural forms. The final chapter \\"Charity\\" is the most explicitly Christian in worldview, and it is the most difficult to grasp. Lewis admits the possible imperfection of his own knowledge and that what he writes about are imagined experiences rather than real ones. He reflects, \\"Those like myself whose imagination far exceeds their obedience are subject to a just penalty; we easily imagine conditions far higher than any we have actually reached.\\"Lewis's _Four Loves_ brims with human insights about love. This is a short work, written in the style of a kind, wise friend sharing his thoughts on a walk or over an evening."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"An illuminating view on affection, the so-called 'the most humble', friendship, 'the least natural and the most independent', eros, 'the most natural' and charity, 'the noblest' of all loves, treated in terms of the so-called 'need love', 'gift love' and 'appreciative love'. The beauty and potential danger of distortion and abuse of each love is also covered excellently. C.S. Lewis is both a psychologist and a philosopher, a brilliant one. His treatment on this subject of love is important for every one to know; some that I personally learn and thought to be beautiful, are:- That we ought to love with decency and common sense;- The reward of the accomplishment of a gift-love is its abdication, when it is no longer needed.- When love becomes a god, it turns into a demon;- The calculating love is no love at all which leads to the beauty and mark of eros, where calculations are irrelevant, and when it is in us, we \\"had rather share unhappiness with the Beloved than be happy on any other terms\\", and finally...- The excellence of charity, confirmed in the Scriptures, something Jonathan Edwards calls 'the sum of all virtues', where Lewis exhorted to love God who will never pass away, \\"Do not let your happiness depend on something you may lose. If love is to be a blessing, not a misery, it must be for the only Beloved who will never pass away.\\"- The gracious call to risk and forego for the greatest good. Speaking of Christ, Lewis says, \\"... His teaching was never meant to confirm my congenital preference for safe investments and limited liabilities... And who could conceivably begin to love God on such a prudential ground -- because the security is better? ...Christ did not teach and suffer that we might become ... more careful of our own happiness... We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent to all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him; throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken and if He chooses this as the way in which they should break, so be it.\\"Get this book, friends, and learn that \\"loves\\" are beautiful, when handled properly, but 'the greatest of these is charity'."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"C.S. Lewis' The Four Loves was not a book that I expected to reshape my thinking. I first picked it up while following the reading guide at the end of Lindskoog's Mere Christian. I thought it would be a fun read during valentine's season. One often is most vulnerable to the trap when one is not alert...And so, once more, C.S. Lewis has changed my thought on a broad portion of life. He's done it to me before--the Narnian Books, Mere Christianity, An Experiment In Criticism--have all been books that have greatly shaped me. Now I can add the Four Loves to the list.One does not often sit down and ponder the different kinds of love. One may have generalized \\"loved ones\\" such as family and friends, we may \\"love\\" certain activities or places, we may even say we are \\"in love\\" ... but do we stop to consider our words?Lewis spends time surveying the lay of love's different lands. Building on blocks of seemingly deepening emotion, he moves from looking at affection to friendship to erotic love (Eros) to the love of God (Agape). Each is looked at in detail, their meaning and impact on life is explored.The most helpful thing about this book is that Lewis allows the reader to think about how they deal with their own loves in life. Does one stress a certain kind of love in an unhealthy way? Do we ignore the possibilities of one love because another kind holds too much sway in our lives?I believe Lewis makes the case that God's love should be primary in the lives of humans. The other loves, though they can be wonderful in their place, can be used unnaturally and ineffectively to try and fill in for Agape if it is not felt. A healthy life will involve all four loves. Yet they must be rooted and grounded in Agape.My own favorite passage in this book is in the friendship section. Dispelling the myth that an intense friendship between two people is always the best, Lewis notes that after his friend Charles (Williams) died, his friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien was something less than it was when Charles was still around--he could no longer appreciate Tolkien through the eyes of Williams. The passage is personal, poignant, and true to my own experience.The Four Loves is a remarkable book. I give it my full recommendation."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I was not especially expecting to be engrossed by a book about four greek words, but I was wrong. This was one of the better books that I have ever read. Lewis overviews each of the four types of love: storge (affection), phileo (friendship), eros (romantic love), and agape (charity or God-love). Each discussion was extremely insightful, especially the friendship one.He desribed storge as the kind of love we have for people whome we spend a lot of time with, but whom with we do not necessarily have a lot in common with. For example, if you have a sibling whom you do not share many interests with but whom you love nonetheless, it is probably storge. These are people whom you probably would not be friends with if you were not related to or neighbors to these people. Lewis notes that these are people we often do not really realize how much we loved until they are gone (or until we realize that they are those kind of people to us).He had an amazing chapter on phileo and the gift of friendship as well. I won't go into much detail so that you can enjoy it more when you actually get around to reading it. Let me just say that it made me appreciate my friends much more, and changed my views on what a friend is. He had the amazing insight that each friend brings out a different part of you. He noted that his friendship with J. R. Tolkien was not quite the same after Charles Williams died, because Williams brought out parts of Tokien that Lewis did not. Very insightful.Lewis' discussion of eros was very insightful as well. He discussed the nature of romantic love, and what romantic love looks like in a marriage. His main point seemed to be that eros loves the other person, and does not try to make the other person become more like himself.Finally, Lewis discussed agape, the kind of love that gives with no expectancy to receive in return. The whole point of this book, through there may have been amazing sidenotes on the way, is that this is the only perfect love. All the other kinds of love can be twisted until they are no longer recognizable. Storge can degenerate into condescendence, phileo can consume us and destory our lives, and eros can degenerate into lust or domineering, but agape is uncorruptable.I highly recommend this book. I can nearly guarantee that it will change the way that you think about love.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I own nearly 1000 books, of which a few I have multiple copies of: The Bible, Sun Tzu's The Art of War, The Prince. This book I have only one copy of, but have bought at least 5 that I can recall off-hand. That's because I loan it out, and it rarely gets returned (folks always return the Bibles, for some reason...). Anyone concerned with the nature and types of love should read this book. C.S. Lewis compares and contrasts love of God, Family, Lovers, and Friends in a way that makes good sense, is easy to understand, and is practical in real life. Should be required reading for anyone that has just started a relationship of any kind, or just ended a relationship for any reason."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I used to think that if I just found the \\"perfect\\" way to do relationships, I would never get hurt or have my heart broken.Lewis counters that kind of thinking. Love is vulnerable, and you will get hurt, he says, and the only place you can fully escape from the \\"dangers and perturbations\\" of love is in Hell.This book helped me, and I hope it will help you, to break free from the mindset of seeking to avoid hurt in relationships, and replace it with a desire to truly love other people.We can never entirely avoid hurt or pain in relationships, but if we approach relationships with the mindset of avoiding pain, we will never experience the joy of true love.This book's scope is not limited to one kind of relationship. It is the \\"Four Loves,\\" after all. Four kinds of love...affection, friendship, eros, and charity.Lewis truly goes through the whole gamut of love. He covers what he calls the \\"likings and loves for the sub-human\\" (like a pet), simple affection for other people and family, the love that friends share, romantic love, and then God's love--the fullest expression of love.I think perhaps this is one of the best books on love and relationships (for the two are inexplicably bound up in each other) that I have ever read. I don't think you will be able to read this book without being changed."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Trust is fragile and does not come without an open heart.C.S. Lewis' book on the four loves: affection (between a parent and a child), friendship, romantic love, and charity or love towards God is truly a remarkable piece of work.Professor Lewis writes with an easiness rare amongst writers, speaks deliberately and with wisdom in his words.He speaks of trust and of hearts, of humanity and humility. Truly, this is a moving book (or was for me) as well as a book which takes the seriousness of love rather lightly and playfully, for good reason. The seriousness and playfulness of love are but opposite sides of the same coin.Read this book with an open, honest, yet vulnerable heart. One needs to take risks in the matters of the heart. And you shall experience the best of dark and bright.--spaceboy"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I have now read this book three times - twice for school courses and once for personal reading. With each reading I find that a deeper understanding of the subject is obtained. This book is a great examination of the human heart, the different types of loves and how they each interact. Lewis examines: Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity. In each of the first three categories he shows both good and bad examples of that form of love, or in other words, the love and the perversion of that love.Lewis states: \\"Let us make no mistakes. Our Gift-loves are really God-Like, and among our Gift-loves those are most God-Like which are most boundless and unwearied in giving. All the things the poets say about them are true. Their joy, their energy, their patience, their readiness to forgive, their desire for the good of the beloved - all this is a real and all but adorable image of the Divine life.\\" p.9 This is the ultimate in love; this is when our love comes closest to God's Love.Lewis gives us a great study in love, what love is, what it means to truly love and some of the pitfalls of love gone askew.

Using the logic Lewis is so famous for and written with the same intelligence as &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, this book is not to be discounted simply because it is about love. Lewis is regarded as one the best Christian theologians of modern times, and it is no mistake that he wrote about this subject, the different types of love, and the importance of it.I went on a spiritaul search for true love--the love of God--at the same time I read this book. &quot;The Four Loves&quot; made everything about love that is cloudy much more clear.

Reading it for the first time twenty or more years ago, each chapter struck me as a revelation, and has been a part of the &quot;spiritual furniture of my mind&quot; ever since. (Though living up to it is more difficult.) It gives me food for thought on &quot;like&quot; and &quot;love,&quot; how to treat animals, the beauties and dangers of friendship and romance, how they differ, the inherent riskiness of love, the disquises by which hatred can enter the soul, and what it means to love God and for God to love me. I do not agree with Gross above that this book is a more &quot;persuasive apologetic&quot; for Christianity than his other books, but I do think that non-Christians are likely to enjoy it. M. Scott Peck's books, Road Less Travelled and People of the Lie, (the first written as a Buddhist, the second as a Christian) can even be read as &quot;case studies&quot; of some of the points Lewis makes here.Four Loves proves that the most eloquent and deepest truths can be expressed in the simplest language.

I give the book an 8 instead of a 10 because of Lewis's views about friendship - he took very little, if any, interest in the personal parts of his friends' lives, so his views are jaded and different from most of society in this respect.

Lewis. It was a classic. According to The Saturday Review, it is a rare and memorable book. Yes, it is. It included sincere Christianity, insight, wisdom and deep meditation. When you read this book, it will give you a feeling that C.S. Lewis tells this story beside you. The contents are four kinds of loves; this is affection of parents, friendship between same genders, erotic love of lovers, and charity for people.The each stage of life can include the mixture of these love. But, usually it is chronological. When people were born, they experienced parents' love at first. Then, when they entered a school, they shared friendship with their classmates. When they became adults, they experienced erotic love emotionally. When they were retired, they gave charity to the needy.He described the difference between Gift-Love and Need-Love throughout all the chapters. In fact, I understood parts of affection and friendship but the parts of Eros and charity were difficult. Divine love is Gift-love. The Father gives all He is and has to the Son. God lacks nothing. However, our Need-Love needs to be filled with.Only God's love is eternal. Except God's love, earthly love is finite. Parents, friends, lovers and people will die when the time has come. So, to love is ready to be vulnerable. It contains the death, the separation and the suffering. It is to accept the cross with love. To share the suffering with the lover is better than to be happy alone.Just as God commanded Abraham to offer his precious son on the altar, the nearest and dearest can exist between God and our obedience. So, we should be careful. There is the priority order. God Himself is primary and center in our spirits, our hearts, our minds and our lives."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"After 50 years, who am I to review a classic work like this? Oh well.The first thing you should know is: if Amazon has heard of a C.S. Lewis book, you should read it. The Four Loves, however, is one of the ones that you should probably have heard of before browsing to here. It is a classic work, it is widely heard of and praised, and if you want the review to end here, then yes, it deserves to be.Now, I do have one more specific comment. The best chapter is Friendship, because it's full of the most truth and importance. Affection is inundated with truth, but (as he adequately shows) it isn't as important, in any sense greater than the bestial; Eros is fairly important and fairly truthful; Charity is extremely important but it's largely his speculation (as he admits), and half a recap of the last 3 books\\"Mere Christianity\\". But Friendship rings with truth, importance, and original insight. It makes you rethink your friendships in real life -- and in a good way.Best quote? \\"Affection and Eros are ... face to face; Friendship is ... side by side.\\" Friends, and perhaps ultimately all lovers to some degree, get on much better when focussing on something they both enjoy, rather than on each other.\\"Oh, lastly, as for edition, this is a pretty solid edition.

It has struck a chord as to why some marriages and long-term relationships become trying after a while.The following are helpful quotes on the characteristics of \\"true friends\\", which is very different from the everyday usage of the word \\"friends\\":1) Friends operate side by side. They let you be you and are not duty-bound. 'Don't mention it' is the way they really feel. They do not impose nor do they burden us with demands or expectations.2) There is no jealousy or rivalry. They are truly happy for us when our external circumstances may take a turn for the better vis-&agrave;-vis theirs;3) Companionship is not friendship. Friendship begins with the pleasant discovery of common interests, 'What? You too?' and involves not only being absorbed in congenial activities but growing mutual interests as the friendship deepens over time.4) A friend needs not agree with us about our answers and would stop at the onset of any arguments by agreeing to \`Let's just agree to disagree';5) Common quest which unites friends does not absorb them in such a way that they remain ignorant or oblivious of one another. A true friend is never uninterested or uninquisitive about our affairs, no matter how many times they might have heard about our issues and are ever-ready to present help in any way they can;7) Eros (lovers) have naked bodies but true friends have naked personalities - they dare to be honest and are not fearful of showing the best and worst in us8) Proverbs 17:17 - \\"A friend loves at all times\\", with the sort of love that covers over a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:8).Marriage is the closest human relationship ordained by God where a man is to leave his family and be cleaved as one flesh with the woman in betrothal (Genesis 2: 14). Marriage is much more than just legitimizing or maintaining a healthy sex life or coming together for the purpose of procreation. Since it is not good for the man to be alone (Genesis 2: 18), a married couple is supposed to be each other's best friends or soul mates who click and have fun together, completing each other in this side of Heaven.The crux is the depth of our friendship with our spouse determines how much and how long we shall remain in love with each other. The feeling of being 'in love' can be a powerful motivating force that oils the engines of our marriages and long-term relationships. Otherwise marriage is a tall order (even for practicing Christians) and one that would be doomed to fail or stuck in the mire of low-level stability where people stay in loveless marriages for the sake of their kids or avoid being social stigmas.Unfortunately, many couples fail to remain true friends in every sense of the words. Many marriages and long-term relationships become duty-bound/obligations-driven/debt-repaying where jealousy rides high and burdensome as participants demand constant affirmation/approval/agreement. Oftentimes these relationships degenerate into downright unloving.We would need to search our hearts and honestly ask ourselves whether we have endeavored to remain true friends with our better halves, actively seeking God's help when the goings get tough. We learn to do this by choosing to adhere to biblical precepts on love (1 Corinthians 13: 4-8),\\"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails\\".Even when it may deeply pain us to take every thought captive in fighting those accompanying raw emotions to be in obedience to God's words in the doing (2 Corinthians 10:5).Regardless of how we are being treated in any given relationship, we are called to live in peace (Romans 12:18, 21) and to return good (love) for evil (unlove). Our religion would be worthless if we claim to love God but fail to demonstrate a loving attitude towards our spouses (who also happen to be our closest neighbors). There should never be any strings attached too - whether our partners have changed or not (in actuality or in our mere perception) or are deemed unlovely, unlovable and unloving."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The inherent bias in my review is that I rate Lewis in context with his other writings. He represents the ultimate pop-theologian who speaks with cutting erudition. Lewis possessed an uncanny power to speak to all Christian denominations through his powerful prose style and unpretentious approach to the ideas of God and the Christian religion. His works make it hard to believe that he was not a trained theologian. With all that said, I dare say he has not written a book that was not great. Perspective with Mere Christianity (among others) dictates that this book receive 4 stars (A \\"4-star\\" rating for him supersedes \\"5-star\\" for many others.). Let me not be misunderstood, his ideas are powerful and his approach is classic Lewis, but the profundity found in Mere Christianity is not present at the same intensity. That is most probably given the fact that most Christians (as I) who read this book probably have given at least some thought to the four loves before this book. The problem may therefore be my own desensitization.The chapter on Eros perhaps engages the reader best as the word draws the interest while Lewis forces the reader to gaze upon the issue in a new light. The chapter (along with \\"Affection\\" and \\"Charity\\") gives the reader a new understanding of familiar themes of love while gifting a new respect and awe of the unique characteristics of the different manifestations of love. The gestalt of the book ultimately drives the reader to a new respect for the Creator of love as well as an appreciation for the complexity found in the four faces of unity that love expresses.May we only continue to strive to reach for love--both as \\"need-love\\" and \\"gift-love\\". Then we fully can (with God's grace) appreciate the depths of humanity and the spiritual end of mankind."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book truly grips the truth of love and helps people put relationship love and God's love into perspective. I am a teenager who was taken away by Lewis' great work. Any age male or female will be absorbed and grow in wisdom. The book has helped me make decisions that will benefit my future for the better and I am extremely happy to have the chance to read such a great work from an author as talanted as CS Lewis."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I enjoyed this book. Through college courses I was already somewhat familiar with the idea of breaking down love / friendship / etc. into different emotions.To me, although the compartmentalization of the different emotions was interesting, I'm not sure I entirely agree with Lewis's breakdowns and this isn't what made the book for me.Rather I appreciated some of his simple insights. Especially when he discusses the subject of friendship. Friends become friends through common interests, through a common truth. He writes something along the lines that friendships will start when in conversation by chance someone says, \\"you noticed this thing here as well?\\" The act of wanting a friend or trying to make one without having a common interest is futile; Friends stand shoulder to shoulder, lovers face to face - just some other Lewis' gems.Also, be aware for non-christians that may read this book, that there are numerous references to God and christian love, and good christian practice, and that sort of thing through-out the book. Most of it is in good taste, sometimes, towards the later chapters, it dominates the book a bit.A good read, though not life changing, as some other reviewers might suggest."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I found this excellent little book misfiled in a used bookstore and felt immediately that I had to rescue it. I'm very glad I did! This short and utterly readable book is nothing less than an introduction to the subject of love as understood by one of the great Christian minds of the 20th century.Following the Greeks, C. S. Lewis divides love into four categories: Affection, Friendship, Eros, and Charity. He goes through each of the first three natural loves, offering observations and describing the joys, dangers, and challenges inherent in each. The last and highest love, Charity, is the love of God. Lewis claims that with love always comes risks--the ultimate risk of loss of the beloved or that your heart will be crushed. However, if one chooses not to love at all for fear of this risk, he will become hard, cold, and ultimately irredeemable.Lewis's conclusion is startling: \\"The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.\\"This book is littered with wise aphorisms and witty asides that are much too numerous to be listed here. If you need help understanding the role of love in your life, I encourage you to read this book. It will answer a lot of questions. That said, it is just a starting point for the subject as Lewis offers little in the way of practical advice. A further way station for folks who wish to continue exploring the role of love in the Christian life might bePhilothea, or an Introduction to the Devout Lifeby St. Francis de Sales."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book provides a great analyze of the concept of love, drawing from both classic/Greco-Roman thought and Christian orthodoxy. There are few opening chapters which lay the ground work for Lewis' essay. I must admit, though some of the information was necessary, I found the opening segments to be rather boring. Lewis has a tendency to get off on rabbit trails that, I imagine, would have been more beneficial to original audience than modern readers.After laying a foundation, Lewis than lays out the \\"four loves\\". Based of the Greek words for love, they are Affection, Friendship, Eros (Romance) and Charity. In typical Lewis fashion, the author picks apart each concept until it seems that there is nothing more to analyze.The study, while incredibly intellectual, is surprisingly practical. It provides great insight into human behavior and relationships. Lewis was a master of presenting concepts that we all have some fuzzy idea about in a defined, logical and articulate way. The Four Loves is no exception. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in the subject."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"A really good read.

Here CS Lewis provides a classical (Greek but Christ-centred) understanding of Four types of Loves -Affection, Friendship, Eros and Charity.

This analogy applies most of all, I think, to The Four Loves. Lewis has such a gift for unpacking complex topics with all the learning of an Oxford professor without coming off as condescending. Yet he never short-changes his readers - he challenges just enough to keep you walking with him as he explores the human heart and that part of it that is knowable in the Divine.Like most of Lewis' works, you can pick any paragraph at random, and you will find a quote with the ring of Eternal Truth:\\"Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket - safe, dark, motionless, airless - it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.\\"\\"Suppose you are fortunate enough to have \\"fallen in love with\\" and married your Friend. And now suppose it possible that you were offered the choice of two futures: \\"Either you two will cease to be lovers but remain forever joint seekers of the same God, the same beauty, the same truth, or else, losing all that, you will retain as long as you live the raptures and ardours, all the wonder and the wild desire of Eros. Choose which you please.\\" Which should we choose? Which choice should we not regret after we had made it?\\"\\"[Affection] is indeed the least discriminating of loves... There need be no apparent fitness between those whom it unites. I have seen it felt for an imbecile not only by his parents but by his brothers. It ignores the barriers of age, sex, class and education. It can exist between a clever young man from the university and an old nurse, though their minds inhabit different worlds. It ignores even the barriers of species. We see it not only between dog and man but, more surprisingly, between dog and cat. Gilbert White claims to have discovered it between a horse and a hen.\\"Christians, especially those who have marveled at the thirteenth chapter of Paul's first letter to the Corinthians, should not go through life without at least one trip through this book."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The Four Loves by CS Lewis has taken me a while to get through but is very interesting and challenging. CS lewis is a very deep thinker."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I'll admit that I haven't read a ton of work by Lewis, but of the work I have read, The Four Loves felt the most scholarly, moreso even than my recollections of Mere Christianity. In The Four Loves, Lewis breaks down the concept of love and analyzes it from a moral and Christian perspective.He uses familiar scholarly concepts from Plato's day by breaking love into the same four main segments that the Greeks used: Affection, Friendship, Eros and Charity. He adds to this the Christian scriptural reference that \\"God is Love\\" and then explores the religious aspects of love.Some of the scholarly breakdown twisted my brain a little bit and took multiple readings to try and untangle...as he expounded on \\"Need Love\\" versus \\"Gift Love\\", I was right there with him, but when he started putting forth various in-depth analysis between Venus (sexuality) and Eros (romantic 'being in love'), things started to get muddled...and when he broke into the chapter on Charity, there were a number of theoretical and rhetorical leaps that were difficult for me to follow at times.Overall though and in spite of moments of confusion, the general message of the book was good and well presented. He provided great insight into the differences between each of the categories presented. The concept of Affection vs Friendship in terms of what makes a 'real friend' was rather intriguing, especially as he continued his examples through love's progression to show how and why friendships are formed or fail to be formed, how and why friendships can grow into romantic relationships or not, and what aspect Charity plays in all of this.As with Lewis's other books, there is plenty of theological discussion going on. I don't agree with everything he had to say, which is fine, but I think he made some great points. During the last chapter or so as he speaks on Charity, he provides some great nuggets for us to think on as we think about our own charitable behaviors. He also talks about the idea of Charity being both a 'need love' and a 'gift love' and that as we engage in that paradox, we are growing nearer to God's love.I enjoyed the message of the book and the well thought out and well expressed arguments Lewis makes. The tone of the book was a little too scholarly at times which made it occasionally hard to read (since I've just finished school and am enjoying the break *grin*).Still, I really like Lewis's insights, research and writing. I enjoyed \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"Screwtape\\" and I'm looking into a few of his other 'theological'/'scholarly' works. He has a nice style and presents great messages without being overly preachy.****3.5 out of 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This was a great book. It looks (as you might have guessed) at 4 different kinds of relational loves.

This is a great book, very meaningful and insightful."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"I only read the chapter on Friendship, so my thoughts are limited to that. I rated this chapter two stars because Lewis defines friendships as sharing a common interest (side-by-side) as compared to marriage as face-to-face. This seems too black and white.In looking at it from a Christian point of view, Jesus never experienced marriage and yet seemed to have much face-to-face communication and relationship with his disciples and even with the pharisees. They didn't seem to have too much in common. Jesus' disciples came from all different careers and socio-economic backgrounds and yet they hung out as friends.I understand Lewis' point in that the level of commitment and closeness in a marriage should be unmatched, however it would seem dishonest and unloving of us to have friends and yet not be able to communicate face-to-face in helping build each other up, speaking the truth in love, encouraging one another, and so on.Perhaps the chapters I didn't read make up for the chapter on Friendship."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"This book has proven to be useful for the class I am using for.

I thought the author had some well thought-out ideas but meandered on the supporting arguments. The main idea being the ancient Greeks had four words for love depending on the type of love. C.S.Lewis analyses these types of love; Affection, Friendship Eros, and Charity. I suspect most readers will be surprised when they read what is included in each classification. I would recommend an audio version of book. The supporting arguments are better suited to the ears, which are more adept and can selectively tune-in. I plan on reading other books by C.S. Lewis. Hopefully the main thoughts put forth in the next book will also outweigh a writing style that does not seem to agree with me."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Everything from the love of a mother for her children to the love of husbands and wives is covered in this book.

Lewis is a great writer and one of the great accessible Christian minds but I think he got lost in his own theory in this one. This book has some great ideas and is very clarifying in the many senses of Christian love but Lewis gets very verbose and muddy in his heavy essay writing in the Four Loves. I think Lewis does better when he suggests or leads the reader to answers rather than writing and supporting his philosophy and theology in a straightforward manner. The Four Loves is still a worthwhile read but for a great Christain C.S. Lewis read try the Screwtape Letters first."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"There are two types of love... true love and mundane love, mundane love is mixed and can be given, taken for selfish reasons, true love however has no shadow of selfishness, but is selfless in the presence of the object of its/his/her lover. infact true love empties itself into the person or thing it is loving. just as some of us empty ourselves into the posts we put on amazon. And in emptying ourselves we are filled with the satisfaction that we may have shared a little understanding (truth).i have given this book three stars because this is such a monumental subject lewis is writing about, and also because it is very honest. he is clearly wracked by certain doubts as pertains to his somewhat 'evangelical' slant which gives so many simple, though often emotionally unsatisfying answers. this is a christian exploring deeper than the answers he has been giving in his previous books. Having met Joy Davidson in September 1952, this book was published in 1960, but he is certainly asking some very difficult questions for which a simple answer just wont do. not knowing the history of lewis i can see that he was brave enough at the time of this book to confront certain loose ends in his once over-simplistic theology. [on page 154 in the chapter 'charity']some excerpts from p 154: Harper Collins 2002 edn: \\"God carried in his hand a little object like a nut, and that nut was 'all that is made'(Julian of Norwich). God, who needs nothing, loves into existence wholly 'superfluous' creatures in order that He may love and perfect them... the buzzing cloud of flies about the cross...[and] If i may dare the biological image, God is a 'host' who deliberately creates His own parasites causes us to be that we may exploit and 'take advantage of' Him. Hererin is love. (are these not the views of some, and with these 'some', he is struggling in the chapter on charity, clear as crystal. infact this whole chapter is a struggle. i find it sad some have said, he denied his faith at the end, no, he found it at the end!)those of us who have watched and loved the film \\"shadow-lands\\", though i hear it is not an entirely accurate representation of things, can see something of the struggle that was going on inside his mind as to just what is 'love' and what love demands of us. his future wife, Joy, a christian herself, and a divorcee was a very profound thinker and challenged the way he thought, right into the marrow of his bones, to the core of his heart and soul. his simple little packaged answers to difficult questions, of which at one time he was so sure all came tumbling down when joy was diagnosed with cancer. he married her shortly before her death... much to the horror of a traditional and evangelical church. one just did not marry a divorcee in those days! in the film, perhaps the most moving scene is when he admits... \\"i just dont have any answers anymore\\".the four loves are the four greek words: agape (charitas), filia, eros and sorge. the one we are interested in here encompases and enlivens the other three. the one is \\"charitas\\"/\\"agape\\", we do not have a new testament in the original hebrew sadly, but it is in my mind a certainty that the word 'chesed' or 'hesed' is synonymous with the greek usage 'agape' and that the word charitas is directly derived from chesed. this chesed or agape represents true love, or as the jews understand it 'loving kindness'. loving kindness is the force behind creation and salvation in the mind and heart of the jew. this too would have been the word in jesus that propelled him and moved him to will and act as he does and did. he would have grown up a witness of the chesed between his mother and father, and the chesed he shared with his parents and friends, even his enemies and the chesed between God and his chosen people.as christians though, we believe that Jesus was and is the personification of true love. that is... Jesus is Chesed, Jesus is Agape, God is Love. we christians believe that it was Jesus the Word that created all (\\"by him, all things were made\\"), we also believe that it is Jesus who will redeem all. \\"for he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the 'whole' world.\\" (Authorised King James version-New Testament). therefore Jesus is chesed. it is only sad that we cannot read the original hebrew to see this word inscribed before our very eyes. not only is chesed a word, it encapsulates the true nature and being of God. I wonder if the cHasidic Jews realize just how awesome their nameing, and the 'full' meaning of this name chesed.the awesome, and i have to use this word awesome again and again, christian revelation is that God is Love. God is Chesed/Agape. some will frown at this... \\"is not chesed, albeit the highest of all Gods attributes, only an attribute?\\" No, we as christians believe that loving kindness is God. And what is agape? agape is chesed! and what is chesed? chesed is 'true' love, and what is true love? true love is 'loving kindness'.lewis points towards a jewish translation when he calls agape 'gift love', this is because, chesed is a giving, merciful love without strings attached. it shows and shares itself with both the good and the bad, the obedient and the disobedient. it is a free gift. Lewis pointing at a christian understanding speaks of 'Love Himself'. the personification of Love, being God. (one person within three).it is from God that all good procedes, gods love is found in all and therefore all are God, love makes divine, that which is not divine, thus speaks the language of love, without judgement. the language of logic and reason says: \\"ah yes, but God is 'that' i am\\". correct, the truth however always resides in a paradox. that God is all and yet perfect in and as one. love says all is one, reason says one is one. love says everywhere, reason says over there. love knows all, reason knows nothing. or love knows all, reason knows very little. logic, analysis and interpretation can only take us so far, the reason has its limits, we must be prepared to open our hearts. chesed is more than an attribute, chesed is one, and makes all things one. its tendency is to draw together and not to separate.this is the earth-mending teaching of the early church, but not always remembered. that God is love/agape/chesed. lets try not to forget it, so please help us dear father in heaven to remember this and live it by your chesed/yourself.perhaps the most significant thing CS Lewis ever said was on the last page of his final book - \\"A Grief Observed\\" (here on earth), and that is that he had a direct experience of Joy's mind touching his... it was an experience of mind that was he said correspondent with love. mind is love, love is mind. pragmatism (mind) and altruism interface with love and its fruits. the mind of love, the heart of love. most doctors either have a good bedside manner, thus facilitating the individuals own inner resources to heal, or a good practical manner, thus healing through objective means. the ultimate doctor is one who combines both bedside manner and mind... a snow flake paradgm. one may become a buddha, or a doctor, whatever his slant, but he should aim for union of heart and mind. There has always been the ages old debate, is it developing the mind or developing the heart that will lead to ascendance? actually one should seek to develop both.with loveing kindness, by loveing kindness, from, snow-flake. xxx"},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"The author is one of the most important theologians of the 20th century, although his scholarly discipline was literature. He examines four main types of love, with special concentration on two types of love he calls \\"Gift-love\\" and \\"Need-love.\\"Early in the book, Lewis identifies the humblest and most widely diffused of the loves, that is, the loves and likings at the sub-human level. Following an examination of sub-human love, he addresses a love that he calls \\"affection.\\" Affection comes from the Greek love word storge.The third chapter is devoted to friendship love, from the Greek work philia. This friendship love is the least of the natural loves, \\"the least instinctive organic, biological, gregarious, and necessary\\" (58). Friendship should be distinguished from community love, because communities require cooperation. Friendship love by contrast is free from instinct, free from duty, and free from the need to be needed. Following an examination of friendship, Lewis addresses eros. By eros Lewis refers to \\"the love in which lovers are in,\\" i.e., romantic love.In the book's final chapter Lewis addresses charity. Charity is \`Gift-love' and the primal \`Gift-love' comes from the divine energy. While Lewis claims that \\"to love at all is to be vulnerable\\" (121), he also claims that God is self-sufficient. \\"In God there is no hunger that needs to be filled, only plenteousness that desires to give. The doctrine that God was under no necessity to create is not a piece of dry scholastic speculation. It is essential\\" (126). Also, \\"God, who needs nothing, loves into existence, holy, superfluous creatures in order that He may love and perfect them\\" (127).After God loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures, God implants in those creatures both Gift-loves and Need-loves. Gift-love comes by grace and we call it charity. God also gives a supernatural Need-love of God and a supernatural Need-love of other creatures. It is through these two gifts that creatures have a longing for God and a love for others."},{"Title":"The Four Loves","review":"Doing a book review on CS Lewis' \\"The Four Loves\\" brings forth an entire new meaning on 'a writer's block'. To expound this extraordinary Lewis' work on the four New Testament Greek \\"love\\" words - storge (natural affection), philia (friendship, love), eros (attraction, sexual love), and agape (love, charity) - amounts to nothing more than a leaky version of the Cliff Notes at best. There are Lewis' scholars who could do far more justice to this work than I.The long and short of \\"The Four Loves\\" is this. The three \\"loves\\" (storge, philia, and eros) are stemmed from agape (God's perfect love). Each is fractured and flawed since the Fall. Underlying all that we do, in both good and not so good, are these shades of loves. All are a fragment of and a divagation from the origin. The agape. Our forms of love have fallen short and are in need of mending. Only God's love mends.If your affectionate other were to ask after a romantic candlelit dinner, \\"What now my love?\\" Don't sing. Lean forward and cup her hand, you segue to say, \\"Eros makes promises. Romance must die in marriage, and that marriage requires affection.\\" Saying this may or may not take you to places you've never been - for the better or for the worst.

The humor comes from the fact that the American family that buys the ghost along with the mansion takes him as being real and apply to him all the possible modern techniques to improve his life and make his sojourn in the mansion untroublesome for the new inhabitants. It is also funny because two young boys play all kinds of tricks to the ghost and there is no end in their creativity. But the story is also a little bit sad because it reveals the ghost has become a ghost when the brothers of his wife, whom he had assassinated, took vengeance and starved him to death. It also reveals that the ghost can be redeemed if love comes along and frees him of his misery and fate. And this love will come from the young daughter of the American family. She will naively open her heart to the suffering of the ghost and thus free him of his lot. This also shows how the attitude of the English owner of the mansion are just not interested in the suffering of the ghost, whereas the Americans will take this ghost seriously and will try to understand him and give him solace.

Wonderful stories by a good man."},{"Title":"Born Many Times","review":"Born Many Times is both the title of George McMullen's fifth book, and the name of the shaman spirit who provided the information to McMullen. Born Many Times, the being, relates details of his past lives, describes the extra-terrestrial beings walking among us now, and offers a glimpse of our future. McMullen, trained as an archaeologist, is &quot;an intuitive person who has developed the ability to see scenes from the past when I wish to do so, to communicate with persons who are no longer in body and to hear and see their life stories as they unfold.&quot; Prior to Born Many Times, three other Native Americans related their stories to McMullen. They're the subjects of his prior books: Red Snake, Running Bear, and Two Faces. (All three books are available from Hampton Roads.) He made his initial contact with Born Many Times while working with Two Faces. Born Many Times enjoyed many earthly lives. Among others, he was a companion of Alexander the Great, Cleopatra's tutor, and contemporary of Jesus. He describes how men first lived in caves, surviving on what they could kill. He tells how they learned to farm and how jealousies developed between those who had plenty of food and those who did not. Mankind has a long history of building great civilizations and then destroying them. He maintains that most civilizations were rebuilt with the help of extra-terrestrial beings, who provided the necessary technological know-how. These beings have not ever, and do not, intend any harm to humans. They wish only to help us. Born Many Times offers some predictions for the future, but cautions &quot;man can change his future, so therefore mankind has not really made his future yet.&quot; Nevertheless, unless changes are made, certain things appear likely to occur. For example, people must learn to care more about environmental damage if we are to survive. Even so, there will be &quot;food shortages . . .war and destruction.&quot; He later says &quot;there has to be better sharing of world resources.&quot; Born Many Times is an &quot;intriguing journey through a multitude of lives, making us behind-the scenes witnesses to unfolding dramas of the past . . . and future.&quot; It's a fascinating journey, and one that will challenge the beliefs of many readers.Sandra I. Smith, Reviewer"},{"Title":"Born Many Times","review":"Knowing something about both George McMullen's life and work, I feel I can provide an objective review for \\"Born Many Times.\\" I've read all of George's published books, and found them all enjoyable, although surreal. If you enjoy seeing who people are throughout history, where our kind has been, how we've lived and where we're going, then this could be your read. George and Born Many Times drew from many, many eras of human history in the compilation of this book. Which is not to say it's an historical volume which would be taught in a university.Instead it provides invaluable clues puzzles of consciousness which any open-minded student would appreciate. How people have lived throughout history, and some of the joys and tribulations they faced are what you'll mostly find here. Obviously, any book with a topic like this will always distill to questions of experience, belief and faith. One must assume there are people who can do the kinds of things George did, and souls like those of Born Many Times', and then dive into what they have to say and decide for yourself. You also have to respectfully decline the emotional, fearful arguments you'll hear from those who are uncomfortable with reincarnation for whatever reason, although it's a commonly-held belief worldwide. Reincarnation's not often a topic for which science has fluid conversations. But that could be a good thing, just as when metaphysics would never be expected to provide the final word on hard science.The writing style of this book is anecdotal and casual. That's what you'd expect from a family man whose occupation was parts manager for an automobile dealership. Among his leisure time pursuits it's reported that he fished and boated. Casual is what you'd expect from any good psychic who penned their own experiences. Intuitives don't write like writers, auto mechanics, scientists, journalists or attorneys. They write with whatever verbal style they acquire in their daily lives. Intuitives simply describe what they see and what they're told through their life's filters.George had particularly uncommon levels of intuitive ability. When combined with his integrity, everyone he worked with appreciated his skills and his sense of humor. His skills and predictions were tested many times in double- and triple-blind experiments. His information was known to be especially accurate among published, respected archaeologists and parapsychologists. This book is as natural an expression of anything else he did in parapsychology, just as when he worked with archaeologists like George Emerson or Stephan A. Schwartz. George was also acquainted with a few important people among Edgar Cayce's organization. I was also briefly acquainted with George, but waited many years to meet him. Instinctually I knew that when I finally met him, I had to change my cosmology to allow for the astonishing, unexpected experiences his work (and that of many others) so simply conveyed. He was a good man, and Born Many Times is an excellent book for any student of consciousness."},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw","review":"This was Porter's second work, a gothic romance that was preceded only by a children's story. A very popular early effort in the historical novel genre (first issued in 1803 and still in print), it is set in Poland in the 1790s and tells of a Polish exile and the failed struggle for independence. The novel drew on eye-witness accounts from Polish refugees and was lauded by the Polish patriot Kosciusko, an acquaintance of the author's brother, Robert. Porter (1776-1850) is best remembered for her later book, The Scottish Chiefs (1810), a work based on the life of Scotch patriot William Wallace. She was the sister of novelist Anna Maria Porter, friend of Hannah More, and others. Amazingly enough for a work first written 200 hundred years ago, Thaddeus of Warsaw reads quite well, and the characters are quite sympathetic, although men cry a bit more than in similar modern day novels."},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

It's a great story, great history and of course a lot of treachery and tragedy. I really enjoyed it. It is very long, must be about 1000 pages and the writer, Jane Porter apparently wrote it at a very young age, apparently in her late teens. Read it on a Kindle because you are going to need a dictionary handy because you are oging to need it - their vocabulary in those days was WAY bigger than ours today. There are many words in this book that I have never even heard of before. Critically speaking the author uses 100 words when 10 would do nicely. It's one of the best \\"stories\\" I have read, only surpassed by her other book written some time later called \\"The Scottish Chiefs\\", which was a truly incredible story based on William Wallace life. In my opinion her writing style is far better on this one, so it's slightly easier to read and follow.

When I was a child, I received this book and found it fun to search for Waldo, the Wizard, and the scroll (and even the various other items that are hidden in each picture). The most infamous part of the book is finding Waldo in a page full of Waldo clones (your only hint is that he's missing a shoe).I would rate this book as challenging to the novice, but of medium difficulty to the more experienced searcher.A genuine concern for a potential owner of this book is &quot;Will this book be worthless after finding Waldo in each picture?&quot; I would answer that as long as you do not write in this book, it will last forever.

While reading, I was forced to look at things differently than I ever had before. The ideological vision of integration is an honorable one, but the simple fact demonstrated in The Death of Rhythm &amp; Blues is that integration is forever indebted to black utility for white profit. It is likely that race relations in this country would be quite different if whites had not benefited from the talent and ingenuity of black athletes and performers in such a profitable fashion. This is ground that history teachers rarely, if ever, tread on. It is quite tragic to know that the unique and powerful black culture from which basically all popular music is derived, can be so easily forgotten or ignored. George's position is most intriguing in that it reminded me that history may belong to the teller, but there are many stories to be told. I consider myself fortunate to have heard this one."},{"Title":"The Death of Rhythm & Blues","review":"I've read a lot of books on musical roots in the last 30 years...to understand what really happened in the history of black music in America you have to understand what went down for the African-American in a white controlled enviroment. Mr. George holds nothing back and lets true history smack us all in the face. I would like to comment on a couple of points relating to white men playing black-roots music. Nelson commented that although Elvis was totally involved in black music ( and hair styles, clothe,etc.) that he essentially became a &quot;wimp&quot;. I feel his material got wimpy, because of the white-music-machine &amp; Tom Parker..but,I beleive the inner Elvis had &quot;soul&quot; in it's truest form. Then Nelsons examples of white boys who actually could play the blues 1. Eric Clapton, who I find leaves me cold with the text-book perfect licks pumped out with computer accuracy &amp; 2. Johnny Winter, who to my ear does the classic wanna-be style playing of &quot;more- notes-faster&quot;...typical of the white boy trying so hard to over compensate, that it loses what it was all about in the first place, FEELING! These are just small things that bugged me a bit...the book is not about white boys wanting to play black music...it has a much deeper and more important message...a very eye openning look at reality in the music buisness and the black experience...I will continue to read Nelson George, he is saying things I'd like my children to understand. People deserve to here the truth."},{"Title":"The Death of Rhythm & Blues","review":"Nelson George's best work, the book he was born to write. His most sincere and true book, everything else he has done seems experimental. I read somewhere that he was influenced by Leroi Jones. His admiration of Leroi Jones' Blues People shows through and through. If you enjoyed The Death of Rhythm and Blues, then you would enjoy Blues People: it reads like a prequel to the Death of Rhythm and Blues.Sadly both writers were content in becoming 'black writers' and perhaps it couldn't have been avoided. One wishes that Nelson George and Leroi Jones (since calling himself Amiri Baraka) would have followed up with biographies of some of the great musicians."},{"Title":"The Death of Rhythm & Blues","review":"the cross over dream and what it meant for R&B is still felt all of these years later.

I am giving this book a four star simply because there was a lot of jargon that made some sections hard to read, if you are not a musician. Then again, it is a book about music.Here are some excerpts that moved me:\\"Through the history of black music in the United States, it has been through the repetition and revision of texts, through the interplay of black language and black music in a long chain of Signifyin(g) tropes, that African American peasants became and continue to be the poets in a land that initially denied them the right to be called artists of any stripe. But poets they have become, as makers of the spirituals and the blues, as creators of R&B; and rock \`n\` roll, and as composers of works for the concert hall. It is clear from the nature of their texts and their tunes that the makers of this music--the repeaters and revisers of the musical derivatives of the ring--have privileged and honored the spirit of Esu as, for example, that spirit is personified in the redoubtable Harriet Tubman, who bid many thousands to come ride her train..\\" The only thing I can say is \\"preach brotha, preach!\\" - Big Sistah Pat\\"In the 1960s, gospel music became entertainment.\\" Interesting! - Big Sistah Pat\\"Sometimes when \\"new\\" sounds emerge in jazz they are perceived as foreign to the black-music tradition and, consequently, are unacceptable to many critics, mostly white, who reside on the margins of the culture. For example, John Coltrane's sound was strongly criticized as being inferior, but was applauded and appreciated by listeners from within the culture.\\" Ain't that some bull! De folks ise all dat matters!\\" - Big Sistah PatReviewer's Note:This comment reminds me of how the mainstream critics hate Tyler Perry. Yet he is loved and supported by numerous regular folks in Black American society. The so-called critics have no value to the folks that support Tyler's productions. They determine what is worthy of their support, not self appointed outsiders. He speaks to them and aspects of Black American culture they can identify.\\"In the late nineteenth century, the advertising of musical products became the primary means of developing, perpetuating, and communicating the negative images of black people in American society. The coon song was the vehicle for repeating these messages in American culture. The stereotypes perpetuated by these publications linger as both conscious and unconscious images of blacks in the memory of countless Americans.\\" What fool said that images aren't powerful! -- Big Sistah Pat\\"Essentially and most fundamentally, the African-American musical experience is largely self-criticizing and self-validating. As such experiences unfold, for example, listeners show approval, disapproval, or puzzlement with vocal and physical responses to, and interaction with, events as they occur. African Americans serve critical notice on inferior music making either by withholding their participation or, as in New York's tough Apollo Theatre in the 1940's and 1950's, by addressing criticism directly to the performers on stage. The culturally attuned are aware when the notes and the rhythms do not fit the context and when the idiomatic orientation is wrong; they know when an act is a Signifyin(g) one, when it is effective, and when it is not\\". You got that right. You know how well you are doing right then by the audience response. We are going to let you know. - Big Sistah PatI would recommend this book if you have a strong interest in learning about the origins and the evolution of African American music in the United States."},{"Title":"The Death of Rhythm & Blues","review":"Great and informative book on the pre and post world war I history of Black music. It is said that 'history repeats itself for those who refuse to study it'. Thus, this book actually gave me a historical understanding as to why Hip Hop is in the state it's currently in (dying). The only issue I had with it is that Nelson ends the book on the issue of Hip Hop when its obvious he hasn't quite done the proper homework. There was no mention of Kool Herc or Bambaata as the originators of the art form and instead the credit is given to DJ Hollywood declaring the \\"rap started in the discos\\" (it actually started in the STREETS of the bronx at least 10 years before it found it's way into the discos). HOWEVER, roughly 10 years later, Nelson authors 'Hip Hop America' (which I'm currently reading) and (so far) totally redeems himself. He has used the time wisely to reflect on his own historical relationship with the art form (having been one of the first, if not THE first, journalists to cover Hip Hop in 1979 - not to mention his monumental Source interview with 'the 3 Fathers of Hip Hop', Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaata and Grand Master Flash) and accurately depicts Hip Hop's organic and humble beginnings.Still 'The Death of Rhythm and Blues' is a MUST-READ for anyone seriously concerned about the future of Black music as well as the the Black community for, as Nelson bluntly puts it, \\"it is clear that Black America's assimilationist obsession is heading it straight towards cultural suicide\\" ."},{"Title":"The Death of Rhythm & Blues","review":"this book is very honest.10 years back the cross-over dreams achived by michael jackson,prince,lionel richie,whitney houston,janet jackson, and the rise of rap at the time put this book on point.cuz 10 years later rap has crossed over like the artist i mentioned and artists before them and though artists like michael jackson always had a cross over crowd many other artists have tried to hard to be pop accepted. and it's coast them careers and credibility.this book points out artists that have tried to hard to be accepted.also lack of black on black support as far as management,tour personnel,etcc.black radio and programmers.this is a must read very insightful and to the point.also it's my fave of his books cuz it predates everything that is happening in hip-hop and rap today not to mention the lameness that goes for r-n-b today.artist that tried to cross-over so bad have made it worse for todays r-n-b. this book shows that point and more."},{"Title":"The Death of Rhythm & Blues","review":"My favorite singer of this era is Percy Sledge who recorded the song, \\"When A Man Loves A Woman'; my favorite of all of his songs was recorded at the studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, \\"Take Time to Know Her.\\" He is represented at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at Florence, Alabama, and gave a concert in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, a few years ago. The demise of this type of music, I think, was the antics of The King of Soul, James Brown, and his prison time; also Ike Turner beating up on Tina. I could not stand for my young son to watch Michael Jackson on t.v. as Michael was so vulgar, always cradling his privates with his hands. What message did that get to young children? We did not know then that he abused young boys at Neverland. We all loved rhythm and blues.

The majority of the addicts were black and Hispanic. In August 1988, on Zachary's birthday, Jean-Michael Basquiat died in New York village of a heroin overdose at the age of 27 (Zach was 26 then). He was a graffiti artist whose pieces sold for $50,000 at the time of his death. There was a lot of debate about his artistic worth.This book traverses the years 1979 to 1989 in America and is mostly about the singers and groups in the entertainment area but also writers which proliferated during that time. It is the time of affirmative action and Clarence Thomas who was married to a Causcasian woman but courted the office girls and almost lost his nomination. I watched it all on t.v. The girl took all the blame, and she was honest and above-board, blameless.

With its cleverly ingenious humor that somehow mixes so well with its occasionally gruesome violence, this is a novel that made me wish I had written myself! I bought and read this book 12 years ago, and have recently unearthed it from a box that had been stored in my garage since I moved into my new home three years ago. This brought back some great memories, and I'd like to share them with you.Narrated in first-person by Paul Sheldon, a famous writer of cheesy romance novels (starring a heroine named Misery Chastain) who crashes his car in the middle of the snowiest winter in the middle of Colorado and is rescued by local nurse Annie Wilkes, who happens to be, as she immediately lets him know as soon as he comes to, his &quot;Number One Fan.&quot; She also happens to be, as he soon finds out, obsessed and dangerously crazy. Her care of him soon becomes a prison, one from which he knows he must escape, someway and somehow. It will prove to be difficult, as he is bedridden with two badly broken legs. When crazy Annie reads Paul's latest installment of the Misery series and finds out, to her horror, that he killed off her beloved heroine, all hell breaks loose. When she finds out that he did this to finally exit the romance-novel arena, and was working on a more street-savvy book starring a troubled teenage boy, she makes him start on a book entitled &quot;Misery's Return.&quot; As distasteful as this is to him, he is not in a position to argue his way out of it, knowing that Annie holds all the cards and has him completely at her mercy. After all, it's hard to argue with a big, strong woman who carries an axe, and who, by the way, saved your life.MISERY is a taut thriller that understands its two main characters, the introverted and reserved Paul Sheldon and yes, even Annie Wilkes in all her irrationality. King loves her even as he simultaneously (and hilariously) makes fun of her quirky speech, which he dubs &quot;the Annie Wilkes Lexicon.&quot; MISERY is a real page-turner (I read the entire 250-page book in one day) that is full of suspense and dark humor.

This, after putting out a series of books about the life of a woman named Misery Chastain who lived during the late 1800s. In the (planned) final installment, he kills off the character. Unfortunately, while driving under the influence in hazardous road conditions, he is injured in a car accident near a small Colorado town. Adding insult to injury, his rescuer happens to be his \\"biggest fan,\\" a forty-four-year-old mentally unstable former defrocked nurse named Annie Wilkes.

Over a series of months, her behavior towards him alternates between almost rational and completely insane, Nurse Wilkes' goal being to force the author to bring Misery back to life.

It is a world of cities, schools, books, government, laws, calendars, engineering, hospitals, poets, merchants, and warriors.The book is highly readable and positive. It is about the daily life of the people called the Mexica (incorrectly called \\"Aztecs\\"). The book is divided into chapters that discuss the structure of Mexica society starting with general topics (the city, government, laws, and social customs) and moving on to more specific aspects (birth, death, war, art, etc).I have read this book several times over, and each time I read it, I come away with something new. This book is like a miniature version of The Florentine Codex, a 16th century encyclopedia written by Spanish priest Bernardino Sahagun.This is an excellent choice for students who need to do a report on \\"the Aztecs\\".

Containing stories, essays, reviews, interviews, novel excerpts and poems, all with detailed, italicized annotations courtesy of the author, this book displays a massive, raging talent assessing itself and the world around it. It is sometimes poignant, sometimes maddening, but never less than compelling. I love this book.Today, Mailer's reputation is rather up in the air. To me, his career is an example of an artist constantly pushing himself, writing with breathtaking ambition even if it exceeded his skill. There has never been another writer like Norman Mailer, and it is touching to read here of his desire to write a novel on the level of Dostoyevsky, Mann and Tolstoy, and to read his pithy, sometimes hilarious assessments of his contemporaries. His commentary on the ups and downs of his career and his disgust and sadness about the decline of American literature are illuminating, but his self-aggrandizement and egocentricity are often difficult to stomach. However, one has to stand in awe at the monument of his talent and his passion.Reading this book today, one has to ask, \\"Did he fulfill his expectations?\\" I think so. \\"Harlot's Ghost,\\" \\"Ancient Evenings,\\" \\"The Executioner's Song\\" and numerous other works, both fiction and nonfiction, will endure, in my opinion. But I, for one, would like to know whatever happened to the self-promoted masterpiece of a novel he excerpts here.

Although Mailer complicates the relation of the work to the creator through an eclectic compilation of self-portraits, self-criticisms, and self-praise, this is still a deeply troublesome book. Mailer's self-aggrandizements probably did more harm than good, though it was clearly inherent in the psychology of his creativity. What emerges here is an interesting portrait of the self-creation of a writer-and writers who are interested in problems of method and strategy should read it, because Mailer makes you believe you can produce magic through developing the proper disposition. An esoteric work, with a wide variety of writing."},{"Title":"Advertisements for Myself","review":"Advertisements for Mysel"},{"Title":"Advertisements for Myself","review":"All during the 1960s, when authors still appeared on The Tonight Show, The Dick Cavett Show, etc, the two authors who had the most exposure and most proclaimed their &quot;genius&quot; were Norman Mailer and Truman Capote.

I thought I could escape from the gossip and innuendo that recently seems to plague our daily lives. I thought I could escape from those whose rigid thinking prevents them from accepting change. What I found was a pleasant narrative that reminds us that the &quot; old days &quot; aren't necessarily what we thought they were. Indeed, there are glimpses of what we expect to find back then i.e. visions of magnificent mansions, fresh, breathy carriage rides through the snow, gala social events, etc. What most of us claim we would like to return to. However, what I also found was a spoiled, stubborn and ego-centric main character who can't seem to accept change, who is as inhospitable as can be and who, along with some of the other characters, is greatly affected by flow of daily gossip and whispered secrets. Mix this in with the coming change from horses to cars and from a tight, immobile society to a more homogenous blend of classes moving into a more migratory lifestyle and you have conflict galore as society shifts its focus in the early part of this century. For me, not necessarily a &quot; I couldn't put it down until I finish &quot; type of book. However, it is filled with enough nostalgia and disharmony to keep me interested.

The Magnificent Ambersons can be a little difficult to appreciate because the book writes about a period far different from our own, with horseless carriages replacing those drawn by magnificent matched pairs of horses and social position counting for a great deal more than money. A modern novelist treating this period as a historical subject would write the book much differently. As a result, I recommend that you listen to the audio version in which Mr. Blaisdell does a wonderful job of capturing the mentality and emotion of the age.On the surface, the book is all about the downfall that always comes from too much pride, especially pride in one's position. Soon, however, you'll begin to appreciate that Booth Tarkington is also writing a social history in fictional terms that captures the changing of the guard from the \\"old money\\" of the day to the newer classes of wealth based on industrialism and merchandising. You also get more than a whiff of the problems that industrialization and the automobile brought to American cities. I was reminded of the Sinclair Lewis novels that so aptly capture similar changes that occurred slightly later.One of the best ways to portray the desirability of something positive, such as faithful unconditional love, is by portraying the consequences of its opposite, such as selfishness. In that sense, The Magnificent Ambersons is a marvelous portrait of how much pain selfishness can bring.George Amberson Minafer is a character you'll probably not identify with, but you'll be impressed by how well you come to know and understand his sense of entitlement and to be highly thought of for no reason other than bearing the family name. As pathetic as that sounds, Tarkington succeeds in making this spoiled brat come to life. It's an unforgettable portrait, one that will encourage any parent to be sure to instill better values in the next generation than his mother and grandfather did in him.Some of the expressions when acted out by Mr. Blaisdell continually cracked me up, including \\"Get a hoss\\" and \\"riff-raff.\\" Those expressions just couldn't be read in print nearly as effectively as they were uttered in the recording."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"The Panic of 1873 has many parallels to the Panic of 2008 including government manipulation of the money supply, over-extended commercial credit and a commodity bubble in gold.

A lot of people were ruined then, and they were just as ticked off about it as we are today. \\"Poor economic conditions caused voters to turn against the Republican Party.

This plays poorly in modern America as B.T. shows us. But he also shows us recovering from the Panic and moving on; justice is served.This is a comforting prescription for today.

I highly recommend purchasing another publisher's edition."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Set somewhere in heartland (actually, \\"Midland\\") America around the turn of the 20th century, \\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\" is a sharp and ultimately melancholy look at change. Founded on old money, the family's generations glide easily along in extravagance, until the cash runs out. Their unwillingness to adapt to new times and new industry dooms their lives of comfort and inertia, as their mansions decay and their neighborhood becomes one of common housing and polluted air.The protagonist is George Amberson Minafer, the sole inhabitant of the third generation and an insufferable snob. He gets his come-uppance in the end, but the Ambersons have fallen so far so quickly that hardly anyone notices or cares anymore. He's chagrined to find after the fall of the house of Amberson that his once-prominent family is not even mentioned in the city history of great family names. His mother is irrationally, almost beyond belief, defensive and protective of her little scion. It's no wonder he was the terror of the town for so many years.Booth Tarkington gradually clues the reader in that something's going wrong with the Amberson empire. He points out, mostly through Minafer's agonized thoughts, that nothing is permanent. The great fortunes and mansions that displace the Ambersons will themselves fade one day, and the customs and people one knows from infancy on will likewise shift. Midland undergoes a jarring shift from the wealthy and their poorer but settled neighbors to a bustling, dirty city of what Minafer sees as money-grubbing ethnic immigrants and incessant change. The old rich who didn't adapt fall victim to what one modern political commentator has called \\"creative destruction.\\"As if to underscore the transitory nature of things, Tarkington kills off most of the Amberson family as if it were itself somehow defective and weak. Minafer redeems himself somewhat at the end but only because of necessity. The few Ambersons who are left find themselves in a nearly alien culture that took only several decades to establish itself. Like Ozymandias, the Ambersons thought themselves and their way of life to be endless. Tarkington's rather bleak message seems to be that nothing is forever, no future is guaranteed, and that those who follow have no more claim on permanence than the mighty who have fallen before them."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Here is a story about true love.

To its merit, I did think the characters were well-developed; the depiction of the slow decline of the Amberson fortune and the surrounding town into a crowding city was absolutely excellent. My only real complaint comes from the fact that at times I just couldn't put aside a feeling of annoyance with the characters - some of their foolishness frustrated me. But then, I had to note that any writing that raises a reaction in me, whether good or bad, has to mark a good story. It should also be noted that the story and the characters leave an indelible mark on your memory...the story is as fresh in my mind now as it was when finished it a few weeks ago."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Few books look at the decline of old ways of life the way \\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\" does. Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer-winning novel is a sharp, brilliant, sometimes mocking look at the way that old money crumbled away when the industrial revolution hit, and the way those Gilded Age millionaires ended up. It's undeniably Tarkington's best novel.Georgie Minafer is the only heir and scion of the wealthy Amberson family, and unsurprisingly he's an insufferable brat. He doesn't improve as he grows up, believing that \\"there's a few people whose birth and position... puts them at the top\\" -- and his snottiness doesn't improve when he encounters and falls in love with an inventor's daughter, whose father was once smitten with his mother.But soon the Amberson fortunes start to change -- family deaths, loss of money, and the encroaching city that is swallowing up their estate. George continues to believe that he is superior to others, but this belief is increasingly strained as \\"the magnificent Ambersons\\" lose the last of their property. And George's only salvation may be the man he once called \\"riffraff.\\"\\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\" seems at first to be a tombstone to the Gilded Age's beauty and glamour. Then you realize that George is a pain in the butt, not a noble figure, and that Tarkington had little affection for that bygone age -- the entire thing is an ironic look at how the \\"old money\\" refused to change their ways, and got swamped for it. Tarkington takes aim at rrogance, complacency, idleness and other flaws.And Tarkington had a rare gift for irony. His writing seems a bit stuffy at first, with pages of details on clothes and parties; but as the Amberson fortunes fall, his prose becomes faster and more incisive. And the differences between idle \\"old money\\" and the poeple who \\"do\\" things becomes more pronounced, as well as the encroachment of machines and urban life into a once-elegant place. For example, the apartment buildings where the Amberson front lawn was.It's pretty obvious from the start that while this is George's story, he's not the hero. He's arrogant, pompous, and genuinely believes that he is next to royalty just because his grandfather is rich. Only in the last chapters does he finally realize that he's no better than anyone else -- when even the people who once loathed him no longer even remember him.The other Ambersons are humbler but no more useful. Aunt Fanny and Uncle George seem almost bewildered by their gradual downslide. And as a contrast to the formerly moneyed family, Tarkington provides readers with the car manufacturer Eugene Morgan -- George's opposite in every way -- and his sprightly, intelligent daughter.Even the title of \\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\" is ironic, and it suits this quietly biting novel about how the world changed at the start of the twentieth century. The best book Tarkington ever wrote."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"This is a wonderful book set at the turn of the century.

It's interesting to contrast those in the city who choose not to change, and those who decide to proceed and adjust with changes. The novel teaches us all a very valuable lesson about life in the end. The Magnificent Ambersons really is a great book. I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"It seems odd that this is a largely forgotten or ignored book, especially because many American novels maintain some greater popularity and are frequently taught, not because they are especially great books, but because they offer a revealing portrait of their time. In the case of The Magnificent Ambersons, it is hard to think of many American novels that create a more fascinating portrait of their time (in this case, America around the turn of the century) and are equally well written.The book primarily traces the fortunes of the Amberson family as Midwestern America transitions from a rural, small-town society with certain seemingly permanent social distinctions based on land, tradition and \\"cultivation\\" (a society based on who you are, i.e., \\"being\\"), to an urban society based on money and industry, where the social \\"ground\\" is subject to swift, seismic shifts (a society based on \\"doing\\"). The Ambersons are the embodiment of the \\"old\\" American aristocracy and, at least at the outset, their world and their position in it both seem solid, secure and permanent. The book does a marvelous job of depicting this older society, both in its heyday and as it rapidly disappears, including its elegance, its foibles and its arrogance. It does so not only through an on-going account of the city itself (which is a character in its own right), but through the Amberson family and the character of George Amberson Minafer, seeming scion of the most prominent local family, and cursed with the presumptions and arrogance of his position. Through the book, the family in general, and George in particular, experience a precipitous fall, as we see the old regime give way to money, industry, and, as George would say, \\"riff-raff.\\"In addition to the brilliant depiction of the transition of American society, Tarkington creates some truly memorable characters: George, his mother, old Major Amberson, the Morgans (the new generation of successful industrial inventor and manufacturer), and George's Aunt Fanny. On the Amberson side, it would be easy for Tarkington to make some of the characters thoroughly despicable, and we certainly have little enough sympathy at times for George and Fanny. (George is often absolutely hateful, and rather funny in his presumptions; Fanny is a work of art.)But it is one of the exceptional qualities of the book that we never entirely despise even these flawed and unlikable characters. We understand them and ultimately empathize with them, and we not only believe in but also celebrate their ultimate \\"redemption.\\"Similarly, it would be easy for Tarkington to too easily dismiss the presumptions of the \\"old\\" society or, for that matter, to damn the corruption and the dirt and the grasping nature of the new. Again, however, Tarkington does a marvelous job in creating a kind of nostalgia for things lost, and also offering some promise (dark though it may be) for the future to come, combining both \\"progress\\" and, just possibly, some of the more enduring values of the past.Perhaps the greatest thing about the novel is the author's tone. He is an ironic observer and accurate reporter throughout, but the book and his prose is infused with a certain humor, warmth, understanding and compassion that makes this a tender portrait, even at its most critical. Further, at the close of the book, Tarkington accomplishes something remarkable. Through the almost transcendent powers of love and forgiveness (the supernatural is rather amusingly invoked), the remaining characters are brought together and reconciled, and we do believe that they have come through and may have been redeemed.Overall, this is a fine book that deserves to be more widely read. It is an impressive portrait of America in transition and the American character in the early 20th century.One comment as to the edition. I bought the paperback that I believe is advertised here and it is one of the strangest editions I have ever seen. It appears it is virtually printed to order, includes no publishing history, and consists of some of the smallest and hardest to read print imaginable. Honestly, it is incredibly hard on the eyes so that you are really pleased to see pages of dialogue that at least break up the print. The proofreading or typesetting jobs also leave something to be desired. Rather than buying this funky paperback, I would try to find an older, used hardback edition. It could only be an improvement."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Assuming you have read the synopsis and a few other reviews, I thought a comparative review might serve as a change of pace. I purchased this book some time ago after The Atlantic ran a few reviews for early 20th century \`transformation' novels slowly reclaiming their place in American Literature. Included in that list were The Late George Apley, H.M. Pullham Esquire (both by John P. Marquand), Alice Adams, and The Magnificent Ambersons (both by Booth Tarkington). Booth Tarkington had the added honor of an article in the New Yorker discussing his merits (structure and theme) and his demerits (awkward prose) during his \`rediscovery.'Each of these books takes as its theme the cultural transformation of America in the early 20th century (less so Alice Adams), which I found appealing given what I consider to be a cultural transformation currently taking place. I can only hope I am not becoming as out-of-touch as the characters in these novels when I question society's direction. And if I am, I hope I am more George Apley than Georgie Minafer.I enjoyed both Marquand novels for their directness and humor. While The Magnificent Ambersons lacks these qualities (and their clean prose), its net effect is much more profound in my mind. The Marquand novels function as well-crafted time capsules rather than emotional appeals to the necessity of change. In today's world, it is easy to dismiss the codgerly annoyance and trifling social involvements of George Apley as the consequence of an East Coast aristocracy in decline. It is similarly easy to dismiss the honor-bound desperation and cognitive dissonance of Harry Pulham as the follow-on effects of Apley's generation, passed on to children faced with the Great War and the Great Depression. However, it is not easy to dismiss Georgie Minifer's behavior and ultimate \`comeuppance.' The reason is simple - his character is so completely worthless and needlessly arrogant that it is impossible not to HATE this character. It is impossible not to beg for his \`comeuppance.' Most frustratingly, by story's end it is difficult not to feel sorry for his character and hope that a better tomorrow waits him...the reader becines guilty of the very same motherly coddling which created Georgie's faults in the first place.As opposed to the Marquand Man who has simply been passed by a newer generation, here we have someone actually IN the new generation who scornfully rejects every opportunity to change. In the end, he is literally run over by his town's agent of change while pining for his symbol of the way things used to be. Most like the Marquand Man, he is actually returned to the bosom of the old world by simple virtue of being unable to function in the new. Does he deserve forgiveness simply for asking? Maybe. Does he deserve a second chance because he forces himself to adopt the bedrock principles which initially provided his family's fortune (hard work and respect for family)? Possibly. Is it fair to Apley and Pulham to reward a spoiled brat for refusing to give in? I don't think so.However, this is the point of comparison - it is the emotional impact of this novel that sets it above other transitional works in the same vein. Tarkington has captured one of the few truths of the human experience - some people never change. Tarkington has also created a much more effective message - change or fall into oblivion in spite of your most violent protests. This is the transition both Tarkington and Marquand were witnessing, yet Tarkington seems to have better anticipated impact. America does not bypass the elites because their time has passed, it bears down with the entire weight of its populace on those unwilling to innovate, work hard, and cast off conceits falsely placed in the achievements of their forebears."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is one of my favorite novels of all time.

George, the grandson of the rich and famous Major Amberson and his mother are the primary characters.George's mother worships him. There is not a thing she will not do for him. Her love for George, ultimately spells her own disaster. George, on the other hand, is very spoiled, superior, snobbish and self-centered.As the story unfolds, the reader watches the Amberson estate slowly fall. The unsuspecting Ambersons, do not realize this until it is too late. George, who has refused to learn a trade ( that is for common folks ) must learn to survive through his own earnings near the end of the tale. However he has been ruined through his own actions and winds up nearly friendless.A good book describing the rise and fall of families -- who are the center of attention one day and then forgotten in the next generation. The message of the book is that life is like sand hand in one's hands.

It is a rather simply story with few surprises. While its observations are keen, it does not reveal anything shocking - it's all rather genteel. One can consider it to be a lightweight version of material produced by the likes of Edith Wharton and F. Scott Fitzgerald.Bottom line: a very competent but prosaic study of late Victorian-era American life and value.

I could only manage thirty pages at a time before I had to leave off reading, cleanse my mental palate, and then resume the slog after a lengthy interval.The strange thing is that Booth Tarkington was a good writer. He had all the technical chops you could want--along with a definite talent for composing a phrase. But the godforsaken PLOT--Jesus. The characters are ciphers. You hate the protagonist, George Minafer, who is a complete caricature, and yet you have to spend time with him and his boring, pointless family. Genteel folk sliding into poverty. Even in 1918 that was hackneyed.There are clumsy and abrupt shifts in time, giving the narrative a disjointed aspect, along with ridiculous examples of factitious behavior. George Minafer may as well have marionette strings emanating from his shoulders. I didn't care whether he lived, died, or grew mushrooms from his crack. Deaths occurred when convenient, and...gah!Don't read this book, and if you're assigned it, get the CliffsNotes. Life is too short.

Having seen and loved the film (it rests in my top ten favorite films of all time), I was really anxious to read the novel, especially under the foreknowledge that the film adaptation (handled marvelously by Orson Welles) was ultimately butchered of the novel's increasingly forlorn catalyst by the studio and so, as I settled into reading Tarkington Booth's novel, I set myself up for a more somber and devastating ride.What I got was a masterpiece; easily one of the finest novels ever written.\`The Magnificent Ambersons' discusses just that, the Amberson family. Written in 1919, Booth's novel follows this family as they manage to imprint the stamp of their souls on life in early Indianapolis. Set during the dawn of the twentieth century, as the industrial revolution was beginning to rear its head, the novel dissects the fateful Amberson clan, delving into the young and rather self-interested George Amberson Minafer, grandson to the family's wealthy patriarch. Focusing on this young man, we follow him as he is brought up by a mother who dotes on his every want and desire, to his detriment, as she constantly shields him from the harsh realities of \`consequence'. Because of her unyielding affections, George grows up crooked so-to-speak, a man who is convinced in his own infallibility, completely absorbed in his own ideas and opinions, constantly forcing them on those around him. His faults are exemplified when he begins to show carnal interest in young Lucy Morgan, the daughter of a man who at one time owned George's mother's own heart. As George's father's health wanes and his mother's attention becomes preoccupied, George begins to meddle in a way that proves disastrous, causing heartache for everyone involved; even George.As the novel progresses the reader is completely consumed with the rich development of character. George is not the only one fleshed out completely, but everyone from Lucy to Eugene (her father) to George's mother and of course, the devilishly self-concerned Aunt Fanny. Reading between lines and identifying each character's most intimate flaws is so richly rewarding.Comparing the film and the novel would be a sad waste of attentions, considering that both are equally impressive while being vastly different. The conclusion attained by Booth Tarkington is phenomenal for it really delivers a well-rounded idea of who George Amberson Minafer was; a complete portrayal. That being said, Welles was able to extract something equally monumental out of his portrayal of the family, and so one cannot fault or prefer one to the other.Well, the novel is better, but that's just how the world works."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"If you have seen the opening of the Orson Welles movie of this book you have a taste of the richness of this novel. Welles knew quite alot about phrasing and the photography of words and he quotes Tarkington almost verbatim which is quite a tribute. The story is paced as was the time in a slow rhythm that quickens with the speed of industrial revolution. No need to go any further than to tell you that this is a book that follows a family and a city and the effect of change upon both. Beautifully written with a close eye to the character and calamities of men and women."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Booth Tarkington's masterpiece \\"The magnificent Ambersons\\" follows the fall that comes after the rise of the title-family. The very first sentence of the book we learn that \\"Major Anderson had \`made a fortune' in 1813 when other people were losing fortune\\". It may be a long way since his descents to waste his fortune but this day some time will come.The novel is a beautifully written chronicle of the loss of the innocence - that one must face when one loses all money and has to lead a different - poorer - life. The figure who will must suffer it is the Major's grandson, George Amberson Minafer. The money - first the excess and later the lack of it - will intrude his life. Having money has been a blessing and curse for the family. Lovers were torn apart because of it, marriages were made because of it.Throughout Tarkigton's narrative his characters are passionate and cold - sometimes both at the same time. For some of them, mundane interests are stronger than love and good will. These are those who will learn painfully the price of their choice."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"I think Tarkington's \\"Ambersons\\" is the first great Post-WWI American novel. Written in 1918, the novel chronicles the transition of the midwestern American postwar society from the contol of the robber baron gentry to industrialized, modern consumerism-- all personified in the precipitous decline of the Ambersons and their world of priveledge and social status.With a surprisingly dry and sophisticated sense of cynicism, Tarkington's prose shows the beginnings of the style of Sinclair Lewis, Hemmingway, and Steinbeck that became ascendant in the period after the war."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this book. From its imagery to its characters, Tarkington's writing shines in every respect. As the city grew, so did my empathy and my disdain, pulling me in different directions- a sign that the author indeed did his job."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Possibly what keeps Barth Tarkington from going the way of the Magnificent Ambersons, completely rolled over and forgotten by history, is that this novel is on the Modern Library's top 100 list of books to read. A quick look at the imdb movie database shows that a number of his works were made into films and starred such pantheons of the golden age of movies as Orsen Welles and Rudolf Valentino. An amazon check shows that he won the Pulitzer Prize--twice! As I was sick in bed without a book of interest at hand Tarkington was perfect: his was a free ebook easily downloaded. It is a regrettable that this towering novelist of another time has become rather obscure today.The Magnificent Ambersons excels in highlighting a rapidly changing time in American history: dress, language, style, breeding, importance, aristocracy and more all went through transformation as cities grew, fortunes were made and lost and life changed. These changes, seen and experienced by the author, an Indianapolis resident his entire life, are narrated from the living room (or parlor, or \\"reception\\" room) outwards. In the case of the Amberson family, the city they helped grow now thrives beyond them and their faltering fortune can't maintain the family as it swirls into obscurity and is surpassed by the modern motor car and sooty grime that defines the city. A touching scene occurs when the proud grandfather, stooped and aged, sits at his desk in his once impressive mansion going over ledger books to a gaslight while the boarding houses all around it have electric lights, and cars speed past the old stables where his rather now shabby carriage sits. Turmoil, Tarkington's previous novel that serves as a prequel to The Magnificent Ambersons, describes a midwestern city scene that could easily find a place here:And then, as the car drove on, the chimneys and stacks of factoriescame swimming up into view like miles of steamers advancing abreast,every funnel with its vast plume, savage and black, sweeping to thehorizon, dripping wealth and dirt and suffocation over league onleague already rich and vile with grime.The book's center is the grandson George Amberson Minafer, who grows up spoiled, proud, selfish and limited, and views those around him as riffraff. His goal to \\"be\\" rather than \\"do\\" prepares him for nothing, and his world view works to destroy him and undue his mother's last chance at happiness. The town in earlier years always wanted to see him have his \\"come uppance\\", (to get what was coming to him), and it comes casually, slowly, as his family is forgotten to poverty, and his own self importance is eventually shared by no one. That he is only 24 when this occurs, and has nothing to combat it but frayed pride, is pathetic. Amberson regrets that the new section of the town cemetery doesn't take into account that the older section holds the most important names, and views his uncle's entry into Congress for its ability to make family members ambassadors, allowing for easier family travel abroad. He takes all as his due, and offers little but arrogance in return. In the hands of a lesser writer George might be unbelievable or a caricature, but Tarkington makes him real, and George's failure to see beyond his own point of view is tragic.The book's only weakness is its ending. Those who can help him do so only when his mother \\"speaks\\" to them during a seance, and its wraps up the novel too quickly. George has by this time shown some redemption, but his lifelong obstinence is still intact, and his faltering attempts at apologies should not hide that the kindness being shown him is not due so much to a light at long last glowing in his soul, but rather the pity being shown by others whose character is far surpasses his own."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Story of brash, spoiled rich kid meanders a little, but the plot is original.

I can easily see why it won the Pulitzer Prize. For novels of this era, it is very faced paced, with catchy dialogue and tremendous character development. I highly recommend it. Moreover, if you are teaching a course in American history based on this period, or North American geography, you might want to consider using this book as a wonderful description of the urban and industrial changes that swept over America after the Civil War. This is the best novel that I have read yet that so well describes the changes to the American landscape occurring during this period. The only caution that I see that you would have to give your class is to be aware of the racist language of the time that finds its way into the book. There isn't a lot of it (nothing, for instance, compared to Huckleberry Finn), but still you would need to sensitize a group of college students to the language of the day. I have, of course, seen the movie, but it is irrelevant here. The book is the thing, and for free, you cannot beat it. There are typos as another reviewer has noted, but no more than I have seen in other Amazon free downloads, and nothing that rendered any places unintelligible.

Social life revolves around the Ambersons, as does the gossip, and the Ambersons set the bar with their sense of fashion and their lavish parties. The wealth and power of the Ambersons culminates in the patriarch's only grandchild, George Amberson Minafer. George grows up spoiled, arrogant, convinced that he owns not only the town, but also the world, and completely indifferent to the concerns and feelings of those around him. He has no idea that others frown upon his behavior, but even if he did, he would not care because he believes everyone should respect him and conform to his worldview.George is also unconscious of a world changing around him. He believes his family will always be powerful and rich and sees no reason why his, or anyone else's, behavior should change with the times. Although he attends college, he does not intend to enter a profession because he prefers \\"being\\" something rather than \\"doing\\" something. Secure in his reliance on his grandfather's wealth to support him, he fully intends on living life as a \\"gentleman.\\"While home from college for the holidays, George meets and falls in love with Lucy Morgan, the beautiful and sensible daughter of an automobile inventor and manufacturer. Unbeknownst to George, Lucy's father and George's mother have a long history extending to before the marriage of George's parents. George has no confidence in Mr. Morgan's business, believes automobiles are just a fad, and treats Mr. Morgan quite shamefully. Most tellingly, he ignores Mr. Morgan's prediction that the development of automobiles, trolleys, and faster transportation will turn the small town into a larger and larger city that will change everything George takes for granted.The novel elegantly describes the transformation industry brought to towns across America and the supplanting of old family money by new wealth derived from innovation and industry. The novel's descriptions of George's arrogance are written in a tongue-in-cheek manner so that you can almost hear the author's suppressed laughter in descriptions of George's actions and attitude. Towards the end of the novel, however, the mood becomes more serious as George's world turns upside down. Even though, like many of the people George interacts with, readers may despise his lack of feeling and arrogance, it is almost impossible not to like him, and, at the end, not to sympathize with his anguish.I would recommend reading The Magnificent Ambersons. It is a short, light, amusing read, but also a quite poignant read in its conclusion. It also perfectly describes the effects of technological and industrial changes on American culture and morals at the start of the 20th century and reminds us that these types of changes continue to affect our lives and relationships today.For more reviews, visit my blog, Life Off the Shelf."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"This is a wonderful wonderful book and like the Age of Innocence, both a document of its own time (1919)and of a preceeding time. The time in this novel both starts before Wharton's book, (maybe around the 1850s) through the Character of Major Amberson and extends past it with George Amberson Minafer. (early 1900's) And during this period we see not only the evolution of their Family but also of the town which at the beginning they are the patriarchs of, only to find themselves more irrelevent as the town grows larger and their fortune eclipsed by people who believe doing things are \\"rathah bettah\\" than being things. The characters are very engaging, especially the relationships between George and Lucy and Isabel and Eugene Morgan that form the double axis that turns the story. Behind this personal drama, Tarkington uses the rise of the automobile to show both how it affects the way people live their lives, and as a metaphor for the new fashioned industries that were changing America from a land of Ambersons to a land of Morgans. It doesn't have any lachrymose social commentary or agenda that distracts it, but the falling and rising fortunes of the two clans are integral to the story and shed light on the dynamism radically changing the country in the generation after the \\"Age of Innocence\\" This is a spectacular story.A word about the edition, like the titular family, this book seems to have suffered a radical fall from its pulitzer perch and this edition is perfectly serviceable. The print is a little big, and the margins sometimes don't make sense and its been edited I think for 21 century PC ears but otherwise its fine- bright, durable."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"A great novel - one of the greatest American novels but not as well know as it should be. George Minafer should be as well known as Gatsby. I cant imagine anyone not loving it."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Tarkington's novel of late 19th century change in America remains vital. He clearly documents the change from an agricultural/landed gentry to an industrial/entrepreneurial society. The changes are slow and subtle but transforming. Some of the characters embrace and capitalize on the changes, while others ignore, deny or are run over by the changes.George Minafer is a spoiled child of privilege. His mother Isabel is fixated on his happiness. She rejected her childhood love based on a trivial incident. She marries a traditional fellow, but pines for her teen love. She is eventually torn between the successful and wise auto manufacturer Eugene Morgan and the will of her own son. Her son George, of course, falls deeply for Eugene's daughter Lucy. Lucy falls for George, but she understands that there are many forces bigger than the both of them that prevent their desired engagement.George Minafer is easy to despise in this novel. He is a heartless, self-centered, unaware CAD who awkwardly pursues the honor of his family name. He eventually meets his match, but the reader, like his neighbors, can find no joy in his comeuppance.At a higher level, Tarkington contrasts the lives of those who succeed with those who fail, without providing a clue. The Amberson patriarch, uncle George and Eugene Morgan glide through life with heroic character. George M., mother Isabel, Aunt Fanny, Lucy and others lead lives of quiet regret. In THE land of opportunity and THE time of opportunity, some prosper and others don't. Perhaps Calvin's views on predestination reign.The CD version is very well performed."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"/Booth Tarkingtons's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of a Midwestern town and family in the emergent new era of the automobile and modern manufacturing is surprising on a number of accounts, for modern readers.Books written before the modern era of Television, are very wordy and descriptive. In the Amberson's, Tarkington dedicates most of the first twenty pages or so to descriptions of the architecture, the dress, the music and the morals of the era the early 20th Century. His work was published in 1918, and a reader can sometimes skip entire passages to get one with the plot, scanning here and there, only to ponder eventually, the complexity of the author's mind and intent. Nonetheless, the Amberson's can be scanned.The Amberson's are the wealthy, landed gentry of the Era, a family whose every action is the talk of the town. Nonetheless, the influx of immigrants from all parts of Europe, and their demand for housing, proves to be an encroachment upon the family land, fortunes and status.The book contains a subdued and very Victorian romance, but the book is largely romantic in the broader context of its meanings. The Amberson's do not work, except for such members as are engagaged in politics, and the management of properties. Young \\"Georgie Amberson Minafer\\" grows up in privilge. He is fawned upon by his mother Isabel, and although he may be dressed as a Little Lord Fauntleroy, the lad's pride and aggressiveness lead him to impose his will upon the town, such that there is hardly a citizen that does not wait in expectation for \\"Georgie\\" to recieve his \\"come-uppance\\".The tale Tarkington weaves is one of intimate personal family relationships, as well as the bonds of old friendships. By the time \\"Georgie\\" graduates from college, his conviction of superiority, and his intention to BE THINGS, rather than DO THINGS, reflects the common attitudes of his crowd at school.The story of \\"Georgie\\" is a story of an unevolved personality, which is selfish, haughty, and arrogant in its youth, only to trample upon the very love which insulates him within his own family.I believe the author has an important message, though the language and grasp of social ideas are from an era now so far removed, that his story may just as well have been set in the era of the Roman Caesars. Nonetheless, the story is good to know. For that reason, I have tried to justify \\"scanning\\" some of the more descriptive passages, rather than have a modern reader discount the story entirely.Tarkington particulary draws the romantic object of \\"Georgie\\" very well. This is Miss Lucy Morgan very well, in my opinion. I enjoyed the manner in which Lucy is able to permit \\"Georgie\\" to court her, while at the same time, recognizing clearly, that his character has obvious faults. Lucy, is not blinded by love; rather, it is love that illuminates for Lucy, the character of the men in her life./ There are some cosmological revelations in the book, and I find it interesting that even in novels proceeding right on up through the 1930's, authors were having there characters discover within themselves, mysteries of life, and profound truths. Sherwood Anderson is one such author who followed upon the era of Booth Tarkington's fame, who did this.I remember specifically at one point, when the observation was offered by the author, that there was a certain problem unique to the newly emerging 20th Century. It was something about everybody living in a kind of tract housing, where people never got to know their neighbors. This was peculiar, because I had assumed that this was a unique problem of the latter decades of the 20th Century, rather than the first decades of the 20th Century. It just goes to show you the powers of Booth Tarkington's insight into culture.Not all such revelations are profound however. They serve the popular imagination, of a populace which lacked a certain Theological sophistication.///"},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"I really expected to be bored by this book but I was determined to plow through in order to get more classics under my belt.

This is a great novel about a great time in American history.Major Amberson is the town's father, whose two main children, George and Isabel, never make corporate claim. A black sheep third child receives little fanfare, and actually is ostracized for fleecing the rich-as-a-pharaoh father while he is older and less capable of defense.Isabel's husband, Wilbur Minafer, and his sister, Fanny, are two other main characters. But, all take second seat to Wilbur's son Georgie whose pretentiousness coupled with an ever spoiling mother make him the poor little rich boy who all envy and despise.As little Georgie's escapades are blamed on his youth, the relatives bite their lips, roll their eyes, and look upon him with wistful eyes - only hoping that Georgie matures. He does not - at least for 90% of the book. Georgie is young and brash, and Tarkington reminds us: \\"Youth cannot be trusted for much except asserting itself and fighting and making love.\\" And, even his young love, Lucy Morgan, cannot relinquish her heart to this scoundrel, as she needs him to be more than a self-absorbed nihilist whose acts upon earth are unappealing and without benefit to all others.The plot has a little twist after Georgie's father dies and his mother, Isabel, and Lucy's father, Eugene, court in a very humble old-fashioned manner. But, little Georgie manages to spoil this incredibly fortunate event in his mother's life. By this time in the novel, Georgie is a man without more than a couple of friends.Arrogant Georgie manages to deliver unanimous opinion in an otherwise multi-opinionated town of numerous beliefs and backgrounds. But, \\". . . the most arrogant people that I have known have been the most sensitive.\\" We are left to wonder: does this include Georgie?When everything appears to be ready for the dumps, an epiphany hits Georgie like a lightening bolt, and he manages to become the new Georgie - better to the community or those closest to him than even his own people were. He shows us a sensitive side, and we can cry to his becoming a better person. He is as valiant and humble as the boy returning home from war.Like many books of this generation, we witness some rise at the same time and rate that others fall. The Amberson's fall happens while the Morgan's ascension occurs. Other examples exist: Georgie's character rises as his fortunes dwindle; and Isabel's health deteriorates as her happiness escalates.Sinclair'sThe Jungle, Dreiser'sSister Carrie, or Steinbeck'sThe Grapes of Wrathfollow that template.

I have never been a fan of socially conscious literature, and I anticipated a novel in the style of William Dean Howells - full of cardboard characters, most of whom would be down trodden and hopeless, or rich and ruthless, and enough moral pronouncements to make me feel guilty for at least a day or two. Thankfully, I let the Modern Library editors convince me that the book was worth reading.The novel is set during the dawning of the twentieth century and concerns itself with the impact of mechanical innovation on the bucolic life styles of a midwestern town. As the novel opens, the gulf between prominent families and their aristocratic lives are contrasted with those in society whose main purpose it is to support this luxurious and frivolous existence. The aristocracy is personified by the Amberson family, wealthy and prominent, and particularly by George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled grandson of the family's founder. He is unable to understand that a great revolution is taking place around him, that the lifestyle he has always known is soon to become anachronistic as those people with talent, luck and a little capital will soon surpass him in wealth and prestige. Although he has the talent to join this new mechanical age, he prefers to be and to remain a gentleman and to believe that \\"being things\\" is far superior to \\"doing things.\\"As the midwestern town grows and expands and becomes more and more industrial, and even as the Amberson family compound becomes surrounded by apartment buildings and factories, George is unable to accept the fact that he and his family are becoming irrelevant. As the town quickly turns into a dirty and depressing city and the Amberson fortune begins to crumble, he still dresses for dinner, still drives a horse and cart, and still holds to his standards \\"as a gentleman.\\" Tarkington weaves in subplots involving the love story of George's widowed mother and the Henry Ford-like Eugene Morgan as well as George's own romantic involvement with Morgan's daughter. These stories add a subtle ironic twist to the narrative as well as allowing the author to delve deeper into the consciouness of his spoiled (but sympathetic) antagonist.Although there is some of Howells influence in this book, Tarkington does not succumb to the artistic sterility of his mentor. This author is able to tell an interesting story and to develop characters that are not only realistic, but invoke an emotional response from the reader. And although the ending seems to me a little contrived and more in keeping with some of the \\"realist\\" writers of the early twentieth century, Tarkington's novel is, in the end, successful and offers an enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"\\"Magnificent\\" is the word to describe this book. Epic in scope, it follows the rise and fall of the Ambersons as the spoiled and arrogant George Minafer grows up. I enjoyed the somewhat melodramatic story and found many parallels between these times and the world of today. The plot is emotional and powerful, and it is easy to see why Orson Welles would have wanted so much to make it a film.What makes the book especially interesting, however, is Booth Tarkington's ability to understand and describe the changes going through America at the time. The setting is more than just a \\"character;\\" it dictates the circumstances of its inhabitants. It provides the foundation for the way of life they must live. This is not only a tale of George and his family falling from great heights, but also a record of how a small town grew into a city, how automobiles changed the landscape in which we live, how people were forced to adapt to this unsympathetic setting between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He writes mainly from George's point of view, so there is a romantic, nostalgic vision of how things once were, but Tarkington is not fooled into believing that technological and social change has not made some things better, just as he isn't fooled into thinking they haven't made some things worse. What the Ambersons saw as tragedy and loss, others saw as opportunity. I percieved no moral lesson or message; this book is about the tragedy and loss of a proud clan unable to comprehend that in an industrial age, life was no longer static.(There is also a good lesson in here on the risks of not diversifying your investments!)"},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"This Pulitzer Prize winning novel tells the story of the decline of the once magnificent Amberson family, the leading family of a Midwestern city at the turn of the century.George Amberson Minafer is the spoiled young heir to the Amberson fortune, but America is now entering the automobile age &amp; the conservative Ambersons are ill equiped to deal with the rapid changes.Tarkington intertwines two tragic love stories with the theme of the Ambersons decline and produces one of the really great forgotten novels that I've ever read.

A portrait of victorian excess, the Amberson's have everything and then more. Their house is the town's feudal castle. People on the street discuss their every move.Born into this world is Georgie Minafer, Tarkington's cartoon monster of spoiled and ego-ridden pomposity, who head is as swollen and vacuous as a balloon.Georgie not only possesses every material item he could ever desire: he also is surrounded by remarkble women: his stunning and angelic mother who would sacrifice anything for his happiness and his wise and beautiful girlfriend Lucy who loves him despite knowing better.Things change, the town becomes a city and absorbs the Amberson palace in a cloud of soot. One by one Georgie's protectors disapear and the magificence of the Amerbersons and everything he took for granted vaporizes like a dream. This leaves Georgie to ponder what he had, and those who knew him in the good days to observe from afar.Tarkington masterfully weaves humor, history and gripping emotion in this book. It remains a rewarding book after more than 80 years in print, largely because its meaning is eternal."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Who would have thought that a novel from 1918 would be such a page turner? Not to generalize, but there aren't many books pre-1920 or so that I've been unable to put down. Until \\"The Magnificent Ambersons.\\"Covering a span of roughly 20 years in the lives and fortunes of the Amberson/Minafer family, Booth Tarkington uses the fall of the family from its privileged social standing as a symbol of the blurring distinction between classes that took place in the country's urban areas at the beginning of the 20th Century. The Ambersons live in a stately mansion, separated from the outside world by vast lawns and gates, and gradually watch their secluded neighborhood overrun by cheap apartment buildings, increased traffic and pollution. What Tarkington does, nearly 80 years before the actual phrase came into common usage, is address the problems associated with urban sprawl.The book has two of the most colorful characters ever put down on paper: Georgie Amberson Minafer, the spoiled brat protagonist who fights most fiercely to retain the family's position as one of the most distinguished in the city; and Aunt Fanny, the manipulative spinster who doesn't understand just how serious the consequences of her gossiping and meddling (to her merely distractions from the boredom and tedium of her life) can be.I surprisingly felt much sympathy for Georgie. He can be odious at times admittedly, and more than once you want to see him slapped silly, and at one point in the novel you honestly begin to wonder if perhaps he's mentally ill, so extreme are the measures to which he will go in the sake of what he thinks is protecting his mother's good name. But by the time the novel ended, I couldn't help being won over by him. He's got an overbearing personality, but I shared his opinion of the ugliness he sees sprouting up around him. His obsession with a time gone by springs from naivete, and as he grows over the course of the novel, he experiences a shift of priorities, as all adults do as they become adults.In many ways, Tarkington's novel is about dealing with maturity and the occassional disillusionment that can accompany it. There's a beautiful passage in which Georgie's uncle George (Georgie's namesake) explains that youth can never understand the triviality of the things it takes so seriously (status, passion, success) and will never be able to understand it until youth has become middle age. And Georgie's grandfather, responsible for the wealth of the family, realizes on his deathbed the ultimate uselessness of all the material goods he has acquired over a lifetime.If you would like to see a good film version as a companion piece to the novel, see the 1942 Orson Welles version rather than the A&E; version from a few years ago. Welles' film is butchered and as a result tells only a very truncated version of the story, but it gets the tone just right, and Agnes Moorehead's dead-on portrayal of Fanny is one of cinema history's highlights. The A&E; adaptation, meanwhile, is dreadful.But please don't let either of these film versions take the place of the novel itself. It lingers in the mind long after the final page has been turned."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"If you take The Modern Library's list of the 100 greatest books of the century, and turn it on its head, so that &quot;The Magnficent Ambersons&quot; drops two worthless zeros, the list suddenly becomes much more meaningful. (Though you'd still have a hard time justifying Ulysses's presence even at number 100).&quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; is too often forgotten completely (rather like its brilliant author), but it is a deep and thought-provoking book nevertheless.A reviewer below was of the opinion that nobody would enjoy this book who was not a fan of early 20th-century period pieces. I disagree. This is a book primarily about human beings and human nature, and as such its theme is universal and timeless. Certainly it has a setting (early 20th-century Indiana), but what book about people does not? And how many people are not influenced, as the Ambersons are, by the events and movements of their time? This is to be expected in any book. But this book focuses mostly on individuals, and their strengths, weaknesses, characters and behaviour, to which readers from any age can relate."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Here is a fascinating book. We start off essentially empathizing with the scornful people who look on at the main character, root root rooting for his demise. As the story progresses it is difficult to not go on truly hating George Amberson Minifer, if only because of a natural distaste for the self-important and the snobs that roam around unenchanted but clearly not aware of this. However, as the story reaches its end, I found it impossible to not actual feel something for this jerk, for his oblivious family and more all the mistakes they made that were obvious to everyone except for themselves. Perhaps this is the truest merit of this wonderful book: such a capable and compassionate understanding of even the worst people (to my mind) that we cannot help but humanize the villains and grow to understand some part of their desperation and yearning for what could never be.A wonderful, truly affecting novel that will linger for a very long time--"},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Set in the early 20th century, this is Booth Tarkington's classic novel about the decline of an American family. The novel won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize in fiction.Major Amberson had established a family fortune by buying and selling land. His children become social drones. One son (unmarried) goes into politics. One daughter and son-in-law wait around for their inheritance. The other daughter marries Mr. Minafer, who has some success in business, but loses his money to bad investments. The main story is about George Amberson Minafer, the only grandchild, who is spoiled as a child and grows up arrogant with the assumption that he is from an upper class family and will never have to work.The family are large frogs in a small puddle and, alas, fail to keep up with a changing society. They are left behind in the dust. The people George Minafer looked down upon become successful in the new industrial climate, while George's family fortunes decline. Eventually George finds he has to (gasp) find a job to support himself and an aunt.The novel is slow reading, but is worth the effort. Many students, unfortunately, are like George, and would probably not like to make the effort. As a moral lesson, be careful who you insult. If your fortunes decline, you may end up working for them."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"The Magnificent Ambersons is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to a bygone age; a time when there were only two social classes, \\"gentlemen\\" and \\"riffraff,\\" where ascots were worn to dinner and the horseless carriage was considered a passing fad. Set in a growing Midwestern town at the end of the nineteenth century, Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer winner (one of two, in fact) is the story of George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled and arrogant heir to the family 'magnificence'. Once the most important family in the rapidly growing town, the Ambersons are oblivious to their increasing irrelevance, and as industrialization and democratization take hold, little Georgie finds himself stubbornly maintaining his self-importance in the face of a changing era.In spite of George's utter nastiness at times, Tarkington has somehow managed to portray him as a sympathetic character. As he bull-headedly marches through life defending the family name and honor, one cannot help but feel sorry for this anachronistic gentleman who believes that \\"being things is rather better than doing things.\\" The disintegration of the Amberson way of life is inevitable but drawn out, and hot-headed young George manages to completely miss the foreshadowing that Tarkington skillfully employs.The author creates conflict not only between George and the unworthy (just about everyone else), but also in the various subplots; George's tempestuous romance with the daughter of a local Henry Ford-like automobile engineer, his antagonistic relationship with his spinster Aunt Fanny, and his relationship to his doting, child-like mother. This secondary cast of characters is richly evoked, and their interactions are often heartbreaking. One of the most enjoyable aspects of The Magnificent Ambersons is Tarkington's clever dialogue, and his acerbic wit is amply sprinkled throughout the characters' various interactions. At times, the humor is laugh-out-loud funny, and will appeal most to readers who love the subtle cuts and parries of Gilded Age conversation.I would likely never have picked up The Magnificent Ambersons had it not been included in the Modern Library's Top 100, and in fact was slightly surprised upon finishing the novel that it made the final cut (albeit barely, sliding in at number 100). While I found the book to be well-written, entertaining and evocative, I felt it lacked a more long-term resonance. While I thoroghly enjoyed it, I didn't find myself gripped by the book's ideas long afterwards. My only complaint was that the ending felt a bit abrupt. Regardless, Tarkington's ability to offer a subtle commentary on a vanishing era are part the reasons for his sustained relevance, and his influence on American Realist authors like F. Scott Fitzgerald is obvious throughout the novel. I will most certainly be investigating more of Tarkington's work, and highly recommend that readers discover for themselves whether Georgie gets his \\"comeuppance.\\"~Jacquelyn Gill"},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"A Magnificent Book about the changing fortunes of social class in America in the period following the end of the Civil War to the early part of the 20th century, a time of rapid change in America. It examines three generations of an aristocratic mid-western family the Ambersons as they cling to the old ways and are \\"run over\\" (literally) by the rise of a new money industrialist class (\\"riffraff\\"). Written in 1918 by Tarkington who was born in 1868, just at the end of the Civil War, he lived and saw in person the changing fashions and changing way of life brought on by the industrial revolution: from small towns with horses to modern industrial cities with cars and factories. The Amberson family is a metaphor for a class of people who get their \\"come-uppance\\", as the path to success changes from heredity to meritocracy during the industrial revolution and its socially democratising effects in America."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"This novel by Tarkington won the 1919 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. Actually, this is the second novel in a trilogy (the other two being &quot;The Turmoil&quot; (1915) and &quot;The Midlander&quot; (1923)). The novel chronicles three generations of a leading family in Indiana, including their period of decline. Major Amberson, who had earlier acquired a fortune, is the dominating head of a socially prominent family in the midwest U.S. His daughter Isabel is in love with Eugene Morgan but, through a misunderstanding, they break off their relationship. Isabel marries a man with whom she has little feelings and gives birth to a son, George, who grows up conceited and arrogant. Eugene, now a widower, returns to the midwest with his daughter Lucy and starts up an automobile factory. Lucy falls in love with George and Isabel and Eugene begin seeing each other again. But, George is appalled that his mother is considering marrying someone outside of their class. He takes her overseas to prevent the marriage but later brings her back when she is dying. The Amberson's fortune is now depleted, George is forced to start working for a living at a chemical plant, and his old friends appear to applaud his \\"comeuppance.\\" But, after an automobile accident, George, Eugene, and Lucy, who still is in love with George, are reconciled. The story of the Ambersons represent the changes that U.S. society has undergone, particularly near the turn of the century: those in upper society who earned their places by heredity are slowly being replaced by those who earned their position by their achievements in industry, business, and in finance (that is, by their own labors). George had been unwilling to change. Perhaps it is appropriate that it is an automobile that forces him to realize this. In July of 1998, the editorial board of the Modern Library listed this book as one of the top 100 novels written in the English language for the twentieth century. I do feel that a response is needed to Mr. Ted Ficklen of St. Louis (of Aug. 12, 1998) who gave the book a poor review. I certainly was not an English major yet I read &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; long before the Modern Library list had come out. And, I knew of Booth Tarkington; the Penrod books were on my shelves when I was a kid.

If you don't, then you won't like this novel because it is representative of this period. The story itself, with its moral lesson, it common for this era. That may annoy you if you don't like that moral lesson stuff. What sets this novel apart from its contemporaries is that the writing style is easy, fluid -- a style that can be appreciated by any writer or reader of any age. If that doesn't grab you, then it is also interesting as a period piece -- gives good insight about life and times during that era. Among the many authors I have read who wrote during this time and about their day and age, Tarkington is quite good and this book in particular was enjoyable to a reader who likes this genre."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"The key context point in this novel was that it was an American novel written in 1918. This puts certain constraints on it that make it very different from a lot of literature written from later in the 20th century.I didn't really like the beginning of the book as the story was very typical. It was a story of a mannered, hierarchical society in a midwestern U.S. town. The lead character is a brash young man who has grown up with a great sense of entitlement and arrogance. His family, the Ambersons, are the most wealthy and influential in the town and he feels above the common people. His mother is a well beloved person who makes a positive impression on everyone. Her great fault is that she only sees her son as an angel even though he is a much disliked snob. Virtually everyone is waiting for the point at which he will be put in his proper place.The second half of the book is much more interesting as George, the arrogant Crown Prince of the Amberson family starts to have things go against him. The girl he loves doesn't approve of his attitude. He becomes very concerned with his mother's reputation and as things start to go against him, he tries to control things through position and force of will. The more he struggles, the more things go against him.An important backdrop to the Amberson events is the transformation of American cities due ,in no small part, to the advent of the automobile. The automobile causes city cores to be less desirable as people can more easily travel further from the cores and away from the pollution. This is a contributor to basic societal changes.As the changes occur, the Amberson family becomes less and less influential and George, the Crown Prince, continues to struggle. His decline, struggle and ultimate redemption (sort of) make the second half a very interesting read.Again, it is important to look at this book in the context of the time. I enjoyed it and found the perspective from that time to be interesting.I recommend the Magnificent Ambersons as a good reflection of the time and place it was written in."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"Booth Tarkington can be considered one of the best commentators on life in the Midwest (Indiana, specifically) in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century; he observes with insight and humor and is a consummate storyteller. \\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\" is the story of the decline and fall of a wealthy family and its selfish last scion; its subject matter is a long way from the comic material of \\"Seventeen\\" and the \\"Penrod\\" tales, but it exhibits the same stylistic qualities.The dynasty is begun by Civil War hero Major Amberson, who, having amassed a fortune by means the novel does not disclose, builds a vast estate, including an opulent mansion and diverse statuary, on the edge of his small Midwestern town. His daughter Isabel marries a local man, Wilbur Minafer; their son George (named after his carefree, jovial uncle, who is never fazed by disappointments) proceeds to become the novel's central character.An only child, and the Major's only grandchild, George Amberson Minafer is, not surprisingly, spoiled rotten by his parents and grandparents, who condone his misbehavior and refuse him nothing. He grows up conceited, arrogant, pugnacious, rude, and demanding -- in other words, he is perfectly poised to inherit the executive responsibilities of whatever his grandfather's business is, except that he has no interest in business, nor any professional aspirations at all. He expects to spend the rest of his life as a proud member of the idle rich, and has no qualms about provoking the envy and animosity of the townspeople, whom he terms \\"riffraff.\\"The novel's drama is augmented by the introduction of a widowed automotive pioneer named Eugene Morgan, who was once Isabel Amberson's suitor and attracts George's naive, fragile aunt Fanny. George doesn't like the guy from first sight and scoffs at his entrepreneurial efforts, even while he is going out with his pretty daughter, Lucy. While Morgan turns his dreams of a lucrative automobile business into reality, George and the Ambersons discover that their finances are depleting as the changing industrial and commercial trends gradually expel them from the elite of the growing city. However, Tarkington saves the novel from becoming a Dreiseresque descent into despair and misery by offering a sympathetic reprieve to his beleaguered protagonist at the end.This is the kind of story that could have been expanded into a massive multi-volume epic, but Tarkington wisely avoids unnecessary detail, minor characters, and subplots, retains the core elements that define the personalities of the main characters, and yields a succinct novel that feels complete and comprehensive. It is a novel with a formula, to be sure: a sort of Horatio Alger in reverse; but Tarkington measures the impact carefully with taste and restraint."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"I read it as a bookclub book.

With one main character representing old-money tradition and another representing new-money industry and technology, the conflict grinds down a family and makes another surge, Tarkington's family drama personifies what was happening as our world industrialized and became dirty with new money. I also recommend for anyone with problem adult stepchildren. The best of this book: the loathsome character, George Amberson Minafer, who is so real, you feel as if you've met him somewhere along the line. A great read. Next I'll try the other two books in this three-book series."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"This excellent novel has many facets. It is the engrossing story of George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled heir-apparent of the richest family in a Midwestern Town just after the turn of the 20th century. It is also a nostalgic and sentimental remembrance of a slower and more elegant time, when well-to-do young people courted by taking carriage and sleigh rides, attending frequent formal dances, and writing letters. Finally, it is an examination of how \\"progress\\" and the changes it brings affect society as a whole, and can, in fact, bring an entire way of life to an end.If Tarkington had ignored the last two aspects of the novel, this would still have been a compulsive read, because of his skill in delineating the character of George, who is so insufferably prideful and arrogant that many who know him long for the day \\"when that boy would get his come-upance.\\" Yet, the reader still feels some sympathy for George, because Tarkington reveals that his actions have been almost predetermined by his family members, particularly his mother, who \\"just fell down and worshipped him from the day he was born.\\" If nothing else, this novel contains a powerful lesson about spoiling a child and letting him believe that he can do no wrong and is the center of the universe.In many ways this novel is somewhat dated, particularly in the tone, which is somewhat humorous and mocking, but in a very fond way, as one would talk nostalgically about a beloved dead family member, remembering faults and eccentricities along with admirable qualities. This is not a tone I see in today's novels.In another way, this novel is very pertinent today, because once again America has gone through a \\"revolution.\\" The Industrial Revolution and its most obvious product, the automobile, changed George Amberson's world. The Information Revolution and its most obvious product, the computer, has changed our world. In George's world, the change led not only to the disappearance of the horse and carriage, but also to a change in society as a whole. In our new information world, many of the old aspects of society are also passing away.Back to the plot of the novel for a moment: the ending seems weak, almost as if an editor had said, \\"Booth, you must have a happy ending.\\" A very strong plot and strong characterization seem to fall through in the last pages.Still, highly recommended.

Maybe that sounds common, but you'll know what I mean when you read it and if you can describe it better, more power to you. Also, it's a fascinating look at the time, around the turn of the century (1900). The rise of automobiles and of the 'suburb', the different customs and manner of dress and speak were all endlessly interesting to me, at least. The best part was that it was free.

The crux of the action in the story really centers on the manners and norms of the day and I was unable to muster any sympathy for two adults who forego their own happiness to appease a spoiled youngster.If you, like me, are keen to work your way through Pulitzer prize winning novels, then do put this on the list, otherwise, take a pass."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"I began my journey of reading the top 100 novels according to the Modern Library with this tale by Booth Tarkington of an aristocratic family's rise and decline following the American civil war. Taking place in Midland, at the beginning of the novel the Ambersons, headed by its patriarch the Major, are the talk of the town. Everything in town seems to surround them and in fact the family is at the center of the town.The novel focuses on the third generation of this family, George Amberson Minafer. Described in his teen years as almost a men among boys, the author sets him up as a thoroughly unlikable person. When Tarkington talks of how seemingly everyone in Midland wants the spoiled, rich, only-child of Isabel Amberson to \\"get his comeuppance,\\" the reader is naturally included in that group.However, the brilliance of the novel lies in that as it progresses, we see George gradually grow in very slight and subtle ways. When inevitably tragedy does befall him, we've found ourselves sad to see it happen. Dislike for the character in the beginning over the course of 250 pages evolves into feelings of encourage, pity and paternalism for the character. It is not until the end that we see just how much George really has changed.Tarkington also does a tremendous job really painting a picture of how Midland changes from the time of George's birth to his early adulthood. We see how the city has changed, not just physically but also culturally. The small world at the beginning ceases to be by the end. It is through these descriptions of the people around George and his family that we really see the social commentary of Booth Tarkington come to life. Written in 1918, the books primary setting is the turn of the 20th century and speaks to the author's regard for the rapid urban sprawl of the time as well as technological advancement.All and all, The Magnificent Amberson is a great read and one where the reader will find themselves enjoying a variety of rich characters tremendously."},{"Title":"The Magnificent Ambersons (Library of Indiana Classics)","review":"If you're a movie fan, you've probably seen the Orson Welles movie version of this novel, or at least seen scenes of it in various retrospectives.

The hardest thing to convey in a fetish story is the sexual connection, but Lisabet brings you inside the mind of a man with a fire fetish and lets you feel the attraction. Creepy? Yeah.

His imagination always amazes me; he animates and describes the world in a way that renders it both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. We know the world in which he is writing, but it is also made to feel foreign and new to the reader. An example is his description of a forest which controls its own pathways. The path itself he animates and has it galloping along in front of his characters.This book is filled with nuggets of insight, not only into the world around us but into people, their beliefs, and their desires. He takes time to show how his characters live, eat, sleep, etc. even while they are in the midst of a trying, wildly changing environment. It is this patience mixed with his well-developed fantastical/sci-fi world, along with his seamless writing, that make this novel exceptional.I would recommend it to people who are not used to reading science fiction or fantasy because it crosses all genre boundaries, mixing the two genres above along with realistic fiction issues and mythological ideas."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"I have loved Sean Stewart's writing ever since I picked up _Passion Play_ on a whim because the store I was in happened to have an autographed copy.Wow._The Night Watch_ is beautifully, delicately written: it's a novel that I found to be compulsively readable, not only because of the interesting concepts set forth in it, but also because of the laugh-out-loud humor I occasionally found, the plotline as a whole.Stewart is never predictable: he always finds a twist, so that even when his stories seme to follow the usual route, they always take a turn so not everything turns out as you expect._The Night Watch_'s blending of modern and ancient, politics and interesting characters make it a book that is worth reading even if you have not read _Resurrection Man_, in whose world it is placed. In fact. I did not even realize it was written in the same world as another book until I read the advertisements at the end of the paperback!Recommended, if you like interesting political interplay, and enjoy the sheer beauty of words spread across the page by a master."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"Most &quot;genre&quot; fiction is pretty limited in the sense of literary style. Let's face it, your average science fiction/fantasy/horror/thriller novel may be entertaining, even meaningful, but rarely stands out as a craft of language and structure.In &quot;The Night Watch&quot; I was pleased to find both a good story and an excellent example of literary craft. Some passages of the novel read like poetry, with a cadence and a cunning use of language that somehow moves the story along at the same time as it makes the reader pause and admire.Chapter 12 was one part in particular, in which the bodyguard Jen is practicing his martial arts moves to distract himself and trying not to attract the attention of a local demon, and as he goes through his moves he remembers his past. The end of this chapter is both beautiful and deeply disturbing. This chapter by itself makes the book worth reading, to me. It is one of the best examples of Stewart's excellent use of language, but there are many others throughout the book.I loved seeing how magic and technology were incorporated in the book, and how they sort of became one and the same in some instances. It reminded me of Tim Hunter's experience in the far future of Neil Gaiman's original &quot;Books of Magic&quot; miniseries, in which magic and technology have become so intertwined as to become indistinguishable. I remember something along the lines of &quot;computers made up of a net of spells.&quot; Think also of Arthur C. Clarke's line: &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; Sean's idea of combining the two may not be completely new, but he carries it off very well. Better than most, I would say.For its craft and its excellent story, &quot;The Night Watch&quot; is well worth finding and reading, and Sean Stewart is certainly a writer to be watched."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"Sean Steart's &quot;Night Watch&quot; is a wonderful blend of old world oriental mythology, new world scepticism, and cybertechnology struggling to gain a toehold in a world gone haywire. The characterization is the key in this book; no one is so good they're beyond belief, and no one is so bad that you can't feel for their plight. I wish for more from this enigmatic world of Mr. Stewart's."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"This book shows the depth of Sean Stewart's writing -- the Chinatown sections in particular are as delicate as blown glass. Stunning. This is a book full of vision and ideas supported by a brilliant writing style. However, ultimately, the technical beauty of this didn't overcome, for me, an unfocused story ... I didn't feel there was a satisfying climax, though the book still remains, in parts, some of the best work I've ever read. When Sean Stewart hits his stride by locking down an absolutely coherent story, he'll be unstoppable."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"A post-magical apocalypse political thriller and story about succession and inheritance in several senses.Stewart writes beautifully and creates original, well-detailed worlds. There were two aspects of this book that didn't work so well for me: first, the political thriller plot became incoherent, and second, the Chinatown culture seemed stereotypical (martial arts, empty cups of tea, whatever). On the other hand, I loved his evocation of the North Coast forest, and the way the elegance of his descriptions is grounded by down-to-earth characters and moments of humor.I'd recommend this, but not as strongly as GALVESTON or CLOUDS END."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"-One thing I've noticed is that Stewart's fiction tends to polarize readers. People either get annoyed with the story and walk away rolling their eyes, or they get very excited about what Stewart accomplishes with his prose, his characters, his distinctive humor, his understanding of life.I certainly fall into the latter category. Night Watch appealed to me immediately with its enchanting jumble of science fiction and fantasy, and quickly pulled me in deeper with its lyricism and the solid reality of its characters.To benefit most from The Night Watch, you must be attentive. And patient. If you mainly gravitate toward shoot-em-up action or heart-pounding romance, The Night Watch might not be for you. It has action, true, but actions always have consequences, and Stewart forces us to see that. It deals with romantic relationships, as well, but not the kind of formula romance that goes down like emotional cotton candy. Stewart deals with love: hard, real, something that is a choice, something that takes a lot of hard work to preserve. This is not a book that merely reflects the influence of other books. It's a book that reflects life.Who will like The Night Watch? I have no idea how to predict. It took me entirely by surprise to read some of the reviews on this page and see that the very things I loved about this novel were things that annoyed or bored other readers. Maybe the lyrical writing will seem dull to you; maybe the story's firm grounding in physical location will seem tiresome; maybe the characters' hard choices, their struggles to figure out life, won't be exciting enough.But if you want a book that looks hard at the real issues of life, unflinching and wryly humorous, The Night Watch could be just what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"This is really just an average book by an average author. Stewart's writing is adequate, but it lacks a certain artistry. He has a tendency to overindulge himself in his descriptions, which occasionally caused me to roll my eyes as I was reading. One of my pet peeves is when an author goes into great detail describing what some character is wearing -- the color, what type of fabric, the jewelry and what it's made of, etc. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, I DON'T CARE WHAT THIS PERSON IS WEARING, GET ON WITH THE STORY. Stewart's attempts at humor, usually spoken through his character's mouths, left me flat -- I never even cracked a smile.At one point, Stewart describes a man trying to save himself from freezing to death in the bitter cold. The whole scene is terribly overdone, with Stewart time and again describing the poor sap warming his hands between his legs and stomping his feet to keep from freezing. At more than one point the author reminds us that &quot;it certainly was very cold.&quot; Yeesh.It wasn't until I approached the end of the book, that I really realized it wasn't going to come together into something satisfying. In the end, there were so many major characters in this book that I ended up not caring about any of them. The denoument, which comes some 30 pages from the end, is almost inexplicable and sucks the life out of the final pages. This isn't a terrible book, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"Set in the world of Resurrection Man, this novel continues to exhibit Stewart's powerful narrative and characterization gifts. I was riveted-- other reviewers below seem not to have been enchanted as I was, but I think they've cheated themselves of a deep and meaningful experience. Stewart, like Tim Powers, has a deft touch with fantasy, and creates a persuasive and comprehensible fantasy world that he peoples with &quot;real&quot; protagonists. I've loaned this book to others, and do not hesitate to recommend it to mature readers with a taste for subtle fantasy."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"\\"The Night Watch\\" is a slow, winding, surreal tale. The characters are very real, which means most of them are unlikable at some times and lovely at others. Each piece of the tale unfurls slowly, rather like the tea leaves Stewart keeps coming back to. You have to be in the right mood for it; it's harrowing to spend pages and pages with a man who's trying to stay alive through numbing cold yet gradually succumbing to frostbite. But those pages are a fascinating trip through a man's mind and circumstances. Much of the book is like this---there is no easy good guy, no easy bad guy. Spirits and gods are abstract---yet very real---things that have no understanding of mercy. If you're of a mind to slowly explore all of the symbolism in here (art, birds, tea, poetry, Sun Tzu, political maneuvering, religion) there's an immense amount of gorgeous stuff. The combination of a magical apocalypse and odd quasi-sentient technology is still highly unusual despite the fact that many people have written versions of that same combination of elements since this book came out in 1997; Stewart's stylized writing assures that his vision is a unique one. This definitely isn't a fast-paced adventure. It isn't a feel-good black-and-white novel. But it is an incredible take on power of all kinds and those who would try to wield it."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"I like Sean Stewart (disclosure) but think that Perfect Circle and Mockingbird are his best works. This is quite different from those books, but still and interesting read. Perhaps this is more comparable to Galveston.This is not a \\"big world\\" book. It focuses on two cities in a future where magic has become strong (but is beginning to ebb again) and the two different cultures these cities have and the differences between them.It has some very clever magic. Forests that are conscious and protect some of the characters and dead armies that lightly interact with the living.Ultimately, it is a little flat in character development, but an interesting read."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"I can't quite hate this book, but I can't love it either. It wasn't nearly as good as Nobody's Son (the other book of his that I've read), but if you have the inclination to wade through pages of verbal-diarrhea, there are some interesting tidbits contained within.I think the most frustrating thing about it is that he goes and crafts a really interesting sounding alternate world, replete with high-technology, magic, and a distinctively un-american flair, then he drops the ball by writing about insipid, boring people doing boring things. It feels like a cross between some airy-fairy arts-community novel, and an action adventure, and fails to satisfy on either level.Plainly speaking, it was unfocused an ended up boring me.As an aside: I decided to read this book after learning it was set where I live, Edmonton Alberta, Canada. I got a good laugh reading about how he envisioned the fates of some familiar places here in the city. He really casts it in the familiarly disgruntled voice of a typical Edmontonian (&quot;Anywhere else is better than here&quot;, basically)."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"I have to admit that I read through this book fairly quickly and that it kept me more or less engaged right up until the end. Unfortunately, that's about the best thing that can be said for this rather dreary novel. Stewart starts off with the potentially interesting (if over-used) concept of our high-tech world giving away to magic, but then drops the ball. Sure, there's magic out there, but somehow technology still works. Except when it doesn't. And the very high-tech, industrialized city of Vancouver has become nearly medieval while the predominantly rural capital of Edmonton has become a clearing house for high-tech mercenaries. Because, after all, everyone knows how dotcom-oriented cities tend to revert to low-tech primitivism while farm-and-cattle oriented ones tend to spontaneously develop ultra-futuristic technocentric societies.No, it doesn't make any sense to me either.Stewart gives us an inexplicable world and then populates it with uninteresting characters about whom we have great difficulty caring. He then loads this down with excessive descriptions of clothing, culture and Chinese philosophy. The whole book feels like Stewart just read a big book about Chinese culture and tried to cram a lot of it into this novel as filler. Speaking of filler, it's bad enough that we have to deal with minor, non-essential characters everywhere but it's downright criminal that we have to put up with the protracted death-scenes of these characters in trite and derivative ways. One character freezes to death while trying to build a fire - which would be interesting to anyone who hasn't read the classic Jack London story \\"To Build A Fire.\\" As it is, I found myself rolling my eyes repeatedly as the author laboriously copied the same segment directly from London - right down to the 'surprise' ending where a sudden snowfall extinguishes the struggling flames that promise salvation. Very moving. Or at least it would be if it hadn't been done to death a thousand times in literature over the last 100 years.Very little about this world is explained, so when things come to a climax the reader has no idea WHY things are happening and has to just hang on for the ride. This might be acceptable if the ride ever GOT anywhere, but instead we end up with an uninspired, tacked-on ending that resolves nothing and leaves most of our questions unanswered. We're unable to determine how the preceding adventure has really changed the lives of our protagonists, but that's ok because we don't really care about the protagonists anyway. All we're left with is the vague suggestion that after a mere 80 years of magical resurgance the world is 'changing back.' Hopefully it will change back into something a bit more rational with more interesting people in it. THAT might be a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Night Watch, The","review":"I was not at all impressed with this book. In fact, I was not able to get very far into it.

It has a tremendous amount of information on nutrition, cross training, speed work and a very easily tolerated training schedule for preparation for a marathon. I have used this book for years, and it still seems to work. Currently training for a fall marathon after being injured for a few years and it seems like everything will work out fine. The chapter on speed work is probably the best for recreational runners who don't normally do highly intense training. It will work for you if you do it and it is tolerable for anyone. Describing the training runs in time instead of distance has always been a big plus for me. It is simply much easier to plan your training runs around time than distance. I never understood how people always knew the length of a run. I never wanted to go out and measure my training runs for some reason. It isn't easy to do all the workouts in this training schedule, but if you do them, I think they will work for you in a successful and comfortable way when race day comes. This book is a lot easier to understand than a lot of more complicated training schedules and distance based or intensity based training manuals I have also tried to read."},{"Title":"How to Train For and Run Your Best Marathon: Valuable Coaching From a National Class Marathoner on Getting Up For and Finishing","review":"An excellent tool for the beginning runner.

I bought this book to train for the marathon, and found it helpful. One thing I did not like was the recommendation to run for minutes rather than miles. I guess I'm enough of a mileage junkie and not good enough at judging pace that I found it disconcerting to have to guess how far I went. Also, that way you have no idea what kind of pace you are on for the marathon itself.

(John Hanc's Essential Marathoner is also good for a first timer, but Gordon Bakoulis' book has more information.)The author does a nice job of providing training schedules. Unlike the preceding reviewer, I though she was pretty clear that her schedules are measured in minutes, and that there is no assumption of 10 minute miles.What sets this book apart, however, is the clear information on speedwork, strength training, nutrition, and race preparation.On balance, a very nice book and highly recommended to anyone seeking to run their first marathon or to improve on a previous time."},{"Title":"How to Train For and Run Your Best Marathon: Valuable Coaching From a National Class Marathoner on Getting Up For and Finishing","review":"All in all, this book was an enjoyable, common-sense read. I was a little disapointed because there was little technical advise about training. To start, the author discusses her first marathon experience: no pain, effortless, and sub-four hours. She is a gazelle-type and alludes to &quot;see a doctor&quot; if you feel you are carrying excess weight. True, the book is ten years old. I am a &quot;heavier&quot; runner at 140 lbs and 5'8&quot;. I have run 2 marathons in around five hours. My time splits are not even listed in the time chart of Gordon's book. Also, throughout the nutrition chapter Gordon continually stresses low-fat and high carbohydrate eating. In addition she states that runners need not be interested in increasing their protein intake. Knowing my own body, if I ate the combination that the authors discuses, I would surely balloon up to 150lbs and plus. No offense to Gordon, however because she is a gazelle and has never had to worry about weight. Great to hear mention of weight training but not enough info about how it might make one bulk up and or become faster. All in all, I am obviously a novice working for a 4:40 marathon and this eating plan has worked well for this pro. I would recommend this book to beginners to have on their shelf. It is a two hour read and covers the basics with good safety tips. I would not recommend this eating plan for everyone and would encourage more protein and fat. I found that the section on cross training was well written and very helpfull. :-) Happy Running!"},{"Title":"How to Train For and Run Your Best Marathon: Valuable Coaching From a National Class Marathoner on Getting Up For and Finishing","review":"The book was of great help to me in preparing for my first marathon, the 1999 Pittsburgh marathon, and running it. I would recommend it to anyone how feels ready for the challenge of running the distance. It does a very good job in taking the reader through every stange of the preparation for the marathon, and it has many useful suggestions for dealing with possible problems along the way. One of the best parts about the book is the suggested running schedules, which are varied and allow for much freedom. They are given in total minutes of work-out time instead of total mileage, which reduces the pressure of having to complete a certain distance on training runs, when one is just supposed to be getting used to running long. The sections on nutrition, speed work, and cross training make a great addition to the running schedules, and helped make the training for my first marathon an enjoyable experience. The advice on recovery from the marathon was also very helpful. And it's great for women runners!

I especially enjoyed that the first chapter included testimonials from various ordinary people about their first marathon.Also there is a countdown chapter, telling you what to do in the month, weeks, days, and last day before the marathon; as well as a whole chapter dedicated to the race itself. I found this very helpful because though I have run shorter races the marathon was kind of a mystery to me.However, I picked up this book expecting to get a little more information in certain areas:1) Stretching. The author mentions stretching, when to do it, and why it is important, but no advice on technique (pictures or diagrams and/or simple descriptions would have been helpful).2) Female concerns. A whole chapter is devoted to \\"Concerns of Female Marathoners\\" but no mention is ever made of sport bras, and periods are only talked about in conjunction with the concern of missing or ceasing to have them altogether - nothing about running while on your period, etc.Finally, I found that some of the nutrition information was a little outdated (the book is, after all, ten years old). The author recommends combining foods to get complete proteins, which is an obsolete theory. Vegetarianism is only mentioned once: \\"Getting complete proteins is a special concern of those vegetarians who do not eat eggs, milk, or dairy products.\\" This has been disproved. The author does not even allude to the scores of elite vegetarian/vegan athletes succeeding in a variety of sports today.I would recommend this book to a beginning marathoner, if you can get a bargain price, but check out some newer books on the subject.Have a great marathon!"},{"Title":"The 30th Anniversary Reader's Digest Reader","review":"You've heard of \\"comfort food\\".

In a dictation given by the false Pallas Athens through him titled (How you can come to \\"know\\" ultimate truth), she said:\\"You can go to the teachings of the ascended masters, you can go to the AskRealJesus website, and you will not there find the living truth; you will find an expression of truth\\".Whereas in a previous teaching Kim said this:\\"Today, many people have opened their minds to a higher understanding of spiritual matters than what is found in traditional doctrines. Many more people can bear the higher truth, and therefore Jesus has appeared to give us that truth. So allow Jesus to give you the Living Word and the Living Truth that he wants all people to have in this age. Receive his cup of truth and understanding--and drink ye all of it\\"!It looks like Kim's Pallas Athena is contradicting Jesus about finding the Living Truth on Kim's website and in his teaching! So why would you or any seeker of truth waste your/their time in reading materials that lacks the Living Truth according to whomever Kim Michaels is channeling!"},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"I first read this book when it first came out a few years ago. There was much in it that I couldn't quite grasp such as the concept of the \\"Conscious You\\" that is introduced here. But a lot of the teachings appealed to me so I decided to accept it all as truth. But after several years of studying the teaching of the Ascended Masters brought through the Summit Lighthouse, I realized that this book has many truths interwoven with subtle lies that actually take you further away from Christ and God.This \\"Conscious You\\" is a graven idol that is being offered you as a replacement for your Christ Self, and raised up as more important than the I AM Prescence. This to me makes it an anti-christ concept. I love Mother Mary, and it saddens me to know that there is one imitating her and using her to introduce ideas that lead people into the mind and away from their Hearts."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"Not the easiest to read and has parts that are very suspect. I've studied the Ascended Masters for many years and this book drifts off base."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"This is a beautiful book which had such an impact on my life and my spiritual growth.Kim has channeled the ascended Mary, Mother of Christ and she explains in simple and powerful terms the reality of our beings, why we feel 'separate' from God and how to come back into relationship with the true inner God we are inside. The book includes 4 powerful rosaries which give you a great momentum of spiritual energy and wonderful openings into healing the various aspects of your being, allowing you to come back into oneness with God within.I simply cannot express how grateful I was to be guided to purchase this book, and the great propelling it had to my spiritual path, after I awoke to there being 'more to this life' than meets the eye.Blessings to Kim, to Mary and to all the Masters who made this possible.Love and blessings to all who read this review."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"Buying this book was one of the best decisions of my life. We all have heard of the Law of Attraction, but wonder why it doesn't work as it sells itself to do. This books goes into the blocks we have that prevent us from manifesting Abundance, and also gives very practical techniques and advice on how to clear them. I highly recommend this book, and all books from Kim Michaels. He is a very kind, gentle and humble man. I've met him at conferences and I can clearly see why he is chosen as a Messenger to bring out such Truth."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"This book has been very helpful to me. Many ideas that have been in my mind for years have been addressed in this book. I have read it and continue to use it daily to walk the path that will take me back to the oneness with God. In reading this book, to get maximum benifit, I suggest keeping your mind and heart open to an uplifting transformation."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"This book is admittedly long, at 547 pages, but the inspiring source, Mother Mary,explains that she is applying a circular type of elucidation of spiritual truth. This circular pattern is intended to avoid the trance of the linear mind, and approach this multi-dimensional reality in which we live from a multi-dimensional perspective. I gave this book two complete reads, and found that each time much more reality \\"stuck\\" in my comprehension. At times it seems repetitive, yet I feel that the repetition is useful, as it is designed to cover the objections and personal perspectives of many different groups of individuals. The work, after all, is attempting to help people overcome thousands of years of ingrained misinformation and self-destructive attitudes. The circular system of explication attempts to approach one's psyche from many different directions, and lay open ancient layers of despair, cynicism and lies which in many individuals have become so familiar as to be seen as obvious truth.As a part of this effort, spiritual tools in the form of rosaries or invocations have been added at the end of the text. After reading the body of the work, it becomes obvious why these are included, as the thrust of the work is about clearing away misconceptions and negative emotions which block individuals from accepting the Father's kingdom, which it is \\"His good pleasure\\" to give. In other words, the bulk of the work in receiving abundance, both spiritual and material, is about releasing blocks we are holding in our minds which tell us that we are unworthy to fill the chalice of our hearts with God's unconditional, infinite love.I can give a personal testimonial to the effectiveness of the book and its suggested spiritual work. About two thirds of the way through, Mother Mary suggests that, in order to accelerate our movement upward on the spiral staircase of growth into the Light, we do a 144 day \\"vigil\\", which consists of reading each of the four rosaries for 36 days in a row, while re-reading a section of the book prior to each day's reading of the rosary. I enjoyed this process, even though there were occasional temptations to abandon it. At day 108, when I finished the reading of the rosary for clearing the emotional body (which coincidentally happened on my birthday), I felt an amazing uplift in joy and purpose, and became aware of having moved into a new realm of freedom with regard to some old emotional patterns of need and habit. I actually experienced a sense of surprise that I could make that much change that quickly! Since then, the process has continued.The reading of the book alone was an uplifting experience, and the practice of giving the rosaries was even more intense and rewarding. I have been studying spirituality for more than thirty years, and at times the temptation to consider this process to be somewhat beneath me tried to invade my thoughts. Then I remembered Jesus' admonition that the Kingdom belongs to those who will become like little children, not the mighty and \\"wise\\". I realized that no matter how much material I may have read and presumably assimilated, the real bottom line of spiritual growth is about how much of it I have applied and actualized in my life. Doing this process was for me a real movement in spiritual cleansing and renewal. Jesus said \\"I come that you may have life, and have it more abundantly.\\" For me, the reading and application of this book was a firm step along that upward path."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"The only thing wrong with this book is that the cover looks kind of tacky and hides the true value of the teachings within the pages. One of the most enlightening books written in our age.This book contains the keys to abundance.Not the kind of abundance that profit gurus promise you where you make a lot of money, get old and die.Rather, it contains the master keys for the kind of abundance where you overcome the apparent limitations we face in this world, where you can do the works that Jesus did, only greater works than these you can do. The kind of abundance where you inherit eternal life by following in the steps of the enlightened ones who have come before you.This book is the real deal. If enough of us were to read this book and put it into practice, the earth would quickly be healed and raised up. Are we willing to let things get out of control on our planet? Or are we ready to take back our power and raise up planet earth into a golden age? This book is the one you've been looking for. Read it! Put it into practice. Heal yourself, heal the world. Take back your power. The time is Now.A wonderful gift to planet earth from Mother Mary.A must read for those who seek the truth that will set them free. Helps resolve personal psychological issues in a major way. Helps us see what is beyond the veil in this world, helps us step into the kingdom of heaven, the consciousness of heaven, that is inside of us here and Now. The kingdom of heaven comes not through observation, you have to seek in order to find. Seek within these pages and you shall find the pot of gold waiting for you in your heart."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"This is the most comprehensive, engrossing book on evolving human consciousness I have ever come across. I had so many \\"aha\\" moments reading this that I am convinced that the content came from a higher dimension. It would have to be from a being that has has a bird's eye view of life, because I cannot imagine any human being trapped in the human mental box being capable of independently coming up with some of this information. It is life-changing because not only do you get a higher understanding, but you have practical tools included with it that you can use. It may be long, but time flew for me when I read this. I keep this book by my bedside and sometimes I randomly open to a page that is always spot-on for whatever it is I'm trying to understand. I believe spiritual persons could benefit no matter where they are on the path."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"In my quest for truth about my christian background and with all the current focus on the validity of major christian religions, this book has been by far the most eye opener for any true spiritual chela, the book vibrates love and divine knowledge. It is so thick but I could not put it down for two weeks day after day. I have to admit that after not acknowledging Mother Mary as our spiritual mother, having read this book made come back to her and have developed a special relationship with her. I am reading Kim's latest book \\"I love Jesus but hate Christianity\\", it is cleverly addressing all major contradictions about God and the religious mongers, if you thought the Da Vinci Code was full of contraversy, wait until you read Kim's book's and his website, askrealjesus.com."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"Kim Michaels has brought forth through this book a new teaching to Ascended Master students called \\"The Conscious You\\" without knowing the real purpose of this incomprehensible teaching even to the most advanced students. This concept is the pivot element for many chapters in this book.Kim Michaels teaches:\\"The Conscious You is the core of your identity. And the essence of the Conscious You is that at any moment you are who you think you are. And therefore, at any moment, you can change who you think you are, change the way you look at yourself and the world.\\"The best I can do with this explanation is that the Conscious You is the mind, where you can project any thought and believe that is your reality, which is quite comfortable, no effort, no spiritual work needed, no action needed, only think yourself through life and you have reached Nirvana, heaven or Ascension, what a comfortable spiritual concept!Unfortunately for those Ascended Master students that know that the only way to God is through the Heart, and following the path that Jesus taught of sacrifice, surrender, selflessness and service, this concept of the Conscious You is hallow and only invites to selfish passivity (such as most Buddhist monks), concentrating in the beam in your own eye and only focus on yourself.I invite you potential reader of this book to ponder this comment in your heart and not waste your time trying to discern the pitfall where many have fallen but from where more and more are coming out, called the Conscious You.If you will anyways start reading this book, chances are you will feel a nice vibration, and this is due to the fact that Kim Michaels over uses the word \\"Beloved\\" constantly throughout the book (and dictations). This creates the impression that there is a Heavenly Being talking directly at you. Most of us want to be loved, so it is a natural feeling that you will feel uplifted and loved, for in how many books is there someone telling you over and over again that you are \\"Beloved\\".The trap is that by letting yourself go under this disguised love, the reader starts disconnecting from his/her discernment, and when the incomprehensible/absurd concepts are presented, and the reader doesn't understand, the reader is told that it is because he/she is trapped in a mental box or in duality. And so the reader is put in a position where he is told that he needs to think his way out of the mental box that doesn't let him understand the Conscious You. This is a pointless exercise which I totally discourage engaging in.Other lies in this book are around duality and the concept of good and evil, Kim Michaels states that good and evil are illusions, and that we should not fall into the duality trap of identifying ourselves as taking sides in this dualistic struggle. If you read KM's teachings you will notice that he does not mention the word Judgment in his teachings, this is a characteristic of the Conscious You (CY).The CY (Kim Michaels) does not want us to judge and discern with our heart what actions may be wrong and ungodly. In reality, it fears being judged, it fears the judgment, both our own and God's through us. So the CY logic will point the finger at us and tell us that we are not perfect and thereby cannot discern, even using Jesus' words to quote at us, \\"look at the mote in your own eye\\". He also writes that there is no right and wrong, that it is a dualistic belief and those who believe such a lie are fallen ones or are stuck in the fallen consciousness (anti-Christ).I hope with all my heart that this brief insight into the subtle but deep lies coming from Kim Michaels and expounded in this (and other books of his) will deter you from purchasing them and wasting valuable time for true spiritual growth. I know from first hand how it feels to have lost precious time with these subtle but harmful untruths, I AM grateful to have found the Way shower, I sincerely hope you will find her too."},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"I love this book from Mother Mary and the website [...]I say to the material author Kim Michaels: -thank you for be so humble-.This book and all the other help me a lot.Love from Germany"},{"Title":"Master Keys to the Abundant Life","review":"I love this book.

(Do publishers not have proofers or something?) The story of Isabelle and her flashbacks of time with the Kind (incubi and succubi) add a great deal, as well. As well as the obvious story, the book seems to have an underlying theme of the importance of accepting differences in people, and trying to live in peace.

After receiving a project to revamp one of our databases, I bought this book (and a few others) to help me feel my way around.

The book is full of examples which alleviates the popular gripe about the lack there of in simliar books, but it fails to include clear and correct explanatations. I would even go as far as saying, some of these examples are not &quot;smart&quot; enough. The recurring theme so far revolves around its accuracy. I tend to agree. Please be careful when purchasing this book or others of this type.

I would buy from them again (as I have), but I wouldn't buy this one again."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Database Programming with Visual Basic 6 in 21 Days","review":"I would suggest that the publisher actually GIVES a copy to a beginner and get him/her to proof read it and run through each and every example to the letter - in 21 days. I spent quite a lot of time debugging code and second-guessing the IDE navigation instructions when I should have been learning about database programming. The 21 days blew out as a result. One sample database was missing from the CD and another wouldn't open in MS Access. You can survive both these glitches but should you have to? Having said that, the information is presented well and I think I now have a reasonable handle on the various VB database programming methods. It still outshines many other similar books I browsed through in the store."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Database Programming with Visual Basic 6 in 21 Days","review":"Besides errors in example code, the instruction is poorly organized, episodic and in my opinion does not focus enough on where databases are moving: the web.

It covers all the basics and provides example coding throughout. Having worked my way through most of it, I can write powerful database programs easily and quickly, in a fraction of time and using a fraction of the code demanded by VB to achieve the same results. I can even understand those dreadful Microsoft Jet Database Help Screens now!!!!!! I recommend the book to experienced VB programmers.The book is not a 'VB programming for beginners' publication - you need to understand VB before using it. The sample code is full of errors that only an experienced VB user can detect and correct. The authour insists on using the Visdata utility to create SQL commands but does not make clear how to translate these into VB code; a VB beginner would be hopelessly confused and not understand the power and flexibility of this command. Readers also need to understand the concept of relational databases."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Database Programming with Visual Basic 6 in 21 Days","review":"Many of the examples contain errors and do not work properly.

Not sure where it's placed.For beginners it's very difficult to figure out what the author is saying about DAO, RDO, ADO. This is exponentially exacerbated by the fact that MSFT seems to change its mind about the standard each time they bring out a new version of Access.MSFT seems now to have settled on ADO as the standard, so with the bulk of this book focussing on DAO, it's not worth getting. But in reviewing, we must remember that this book was written way back in 1998 - an aeon in programming.I found the line numbering style reminiscent of the early days of DOS BASIC when every manufacturer had their own version.

However I must say reading Ms. Palmer is like climbing the mountain, breathless for more. Her ability to synthesize has taken the sting out of fresh wounds and demilitarized those long burried . . . allowing me to come from a place of deep compassion, rising above the immediate impulse of my \\"venge\\" nature.Being an emotional 8 with an aggressive 4 subculture, I've finally come to understand how I can be \\"always fearless and petrified at the same time.\\""},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"In reading over my previous review of a book on the enneagram, \\"Essential Enneagram\\", by D. Daniels and V. Price, I find that my current views are very consistent with what I wrote there. Thus, the important point to consider with respect to H. Palmer's book, \\"The Enneagram\\", is, after having narrowed down the possibilities for my enneagram type, and having a superficial understanding of the enneagram, of what value was it to me to read Palmer's book and why did I select that particular book?The positive points in favor of reading her book are that it is a clear, well-written account, with well-chosen and illustrative anecdotes, about the broad scope of the enneagram. She makes a comparison with the DSM, which of course is not intended to help us understand human behavior but to diagnose pathology. Nevertheless, I think that quite often in the extremes we can see reflections of the ordinary, and the fact that enneagram categories correspond quite nicely to some in the DSM is gratifying.Another important aspect of reading Palmer's book is that she deals with the dynamics of the enneagram. This is part of the attraction of the enneagram as a theory over say the Myers-Briggs typology, in that the arrow diagram is making predictions about dynamics of individual behavior.Overall, I thought that Palmer's book boosted my understanding up a bit over that of the \\"Essential Enneagram\\". Still, one feels daunted by the depth of the enneagram, and the complexity of human behavior, itself. An understanding that carries us beyond the narrow confines of our peculiar reference frames cannot be acquired in reading a few books, but must be found ultimately in the acquisition of wisdom."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"This is a book to read, study, think about, and re-read. Just as the sub-title says, it is the best guide to \\"understanding yourself and the others in your life\\" that I have ever seen. Straightforward and to the point, every page is filled with powerful insights. I first read it 18 years ago, as part of a workshop, and I highly recommend workshop participation as a way to bring the concepts to life.[...] is a useful website. I have read several books on the enneagram and this one is my all-time favorite."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"This book gives a very thorough and comprehensive exposition of the personality enneagram. There are books on the enneagram that go into details that this book does not, but they do not really stand on their own without a person being familiar with the material in this book. In other words, the other books are at best supplemental to this book. The author had studied the teachings of Gurdjieff, the insights of Claudio Naranjo, the information that the Jesuits have, and some information from the Arica system. The personality enneagram goes into nine personality types and their dynamics with each other. I have found that typing people according to the enneagram has been more useful than other systems, with the possible exception of astrology. But astrology takes longer to truly master and cannot be done as easily without getting the birth information of someone. With the enneagram, I can often make a rapid assessment that helps when I am meeting people to work with them doing hypnotherapy. For instance, with an ennea-six, taking time to check in to what is comfortable repeatedly makes them few secure and they relax and open up. The same behavior would make an ennea-eight very annoyed, since they take this same behavior as meaning I am weak and am trying to make them dependant on me. With an ennea-eight, being confrontative feels to them that I am honest and am putting all my cards on the table, and they start opening up and relaxing. But if the same thing was done with an ennea-six, they would panic and run out the door. In a similar way, each type responds ideally to a specific approach.There are some things that are only suggestive in this book and is gone more into detail in other books. Although not part of the enneagram, THE FOURTH WAY by Ouspensky goes into some detailed Sufi training material that is necessary to understand some of the charts that Helen Palmer has. The division of the human into the thinking center, higher and lower emotional center, moving center, sex center, and other centers is developed in this book. The directions of growth and degeneration are gone into more detail in the Riso books. The original Arica system gones into more detail on how the nine types evolve within certain exercises based on the number nine.The main point I differ with in some of the older enneagram books is that I do not feel that all types are pure types. I feel that some people shuttle between two or three enneagram points and are not easily reducible to one. I have found that sometimes when people are going through a lot of fear, they appear to be like ennea-six types even for a whole year, before falling back to their more usual style. I prefer these days to just type the enneagram strategy of the moment, rather than worry about typing people in a more enduring way. It seems, too, that some people shift their type sometimes.The other thing to mention is that there are more enneagrams than the personality enneagram. Although this is the most popular one, the Arica system has mapped out a great number of them, and the Gurdjieff system has also mapped out many enneagrams that map out processes flowing through time. The Enneagram book by Irmis Popoff is one good one to show several of them. John Bennett, a student of Gurdjieff, also did a few studies on the Enneagram, including one on the Lord's Prayer (the Our Father prayer of Jesus). Gurdjieff hints of another enneagram where 27 personalities are mapped (intellectual, emotional, and physical types of each of the nine types) and which he felt were necessary for certain kinds of advanced group work. Even so, the Helen Palmer book, especially if you take the time to use it in daily life and in observation of others, is still a very good place to start."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"I read this book about six months ago. It wowed me right away. The thing that most impacted me was the density of the writing. In my category type, Observer, every sentence, every word mattered. I can only surmise that this might possibly be true for other types as well. I have since referred the book to others. Some were enthusiastic; others were not. I understand that this book is prominent in the Sufi religion. I have not converted, but I think they made a good choice for a book of guidance."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"I have strengthened my spiritual connection by reading this book by Helen Palmer Ph.D. Ms Palmer is a pre-eminent authority on the teachings of the Enneagram, and this book, the ENNEAGRAM: UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF AND OTHERS IN YOUR LIFE, is considered by many as a major work on the subject. The subject of the book is succinctly summarised by Ms Palmer in the first paragraph, &quot;The Enneagram is an ancient Sufi teaching that describes nine different personality types and their interrelationships. The teaching can help us to recognize our own type and how to cope with our issues; understand our work associates, lovers, family, and friends; and to appreciate the predisposition that each type has for higher human capacities such as empathy omniscience, and love. This book can further your own self-understanding, help you work out your relationships with other people, and acquaint you with the higher abilities that are particular to your type of mind&quot; Ms Palmer describes the process of learning about our personality as a &quot;stepping-stone to a greater consciousness&quot; serving the double purpose of making us &quot;more effective and happier as a person&quot; and also, teaching us &quot;to set the personality aside in order to allow the next phase of consciousness to unfold&quot;. It is this act of setting the personality aside which has been a tool for me in my spiritual relationship. I find that by being able to identify the preoccupations of my personality, I am more easily able to detach from their neurotic tendencies. Further, I am able to attach to my spiritual centre becoming more of the person I will to be. This practice has encouraged me to dissociate from the preoccupations that underlie my particular personality. Ms Palmer states, &quot;When we cannot detach attention from a recurring preoccupation, when we lose the ability to observe our own behavior in a dispassionate way, then we are under the control of our own habits and have lost freedom of choice.&quot; Further, &quot;The unmasking of blind spots, defense mechanisms, and cognitive dissonance within our own character structure is a vital issue for anybody who wishes to lead a psychologically mature life.&quot; Ms Palmer distinguishes her approach to the Enneagram, &quot;It is, however, of great interest to me that we have become so preoccupied with naming what our attention is attracted to that we have neglected to look at how attention is organized when we perceive the information that interest our type.&quot; As such, this is not a handbook of personality. &quot;It is not within the scope of this book to discuss even basic internal practices. Practices are best learned with an experienced teacher, in a supportive setting, rather than out of a book, where even the most precise language is sure to fall short of what is necessary to gain access to an altered state of mind. This book is about the preoccupations that are characteristic of different types of people, so for our purposes, it is important only to point out that the way in which each type pays attenttion to its preoccupations can be both a burden and a blessing in disguise.&quot; For centuries, accomplished mystics in the monotheistic religions have maintained that the first step in the spiritual journey is to see one's self. Teresa of &Aacute;vila, St, (1515-1582) in her book &quot;The Way of Perfection&quot; teaches of the great spiritual benefit of self-detachment, both interior and exterior, from all things created. The process of the enneagram as presented by Ms Palmer has provided me with valuable tools to strengthen my spiritual commitment. If you are interested in personality, spirituality or the incorporation of the ancient ideas of the enneagram with twentieth century clinical psycho-therapy, this book will interest you."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"If you are at all interested in the Enneagram as a system for self-discovery, read Helen's groundbreaking book. In my opinion, it is the definitive text on the subject. While many, many writers have since published books on the Enneagram, Helen's treatment still rises above the rest by sharing the voices of those she's taught and interviewed over the years. I have been amazed at how few other writers have followed her example - letting the representatives of each type speak for themselves. Individuals remain, as always, the best teachers of how their minds, hearts and psyches truly work. Although nothing can replace the &quot;oral tradition&quot; of actually hearing individuals tell their stories, by utilizing such testimonials Helen's book maintains the sacredness of the teachings of the Enneagram while at the same time making them available to a curious and searching public. While Helen herself might admit that the book is &quot;less graceful&quot; in parts, she has d! one an excellent job of introducing the complexity and depth of the system in a way that preserves the integrity of the whole. I found the book transformative; it began what will certainly prove to be a lifelong study of personality and essence and I am forever grateful to her for this gift."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"I found this book one of many excellent frameworks in describing personalities. Originally an esoteric Sufi and Cabalist mysticism, then elaborated on by others such as Gurdjieff, Oscar Ichazo, Claudio Naranjo, Joseph Hart, John Lilly, Riso and Helen Palmer. I think Jung's is most famous that embrace the introvert and the extrovert regarding the four personality types of a thinker, feeler, sensor and intuitive, which presents 8 personalities. And in this book by Palmer (also Riso) on the Enneagram, there are nine personality types. Like Jung's personality types, the Ennegrams presents scores of in-between stages, a fourish-five, a threeish-four and so forth, so you can't fault this theorem, nor the non existent particular attributes believed to be of one personality type to an individual, even when that one fits one of the selected types.The idea that must be remembered here is a person is not one personality type, but a core type fluctuating between two others, one in stress, the other in non-stress. So each person is continuously traveling between three points, one of them being the core, while at the same time, this person may or may not lean towards one of it's wing points. To repeat, it is a core point fluctuating between two other points, towards one in stress, towards the other in security, while some are heavily influenced by one of its wing points. A Five for instance, is secure in eight, but when stress hits it goes towards seven in order to secure its core of Five, like a rubber band effect. I am a fiveish four, or a four-Tragic Romantic, who acts as a withdrawing observer, from leaning in my wing point as a Five-Observer-Solitude. As a Four, I fall into the secure point of a One-Perfectionist. So under stress, I move towards a Two-Giver, in order to balance out my Four.You have to accept the system with degrees of relativity. As helpful as this system is, it is not an exact science, and in this sense, there are no absolutes in any formulated structures.The first four chapters of the book are small and explain the system itself and how it works. The remainder of the book describes in quite detail the nine personality types and is very helpful in observing both the self and others with scores of helpful hints and workable areas that one can work and benefit on by knowing the basic principles and framework of thinking that externally show in actions. By looking in this particular lens of personality types, you can gain greater perception of the person you are dealing with and how you yourself are dealing with the other and make the necessary adjustments. I found myself constantly envisioning many persons I know that really do fit many of the personality types with a large degree of accuracy, including that of myself.I found what is important is to read the entire book, and try to get a handle on the types. Then go back to the first four chapters and re-read to get a full understanding on how each point is really a base of three points and how the wing points can be a major influence."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"Understanding the Enneagram will change your life!

I think Palmer's personality descriptions are insightful and thought provoking.It is also the best starting point for anyone interested in personality types who wish to delve deeper on this subject.What I find most amazing is that you will never see this topic, ever discussed in any collegiate psychology department. For them, ideas are like religion and they can never agree.The truth is this one book would put most of them out of business. Or rather, there are more truths in this book than most others.These books as a class, describe what I'd call the unified theory of personality types. It gives you a clear picture of who you are, why you act the way you do, and what you are likely to do under pressure or stress. All of this applies others around you too.This is a must read book for anyone interested in finding out who they are.

If you want to learn the enneagram this is the book to read."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"Along with Don Riso &amp; Russ Hudson's &quot;Personality Types,&quot; Helen Palmer's &quot;The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life&quot; has established itself as one of the definitive and most thorough texts available on this subject. I have been a student of the enneagram for a long time, and I frequently reach for this book as a reference.The book is divided into two main parts. The first 70 or so pages are dedicated to an overview of the enneagram system, both from historical perspectives, as well as in terms of pratical application. The remainder (and majority) of the book's 400-odd pages provides a well organized wealth of information on each of the nine enneagram personality types. Because each of these nine chapters are laid out in a standard &quot;template&quot; format, expect some minor duplication from chapter to chapter.UNlike most personality typing books, Helen Palmer's book does NOT include any kind of &quot;quiz&quot; to help readers determine their enneagram type. However, the descriptions of each type are so thorough that it isn't difficult to determine which one is the best fit.The book is quite comprehensive, and goes well beyond merely examining the enneagram as a &quot;personality type inventory,&quot; instead also covering the self-growth and life philosophy aspects of the system. Palmer goes into great depth in her decriptions of each of the Nine enneagram personality types-- starting with the childhood &quot;programming&quot; that influences current behavior patterns, then going on to outline the adult &quot;preoccupations,&quot; including how they affect that type's behavior in both intimate and &quot;authority&quot; relationships. She relies extensively on the &quot;oral tradition&quot; of the enneagram; that is-- the practice of listening to, and learning from, groups of people of the same &quot;type,&quot; talking about their lives and motivations. Many quotes and examples from Palmer's enneagram study groups are included in the book, and they add a nice &quot;live&quot; counterpoint to what is otherwise somewhat &quot;academic&quot; material. Each chapter also includes a brief description of &quot;instinctual subtypes,&quot; and concludes with a list of actions/environments that might help each type grow and thrive.If there is one (minor) complaint I have about this book, it is perhaps that Palmer has a tendency to dwell at length on the negative or &quot;defective&quot; traits of human nature while not really giving equal time to the positive-- or even how to work our way through the negative. In addition, she does not acknowledge the possibility that an &quot;emotionally healthy&quot; version of any type might exist-- which is one of the reasons I prefer the work of Riso and Hudson. In personal growth terms, it is certainly of great importance to identify the pitfalls of life (Our &quot;preoccupations,&quot; as Palmer calls them), but it is almost of equal importance to be offered some guidance for self-devlopment-- and this book falls a bit short in that area. Which, in a way, is surprising, since Helen Palmer is a practicing psychotherapist. However, this is trivial issue that really doesn't detract a great deal from the book's overall usefulness.Final thoughts: An excellent and worthwhile reference (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks), especially for the more serious student of the enneagram. Provides a nice counterpoint to Riso &amp; Hudson's writings. Perhaps not the best &quot;first read&quot; for someone just beginning to explore the enneagram-- if that's you, I'd recommend Baron &amp; Wagele's &quot;The Enneagram Made Easy&quot; as an excellent introduction.Thanks for reading!--Peter"},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"Actually, four and one half stars. It is that good! Very thorough. A benefit is Palmer's basing the various indicator points in psychological insight. This is no popcorn and candy book. This takes some work to read and comprehend. One should read something similar but lighter before taking on Palmer's work. Her language is clinical, and may catch off guard the one who is only doing a popular-level satisfying of an interest. At times there does seem to be repetition, or re-iteration of concepts, I would guess so as to enforce understanding. One would be foolish to immediately jump into the sixth chapter, where the different Enneagram points begin to be delineated. Read the first five chapters to obtain the needed background. I recommend this work to anyone who wants a deeper comprehension of this popular tool for understanding oneself and significant others."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"Helen Palmer is one of the two leading writers on the subject of the enneagram, a system of personality typing. The other leading writer is Don Riso. There seems to be a dichotomy in the field. You are either a Palmerite or a Riso follower. I find Helen Palmer's writing interesting and valuable but I am more in tune with Riso.One of the main differences for me is Riso's division of each type into healthy, average, and unhealthy levels. Palmer accuses me and my type of faults that I definitely don't identify with, although I would be the first to admit if they were true. Riso places those faults at certain levels of the type - not my levels. He has much more accurate descriptions of me in certain specific levels of my personality type, while Palmer mushes the whole type together in one beg generic mass to the point where it is unrecognizable to me.After reading Riso's books in depth I found it interesting to get Palmer's views. She has a lot of valuable contributions to make. I feel that I understand the types better thanks to Helen Palmer even though my basic understanding of the system comes from Riso and from my own observations."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"Approach this as a textbook, rather than as an entertaining read, and you won't be disappointed.Palmer presents the Enneagram as a systematic map of 9 different personality types that can help people understand and develop their own intuitive styles. An important lesson conveyed is that no single model of psychological health fits every individual. Rather, every type has its own challenges and opportunities. With self-awareness, a person can transform weaknesses and preoccupations into constructive ways of understanding situations.In her attempt to be systematic, Palmer is often repetitive. She sometimes presents advanced information before she gives the basics. Don't skip the intro, but do read with your own questions in mind."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"I first read this book in 1997 and it was life changing as I discovered that I wasn't so strange after all, but rather one of many. Being an Enneagram type 8, I for the first time understood what coaches, teachers and friends had been trying to tell me for years. Helen Palmer's book helped me for the first time develop an empathy for how others view me and the rest of the world. I've now read at least 8 texts on the enneagram and attended the first International Enneagram Conference in Chicago in 1997. I always choose this book to introduce people to the enneagram. Other books I've read, including the later version of Helen Palmer's, are too objective and practical to impart the understanding and empathy for the types that this book conveys. I've enjoyed all the other books and they've had value, but always start with this one so as to not miss the beauty and warmth of the enneagram."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"The enneagram is based on the concept that there are nine basic personality types and that we all are essentially driven by one of nine basic sins. As children our personlities are formed, using natural talents and predispositions, in order to create a safe place to live and a safe style of coping with life's hardships and stresses.This volume, while profoundly comprehensive, is a bit hard to follow for the casual student. I also discovered that many of the &quot;types&quot; have very similar characteristics, making it difficult to differentiate between them. I also finished reading with the sense that Ms. Palmer prefers certain types to others. For instance, what inspired the seemingly random discussions of pairs in love and at work? Some types got a lot more ink that others.Interesting book for the reader with a serious interest in enneagrams, but a chore for the simply curious."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"I first encountered Helen Palmer's &quot;The Enneagram: Understanding Youself and the Others in Your Life&quot; a few years ago and it still holds up fairly well. The Enneagram is an interesting tool for self understanding, and this book presents the nine Enneagram points in a clear-cut way. I found it somewhat disorganized, however, and not partiuclarly well-written. The prose rambles quite a bit. Although there's some good information here, it's sometimes hard to find, and I could think of a number of people who did not quite fit any of the categories, at least as the author describes them. Nonetheless, it led me to learn more about the Enneagram, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"Here's a book that people seeking happiness in their careers should definitely read. It's the first step for career planning.Palmer gives clear, concise explanations of an intricate personality system making reading intriguing and exciting. Her understanding of the delicate nuances of the types makes her a trustworthy and solid guide. Additionally, she is particularly respectful to the limitations of categorizing people and avoids any hint of such. We wouldn't expect anything less from this top expert of the Enneagram.Part I gives an excellent summary of the theory; including numerous diagrams that define the passions and perspectives of the types. Part II gives explanations of each of the nine types.In particular, presenting the dilemma at the beginning of each chapter immediately gives us insight. If any doubt surfaced about where you fit in the Enneagram world her descriptions of the dilemmas clearly helps us understand ourselves, bringing a deep comfort. Palmer also provides a unique blend of personality characteristics and psychological perspectives. Such topics as major issues, intimate relating patterns and intuitive style are covered. Most importantly much of her knowledge and insights were gathered from twelve years of interviewing thousands of students learning the work.And all of these details are why Helen Palmer's book is so crucial to our development. Those wanting greater love in their relationships will find the book meaningful. Those in transition in love or career will find great insight into their desires and strengths. Whether we apply the understanding of personality to our professional or personal lives it is a benefit. While most of our time is spent in some type of relationship, it's amazing that discovering who we are is not a mandatory course. This book clearly would be the required reading.Helen Palmer has written the bible of the Enneagram -- a first choice for anyone desiring deeper self-understanding."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"Actually I think this book is pretty good, and in the future I may write another review for the paper edition, but I feel it necessary to write this one-star review to draw attention to a massive defect of the Kindle edition.The problem is that a substantial portion of this book consists of quotations; self-descriptions of people of the various enneatypes during what she calls \\"panel interviews\\". It must be the case that in the dead-tree version of this book the voices of the interviewees are distinguished from Helen's using some kind of typographical or formatting conventions. In the Kindle edition they are not... there is no change of type-face, no indent, not even quotation marks. The result is a mishmash of voices that completely disrupts the flow of the narrative. One paragraph it's Helen Palmer talking, the next it's a panellist and the reader only realizes the shift when a first-person reference in the middle of the paragraph is clearly not to the author.The Kindle edition of this book should be withdrawn until it is fixed. I hope Helen Palmer will see this and complain to her publisher about it. I will certainly complain to Amazon, but that's not likely to have any effect."},{"Title":"The Enneagram: Understanding Yourself and the Others In Your Life","review":"Palmer's work is very penetrating and deep. Although the text seems unorganized compared to other enneagram books, I think it is a necessary evil to go deep into a particular issue before letting it go. When you go deep, it does throw off the readers.Another interesting point about her book is the rather unflattering descriptions of some of the darkest aspects of each type. However when the descriptions of a type get a bit too &quot;negative&quot;, it is up to the readers to determine the degree of &quot;fixation&quot; they are in, and whether such descriptions apply to them personally or not. I don't think Palmer means to say any one of a certian type will definitly have the most negative characteristics described in the book. She simply shows us &quot;some possibilities&quot; that we might want to be on the lookout for. Personally, I think the more we can accept the dark sides of a particular type, the more compassion we can develop for ourselves and others.I would suggest pick up the &quot;Love &amp; Work&quot; book for a clean, organized, but perhaps more surface description of each type and their interactions. Read this book when you want to dig deep into the range of possibilities for each type."},{"Title":"Wireless Java Programming for Enterprise Applications: Mobile Devices Go Corporate","review":"Just got this book and have read most of it. Finally a Wireless Java book that talks about something more than J2ME! The campus portal app is a nice touch and ties all of the previous discussions together.

You need to be an experienced developer to read this book."},{"Title":"The Blood of a Dragon","review":"I read this book, along with all the other Ethshar fantasies, when they first appeared back in the eighties. I must say I always enjoyed the way Watt-Evans approached magic; he could make it at once fantastic and logical.His scenes of magic at work are indisputably fun. Watt-Evans is kind of old school, he has devised a magical world, rules for that world, puts his plots into that context, and relentlessly follows things to their logical conclusion. The thing is, nothing much happens in Watt-Evans' stories. There are no larger-than-life heroes, no derring-do, no hair-breadth escapes, no great truths revealed, and no surprises. As one reviewer of his work pointed out, his characters are pedestrian, which I think is exactly Wat-Evans' point. Just because there is magic in Ethshar doesn't mean people or their institutions will be any different. Folks are still interested in profit and comfort, governments and religions just want to perpetuate themselves, parents still want to control their kids'lives, etc.This adds an element of realism to his work that is lacking in Tolkien-wannabe fantasies. Watt-Evans has managed to create a very magical world, and then his plots render it mundane. As strange as this sounds, I would always scoop up an Ethshar novel as soon as it hit the shelves, devour it in a day or two, and look forward to the next. Yet, I never felt really satisfied after finishing. Kind of like eating Chinese food."},{"Title":"The Blood of a Dragon","review":"Let's see: This is an Ethshar series book and is therefore an excellent read. That may sound like a bold statement, but it is a fact. Before you run out and buy it I recommend that you start at the beginning with the first book \\"The miss enchanted sword\\", that way you will understand what is going on. Get the whole series and enjoy many hours wasting time reading about a world of total fantasy.Note: This applies to every book in the series, I have read them all."},{"Title":"The Blood of a Dragon","review":"Eventually I will get around to all of Lawrence Watt-Evans's Ethshar novels -- these are uniformly enjoyable commonsensical light fantasy, somewhat in the mode of L. Sprague De Camp, set in a fantasy world distinguished by having multiple, mostly quite different, magical systems.Dumery of Shiphaven is a 12 year old boy, the son of a wealthy shipowner. It is time for him to choose a trade. He has no interest in the shipping business, and anyway his oldest brother will get the business. Dumery, at any rate, is interested in something else -- he wants to be a wizard. His father agrees to let him try -- but every wizard Dumery meets agrees that he has not a shred of magical talent. Dumery is frustrated and offended -- but then he happens to see a wizard negotiating with a seller of dragon's blood, which is an important ingredient is many spells. He realizes that if he can't be a wizard, he might get a measure of revenge by becoming a dragon's blood seller.So Dumery tracks down the dragon hunter. Who, it turns out, has no interest in hiring an apprentice. Dumery decides not to give up. He decides to follow the dragon hunter to his home, and to insist on an apprenticeship. Thus, he ends up paying his way on a boat up the river, shoveling cow dung. His parents miss him, of course, and they hire a witch's apprentice to track him.Both Dumery and the young witch end up following the dragon hunter to his home. The witch learns some secrets about witches and warlocks which (no pun intended!) seem a setup for a further book. Dumery, meanwhile, learns that the dragon hunter isn't quite what he seems. Also, that he still hasn't any wish for an apprentice. Dumery remains stubborn, and almost despite himself -- certainly not through any particular virtue of his own -- stumbles on a secret involving dragons, one in particular, that might just make his fortune.It's an odd, interesting, book. There aren't exactly any heroes, nor really any villains. Dumery is certainly the central character, and he is in many ways quite an unpleasant young man. He is a thief, he's irresponsible, he's spoiled -- he's not by any means evil, but he's not good. The witch's apprentice is fairly appealing, but in the end a pretty minor character. The other characters are ordinary people, some of whom do pretty bad things -- but mostly through ignorance. The book is enjoyable reading throughout -- Watt-Evans is a very engaging writer. And the eventual solution is both logical (indeed, I thought of it much earlier ...) and in a way heroic."},{"Title":"The Blood of a Dragon","review":"Once again, Lawrence Watt-Evans journeys to the world of Ethshar with a tale full of magic and surprises.Whilst not the best book in this growing series it will keep you amused and begging for more.I can't rate this author highly enough, you leave feeling thoroughly entertained. You will appreciate his writing style and the wry comedy common throughout which bare repeated reading.If you like humour in your fantasy and you're more interested in a book you can pick up without worrying that it's to heavy for you then give him a go, you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Blood of a Dragon","review":"All of Lawrence Watt-Evans books are wonderful.

Go also for the errata on the author Web Site to correct4 or 5 bugs and you will script on your XP system from chapter 2 ,understanding some new possibilities of VB SCRIPT. You will realize also WHY Win 95 reallybecomes obsolete and how to send mail with CDO technology.For Active Directory addicts, you also have a chapter on ADSI.I will say that this kind of book will have a great impact onUNIX colleagues, always keen to criticize the &quot;mouse&quot; productivityof Windows IT people. You can shell WinXP and this book shows yougreat productivity tools that come with the Microsoft OS.Good book indeed !"},{"Title":"Windows XP Under the Hood: Hardcore Windows Scripting and Command Line Power","review":"I read &quot;Windows XP Under the Hood&quot; (WXPUTH) because I wanted to know more about Windows scripting. I sought a modern book that covered Windows XP and its server counterpart (where possible), and went beyond the batch files of the 1990's. Ignoring some issues which can be addressed by an updated errata, WXPUTH will not disappoint. It's even useful to those running Windows 2000 and NT shops.Let WXPUTH be your guide to a world where graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are optional! Author Brian Knittel introduces the reader to the full range of Windows' command-line capabilities. Through examples, tables, explanations, and humor, WXPUTH doesn't teach everything, but instead concentrates on the most useful features of the Windows command line.If you've never done any scripting before, WXPUTH begins with a helpful tutorial on VBScript. Next are discussions of object-based scripting, which allow for greater flexibility and power than simple batch files. The Windows Script Host (WSH), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Active Directory Scripting Interface (ADSI) provide deeper access to core Windows functions. WXPUTH even teaches how to create custom objects, which I found fascinating. (This is truly getting &quot;under the hood,&quot; but in an accessible manner.)Where necessary, WXPUTH reveals details of Windows' innards. Topics like X.500 and LDAP appear in ch. 8, while hidden tools like &quot;iexpress&quot; and how to start various control panel applets are discussed elsewhere. The author isn't afraid to point out where Microsoft documentation or implementation is confusing or broken, which shows he isn't a Redmond drone.While the dozens of sample scripts in WXPUTH are very helpful, and offer great opportunities for customization, they sometimes seem confusing. I think some of them need adjustment to work properly, although tinkering with scripts is a learning method. The author also made a few questionable comments, such as not being able to use 'runas' to start &quot;Windows Explorer or any of its derivative programs&quot; (p. 560). I am logged into Windows XP as a user right now, and have one instance of Explorer running as a user and another running as &quot;administrator,&quot; started with 'runas'. Perhaps better technical editing might have caught similar issues?Regardless, WXPUTH is &quot;the&quot; book I will recommend as a resource for Windows scripting. The first time you send an email via the command line you'll begin to appreciate the gift Brian Knittel has given the Windows admin community!"},{"Title":"Windows XP Under the Hood: Hardcore Windows Scripting and Command Line Power","review":"1. I find the organization of the book fairly difficult to follow. It just doesn't flow for me (can't figure out why the topics are organized as they are). Clearly this is a personal preference thing - but the following books all felt more clearly organized to me:Microsoft Windows 2000 Scripting GuideManaging Enterprise Systems with the Windows Script HostWindows 2000 Scripting Bible2. There's a lot of text, but not that much concrete/applicable information. I like books that teach by doing - lots of short/sweet examples to illustrate the points. This book seems to have repurposed a great deal of MSDN documentation to describe the detail of functions and objects, but isn't really laid out as a reference. It feels like an unhappy marriage of reference book and how-to.3. There are a number of frighteningly basic/obvious errors in the book - which pretty much ruin the credibility of the author. Just a few examples:3a. COM is defined as Common Object Model (it's Component Object Model)3b. CIM is defined as Common Interface Model (it's Common Information Model)3c. Knittel says all CIMv2 objects start with Win32_ (clearly not the case)4. There's very little on WMI (Knittel himself says &quot;...this chapter gives the barest introduction to WMI&quot;.5. Knittel's command-line section doesn't address WMIC at all, which is inarguably the MOST powerful command-line tool introduced in Windows XP.It's not terrible or totally wrong, I just don't think it's as approachable, as deep, or as credible as the books mentioned above."},{"Title":"Windows XP Under the Hood: Hardcore Windows Scripting and Command Line Power","review":"This book is perfect overview of VBScript and Scripting Windows XP.

The chapters on WMI and ADSI are only 36 and 51 pages long (to give you an idea).Again, it is a nice book, but it is not &quot;hardcore&quot;, and the &quot;user level&quot; on the back cover should say &quot;beginner-intermediate&quot;, not &quot;intermediate-advanced&quot;."},{"Title":"Windows XP Under the Hood: Hardcore Windows Scripting and Command Line Power","review":"Brian Knittel gets an A+ from me for being one of the most lucid technical writers I've ever read.

Unix user may turn up their noses but even they have to admit WSH is pretty cool and smashes some of the traditional stereotypes about Windows only being for the technically challenged. The book does a good job of preparing you to start scripting in an MS environment."},{"Title":"Windows XP Under the Hood: Hardcore Windows Scripting and Command Line Power","review":"I have found this book incredibly useful. Without it, I doubt I could have put together some sorely-needed processes such as a developer-friendly build for a large system with several VB6 components with complex interdependencies, communicating with .Net components via Interop, therefore regenerating wrappers on the fly. The options are controlled by an XML file that has quite a lot of backward references in it, necessitating recursion in the parsing, and VB script's regular expression support was handy as well. Unix people tend to be surprised at just how capable a non-object-oriented technology can be (well, there is support for objects in a limited way, but it's not like Java!)Before I had this book I had never heard of WSC objects. What a nifty idea for the Windows environment: a source (script) code object, with methods and properties, that you can register and access like a DLL from your scripts. No compilation, no DLL hell.Once you have the strong foundation in scripting principles that this book gives you, it is easy to add in topics that it doesn't cover. There's plenty of information on the Web about things like using ADO from VBscript, or HTA applications (a nice way to show a GUI display from a command-line script). Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Windows XP Under the Hood: Hardcore Windows Scripting and Command Line Power","review":"As a Windows author myself I tend to be very demanding when I look for books about the Windows operating system.

It also delves into 'lesser' 'genocides' in Bosnia and the \\"U.S Mexico border region\\". It is these dichotomies that make the book problematic. First, the introductions explain different categories of genocide. Then there is a rundown of genocides of 'indegenous' or 'first' peoples. These are well known or not, depending on ones backround. The native american genocides in the Americas are covered as is the genocide of the Herero people, and the Armenians. Also mentioned are assaults on native peoples in South East Asia and India, as well as the Sudan and Australia.However some major assaults on people go unnoticed. For instance the ethnic cleansing of Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan in 1948, the killing of more than 250,000 Chinese by Indonesia, and of course East Timor. Genocide is selective, not in its fact, but in how the west perceives it. Certain conflicts are not called 'genocide' becuase of Political correctness. For instance the mass slaughter of Assyrians in 1920s Iraq is not mentioned.This is where the book breaks down. Wonderful chapters deal with post genoicde and trauma and memory in such places as post war Germany. However the foolishness that one article labels the American-Mexico border a 'potential' genoice or a place where 'genocide' terms ar eused is pure nonsense. IF this is true of the border area, then it is true of every nation in the world, and that downplays the seriousness of actual genocides like the Holocaust. if the Holocaust is 'like' the Mexican-American border region, then 'genocide' means nothing.The Bosnian case is also suspect. Most now confirm that the 'genocide' that took place, involved perhaps 2000 civilians. ANd of course the war and the 'ethnic cleansing' terms were political aimed only at Serbs, ignoring Croat and Bosnian and Kosovar atrocities. Genocide is not war, and this is where one writer is very mistaken. failed Attempts, or thoughts of genocide, are not genocide. The Sudan is genocide, and due to lack of information not one article details it, which shows the bias of western scholarhsip and the problem with these type of texts.Seth J.

In this book, Ada Lim&oacute;n reminds us of the first time we fell in love a poem, and why--as her poems speak directly to us, with nothing in the way, while exploring subjects worth caring about: love, loss, death, joy, family, the self, the soul, and the world--all the big ticket stuff. These poems are deeply generous and moving in the way they risk honesty and extend themselves to the reader. While the poems often start in a personal place, she inevitably propels them, and us, into a universal truth through humor and voracious attention to beauty. She shuns sentimentality, yet conveys an infinite tenderness for our species, and others, in all their glorious absurdity. From the greatest to the least, there is no subject in which she does not discover some surprising worth--from ladybugs to sunken ships to feral cats--nothing's too big or too small to show us what it means to be alive, and in the world."},{"Title":"lucky wreck (Autumn House Poetry)","review":"Fearlessly written in a voice that sparks curiosity and leads readers down the path of metaphoric discovery, this book is unique and energetic.

It's not that it's poetry for beginners; it's just that it represents how clear, lyrical and unambiguous good poems can be. There's a kind of magical focus to it.

However, Schwartz also uses each example to outline broader themes and to provide a bigger picture of the landscape: importance of analogies and pattern recognition, the value of building systems, identification of barriers, role of serendipity, and many others.

Only recently have inventors and engineers in the West learned of Genrich Altshuller's Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (which also goes by the Russian acronym TRIZ), based on an intensive study of the principles implicit in mainly Soviet-era patents, though also incorporating information from patents in other countries. TRIZ shows how the haphazard \\"methods\\" traditionally used by inventors waste time and resources, whereas the algorithm developed by Altshuller and his colleagues parses away the irrelevant information and identifies the exact \\"technical contradiction\\" the inventor has to resolve, along with a matrix of techniques for tackling it.Yet neither Schwartz nor the American inventors he interviewed in his book reveal an awareness of Altshuller's revolutionary discoveries. \\"Juice\\" comes across to me like a popular physics book published in the early 21st Century that shows a complete ignorance of developments in 20th Century physics like quantum mechanics and general relativity.

Instead, here are stories of inventors who channel their ability to look ahead into many different directions, use their windfalls from patents and profits to explore new possibilities, and cope with the mix of invention -- achievement for themselves and their ideas, and dismissal from the establishment.

I also found the book interesting because of its elaboration of some very important 'modern' innovations. This is a book I reccommend not only to those who are interested in the subject of innovation, but also to all who would like to read the minds of really creative and poductive people of especially our current times. My sincere congratulations to the author."},{"Title":"Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors","review":"I've read many books on innovation and this one was the best I've read. Schwartz engrosses you by weaving past and present, across domains as varied as agriculture and e-commerce, isolating the common techniques that great inventors use to overcome the obstacles to innovation. The book is a great combination of science history and management insight.You might see Harvard B-School as the publisher and think \\"ugh, dry business tome, better wait for the digest version\\" :-) That couldn't be further from the truth!! Without spoiling it, I'll simply say that there are great personal stories and wonderfully light moments. He has a style that is engaging and he switches between stories like a good film director. As an entrepreneur, I found myself sympathetically rooting for each of the innovators profiled, including several I had never heard of.I think it will appeal to:- business executives (e.g., leaders of product teams, who having read Clayton Christensen, are now striving to stimulate innovation in their organizations)- science history buffs (e.g., fans of James Burke's works such as Connections and Pinball Effect)- fans of his previous books (e.g., Last Lone Inventor about Philo Farnsworth's invention of television)In short, the author cracks the mystery that is \\"innovation\\" through a series of in-depth looks at the people, places, and circumstances that led to their inventions. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors","review":"Schwartz brilliantly explains \\"the creative fuel that drives world-class inventors\\" while explaining, also, that each of them followed a process by which to create possibilities. More specifically, by pinpointing problems to be solved, recognizing what are usually interconnected patterns, \\"channeling chance\\" (i.e. serendipity), eliminating or transcending boundaries, detecting barriers inorder to remove or overcome them, recognizing and applying appropriate analogies, visualizing probable results, embracing each failure as a learning opportunity, \\"multiplying insights\\" as they reveal themselves, and at all times \\"thinking schematically\\" (i.e. cohesively). Yes, that's a mouthful but essentially what the process of invention involves. It bears striking similarities with how the human mind functions. Here is a brief excerpt from Schwartz's Prologue:\\"The brain's hundreds of billions of neurons, or nerve cells, fire signals across tiny gaps known as synapses. These neurotransmitter signals travel across billions of pathways, often making new connections along the way. One of the mind's many astounding feats is that this network of neural circuits can operate and grow while consuming only a quarter of the electrical power that drives a modern microprocessor, or about twenty watts. This internally produced electricity is our juice.\\" All of the inventors whom Schwartz discusses in this book channeled this \\"juice\\" the right way. By making new and unexpected connections, they produced that special form of creativity known as invention.According to Nikola Tesla (the inventor of alternating current), \\"cognitive LEDs\\" (i.e. the electrical energy of invention) races through both the mind and heart. In common parlance, this is often referred to as a \\"rush\\": forces of intellectual and emotional energy achieve together what Joseph Schumpeter once described as \\"creative destruction.\\" This is precisely what Schwartz has in mind when noting that by \\"isolating a problem in a new way, by redefining it, by focusing it down to something more specific than meets the average eye, the inventor constructs a new possibility where none was thought to have existed.\\"Among the inventors whom Schwartz discusses, those of greatest interest to me are Woody Norris, Alexander Graham Bell, Jay Walker, Lee Hood, Carl Crawford and Kevin King, Dean Kamen, and Ron Katz. Here are brief excerpts about four of them:Woody Norris: He \\"was engaging in a common habit of inventive engineering: taking a technology of technique that works in one domain -- in this case Dopler radar detection of aircraft or weather patterns -- and then repurposing it for a new problem space. Was Norris the first inventor to think of this basic idea of diagnostic ultrasound? Hardly. But he imagined the possibility without knowledge of other efforts. Throughout history, most epochal inventions have been born in a rush of nearly simultaneous discovery.\\" (page 18)Alexander Graham Bell: After a series of partially successful experiments, Bell became convinced that he had \\"found a way for [begin italics] continuous [end italics] patterns of electricity to carry almost any type of sound over wires....Bell's method, however, was anything but a linear progression -- the first problem leading to a second, leading to a third, and so on. Instead, his diverse investigations led to an explosion of puzzles, a simultaneous eruption of new possibilities that sent him down parallel paths that he eventually connected.\\" (page 24)Jay Walker: He has defined challenges in a unique way which provides a competitive advantage. For example, he conceived Priceline.com as an intricate system which enables consumers to trade off flight preferences (i.e. non-stop flights, departure and arrival times) for lower prices; it also enables airlines to unload unsold tickets (i.e. \\"excess capacity\\"). \\"In recent years, he has been averaging about one hundred patent filings annually. With more than two hundred fifty issued patents and more than six hundred pending,\\" Walker and his colleagues at Walker Digital continue to focus on specific target areas of opportunity. For example, they wonder why current slot machines are lackluster and why winning is based on mere chance. \\"Why isn't skill a factor in winning at slots?\\" Re current generation cash registers, \\"Why do cashiers give customers their change? Why not find a systematic way to offer additional products in lieu of money?\\" (page 43)Lee Hood: \\"The ultimate system is the biological system. That the human body is a system of systems has been known for ages.\\" So what's new? Hood and his associates are convinced that the history of medicine has been about diagnosing and treating disease. The future, by contrast, is all about predicting and then preventing disease. \\"If you ask me what the technology of the future will be in biological medicine,\\" Schwartz quotes Hood asserting, \\"it is utterly clear: microfluidics coupled with nanotechnology.\\" Hence his vision of \\"capturing an instantaneous genetic health snapshot of an individual, to see whether any genes are mutating and whether any cancers might be forming in the near future.\\" To obtain tremendous amounts of information from tiny samples of blood, \\"you create groups of microscopic robots, essentially reducing an entire laboratory to the size of a fingernail.\\"(page 201)The work of these and other inventors demonstrates what Schwartz calls \\"the cycle of thinking strategies: creating new opportunities, pinpointing new problems, recognizing new patterns, detecting new barriers, and so forth.\\" This is a never-ending process. If conducted with rigor, it is also ever-expanding because each new solution creates all manner of new problems which, in turn, create all manner of learning opportunities which, in turn, facilitate new solutions which, in turn....In his Epilogue, Schwartz devotes substantial attention to Ashok Khosla who sees three proven models that can turn poor nations into rich ones: copycatting, piggybacking, and leapfrogging. Khosla is currently focused on India's rural poor, the 70% of the population who have been \\"untouched\\" by global outsourcing. He is an archetypical example of the inventor as entrepreneur with a social conscience and a determination to help as many people as possible to escape the cycle of poverty. To achieve that admirable objective, Khosla practices the same \\"cycle of thinking strategies\\" as do all other world-class inventors. For example, he recognized that poor people need places to live; ways to produce their own clothing locally, to cook food, to purify water; and cheap renewable energy. \\"Borrowing ideas he has seen all over the world,\\" Khosla has invented a series of new products to meet those basic needs. All can be produced with locally available materials. He has also devised a franchising system by which local dealerships can distribute new technologies and train people to use them.I agree with Schwartz that there has never been a prior time when the need for inventions was greater, inventions which can alleviate and eventually eliminate the world's problems in areas such as healthcare, nutrition, and education. It is Schwartz's expressed hope that those who read this book will be better prepared to \\"turn on the juice\\" of their own inventiveness. \\"We know that brainstorms are electrical, and you need to have many of them if you want to change the world.... So, let's turn on the juice and see what shakes loose.\\""},{"Title":"Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors","review":"Juice is basically a collection of anecdotes that seeks to describe the invention process. Various individuals are highlighted, showing the thought processes, the constant drive, the problem-framing and problem-solving abilities that are necessary to make useful innovations. However, I found myself wanting to know more in many of these cases. Oftentimes an inventor has an idea and then spends 10 years working to make it a reality. In my mind, what happens in those 10 years is key. But Juice seemed to gloss over these periods. Also, most of the examples used in the book are well known and well documented, so some more original cases would have been good. In the end, the book was interesting and engaging, and an easy read, but could use more substance."},{"Title":"Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors","review":"This book is a delight to read. The author summarizes his interviews and research of noted inventors and concludes that there are eleven secrets to their inventions. These become the chapters in his book:1) Creating Possibilities, 2) Pinpointing Problems, 3) Recognizing Patterns, 4) Channeling Chance, 5) Transcending Boundaries, 6) Detecting Barriers, 7) Applying Analogies, 8) Visualizing Results, 9) Embracing Failure, 10) Multiplying Insights, 11) Thinking Systematically.I found these chapters to be the most interesting: Visualizing Results, Applying Analogies and Thinking Systematically.The book is interesting to read because the author weaves research into invention with interesting interviews with active inventors. Here's an example on visualization, talking with Stephen Jacobsen, Sarcos Research, who runs an invention firm specializing in robotics:\\"... he begins painting word pictures in rapid-fire succession that illustrate how his creations work. He is the kind of man who wouldn't seem outof place zipped up in a silver jumpsuit as the scientific captain on a spacestation orbiting the galaxy... Like many of his peers, Jacobsen collects inventions from the past. In his case, especially, these props serve as inspirations for thinking visually... Jacobsen is more interested in perceiving problems and quandaries firsthand - unburdened by the knowledge of prior approaches -- and then visualizing a new idea on his own.\\"Thus, each chapter develops an important trait of inventors and then illustrates just how that trait is used to invent. He illustrates each chapter with two or three inventors. There is little repeat in the choice of inventors. I found all of the interview material most intriguing. The book ends with a detailed bibliography. But much of the really interesting material came from his interviews with living inventors.This is a delightful, interesting, important and well-written book. Required for anyone interested in invention and technology.John DunbarSugar Land, TX"},{"Title":"Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors","review":"A great read.

Having recently spent time with a famous inventor I was intrigued to learn more about what made people like him \\"tick\\", which seemed to be the subject \\"Juice\\" was attempting to tackle. Imagine my joy when I saw the name of the man I met listed in the inside cover as one of the people Evan Schwartz chose to study in this incredibly informative, inspiring and easy to read book.Choosing to explain through example, Schwartz brings to the forefront the incredible stories of some of the most fascinating thinkers (and doers) living today, most of them completely unknown to the general public. In case after case the building blocks of innovation come to life in compelling fashion and it is not long before the reader concludes, as guided by the author, that behind the seeming randomness of invention is a systematic process that can be studied and emulated.Through meticulous (and probably very fun) research, Schwartz has discovered a through-line in the lives of great inventors froma variety of disciplines that serves to explain or at least illuminate a process that has heretofor been largely ignored. At the very least, if similar research already existed, it has not been made nearly as accesible or compelling.The book is also amazingly up to date and does a great job of leading you toward some pretty profound realizations about our potential future and the kind of people who will help guide us into it.There are few stones left unturned, including obvuoius icons of our history like Bell, Edison, Goodyear, Ford, Farnsworth (whom the author has written another book about that I look forward to reading) and others.Lastly, as someone who has always feared that the sparks of innovation firing within me are doomed to be stifled by the conventions of everyday life, this book (more than others I've read) allowed me to identify profoundly with many of the peculiar processes and tendancies identified by the author. This was an unexpected bonus that accompanied an otherwise fulfilling education and opened a door I look forward to diving through hence forth. Given that one of his key arguments is that many people can nurture the part of our brains that lead to innovative thinking and invention once they understand how and why it works, I imagine many other readers will be equally stimulated."},{"Title":"Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors","review":"I am reading 'Juice - The creative fuel that drives world class inventors' by Evan Schwartz.

The United States has a culture that accepts and rewards invention better than anywhere else in the world, and this is combined with a huge market capable of accepting the volumes of product that are needed to establish a viable business and the capital markets that can fund it.The author of this book is a contributing writer to MIT's Technology Review. He used this background to have discussions with a few dozen inventors and to consolidate their thoughts into this book. The book is a bit different from other books in the invention catagory in that it also discusses such things as why the particular invention is good, and why it makes business sense. Some of the discussions in the book deal with things like the law suits that come from trying to enforce the patent rights of inventions.At a time when the companies are getting bigger, they are also getting less able to invent. This is an interesting book on JUICE, the creative fuel that drives the inventor."},{"Title":"The Old Wives' Tales (Everyman's Library)","review":"I'm certainly not the only person in the world who thinks of this book as a masterpiece. The fact that H.G. Wells, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf all praise this book as being so is one of the reasons I picked it up. In spite of that, I really read it without set expectations.Briefly, to say what has already been said before, The Old Wives Tale is exactly that - a tale of three women who marry in very different circumstances. Mrs. Baines, the mother, is a life who is only briefly touched upon. However, the seperate lives of the two sisters, Sophia and Constance, are the crux of the book. Each life takes its' turn. We are first told about Constance, then about Sophia, and finally, about their reunion. Constance, whose name is not a coincidence, lives a simple provincial life, and Sophia, whose name also matches her persona, chooses romance and adventure. There is only one villain, and yet, he is perhaps the most powerful and chilling of all villains, Time. His grasping, clutching, suffocating presence is ever felt throughout the book, and looms even larger once that final page is turned. In the end, Sophia and Constance each pay the price for their choices, and the true cost of those choices is left for the reader to decide. As unique as we are, we will each believe something different about Sophia and Constance in the end, and that is precisely the point.To sum up the experience of The Old Wives Tale, a tale of three women living their lives, and their lives changing them (or perhaps not changing them, is that it is the most honest approach to human psychology I have ever read. The lives we read about, Mrs. Baines, Sophia, Constance, and even those who surround them, could be anyone's. In fact, most of us can find someone in this book we could point to and say &quot;that's me&quot;. No character, no matter how brief their exit or entrance into this story, is insignificant. Each person gives us a fresh perspective on the human response to events and to, of course, other humans. The three main characters are presented with sheer, unsympathetic, yet respectful honesty. We are not introduced to inhuman, perfect, idealistic souls in this book. Nor are we looking through the eyes of the wicked. Instead, we are searching the souls of ordinary people and in the end, are left with a question about our own existence.In fact, it should be a large clue to readers when they see that the title of the fourth section is, What Life Is. It is here that something occurred which I totally unexpected, and it left me quite shaken - in fact, desperate. I found that I had been brought from the comfortable vantage point of observing these fictional lives, which are at times inexplicably amusing and heroic, to a sudden uncomfortable sensation that the characters were real and had turned toward me - the reader - begging the question &quot;What of your life? What have you done with it? What have you accomplished?&quot;That subtle change of vantage point was shocking, and ingenious. Without criticizing his own creation, the author was able to communicate the importance of living our lives to the fullest without telling us how. This fact alone shows great wisdom. Sophia and Constance experience remarkable things, no more remarkable than most people, but remarkable just the same. Each reacts differently because they are different, and each has a different idea about how to find happiness and how to deal with life's disappointments. Both are frequently of the opinion that they could improve someone else's life, yet have not found real satisfaction in their own. Each makes mistakes, and each perform the heroic. The author will on the same page be blunt about their faults and tender with their plight. He tells their story without judgement, and yet in the end, you feel you have read a very wise judgement on the nature of the human race. Here, reader, you will find no prescription for life, but a question that begs a diagnosis. The author makes it starkly clear that the remedy, or whether a remedy is even required, is up to you.The Old Wives Tale is not a dark story. It is not a comedy. It is not high adventure or mystery. In fact, it is many of these things put together to create something REAL. And it has shaken me to the core."},{"Title":"The Old Wives' Tales (Everyman's Library)","review":"I first read this wonderful book many years ago.

I stayed up all night rereading it. \\"The Old Wives' Tale\\" is a heartbreaker, but superb. As somone else has pointed out, there's a real villain in the book, but the villain isn't human: it's Time. It's difficult for me to imagine anyone reading the last few lines without being touched. I agree with Somerset Maugham: I feel presumptuous even praising it.

This book is longer and more complex but carries on the direct form of writing that seems to characterize Bennett's work. The direct, simple form of his prose draws the reader in and involves her in the experiences in these two women's lives. The ending, though expected, is still tragic and leaves the reader to reconsider what life is and just how it affected the sisters. I wish I could find more books by him about the five towns. I read voraciously and am always surprised by how moved I have been by Mr. Bennett's work.

And ther lies the basis of the story-how does one go from being a beautiful,fun loving girl to a boisterous old lady.Well as the story delves further into their lives we witness everything that happens and therefore shapes their lives.In real life events, whether large or small will determine our next path in life and here we get to see where they end up.A terrific read for something written in 1908."},{"Title":"The Old Wives' Tales (Everyman's Library)","review":"I am largely a reader of non-fiction and I determined I should undertake more fiction so I started with a recommendations list. When I counted the pages in this novel, I thought &quot;Oh, no! I will never complete this book!&quot; I honestly couldn't put it away until I had completed it.The book focuses on two sisters, Sophia and Constance. These sisters are opposite each other in most ways except the family traditions. Each takes a different path in life. Sophia pursues happiness and Constance seeks the appropriate traditional life - no waves for this girl.Sophia becomes independent but remains unhappy, it seems. Constance does what is right, but to me seems unhappy as well. Several readers ask if Bennett liked his characters. Seems as if Bennett chose to keep their character's as un-romantic as possible. There are no fairy tale endings in this book.Despite the gloom and despair I found The Old Wives Tale a compelling read. I wanted happiness to fill their lives but it never seemed to come. The read was inviting and not at all tedious."},{"Title":"The Old Wives' Tales (Everyman's Library)","review":"The Old Wives' Tale is not in any way a challenging read, but it is enjoyable and seems to be an accurate reflection of the gradual effects of time on a way of life as embodied in the Baines sisters. Bennett seems especially acute in his observation of the way habit eventually defines personality for both sisters and the grand movement of history only appears sweeping in retrospect.I am surprised by some of the earlier reviews of this novel. They seem to criticism of Bennett's source of inspiration rather than of the novel itself. Which of us has not seen an individual at some stage of development and been struck by the revelation that he or she was once an infant or teenager or young adult? This does not imply condescension.Bennett's portraits of Constance and Sophia are largely sympathetic. He does not see either as faultless and in some ways both are pathetic, but his object is to show us the whole range of each of his heroines' lives so that when we find them late in life to be stubborn and incapable of change, we can see the source of their defects without condemnation. Readers need only ask themselves at the end of novel whether he likes the sisters or not to gauge whether Bennett's portraits are sympathetic.It is hard for me to see how anyone could finish this novel wondering whether Bennett likes these women."},{"Title":"The Old Wives' Tales (Everyman's Library)","review":"I was so happy to see so many positive reviews of this wonderful novel. When the Modern Library published it's list of the 100 Best Books of the Century, I decided I should attempt to read them all. In the end, I am about a quarter of a way through the list and I am continually glad that I took on the challenge since it has led to me wonderful, but more obscure, novels from the last century, this being one of the best examples.When I picked up the Old Wives Tale I had a similar thought to a previous reviewer: there was no way I was going to finish this book. But after reading Bennett's introduction and starting the first few pages, I found myself intrigued by this family. They are so normal that you find yourself relating to them, whether good or bad. They lived through such changing times, but for the sisters, whether they were in Bursley or Paris, life went on as usual. That is probably the most remarkable thing about this book. No matter what people live through, they generally are unaffected by the larger world around them. It's the private lives, the inner workings of a household or the change in ownership of their homes, which really troubles or changes them. In the end though, Bennett's old wives are what compels you to finish the story since you want to see how their lives end and how their relationship to each other changes through the years. Bennett stays true to human nature throughout the work, there are no death bed confessions or wild changes of character. In the end there is just one woman left standing, trying to keep time from pushing on and changing her world.Bennett is a master storyteller and he combines just enough detail with dialogue to get the point across and get the reader through the book. His prose is very precise and I found myself surprised from time to time that this book was published in 1908.

The story gripsone like a thriller, but the book is far more than that. The last section\\"What Life Is\\" reminds us that truth is just as often felt in the theheart as perceived in the mind.

Yet it is not a thriller but basically a story of two sisters who follow very different paths.In the style of authors like Flaubert, this is a male author writing mainly about the lives of two sisters, within the context of the potteries in England and Paris in France around the second half of the nineteenth century. There are times when one would have wanted more about the thinking of the male characters.In some ways the ending seems an anti-climax. After reading about 600 pages there is an unspoken expectation of something dramatic. But that did not happen. This is simply a story of two sisters, Constance who stays at home, gets married, had a child and follows a lifestyle common of people of her generation. Her sister Sophia, on the other hand, much more restless and wanting more out of life, elopes but then is left on her own in Paris where after a lot of hardship and hard work, becomes a very strong and wealthy woman. Bennett has got a wonderful style of writing. All the descriptions, like the execution in Paris are detailed in such a way that the author becomes completely involved.In many ways this is a detailed social history of the shopkeepers in England. Relations with customers and with servants are as important as the following of the protocol at marriages and deaths. What is also interesting is the way in which lifestyles were changing, especially when the small shop with everything made by hand is replaced by a big outlet for mass-produced goods.Well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Old Wives' Tales (Everyman's Library)","review":"This is a beautiful book. Tracing the full arc of two human lives, it should be read by everyone who is at that earlier stage in life's journey where its final stages seem impossibly distant. Yes, the ending is sad - or is it? Don't we all come to that final point? And isn't there a kind of richness in having experienced the journey? Because really, \\"that's all there is.\\"Of course we also get the marvellously detailed picture of the world towards the end of the 19th century: the social framework, the customs and shared understanding of behavior, the physical setting of the unglamorous towns of the western Midlands, and how they too changed over the years, and the \\"City of Light.\\" How does anyone achieve that incredibly full and in-depth imaginative re-creation? But above all, the poignancy of the complete separation of two sisters for most of their lives; the stay-at-home in the drapery shop and house in Bursley, and the daring young woman who elopes with Gerald to Paris and what became of that...Incidentally, I really liked his trick to remind us when conversations are in French - he gives the English as a literal translation, retaining the French syntax. Neat.Not everyone, in today's frenetic world, will be able to settle in to the leisurely pace of \\"The Old Wives' Tale.\\" But if you can, I believe you will be very moved by it."},{"Title":"The Old Wives' Tales (Everyman's Library)","review":"It's very true that Bennett's prose is full of wonderful, vivid and often ironic commentary. This book gives you a great sense of place to the \\"five towns\\" (based on the six towns that would become Stoke-on-Trent) from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth. Detail is exactly right for time and place. That makes it a rather interesting read.However, there's next to no forward motion to this book. Two sisters lead divergent lives-- the beautiful one runs off with a hapless commercial traveler to Paris. The dutiful one stays home, manages the shop, and marries the clerk. But that's about it for drama. Both sisters grow older, have some not very interesting stuff happen to them, then meet up again after a long time and end their lives together. OK, Sophia, the beautiful one, does survive the siege of Paris, and become a manager/proprietress of a well-run pension. But somehow even this lacks drama.Bennett is often praised for how well he wrote his women characters. I disagree. They are well observed it's true, and some of his projections about what they might feel-- when Constance, the dutiful one, faces \\"empty nest syndrome\\" so mournfull, for example-- are accurate. But he imagines no real complexity for them. Both women are extraordinarily passive in most ways. The men in the book occupy far less time but manage to seem more human. Compare and contrast JANE EYRE: on the surface a rather prim, direct governess-- but as Bronte writes her, she has a passionate, vibrant beating heart.In Bennett's world, women don't particularly long for sex nor care about it, nor think much about attachment at all. I think it's very telling that Bennett was inspired by the sight of an older woman in a restaurant. It was not a woman he knew, but a woman he saw. He imagined everything else about her.If the time and place is enough to draw you in, then this book certainly does have that, as the 600-something pages sprawl about 50 years. But if you like a good narrative, apart from \\"people get older,\\" look elsewhere. The writing is very good, but although Bennett's often compared to Balzac and Zola, he lacks their punch-- and I also think, essentially lacks their heart."},{"Title":"The Old Wives' Tales (Everyman's Library)","review":"Arnold Bennett was in a restaurant in Paris one day and a haggard old woman, apparently a maniac, got into a tussle with a beautiful young waitress. Bennett had an epiphany and realized that the old woman too must have once been young and pretty and full of life. He decided there and then to write a novel that would chart the arc of such a woman's life. The result is this naturalist classic, by one of the last truly 19th Century writers. But it begs the question: is an author a humanist or a condescending phallus when it comes as a revelation to him that old unattractive women may have lead full and interesting lives?In the event, Bennett wrote a book about two sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines, daughters of a shopkeeper in the Five Towns where he set all of his novels. Sophia, who leads the more exciting life, runs off to Paris with a louse of a husband, but Constance, modeled on the old woman, stays in Bursley and marries the assistant in the shop. Late in life, the two women are reunited, dying within a brief time of one another. The version of the book that I read has an Introduction by JB Priestley, wherein he says:If we think first of the two sisters as young girls, then this tale is grim, a tragedy; but if we think first (as Bennett did) of the apparently dull old women and then realise that they marched through this epic, then the tale is a romance.Now, I'm not the most sensitive flower in the garden, but I just find that totally offensive. It seems to me that it is a fair representation of the attitude of the intelligentsia throughout history: pity the poor hoi polloi, what dull lives they must lead. But it defies logic to assume that the great mass of mankind leads lives of desparation and disappointment. It would seem that the contrary is probably true; most folks probably lead perfectly satisfactory lives, even if they are just working 9 to 5 and then going bowling or watching wrestling and NASCAR on TV. We may not all pursue the same highbrow interests as the authors and artists of the world, but there's no reason to assume that we're any less happy with our lives. And even the fat old chick pumping coins into a video poker machine may be as happy as a pig in slop.I had honestly never even heard of Bennett until there was a piece on him in the New York Times Book Review a couple of years ago. I've since made an effort to read his stuff and I find much to like in his work. But the attitude that gave birth to this book infects his narrative voice and I found it pretty annoying.GRADE: C"},{"Title":"The Old Wives' Tales (Everyman's Library)","review":"Reputedly, Bennett wrote this books after seeing an old woman in a restaurant and wondering what her life must be like. But, it appears he didn't trust that her life would be interesting enough, so he introduces a sister who lives a far more wayward life. As a result, he produces two different books welded together precariously by this sisterly relationship.The two sisters' stories are interesting enough (although he should have stuck with the stay-at-home sister, she's more interesting and believable). What wrecks the books is Bennett's condescending, smug attitude towards his characters. One feels that he would cross the street if these ladies ever deigned to cross his path. His snide comments about their actions and habits quickly grow tiresome. One can only hope that he ended his life alone in a garret tyrannized by the hired help.

Why this is particularly contentious with Grant supporters is a trifle mystifying, but Grant fans still vociferously contend the author &quot;embellished&quot; or &quot;lied&quot; about the drinking binge. Never mind that two other people who were also with Grant corroborate the drinking story. Never mind that his chief of staff specifically wrote about the binging in a private letter.Aside from this drinking anecdote, the book is a warm, rich portrayal of General Grant from a man with a discerning eye. Cadwallader relates many small incidents of Grant's everyday life as a man and as a general that are fascinating and not to be found in other first-person narratives.Cadwallader truly loved Grant and his book shows his regard and his profound attachment to him. It's a pity that so many people denigrate such a fine book simply because they feel the author's memory was fallible or because they refuse to see Grant as a multi-facted man. A man with his share of human frailties and weaknesses, but still a towering individual: a great general and a man of uncommon moral fiber and decency. If you know little about Grant, this is a good place to begin a journey in seeking to know him as a man and as a great soldier who saved the union."},{"Title":"Three years with Grant, as recalled by war correspondent Sylvanus Cadwallader","review":"During the early part of the Civil War, war correspondents were, for the most part, despised reptilians. As far as most of the Union High Command was concerned, they were a scurrilous lot that could not be trusted to be fair in their reporting. They were people who fabricated stories, published battle plans before the battle, were capable of being bribed to produce favorable and untrue stories to assist in one's career planning and could, with the scratch of a pen, terminate the careers of good soldiers. Small wonder the relationship between journalism and the military was adversarial.Sylvanus Cadwallader set standards in Civil War journalism. This is not a story about the Civil War but rather is the story of how this intrepid man's character enabled him to establish himself as a valuable addition to Sam Grant's Headquarters staff. Becoming a permanent fixture on Grant's staff he literally endeared himself as a trusted confidant. His tent was always pitched close to Grant's, Grant signed passes that enabled him to go wherever he wanted, whenever he wanted to. He had the ability to use, even commandeer, any form of transportation he required, horse, train or boat. He did not abuse his privileges nor did he betray confidences.These reminisces reveal information not contained in his dispatches. Cadwallader remained with Grant through Union operations in southern Tennessee and northern Mississippi, the Vicksburg campaign (where he is captured and released and subsequently, in a different escapade, gathers intelligence for Grant at the battle of Champion Hill), Chattanooga, the Wilderness (where he is again captured, but escapes), Cold Harbor, the crossing of the James River, City Point and is present for the Union Army's breakthrough at Petersburg and Lee's subsequent surrender at Appomattox Court House. We get a clear picture of Grant, a man Cadwallader thought a military genius. Living close to Grant from October 1862 until the end of the war, Cadwallader was one of the few men, certainly the only civilian, who had a clear view of how the Civil War was fought at the command level. He depicts Grant in the heat of battle and relaxing with friends. He reveals Grant as a surprisingly good military politician, that Grant thought more highly of Sheridan than Sherman, that Grant personally disliked Ben Butler and thought little of Governeur Warren's military skills. Cadwallader observed many Union officers at close range: Sherman, Sheridan, Logan, Wallace, Thomas, Butler, Warren, Meade and others. He appraises their military talents candidly.The author finished this work in 1896 when he was seventy years old. It was never published. Until its acquisition by the Illinois Historical Society and subsequent publication in 1955, few people had ever read it. It is a wonderful, colorful, insightful work that transports you back into a period of our history when our survival as a Nation was in serious doubt. But perhaps as important, through these reminisces we get a clear picture of Cadwallader himself. He appears honest, straight forward, scrappy, tenacious, remarkably loyal and above all, exceptionally professional in his work and conduct. He gains our respect and admiration today, just as surely as he did throughout the campaigns he covered and the men he interfaced with, 150+ years ago.This book is as fine a glimpse into this segment of our history as is available today."},{"Title":"Three years with Grant, as recalled by war correspondent Sylvanus Cadwallader","review":"If you are familiar with the campaigns of General Grant then you will find this book worthwile.Cadwallader has a front row seat at Vicksburg, Chattanoga,the Wilderness,and Appomattox.

I was drawn to this book because of my life-long interest in, what I understood to be, the monastic life. Not Catholic and not well-read, this book confirmed my ignorance of the whole topic! Wonder how true Fermor's findings would be if he revisited these monasteries today. Do they even exist?I live a similar life, by choice, but my choice is birthed by selfishness. A remote ranch, I actually see people about once every six weeks or so. I use television only for DVDs that greatly appeal to me - one per month, at a guess.Before I retired, I had music in the background at all times. Now, it is impossible for me! I find that such silence, as Fermor mentions when he exited St. Wandrille the first time, makes one so sensitive to sound that a very little of it becomes overwhelming. I find that if I wish to listen to music or play the piano or sing, I have to concentrate only on those activities. There is no place, in my life, for background \\"noise.\\" Such seclusion really does allow one to more clearly identify personal priorities. After a while, that priority list becomes smaller and the items left on it can be very surprising.What I learned from this book was astonishing! I had simply never considered that a monk or a monastery abiding by St. Benedict's rules and vows of silence considered themselves to be active in the greater community of Christendom. I had always thought that, like my own self-imposed isolation, monasticism was very personal - one-on-one with oneself to, perhaps, further one's relationship to God. When Fermor explained that those organized and virtually continuous (in one way or the other) prayers of the monks in St. Wandrilles and the extreme - really really extreme- living conditions and self-flagellation of the Trappes were as bolsters to the external Christians and as vicarious penance simply floored me. Incredible and deeply moving.If I weren't such a complete and absolute coward and if it still exists, I can think of few things more desirable than to visit The Rock Monasteries of Cappadocia. No words come to mind to express my awe over the descriptions. Such a dangerous part of the world today. I can't imagine that any of it remains or that an American Woman would be permitted to visit.The histories of the founders of these monasteries and of the rise and fall of that part of Catholicism (and of some of Anglicanism) was fascinating.My true problem with this book is that I have not the personal lexicon to read it easily. Only 96 pages and it took me WEEKS to read. I had to take recourse to online dictionaries on every page which, then, would require me to re-read the page(s.) That was just the ENGLISH part! I gave up on the French parts about 10 pages in. My high-school-learned French was clearly not sufficient and online translators were less than helpful.Even so, the writing itself, apart from the fascinating subject, was so fluid and so rich that I suspect I will reread this on occasion - just to experience that flow.DL"},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"Very short read, but very challenging and specialized vocabulary. Interesting for anyone with a monastic curiosity. Informative about Orders of Catholic clergy."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"Patrick Leigh Fermor needed quiet to write so he retreated to a French monastery, and thereby hangs the tale . . . It is a wonderful meditation and description of monastic life with addenda expanding his basic subject. Fermor did not begin with an allegiance to monastic life, and I don't think he ended with one--but his appreciation is another thing. I read his book and came away with complete admiration for the lives of the monks; a great desire to participate in their services; and a respect for their motives.All of Fermor's books are worth both the read and then the study they provoke, but if one does due diligence, they may take time. This is a little easier than most. I read it in one day, and will read it again. It is easy to recommend this book as a rewarding exploration of the holy calling as practiced by monks, and a melodic Fermor read."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"Absolutely, wonderfully crafted book by a master wordsmith that takes us beyond our worlds and lives of comfort into a place of silence, devotion and total selflessness"},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"This is a short read. In true Leigh Fermor style, the writing is inspired and inspiring. Patrick Leigh Fermor, the last great Englishman, had the extraordinary ability to relate to people, to \\"get under their skin\\" and to understand (and represent) them better than they understood themselves, one suspects. The result is writing so beautiful and informed, it lifts you up and transports you directly to places and times you could hardly otherwise imagine. In this slim account of the purpose and character of monastic life, he packs in so much interpretation and insight, you know you will return to this reading delight again and again, and always learn something new and important.A Time to Keep Silence cannot really be called a book. It is rather a collection of essays. The first, and most profound, is a deeply personal reflection on the life and times of Benedictine monks. His journey of discovery is probably the most moving of all his travel writing. Leigh Fermor brings a remarkable freshness and free spiritedness in an account that is totally free from dogmatism, presumption or received wisdom. His second essay on the Trappists is engaging too, but whereas he is captivated by Benedictine discipline and intellectualism, he is alarmed by the seeming brutality of Trappist life. The last chapter is a curiosity - an attempt to reconstruct with very little evidence, the unexplained lives of the cave dwelling monks of Cappadocia.In very short order, he leaves his reader entranced, bewildered and curious. The most lasting feeling, however, is one of deep sadness at what the world has lost. You don't have to be religious to feel this way, just human."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"came across this book mentioned in Susan Hill's Howards End is on the Landing and was intrigued by what she said about it. The author spent some time in different monasteries in an effort to find peace and to write a book - not this one - that came later. What I enjoyed about the book was the author's marvellous grasp of the English language. The book is lyrical and evocative and fascinating to anyone who is interested in alternative ways of life.I found the book interesting for its insights into different ways of monastic life from the very strict Trappist orders of Cistercian monks at Le Grand Trappe near Alencon to the rather more relaxed orders of Benedictines with whom he stayed for many months at St Wandrille de Fontanelle near Rouen.The author was surprised at how happy all the monks were and the sense of peace, calm and joy they all exude. Monasteries are places of spiritual healing and quiet and the author found peace and quiet. No one questioned his own beliefs and they accepted him as he was.The mystery of the rock monasteries in Cappadocia which are described in the last section of the book was intriguing as well and it is likely that no one will ever discover who they were built by or for what purpose. This is a book which is well worth reading for the use of language alone and I shall be reading it again at some point for that reason."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"A wonderful slim volume about the authors sojourns in various Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries.

I found that annoying but am glad that I bought the book."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"\\"A Time To Keep Silence\\" is travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor's beautifully written account of visits to a number of European monasteries (Benedictine and Cistercian) and later to the ruins of an even older Turkish desert community in his efforts to understand the continuing appeal of the monastic way of life. An outsider, Fermor frankly acknowledges his contemporary bias, making it clear he's a man of the world whose direct intention is not to seek a believer's purification of soul. Instead, he wants to discover why an initially unattractive way of life, one that must strike a big-city dweller like himself as filled with deprivation and sadness, has continued through the centuries to exert its appeal upon men, men of a sort he discovers through his own experience to be not only psychologically balanced, but largely happy.The telling insight Fermor receives from his initial stay at St. Wandrille's, one reconfirmed after visits through the years to other Benedictine abbeys, is that hidden within abbey walls is something truly magical, \\"the slow and cumulative spell of healing quietness.\\" Whereas the abbey had struck him first as a place about as exciting as a \\"graveyard,\\" it becomes one where he discovers, after a painful adjustment, that he can dispense with interfering trivalities and begin to look at life steadily and whole. Not surprisingly, when he returns to the outside world, he has to adjust once again, the world now seeming after his monastic stay \\"an inferno of noise and vulgarity entirely populated by bounders and sluts and crooks.\\"Fermor's insights in this book are equally matched by his extraordinary descriptive powers. Like any true poet, he is enough a lover of the world's body to give it a memorable description. When he speaks of the long sleeves of monks' robes brushing the floor, for instance, he says they are \\"like the ends of elephants' trunks.\\" And describing the arid desert location of the long since abandoned Turkish monastery, he talks of \\"lion-colored uplands\\" and \\"biscuit-colored villages.\\" Far from simply telling what he sees, Fermor through stunning word painting allows his readers the pleasure of seeing with him."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"The other night, needing a calm book after an agitating day, I re-read this short but typically-- granted this author's ability to convey much depth in a few pages-- account of the famed travel writer's visits to monasteries. His simple account focuses on a long stay at St Wandrille's in Belgium, a bit of Solesmes, more at La Grande Trappe in France, and the journey later among the ruins of Cappadocian foundations in Turkey.Fermor knows his limitations in retreating to such places in search of solitude to work on his own manuscripts. He tries to take on the mystery of the call to silence even as he tries to put it into words, to account for its appeal to a few and its strangeness to many of us. The results may not please all readers, for Fermor submits to the difference he encounters, and so by his lay status must remain too at the margins of what the monks take decades to live within. Writing well before Vatican II, Fermor conjures up an astonishingly austere regimen that he glimpses among the Trappists at their motherhouse; the Belgian Benedictines, by contrast, earn much more time for study and scholarship.I wondered, in the decades since, how many monks remain at such European houses. Fermor provides us with efficiently told summaries of the past depredations and recoveries of such venerable communities, and one closes Fermor's depictions of life as it was lived there a half a century ago with a realization of how close it was to observances centuries older. Again, such a description leaves me to ponder how much as been altered and how much remains the same given the enormous shifts in Catholic practice and the decline in vocations since then.This reflection leads to the comparatively short glimpse of the biscuit-colored mountains, with their pyramidical, anthill-like terrain, that housed some of the first monks in Christianity. The photos, as the one on the cover show, of this forbidding terrain remind me of an objective correlative for La Grande Trappe. The caves, the few remains, the hostile environment present, it seems, Fermor with a sense of an otherworldly terrain in more ways than one."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"Another great book by a great travel writer. This is a very quick read, but absolutely stuffed with erudition. For all but the most educated, it wouldn't hurt to read this with Wikipedia as a companion piece. As with his other travel books, the mix of architecture, history, linguistics, and an obvious personal touch lend an air of familiarity which, in the end, help give the impression that you have experienced these things yourself.I once read a review which stated this book concluded that the vow of silence and other retreats from secular life were not effective or warranted in some circumstances. In my opinion, this conclusion was not reached by the author. The opposite appears to be true - Fermor's return to secular life seemed to be more traumatic than his adjustment period during his first visit. His understanding is remarkable and serves as a good lesson to the casual reader - his hosts honestly believe they are suffering in order to atone for the sins of the world, and they ask for nothing in return."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"I am a Benedictine, and I just finished reading A TIME FOR SILENCE by Patrick Leigh Fermer. I am distressed by the fact that he seems to think that Benedict's Rule is strict and severe. \\"Au contraire!\\" Of course he was writing before Vatican II, which might account for that impression. I realize some of our practices might seem difficult. Take silence for instance. Our world is so filled with noise and distraction that silence can be a very hard discipline for one who is not accustomed to the richness of it. I guess I would like to tell Mr. Fermer that Benedictine life isn't about asceticism for its own sake. Aspects of our life that may seem ascetical are really about clearing away anything that might distract us from the spiritual journey - a journey that's not just for monastics but for everyone! Other than that, the book is an interesting read as a travelogue. I was especially interested in the bit about the abandoned rock monasteries of Cappadocia. I knew nothing about them."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"because it's so beautiful. Lovely, inspiring, all too brief. I want to know much more about this man and these monasteries. I tried to read Thomas Merton's Seven Story Mountain because I'm interested in monastic life and I couldn't get through it. Leigh Fermor, on the other hand, isn't on a faith journey. He's a writer looking for a quiet place to work. Yet he manages to tell me more about why one might choose to leave the world and become a monk than I got from Thomas Merton."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"I'm a big fan of Fermor's writing and this little gem of a book is a departure from the classic travel works he has given us. In this short book, Fermor describes life in several monasteries where silence defines the world of the monk. Fermor stipulates that as a guest in these places he will never achieve the level of faith and monastic practice that the monks do, but he shines a light on their world, giving the reader a glimpse of an existence we've always wondered about but rarely got to know."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"Anyone who, on a journey through the world, can stumble into the Trappist world and both embrace, respect, and absorb the difficulty has got to be worth reading.

He was the very last of a heroic generation of British travel-writers who earlier had earned distinction as soldiers during World War II (a group that included Peter Fleming, Norman Lewis, and Wilfred Thesiger). Leigh Fermor's WWII exploits were particularly notable. He lived for two years in the mountains of German-occupied Crete, organizing resistance activities, and in 1944 he led the mission that abducted the German Commander General Heinrich Kreipe, a story that became the subject of the film \\"Ill Met by Moonlight\\".After WWII Leigh Fermor embarked on a career as a travel-writer that brought him even greater distinction. His best-known books were set in the Balkans and Greece. A TIME TO KEEP SILENCE is an earlier one. Originally published in 1957, it contains Leigh Fermor's thoughts on the monastic life, as occasioned by a series of stays at Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries in France in 1952, followed by a visit to the ancient (and long-abandoned) rock monasteries of Cappadocia in Turkey.A TIME TO KEEP SILENCE is not the paradigmatic travel book of action and adventure in exotic places. The monasteries are, by design, sequestered havens of quietude and solitude. The \\"unfamiliar\\" that the author reports on is not so much a foreign land of strange sights and sounds as an inner world and an alien modality of living. As Leigh Fermor writes, \\"The secret of monastic life, that entire abdication of the will and the enthronement of the will of God which solves all problems and trials and turns a life of such acute outward suffering into one of peace and joy, is a thing that it is given to few outside a cloister fully to comprehend.\\" Reading A TIME TO SLIENCE will give the non-cloistered secular reader of this modern world a much better appreciation of that other world, a world that truly does seem to be imbued with peace and joy.What most distinguishes A TIME TO KEEP SILENCE is the extraordinary prose - cultivated and recondite, yet gracious and relaxed. Leigh Fermor is a master of description, both of physical settings and of spiritual or psychological ambiance. Here is a longish extract, from Leigh Fermor's first visit to the Abbey of St Wandrille de Fontanelle: \\"As the monks dispersed after Vespers and, a few hours later, after Compline, I had a sensation of the temperature of life falling to zero, the blood running every second thinner and slower as if the heart might in the end imperceptibly stop beating. These men really lived as if each day were their last, at peace with the world, shriven, fortified by the sacraments, ready at any moment to cease upon the midnight with no pain. Death, when it came, would be the easiest of change-overs. The silence, the appearance, the complexion and the gait of ghosts they had already; the final step would be only a matter of detail.\\"I first read A TIME TO KEEP SILENCE about twelve years ago. It was rewarding and enriching to read it again, as I believe it would be were I to read it in another ten or so years (which I hope to be able to do). My copy predates the New York Review Books edition, but NYRB deserves commendation for keeping it and the other major books of Leigh Fermor in print. His is a voice of culture and wonder that, I hope, does not pass into antiquity for generations to come."},{"Title":"A Time to Keep Silence","review":"this books is so interesting!

Booth believesthat grapefruit grow on vines! The hardcover edition of this book came out in 1986 as a tie in with the broadcasting of &quot;Man eaters of kumaon&quot; a BBC docudrama which was also scripted poorly by Booth, painting him with a 'chi-chi accent' whatever that might be. Corbett was not a reward hunter according to other biographers, but according to the script Corbett was 'amply rewarded'.

He appears to have done his homework, digging into the family history back several generations. This, in fact, is the problem with the book; he's done too much research and can't bear to edit any of it out. The first half of the book passes without any tiger being stalked, and that is all Corbett is famous for. The only portions of the book with any drama are those hunting tales he re-tells from Corbett's own books.He also spins in a tremendous amount of speculation about the motivations of Corbett and his family members and friends. He tries to support these speculations with his research, but it's largely unconvincing.Don't waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"Carpet Sahib: A Life of Jim Corbett","review":"Good job in gathering some of the photographs published in the book, butthere are far too many contradictions in the text, a sign of writig in haste.The cover design for the original hard cover was good, but the Oxford reprint, the paperback edition, without any illustrations, looked pathetic!"},{"Title":"Carpet Sahib: A Life of Jim Corbett","review":"All the mystery and charm of British India; the exitement of hunting Man eating tigers,Jim Corbett's enigmatic mixture of man of action and &quot;sadhu &quot; . probably the best loved whiteman who ever lived in India."},{"Title":"Carpet Sahib: A Life of Jim Corbett","review":"Booth, I believe has done a very good job in writing this biography. He has very articulately brought Jim Corbett's strenghts and weaknesses to the reader. Jim Corbett was a brilliant hunter, a practical man and an enterprising business man. This book is definitely a treat for people who have read Jim Corbett earlier. He was fiercely patriotic and loyal to the Crown but also very much in love with India. Its just amazing to how brave and agile this man was. A true legend indeed.I got this book as a gift from my brother, with whom I have enjoyed reading Corbett stories as little boys. Without any doubt - Corbett; through Booth is still as refreshing as Corbett in his own words."},{"Title":"Carpet Sahib: A Life of Jim Corbett","review":"I think Booth has done a marvellous job with Carpet Sahib. Anyone who has ever travelled to northern India - and Kumaon in particular - will appreciate Booth's vivid and sympathetic portrayal of the subject, the people of the hills and terai, and the tigers and leopards which roamed them so freely. Sadly, that world is no more. Kumaon today is a very different place. Luckily, I managed to see a tiger when I visited Corbett National Park in Uttar Pradesh, and reading this book in my cabin while hyenas sniffed and scratched outside my window was a magical experience. Carpet Sahib is a fine book and one of the few available on this fascinating individual and the wilderness of northern India."},{"Title":"The Immortal Dickens","review":"SINCE I OWN THE 82 YEARS OLD BOOK, I ENJOYED READING THIS AND WRITING NOTES [IN THE MARGINS] FOR SCHOOL CLASSES.

The book is arranged in a series of exercises that are fun, thought-provoking, and not at all difficult, even for complete beginners. The text for each lesson is well-written. Crespo compresses a lot of useful art theory into brief but very usable form. Although the author uses some of his own paintings as demonstrations,the majority of the illustrations show student work. The pictures are beautiful in their own right. They also offer great encouragement to beginners who may be intimidated by seeing too much technically perfect work in conventional art instruction books.I have been working with watercolor for nearly thirty years, but I still learned something new from every page of this book!"},{"Title":"Watercolor Class: An Innovative Course in Transparent Watercolor (Practical Art Books)","review":"This is an exceptional book of graded lessons on how to watercolor. It is completely different from any other &quot;how to&quot; book on watercolors that I've seen, (which to me are mostly &quot;show off&quot; books). Crespo is genuinely dedicated to teaching students - while teaching technical skills, there is a wonderful sense of humanity, love for teaching, and awe of the mysterious essence of nature which shines through. Instead of having illustrations which show only master watercolors, (as many books do - a good way to discourage the beginning watercolorist right off the bat), most of the examples Crespo gives are of his own students' work, and only a few of his own. He points out what is wonderful about the students' work, (which is such a refreshing change from critiquing student work and pointing out in graphic and gorey detail what is wrong with it!) The lessons are carefully graded, building on what has already been learned. The assignments are stimulating and fun, with just enough challenge to not feel overwhelming.I can't say enough good things about this book. As in all the best teaching, what shines forth in Crespo's is not only his knowledge of technique, but his love for the medium, his students, and life."},{"Title":"Watercolor Class: An Innovative Course in Transparent Watercolor (Practical Art Books)","review":"I have both studied under Michael Crespo as well as read this book. He is an amazing teacher and an amazing painter. This book is a very well done translation of the structure of his course, and will be a boon to anyone trying to learn on their own or bolster classes."},{"Title":"Watercolor Class: An Innovative Course in Transparent Watercolor (Practical Art Books)","review":"Woody Allen said that &quot;Ninety percent of success in life is just showing up.&quot; This is true for art skills too. Crespo has made this easy in this book. He helps us to realize that our efforts are art and that art should be fun.For example, Crespo's Day 1 of the second semester is an exercise encouraging artists to &quot;begin again.&quot; He stated, &quot;Remember: relax, love what you're doing, and don't take yourself too seriously. Let your critics do that&quot; (p. 138).I am starting through this book for the second or third time. I don't know if I will ever be a famous artist, but now I know that I am an artist. Crespo's exercises help me find work to do and help me to focus on principles. Every exercise yields one or several paintings that I can display. Right now I am doing a series of 3 paintings. One in normal value, one in high key and one in low key. I am having a lot of fun.The exercises have really helped me improve over the years. Anyone can learn something from this book. But the best thing is that you can feel good about what you are doing. You always have plenty of critics; Crespo is someone who encourages you to suspend criticism and to enjoy creativity and growth."},{"Title":"Watercolor Class: An Innovative Course in Transparent Watercolor (Practical Art Books)","review":"Through a series of lessons and exercises, the book helps painters develop their skills in watercolor in particular, and painting in general.

Truly an inspirational book by a powerful painter.

Unfortunately, I don't think the author is a very good painter, so it is hard to take the lessons very seriously.The book has some worth, teaching you how to see shape, then shades, composition, and then executing paintings. It builds one lesson on another. But the bottom line is the paintings aren't anywhere near as good as Jan Kunz, or other well-known artists. So it is hard to take the author's advice.I am sorry I bought the book, and will probably sell it to someone else.

For all of the years that the &quot;Ships of the Line&quot; calendars have been published, Paramount and Andrews McMeel Publishing has had the respect to use imagery from all of the television series, that is not the case with this 2004 calendar.With all due respect to the powers that be when it comes to Star Trek, the lack of just a &quot;single&quot; image from Star Trek Deep Space Nine is just another slight against Star Trek's best overall series which in this reviewer's opinion was the richest character and plot driven series to date! One would've thought that the successful sales numbers throughout this last year on the DS9 DVD sets and Pocket Books DS9 re-launch series would've garnered DS9 some more respect, apparently not though. I guess DS9 and its multitude of fans can and will continue to wear the &quot;red headed stepchild&quot; hat proudly!Although there have been some rough spots in the Star Trek Enterprise endeavor over the last two and a half seasons, I've stuck with it just as I had with all of the other series. Having said that, I would say that the number of images in this calendar devoted to Star Trek Enterprise suggests to me that they should've just finished it off with all of the images being from Enterprise and called it the Star Trek Enterprise calendar because this one is clearly aimed at improving that series image and hopefully increasing its viewer ship.Since there is no link providing any of the images for this calendar they are as follows:Strangely enough, the cover art here on Amazon is an image from Star Trek Enterprise, the calendar in my hand has some extraordinary imagery from Star Trek to include the Enterprise NCC-1701-A, an Excelsior class starship and three Klingon battle cruisers.January - Star Trek EnterpriseFebruary - Star TrekMarch - Star TrekApril - Star Trek VoyagerMay - Star TrekJune - Star Trek EnterpriseCenterfold - Star Trek EnterpriseJuly - Star Trek VoyagerAugust - Star Trek EnterpriseSeptember - Star Trek The Next Generation/NemesisOctober - Star Trek EnterpriseNovember - Star Trek The Next GenerationDecember - Star TrekHad I reviewed previous years &quot;Ships of the Line&quot; calendars all of them would've received a five star rating, had this one had just one image from Star Trek Deep Space Nine, it would've received a five star rating. Overall, this is another beautiful &quot;Ships of the Line&quot; calendar but it loses one star for the slight against Captain Sisko and crew! {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"Star Trek Ships Of The Line 2004 Wall Calendar","review":"This year's calendar has some truly nice artwork. Still, there are two important things that I must point out about it. I used the term artwork because some of the renderings look more like perfectly hand-drawn paintings instead of CGI. I can overlook this out of respect for creative license. However, The most annoying aspect about this calendar, is that it completely overlooked Deep Space Nine... Not one single picture was inspired from that show. That &quot;oversight&quot; is compounded by the overabundance of renderings dedicated to Enterprise (the series, not the ship). There are 5 pictures inspired from the show Enterprise. The rest of the shots are broken down like this: 3 Original Series Movie Era shots (counting the cover), with two additional shots of the Original Series 1701, two shots dedicated to Voyager, and one shot each dedicated to the Next Generation in both series &amp; movie incarnations. I strongly request that in future calendars, Deep Space Nine not be overlooked again, especially in favor of the clearly inferior series Enterpise."},{"Title":"Star Trek Ships Of The Line 2004 Wall Calendar","review":"In general I think this is the best calendar of this series since the initial outing. Many of the renderings are finished with filters that give them a slightly painterly look - a refreshing departure from the unnaturally crisp appearance of some raw CG work. For me the stand out piece was the &quot;Doomsday Machine&quot; rendering, giving us a unique and updated glimpse into a familiar TOS event. I hope to see more TOS work in future calendars, as this &quot;publication&quot; presents a perfect opportunity to revisit and refine the dated FX shots of the original Trek.I'd like to chime in with others in voicing disappointment that there was not at least one DS9-related image in the collection. In addition I'd like to express my disappointment in the fact that five of the thirteen images are from &quot;Enterprise&quot;. I understand that it's the current focus of the franchise, but it's a show I have zero interest in. With such a deep fictional history to draw from, I hope we can look forward to more varied subjects next year."},{"Title":"Star Trek Ships Of The Line 2004 Wall Calendar","review":"This is simply an awesome calendar...the best of the series since 2001. I liked the combo cgi/painted look of it and the land-scape format which gives us sort of a mini-poster in the true paranomic wideescreen format. I think there is no merit for people who are complaining about vertical full-screen version. I mean no one is going to buy a ships of the line calendar to write stuff; we are buying it for the most detailed art we can proudly display in our offices as long we can see the dates for the month. Most of the images in this calendar are epic in nature and the cgi/painted rendering helps them in my view. I agree...there is an over-emphasis on enterprise but I am not complaining as long as I get cool, sharp and epic images of the capital ships of the star trek line which vows my colleagues at work. But still some Ds9 images would only help(I think having 4 images of enterprise instead of 5 and devoting atleast 1 image to Ds9 could have pleased some people).Ignoring my star wars pun; Impressive....most impressive"},{"Title":"Star Trek Ships Of The Line 2004 Wall Calendar","review":"&quot;Ships of the Line&quot; offers some beautiful artwork.

I don't really care how many scenes are from &quot;Enterprise&quot; or the fact that there are no &quot;DS9&quot; images here. I'm just interested in the beauty of the artwork.I can see where hardcore fans of &quot;Star Trek&quot; may be offended by certain things in the calendar, but overall I have no complaints. Having the birthdays of the actors and actresses involved with the shows is a nice touch. I also love the panoramic view that each month is set in.This is some very nice work to me.

Anyway, this year's calendar has some impressive images as always, but they are nowhere near as &quot;realistic&quot; as in past versions. The most notable example of this is the March rendering of &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;. It looks more like a comic book illustration instead of the clean CGI work from the past.Still, this year's calendar is a wonderful series of images as always and would highly recommend it to any Trek fan. Disappointing to see no DS9 images and five &quot;Enterprise&quot; images from the worst of the series, but still worth the money."},{"Title":"Star Trek Ships Of The Line 2004 Wall Calendar","review":"No nitpicks here, but where is the associated book that was supposed to come out from this line?

Stephen King's main criticism of the book is that the main characters, Walter and Colquitt Kennedy, are unsympathetic as spoiled priggish good-looking rich people, and I agree with him about that. I also found the name \\"Colquitt\\" to be annoyingly distracting. None of the new people that Colquitt meets (and she meets several) ever ask her to repeat her name, or spell it out, or ask what the origins are. As though Colquitt were as common and ordinary as Heather or Julie. (I discovered that there is a Colquitt County in Georgia.)The story opens when Colquitt and Walter Kennedy find out that someone has bought the vacant lot next door and is going to build a house there. They're disappointed at first, but then they meet the architect and see the plans for the house, and the house is going to be so gorgeous, practically alive and growing up out of the ground, that they change their minds about it.The annoying young couple who are having the house built are Pie and Buddy Harralson, both from rich families, each with unhealthy attachments and conflicts with their respective parents-of-opposite-sex. Bad things start happening, and finally there's a housewarming party, and all hell breaks loose.Two other families live in the house over the next few months, and more bad things happen, and soon it becomes apparent that whatever malevolent force exists in the house is starting to affect the whole neighborhood.Anne Rivers Siddons, who usually writes long literary novels about rich, troubled Southerners, wrote this book because she thought it would be fun to write a haunted house story. And it is so scary because the thing that is the source of the terror is the house itself -- the home, that is supposed to be a haven, is actually a changing room for werewolves."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This book was the first I have ever read of Anne Rivers Siddons, and it got me into her other books as well! She did a fine job with her characters, and describing the events in the scenes, as though it were real, and not fiction. Every time some new neighbor had a party in the book, (throughout the story), I always wondered what was going to happen next knowing there was more horror on the way in some form or other. It is very hard to put this book down, and keeps you awake into the night!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This book is good in that I like stories about creepy goings-on that don't fit the definition of the typical \\"ghost\\" or \\"horror\\" story. This is a unique book in its subtle horror and uneasy feel. Someone already mentioned that the characters were \\"self important morons\\" which is true. I could not like any of them and it would have helped to have some sympathetic characters or at least not tell so much about them. I really don't want to know in-depth about the lives and doings of rich, snobbish people who I could not stand to deal with in real life and find it very hard to care about what happens to them or why.As a funny aside, the author seems to think that people in their mid-30s are unspeakably ancient! I know this was the late 70s and times have changed a lot since then, but the narrator and her husband are described as mid-30s and \\"middle-aged\\" and she keeps drawing attention to the fact that these folks are no longer young and are past their prime, contrasting them with \\"young\\" 20-something characters (BTW, a recent law grad would have to be at least 25, which is only 10 years younger than the \\"ancient\\" mid-30s!!). This was kind of funny and let me know I'm SO glad I wasn't around back then as life seemed much more stilted and inflexible!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Don't miss this book! Usually I do not like horror books because of the amount of gore, but this book shows how an author can create a truly disturbing atmosphere with very little blood and/or violence. The tension builds from the first page, as Walter and Colquitt confront the new house built next to theirs and the seemingly random series of very unsettling events associated with it. Ms. Siddons is known for her use of descriptive language and displays this talent admirably here. Each word seems to have been carefully chosen to evoke certain emotions in the reader. I felt drained and reflective for days after reading this. Again, don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Anne Rivers Siddons is best known for her semi-romantic \\"woman's\\" novels set among the genteel spaces of the scenic south. So it was a slight surprise that I discovered she had turned her hand at the haunted house genre. And what an excellent job she did, too! In fact, I would go so far as to put this in among the five or so scariest books I've ever read. It's up there in a league with Hill House and The Shining. The mere memory of this novel, which I initially read five years ago, is creeping me out tonight as I type this review. I'm not kidding.The House Next Door (doesn't the very name sound ominous?) takes the conventions of its venerable genre and casts them through the basement window. Forget a run-down old mansion, the house in the title is a brand new, lovely dwelling place constructed in suburban Atlanta in the booming 1970's. It sits among other equally gorgeous houses and on the surface seems a highly unlikely location for a tale as dark and eerie as this one becomes.I hate when a gloriously layered story is wrecked by a ham-handed reviewer, so I'll say very little else except that the nature of the \\"hauntings\\" in the house are not of the usual variety. Ghostly entities do not creep and moan among cobwebs and whisper in Victorian lace. No, Siddons masterfully spooks us with the very trappings of our modern existence. (Read this book and you'll know EXACTLY what I mean.) By the last thirty pages, I was totally stumped but very \\"into\\" what I was reading. When the cause behind so many vividly malignant effects is made clear to us in Siddons' fine twist ending, a literal, \\"Oh, my gosh...!\\" escaped my lips.Folks, I like this book as you can tell. I have nothing bad to say about it at all. If you want my advice, forego the slasher novellas and tired clich&eacute;s of the horror aisle and pick this overlooked gem up next time you want to be thoroughly creeped out!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It did get slow in some places but nearly each chapter ended with a bang and the ending was superb! It was scary without being really gory in a Stephen King kind of way. The way of getting inside the narrators head was so well written that by halfway through the story you were convinced the house was evil. It was great. I'd definently recommend you pick up this book."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This is certainly not your average haunted house book. There are no nasty shock tactics, no gruesome depictions of gore, and no hideous monsters waiting in dark corners. There is just a magnificent modern and newly built house, which in its own quiet way wreaks havoc on the lives of its unfortunate 3 successive owners, and in turn, the peaceful and prosperous neighbourhood in which it is built.What is clever in this novel is the introduction of things that are happening in our society, including some quite horrific things, which are frequently and quietly ignored if not accepted. This forms an eerie basis for the things that are to come. The unnatural closeness of a father and his daughter; the spectre of the loss of a child and the resultant mental illness; the suggestion of domestic violence. The author weaves these themes cleverly into the occupants of the house next door, and you just know that some further bad things are going to happen.At its best level this book is a psychological chiller. The families involved clearly have issues and unfortunate lives - are the things that happen to them simply further misfortunes? Are the caring neighbours who begin to recognise the growing menace that the house next door represents themselves slipping into paranoia and their own mental illness? It is a very clever book - very clever indeed.This is a book that will stay with you for a long time. I find myself considering its themes of quiet madness in leafy suburbia, intertwined with the great gothic themes of a haunted house, and I think that it is one of the best books I have read in ages, and one that I recommend highly."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Siddons is a master story teller. She creates a world for her characters and you are there. Feeling their feelings, seeing what they see. In this novel it is a world that prompts late-night page turning and rapid pulse. Some have found the end of this book frustrating and/or lacking in creativity. What Siddons has done is let the reader imagine what happend to her central characters. One must have a better-than-average imagination to go along with the novel's premise in the first place, so why should we resent having to invent a fate for this determined couple. Has televsion spoiled us to the point that we want all our mysteries handily solved only to be quickly forgotten? I will not soon forget this couple or stop wondering anytime in the near future about their demise. Or perhaps they survived whatever the monster house threw at them and are happily living on their island."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This is a scarey book. I envy those who will be reading it for the first time. It is very different, and as another reviewer observed, the reader has to decide whether to view the evil as supernatural or spiritual (kind of like The Shining). The reason I suspect the nasty things that take place in this book come from the souls of the people in the neighborhood is that they are all SO shallow, smug, judgmental, and annoying. Either Anne River Siddons creates characters who are not likable as a spiritual lesson, or she has never met any likable people. I have read all of her books and find her characters universally creepy and phoney."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"When you read about a haunted house it's very different from your horror stories, being possessed, a psychological thriller or witchcraft. It's very unique in the aspect of a house that has a spirit of it's own and the ability to control lives. From the beginning I identified with Colquitt and Walter Kennedy in their loving comfortable lifestyle in a home they adored next door to a vacant lot that was beautiful and peaceful, so much a part of their eveyday life. Soon to be altered and redesigned to include a home, mystical in it's own way, by a novice architect, Kim. Colquitt and Walter witness 3 familys buying this house and the tragedies that transpire almost immediately. Trying to hold on to their own relationship and sanity together while defying and defeating the spell of this house is spellbounding. Witnessing the brutual influence this house has over the owners, the architect and neighbors brings shocking awarness to readers."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I first picked up this book in 1983. Twenty-five years later, I can tell you that this book is one of my favorite horror stories.Anne Rivers Siddon lulls you into a false security, using home and hearth- a false normalcy - and then smacks you with such supreme horror it rocks you. Her secret,I have noticed, is to allow you to believe that honor, faith in love, and hope in friendships will conquer all. Then she takes a small thread with a pointy fingernail and unravels it with absolute glee!I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a great summer read! (Just make sure the house next door isn't under construction.)"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I read this long ago when I was beginning to read Anne Rivers Siddon's novels. She writes lady novels about women who grow up in the changes of the New South, and who adapting to their own changes. I love her novels. This one is kind of the flipside of her usual novels, which are strictly personal struggles.This one is about a struggle that takes place outside of the normal, physical struggle. This is a struggle with a subtle, unseen force of darkness.What makes this novel work so well, I think, is that it takes place in a well-to-do Atlanta suburb, not the hills, where people lead comfortable lives lived on the surface. There isn't much here but surface. They have work they enjoy, beautiful houses, friends they like, good food, good drinks, and enough money to make things comfortable, without the problems that great wealth brings. Walter and Colquitt are good-looking people in a set of people who aren't necessarily beautiful, so they're kind of the stars of the show. One of Colquitt's neighbors thinks she's beautiful, and he calls her the Lady of Shalott, only he pronounces it, as Walter recounts wryly, \\"like the onion.\\"Walter and Colquitt live next to a piece of land that seems magical and enchanted. It's forested, so Colquitt can indulge her taste for slim to no attire while in her office that overlooks it. She has her own one-woman ad company, knocks out her campaigns and then makes martinis for Hubby when he comes home.She notices that small animals who venture onto that property end up looking like bloody rags lying dead on its edge. Her cats won't go near it. She mentally waves away this thinking because sophisticated career women of the New South don't think like this.Enter Kim. He's handsome. He's talented. He's an orphan. He has angst. He was adopted by a wealthy family (a seriously rich clan) and he is burning to build The House. He's Roark, but better looking, with charm.Naturally Colquitt falls for him. Walter likes him. Everyone in the neighborhood accepts him.He begins to build a house on this property for an insufferable pair of newlyweds expecting a baby. They are fresh out of college. They are almost willfully ignorant. The girl is pretty. The boy, Buddy, is a non-entity, hence his name; he is a everyone's buddy, but has a forgettable face and personality. The girl's nickname is Pie, from Punkin Pie, her father's name for her. Pie and Daddy have an Electra-complex relationship. Her father is a self-made millionaire with what's described as a \\"wire-grass\\" accent. Think of a chainsaw gifted with the power of speech. This is the wiregrass accent. You know something terrible is going to happen as soon as Mrs. Siddons sets up this bunch of New South horrors.The house takes from everyone who moves in whatever is most important to them, which in this case is Pie's baby and her father. I don't want to give away the plot too much save to tell you that it gets subtly more and more frightening. Pie is an unlikeable person. You can take a mean-spirited sort of joy in her miscarriage, but Pie's tragedy just makes what comes next worse. Pie and Buddy lose an aging parent, a fetus and social standing; the loss of a parent and a wished-for baby are bad enough, but wait'll you read how the house makes them lose their social standing. The people who move after Pie and Buddy lose more; each time someone moves in, the horror of the losses escalates.Walter and Colquitt watch this slow train wreck escalate to the point where they have to do something, which they do at the end because they've decided that they can't let the horrors continue. They are also afraid that the property's evil influence will spread. They suspect that Kim is a carrier of evil. They realize that if they don't handle the problem nobody else will.You have to read it to find out."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"What made this book different from other \\"horror\\" books is that the house doesn't need ghosts or zombies or other traditional horror fare to wreak destruction. It destroys its occupants with their own weaknesses, secrets, tragedies and failings. Home -- a place where we should feel safe -- is the very enemy.In the end, I wondered what it used to get Colquitt and Walter. Is it that they gave in to the madness of the house and committed murder themselves? Did it kill them, or did it let them live to be destroyed in other ways? And their efforts were for naught because the house plans survived and, as long as people have human frailties and faults, it will continue to destroy."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I enjoyed the creepiness of this novel and the social commentary underneath it: the idea that nothing bad should happen in upper middle class suburbia and that if it does, the well to do just MIGHT have to stand up for their principles for once. Anne Rivers Siddons makes these thematic points in the novel.I found one of the best things about the book is that I was wondering what would happen to MY family if we moved into the house next door. Every family has problems, secrets, and struggles. The impending horrors of everyday life is the best horror, in my opinion. The premise is a fascinating and truly scary one. I wish Rivers Siddons had written more novels like this one! I like her others, but I enjoyed this different type of book from her."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I enjoyed this novel, and disagree with the reviewer who stated that it isn't spooky or scary and doesn't deliver at the end. I actual continue to see the last scene in my mind, over and over. That is the mark of a good ending.Are there problems with the book? Yes. Some of the situations seem dated, and maybe not as shocking to me if I had read it in high school. BUT, the way she used the frame of the book to tell three separate stories which do tie together at the end was very good and allowed for a different kind of character development. We see the main characters change as they see events next door.I read this book right after Shirley Jackson's masterpiece of haunted house books, The Haunting of Hill House. While Jackson's book is better, I think Siddons holds up well in comparison. I especially liked the idea of a MODERN haunted house. Nice touch.All and all a good, if not difficult, read."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This may not be the most conventional horror story ever written, but I have to say it gave me the shivers in ways most horror stories don't. There's something silently insidious about how the house managed to ruin so many lives...granted, it's not very realistic, but who wants realism in a story about something so supernaturally horrific?The fact that Colquitt and Walter led such normal (if charmed) lives and something like that house could so completely destroy them is horrible enough, but the things that happened to the people who lived in it took me over the edge...and the end result of what happened to the Kennedys and what they had to resort to was, in my mind, the most cruel trick of all.This is one of those great books best read at night, or during a storm with a blanket pulled safely around you, a warm critter at your feet, and plenty of time. I loved it."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This book is an anomaly- a genre piece by an author previously and subsequently associated with the literary novel .It is a haunted house story ,the first major such work since Shirley Jackson had penned \\" The Haunting of Hill House\\" some 20 years previouslyWhat makes it a unique novel is that it breaks genre rules .It is not the traditional old dark house that is infested but a new one .It is narrated by Colquit Kennedy .She is married and contented ,albeit childless ..She is drawn to and at the same time slightly uneasy about a young architect who designs a new home on a long vacant lot next to her home .From day one the new house seems cursed .The family that moves in is wracked by misfortune and eventually torn irrevocably apart when sexual secrets come to the surface .A second family move and they too are destroyed psychologically .Yet another family tries living in the house and the outcome is fatal thjis time .Has the architect somehow designed evil into the very fabric of the house ? Colquitt is reluctant to acceot the notion being an ordered and rational person but eventually she is driven to confront the house and the evil etched into its very walls .This is a superbly ambiguous novel .Colquitt firmly believes the house is demonic -other readers may conclude the house is simply the scapegoat and the real evil comes wrapped in the desires and actions of its residents and neighbours .Is the evil in the house or in us ,in our fragile and surface value systems ? Ms Siddons lets us make up our own mindColquitt is not an especially likeable person -she is emotionally detached ,a little vain and self absorbed ,and the changes she faces during the novel are profound .Nothing in the book is quite what it seems .The book came to my notice when Stephen King wrote about it in his collection Dance Macabre ,and in the essay covering this novel he pointed out the novel may well resonate more with women -to a woman says King her home is her world to a greater extent than with men .Such a view seems to ignore trends of the past 20 plus years and I maintain that this tale of evil at work in the nuclear family will chill most readers .Do not expect a gross-out however -this is cool,elegant and distant in its style .A minor modern classic in the horror vein .Please give it a go"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This is a wonderful novel. I read it after reading Outer Banks so I knew I was in for some kind of treat. I had no idea this book would be as wonderful as it was. Full of suspense to the very, very end. This is great summer reading, folks, I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"If you love Anne Rivers Siddons books as much as I do, you will easily slip into this eerie story. Some strange goings on will capture your interest right away and you may be up all night reading chapter after chapter, eager to see what peculiar development will happen next. There are many instances that will totally take you by surprise and you may even find yourself gasping. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"If you don't already know, Anne Rivers Siddons has made a name for herself as a writer of Southern novels, generally for women. That's what makes it so surprising that she writes a horror novel that actually works. I don't know that I'd call her the female Stephen King. All I know is that I've read a lot of horror and this book kept me glued to the very end. Somehow Siddons learned what is truly scary without staging a stupid blood bath. She learned how to make the protagonist very likable and the \\"villain\\" very scary. She learned how to gradually ratchet up the horror in small doses to reach a fever pitch. She learned to hide the evil instead of having it show its ugly face in clear view. Don't mind that this is Siddon's only horror. I really think you'll like the book."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I read this book when it first came out many years ago, and I still think of it often. There is not too much I can say about what makes this a true masterpiece for lovers of the horror genre without giving too much away. Suffice it to say that ultimately it is you, the reader, who becomes a victim of that \\"House Next Door\\"."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Anne Rivers Siddons' novels can be a slow read, the prose is so lush and detailed. Never-the-less, this book is intense. I would put it down to do some work and find myself pulled back to read more."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"The story is original and unlike any other \\"haunted house\\" story.

It's not so much that the house is haunted as it is simply... wrong. The house itself is bad, bad, bad. This book haunts me still. Just read it and see."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This is not your typical haunted house story, because it focuses on the house's architect and the unfortunate inhabitants in terms of their character flaws. The reader is drawn to the woman telling the story, her husband, their struggles with growing awareness of the evil associated with the house next door, and the price they ultimately pay. I love Anne Rivers Siddons books and have read most of them. This ranks second, only to Off Season, in my book."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Anne Rivers Siddons' \\"The House Next Door\\" is a Masterpiece of Contemporary Horror fiction and doesn't let the reader down. I teach a college class on Gothic Fiction and last semester we studied this as well as \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" and Shirley Jackson's short story, \\"The Lovely House\\". Great examples of how 20th Century writers were able to take all of the themes and aethetics of the Gothic and set them in everyday settings. After all, what is more horrifying than terror in the evryday things that we take for granted, like upscale neighboorhoods and your Manhattan apartment building? I would suggest \\"The House Next Door\\" to anyone who likes haunted house stories with a southern gothic twist. I only wish Siddons would revisit this genre!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This is my third book by this author and I am looking forward to reading my fourth. Her narrative is fascinating, and she captures the female human condition in a unique and stimulating style."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Stephen King recommened this book on a list of ten books that taught him all he knows about writing horror fiction. You can see his attraction to this book for it creates a detailed, realistic world of affluence and harmony that slowly spins out of control due to the influence of the haunted house next door. Siddons creates a narrative voice that is subtle, compassionate, and intelligent. Nothing seems forced. Nothing seems contrived(except for the brief epilogue). I support King'srecommendation for this haunting novel."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This book is an odd mix of novel and horror story. Picture an idyllic street with upper class residents whose biggest problem is a neighbor who seems to breed annoying children yearly. Suddenly, a vacant lot, seemingly too small and oddly shaped to build on, is sold and a house goes up. Once in progress, bad luck begins to befall the builders and their architect. At the housewarming party, a shocking event leads to tragedy, causing the owners to move and sell the home. Fast forward through two more similar, yet still interesting, scenarios and towards an ending that is a bit less than satisfying and you've got &quot;The House Next Door.&quot;The strength of this book lies in the fact that the story keeps your attention long enough to get you from one shocking revelation to the next. The weaknesses (note the plural) don't ruin the book, but do make it less enjoyable than it might be otherwise.First, the writing is adjective and metaphor rich, often to the detriment of the storyline. I'd occasionally find myself needing to re-read a sentence or paragraph in order to wade through the language to get to the actual point.Second, the characters are a little &quot;too&quot; highbrow to be sympathetic. They belong to the ballet guild and the Junior League, lunch at the club, and describe friends and colleagues as being from &quot;substantial&quot; families. Their biggest problem seems to be having one martini too many at the semi-formal neighborhood party to make tomorrow's 8:00am tennis date. At times, I found myself wishing something terrible would befall them just to bring them down a notch.As for the ending, it left me wanting. It wrapped up the bigger story, but left some of the lesser details without resolution. I actually flipped the last page back and forth a couple of times to make sure I didn't miss something!All in all, I'm glad I read the book. It was enjoyable, different, and surprising at times. I recommend it to anyone wanting a casual, not-too-involved read."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"...but I had to physically get rid of the book after I read it. It was as if the book had the same effect on my life as it did on the lives of the characters in it. That's all I will say. I don't want to give too much power to words on paper that were written as fiction, but I felt a sense of relief once I had put the book physically out of my living space, as if it no longer had the power to use the evil that is described in it to influence my life.Sorry, Ms. Siddons, I can't help feeling that I never should have read that book, well written as it was. I have read other works by you and enjoyed them, but this one contained real and unspeakable horror and evil. That may be one of the reasons Stephen King ranked it as highly as he did. I won't be able to forget it for a long time, if ever, as it has haunted me ever since I finished it - I couldn't wait to see how it turned out, and when I did, I deeply regretted reading the ending. Probably the way Col felt when she finally looked into the windows during the second section of the book. The ending is as shattering as that of William Bayer's masterpiece, Peregrine, although it's a different sort of book.Many will not be touched by this book in the same way I was, but as Col said to prospective buyers of that evil house, beware..."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"It's hard to believe that this tale of a house gone bad was written over 25 years ago. The atmosphere created around an upscale neighborhood of BMW's and martini drinkers felt remarkably current and not at all dated. In fact our society is likely even more enamored today with the trappings of the wealthy than when this novel was first written. This creepy story focuses on a new house built in an established well-to-do neighborhood. Although the reasons are inexplicable, the house itself is hell bent on wrecking havoc on the individuals who reside within it's walls. There are no ghosts here, just a malevolent force bent on destruction.Told from the perspective of the couple who live next door, this novel provides a different take on the traditional haunted house genre; that of the observer not the resident. My only minor criticism of this story was that the ending felt somewhat rushed given the build up. Still, a worthy book if your looking for a late night read."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"If you are an Anne Rivers Siddons fan, you will recognize the type of characters in this novel. It is a world which goes horribly awry. There is real horror here, not the shock and gore usually presented as a horror tale. A deliciouslydisturbing read!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I bought this book way back in 1978 when it first came out and have had it in my library ever since. It would get a five star rating but for one thing -- some of the dialogue is wildly unbelievable. However, the writing itself is first rate and the main characters - because they are nice, good-looking but actually nothing special people - are used to great advantage. We see all that is happening through the eyes of normal, if moderately wealthy, couple who initially try to make sense out of what is starting to happen in their yuppie (before the term \\"yuppie\\" was known) neighborhood -- then are figuratively swallowed by something even the reader can't really understand. After all, the house isn't really haunted; it's brand new!! Oh, but YES there is something there -- where did it come from? The architect?? But Kim seems like such a nice chap ...Col and Walter are unable to accept some of the things they are seeing (possibly thinking of lowered property values?) and one tends to wonder - because they are so close to the house - if they are indirectly being influenced as well. The ending, written subtly without a pretentious explosion or blood pouring down the walls - always makes me shiver a bit.Every couple of years, usually around Halloween, I'll bring this book out and read it. It's an amazingly fresh read each time I pick it up. Something new is always found.Note to producers who may want to turn this into a movie (it hasn't been made into a movie yet has it?): I suggest the casting [for a TV movie] - Rachel Blakely as Colquitt, Will Snow at Walt (both from THE LOST WORLD - ages are right and their chemistry is awesome) and (don't laugh) someone like Johnny Depp for Kim Dougherty, the man who built THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"The House Next Door will draw in even the skeptic reader with Anne'sgifted intelligence with words. Anne Rivers Siddons has the abilityto bring out the longing to visit the south. In all the Siddons novelsa new understanding of &quot;old money&quot; is gained, along with the lack ofglamour every person has.This spellbinding book is written with excitement and imagination.Siddons' novels should be a staple in every personal library!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Colquitt Kennedy is just the kind of neighbor you'd like to have; she's kind, thoughtful, and absolutely normal. She's the sort who would bring you chicken soup if you were sick or meet your kids at the bus if you were running late. In fact, the whole neighborhood seems to be made of up of that kind of people. Solid, salt-of-the-earth types who have known each other for years, seen each others' children grow, shared holidays, and so on.So when Colquitt begins to think there's something strange and sinister about the house next door, it's a wonder more people don't believe her.Everyone in this book is so realistically written (from Colquitt and Walter to their old friends and new neighbors) that when the weird stuff starts happening, you get sucked right in.I've been home for a week with an injury, so I've been catching up on a LOT of reading, and I've read some things I really enjoyed, but this one was so hard to put down that I read it well into the night and finished it first thing when I woke up. When it was over, I was sad to say goodbye, despite the stunning, upside-down ending. I don't know what to pick up next because I'm still so entrenched in Colquitt's world.This is my first Anne Rivers Siddons book, and from what I understand it's the only one she's written with paranormal elements, but I will be looking forward to reading more of her books in the future."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I didn't have high expectations for this book so the starting point at the inception was quite low. It certainly was no Stephen King horror story but I found it to be interesting and compelling. The premise of the book is a family who are living securely in a neighborhood with an idyllic setting, when a house is built beside of them and their secure little world becomes rattled. With this house come a number of inhabitants who all undergo tragedies. At first the neighbor chalks it up to a coincidence but then it happens each and every time a new family moves in and each time it is decidly worse. It was creepy for sure and I agree with the other reviewer who said it was unbelievable, but at the same time most horror/scary things are unbelievable. All and all it was a good read and I'm glad I happened upon the book."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I really did not see the twist coming to this story and it really is a twist. It very much has a gotcha that I never saw coming.This is set in the 70's so it is dated and if you don't like to read about that period then this book may not be for you. However, it is a first rate haunted house story and I believe that it also is about the satanical.I also was left wondering if the house was really haunted or was this about a descent into madness as well. I think it is all of the above.There are times when this story seems to be a bit overwrought and prone to the dramatical but when I finished the book I felt that all the drama was necessary to the events that happened.Read it if you have not ever thought of reading an Anne Rivers Siddons' book; you will be surprised!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I have read every one of Siddons previous books and loved them all. I am always awaiting the next one. So when The House Next Door became available, I scooped it up. Much to my chagrin, it was a horrible, unbelievable book. I hope that she goes back to her normal genre."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"an unspeakably tedious tale about smug,self-absorbed and self-important morons,apparently written by someone who fits the same description. this book was so bad it almost turned me off altogether from the habit of reading. I would rather sit through I Still Know What You Did Last Summer twice than even remember the tepid traumas trifling through this tripe (and,yes, I know I'm underestimating one of the worst films of all time). the most disturbing thing about this book was the discovery that I lived in a world stranger than I'd ever imagined,one where emesis-inducers like this can be published and praised. I may have to reconsider my opinion of apocalyptic millenialism."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I just read this book, which took me back to the culture of the 70's. It was engrosing - but some characters were hard to believe. I burst out laughing at the scene in the bedroom at the first party, where handbags and coats were stashed on a bed. A compromising affair when anyone could walk in at any time???This book describes a very insular world - a world I once lived in. Does it still exist? I do not long to go back."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Ms. Siddons' book reads like a pre-quel to Bentley Little's \\"The Association.\\" It contains the same basic element; a middle-class, middle-aged, childless couple has their perfect world shaken up by strange goings-on in their swanky neighborhood. But unlike Little's couple, I have to give this couple credit for at least attempting to help the poor schulbs next door before everything goes terribly wrong.\\"The House Next Door\\" starts off with typical horror genre elements; as the new house goes up animals are mysteriously killed and mutilated. But after that the book branches off into daytime television shenanigans; we've got cheating spouses, abused housewives, people who are driven insane, not to mention disastrous housewarming parties. These are the events that occur after each family moves in, 3 in all. Suddenly the \\"horror\\" becomes something vague and esoteric. To my chagrin, just when the couple puts down the chardonnay bottle and decide to take some drastic action, the novel ends! Personally, I believe the writer dealt too much with the dull day to day activities of this bourgeois couple and not enough on The House Next Door."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I was pretty unimpressed from page one, frankly, but after a bit I noticed that the characters used the word \\"fool\\" or some derivation thereof wayyyy too often - 13 times according to my ipad word count (yes, I became obssessed enough with this to do a word count). I began to imagine that the book itself was possessed and was mocking me as a \\"fool\\" for paying for it! Oh, the shudders I endured!Another source of the icks came, not from the plot or depicted events, but from the characters, especially Colquitt. How sweet is it that she belongs to a \\"set\\"? Not to mention the local country club and all that THAT entails.The others were pretty bad, too, including all of the supposed victims of the house. They were all so fundamentally flawed that the so-called tragedies that befell them seemed to me to be foregone conclusions.It perhaps would have been better if the house's stated evil power was to lure in damaged people. But of course, how bad could these people be since they could afford the house in the first place? After all, they all came from such \\"substantial\\" families and whatnot. Whatever!If the author's intent was for readers to have no sympathy for her characters, then she has succeeded admirably. Otherwise, there is little here to recommend. It certainly wasn't scary, and it's a laughable example of social satire, at best. And really, she should lay off on using \\"fool\\" so much!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I went on a search for haunted house novels and the title for \\"House Next Door\\" popped up and after reading some 5 star reviews I thought I'd give it a go. One of them mentioned never sleeping at night, but I have to disagree. This book kept putting me to sleep.If I had to quickly sum it up, I'd say it was about a neighborhood of the rich who had their martini drinking lives turned upside down because \\"bad\\" things started to happen. (In fairness, #3 was pretty awful.)I'm sure it could have real promise, but I honestly just wanted to get this book done and over with. I felt the ending didn't follow through well enough. (I wish the thing with Kim would have been explained more.)Sadly, I'd never recommend this book for any of my horror/haunted house loving friends. Not that it makes a bad story, but it's not exactly one for the genre."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"the ending was very disapointing and at times Colquitt was annoying. Why did she ruin a deep friendship by not telling Claire about the reason Virginia left? Why not just say what happened, I do not understand her need to hide that. But anyway, you will have to read the book to see what I am talking about."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"A haunted house novel would never be something I'd ordinarily choose, and I picked this one up purely because I was familiar with the author's other books and decided to give it a chance.And guess what??? I absolutely loved it - an entracing page-turner. It was more about community and neighborhood friendships than spooky, and I wish I lived on the same street with these wonderfully developed characters, especially Colquitt.My only criticism was that the ending was a bit rushed and vague considering all the vivid details that bought the reader to that point. After immersing myself in this novel and almost becoming a part of this neighborhood myself, it would have been nice to have the loose ends tied up more concretely."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Long before I ever read this book all I ever heard were gushing great reviews and opinions of it,it seems everyone who has read it just loves it;when I finally got around to reading it recently I was left feeling like I had a big question mark over my head.Am I missing something here?I'm surprised I could stay awake long enough to finish it.What's the storyline anyway?No explanation,not even any guesses at anything supernatural,no assumptions of a \\"cursed\\" land or ancient burial ground or former site of Satan worshippers,no plot at all.How can anyone think this is scary/horror?Just a bunch of boring suburbanite professionals,some dumb southern stereotypes,people falling down stairs and miscarrying and animals being mutilated and housewives having breakdowns and cheating on their spouses and having dinner party after dinner party...um,it NEVER even hints at WHY all this is happening,no history of the land is ever told or even speculated about.If it's supposed to be a metaphor for secluded suburbanites' fears of everything outside their cloistered little worlds,well okay,why not just classify it as psychological drama?Because this certainly doesn't belong in the horror genre."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I have read most all of her books, and all have been informative, interesting, taking me to places in my heart I usually just ignore.

What an intense author... her books grab you and hold you until the very last page. The reader enters Siddons' captiviating worlds, and you don't want to leave. I am now starting my third Siddons' book. I don't think you can go wrong with one of her novels.

Takes place in the south, as many of Anne Rivers Siddons' books do, in an affluent neighborhood in an unnamed city. The story centers around a wealthy, thirty-something couple, who live next door to an empty lot. The lot soon sells, and a newlywed couple hire an architect to build a house for them. The house is modern, amazing, and captures the imagination of the entire neighborhood. What no one knows, however, is just what the house has in store for this neighborhood. Not a story to read before bedtime, it will send you down twists and turns, never quite revealing exactly what is happening, and who is really under the house's spell."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Don't listen to what anyone says berating the novel's ending, first of all! After reading the last few pages, i almost felt emptied after the emotions ran through--a hanging ending is always preferable to those that have imagination. It will chill your blood! The book as a whole, too, is an excellent horror novel, and an even better interplay between characters (although, as even Stephen King points out, they are characters many may have problems with connecting to completely because of their rather different culture)."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I've read this book so many times that my copy is falling apart. I enjoyed getting to know the well-drawn characters -- the way they meshed and interacted was fascinating to me. The author got the job done without gross ugliness and shock. Proves that a house doesn't have to be old and full of bats and cobwebs to be scary. I even liked that the ending was not the usual burning down of the house, or ritual to appease the spirits, or wholesale massacre of all the remaining characters except for one gibbering madman."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Fabulous haunted house novel. A self-absorbed couple slowly comes to realize all those neighbors who keep coming and going may not be to blame for their singular misfortunes. Siddons plays with a few obvious conventions (the house is spanking new, for instance) but the real coup here is that she plays with structure and narration in ways few straight horror writers would bother to try. The woes of the house next door's victims are strictly modern, common - and yet ultimately cannot be explained away by the book's heroes, who finally emerge from their isolated, upper middle-class paradise with an act of tragic heroism. Some of the dialogue gets a little precious at times, but this is a real acheivement from an author who obviously didn't need to bother with this genre"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I read this book last summer and I still think of it every now and then. It was so well written, engrossing, mesmorizing. I could not put it down. It would make a fantastic movie. I love the way Anne Rivers Siddons writes; although this book is somewhat different than her others. This is more of a horror book with beautiful writing. Just writing this review, I want to read it again"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Funnily enough, I read this novel in the same week I also read two other haunted house tales - Richard Matheson's \\"Hell House\\" and Shirley Jackson's \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\". Siddons's novel is not as good as either of those two but it is unusual and intriguing, nonetheless. Not a typical haunted house story in that the main characters don't live in the house, and the house itself is new, not old, the novel is surprisingly fast-paced and suspenseful, but it is flawed and marred by unlikeable characters, dated social references (upper class Americana in the 1970's), and adjective-heavy belabored prose. The main characters are affluent and thoroughly unsympathetic. This is part of Siddon's point. These characters are sheltered by their rich, privileged lives, which is why the increasingly strange and disturbing events begin to eat away at their previously problem-free existence. Told in a frame style, its a shame the novel, which really picks up in the last fifty pages, ends abruptly on a twist. Despite its flaws, I recommend this blend of dark soap opera, biting social satire, and murderous mania. 3.5/5"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This novel is a compelling page-turner from start to finish. Whenever I read it, I had a hard time putting it down. The characters are vivid, and after only a few pages, I already felt like I knew them. This book is very different from Anne Rivers Siddons' other books as it reads more like a mystery novel. Siddons establishes a dark, eerie mood without compromising a fast-paced, intriguing plot."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I have to be honest...I never even imagined myself reading an Anne Rivers Siddons book. Never. And that's not to say that I don't think she's a great writer; I just tend to stick with horror or at least with stories that have a darker side. I picked this one up on the recommendation of several fellow horror fans with this thought: &quot;yeah, right, this will be a waste of my time.&quot; I suppose if I were truly capable of eating my words, I'd be reaching for a fork.This novel introduces us to quite a different time in America. It's the 70's, and it's the South, AND the story is set in an upper-class neighborhood where everyone follows an unwritten code of social conduct. Colquitt and Walter Kennedy (never in my life have I met someone named Colquitt) live a quiet, genteel life. Purposefully childless, they enjoy life's luxuries and spend their time hob-nobbing with their equally successful neighbors. Again, this is the 70's--these characters smoke a lot, eat a lot and drink even more; even the most minor of social get togethers is accompanied by a pitcher of martinis, and everyone seems to have the time (and money) to battle hangovers and to throw lavish parties. The Kennedys love their home overlooking a lovely, peaceful empty lot. But then the lot is sold, and a young, spoiled couple build their dream home utilizing the talents of the brilliant up-and-coming architect, Kim Dougherty. The Kennedys befriend Kim and then watch as terror after terror occurs in the beautiful new home. Tenants come and go, and the Kennedys have to choose between their social standing and their perceived duty to stop the suffering by speaking out about the horrible house.The writing here is wonderful. I could close my eyes and picture every scene. The horror is so subtle that I was surprised to find myself looking over my shoulder throughout this reading. I enjoyed this book, and I've gone on to recommend it to several people. Contrary to some, I liked the ending (and I'll say no more about it). This is one of the best haunted house novels I've ever read, and I plan on holding on to my tattered paperback copy. I never thought I would add a Siddons novel to my horror collection, and I am so happy that I was 100% wrong!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This book is so different from the usual haunted house fare. There really isn't much that serves as a tangible reason for the house being so evil, it just apparently is. And it's a vicious house for certain, preying on psychological fear rather than manifesting itself as a poltergiest or apparition. Things just &quot;happen&quot; in or around the house, disturbing things. Lives are ruined and that is the only motiff that emerges. It's not a singular entity with just murder in mind. It wants to cause pain to its victims on an inner level and that is extremely frightening in concept. The novel is like a constant mind rape of the characters involved and it is so very delicious in its malice. One of the top 10 horror novels I have ever read and way more intense than Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House or Richard Matheson's Hell House. A must read for any fan of the horror genre or any new home owner."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This a wonderful &quot;house gone bad,&quot; haunted house story.

I was 16 or so, with a summer babysitting job, and picked it up one afternoon at my employer's house while the children were out playing. It was a hot July afternoon, kids playing in the yard in front of me, and I was as frightened reading this book as I have been by any book or movie since then. 28 years later, it is still at the top of the list of \\"the scariest books I've read.\\" and that includes every one of Stephen King's books. (which make up the rest of my list, I think!)Many of the other reviewers have given the plot of the book, so I won't do that, but it is set in an ordinary (if tony) neighborhood, like many in my present city, and countless others. The neighbors are like anyone's neighbors, some you could easily be friends with, some you could barely tolerate. And that is what makes this book so riveting and so frightening, everyone and everything is so ordinary and so easy to identify with, and yet evil permeates it all. At least one reviewer made the excellent suggestion that the house was just the place where the darkest impulses of its residents' lives manifested itself, and the house and its designer were just scapegoats. This could be true, or it could also be true that lurking in the architect's unknown DNA was an unspeakable malevolence that spilled over into the lives of those he touched. Either answer is pretty frightening, in my opinion. If you're looking for a page turner that will haunt you after you read the last page, I recommend this book. I wish Siddons had written others like this, after this book I have tried to read her many other books, and haven't been able to warm to any of them. She has proven to me she's an excellent writer, I guess I just don't have a taste for her other writings. On the other hand, my mother loves her other books and was horrified and offended by \\"The House Next Door.\\" (but she can write her own review!) This has endured in my mind as a terrifying read."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"In this story houses don't have to have previous owners to be haunted. Anne Rivers Siddons suggests, like Shirley Jackson, that some houses are intrinsically evil and able to prey upon the weaknesses of unsuspecting humans. No motive is necessary, only the opportunity.The story is a little dated in its setting (Atlanta in the last third of the 20th Century) but story of the house along with the author's discussion of the worth of a small, graceful life, merits reading. The story is well-paced and the suspense tightens inexorably. This is not a story of gore but treachery, human weakness and how difficult bravery can be."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I would never have picked up The House Next Door because I do not read books about the supernatural but when I heard of few remarks about how good the story was I figured I would take a chance.The title pretty well explains what the story is about ... The House Next Door. Walter and Colquitt lived a pretty quiet life. They had good jobs, a nice house, and friends. That all changed one day when the empty lot next to their house was sold and a young couple was going to move in right after the new house was built. Right from the start strange unexplained things were happening and Colquitt and Walter start to believe that the house is \\"haunted\\". Of course, all their friends thought they were crazy and they were suddenly the outcast of the neighborhood. The House Next Door is a page turner with just the right amount of suspense so you wont get too freaked out."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Stephen King devotes a significant number of pages to Anne Rivers Siddon's The House Next Door in Danse Macabre, his remarkable study of all things horror. Without King's reference, I would probably have never crossed paths with this novel. Siddons is not a horror writer, yet in this, her second published novel, she has produced a rather remarkable work of psychological horror, tilling the same fertile fields of Southern Gothicism that a William Faulkner might have worked in decades earlier. The Atlanta suburb of Siddons' creation is a social microcosm of the South in juxtaposition between the old and the new, a place where one's identity is determined by one's position and set of friends, and it is the effects of the house next door on this tight-knit, structured community that really serve as the focus of Siddons' attention. As such, the \\"haunting\\" is never really creepy and is certainly not frightening in the least, especially given the fact that we see the effects of the horror through the eyes of our protagonist and her husband, relying on their reports of sights and sounds we really never get to witness firsthand. There is no ghost in the normal sense here, no discernible force that seems to lie behind the horror of events. Siddons' grounding of her tale in reality and in a community her readers can visualize and relate to in a tangible way is absolutely necessary in order for this novel to work. As Siddons has said in reference to The House Next Door, \\"Without belief, there is no terror.\\"Some readers have had trouble fully connecting with the narrator of events, Colquitt Kennedy, and her husband Walter, but I really do not. Colquitt can sometimes become a little tiring in terms of her laments of mounting pain and sorrow, but she does not come across to me as a person who puts her social or mildly affluent social position ahead of her humanity. After all, the Kennedys make some entirely self-less decisions when it comes to warning future homeowners of the danger lurking in the walls of the beautiful house next door. The house is unique and brand new, a brilliantly designed structure erected on a site local architects claimed could never support a house. The very antithesis of the traditional haunted Southern manor or plantation house, the house uses its loveliness to entice families inside its seemingly normal walls, somehow isolating each family member's greatest weaknesses and vulnerabilities and playing upon those to enact the destruction it thrives on. The brilliant young architect becomes an important player in this drama, and his character helps build a bridge of plausibility between the brand new home and the tragedies befalling those who live within it. The book is basically broken up into three sections, each one telling the story and eventual tragedy of a different new family, the haunting and tragic factors increasing dramatically as the house feeds itself on the evil forces it unleashes. This premise works beautifully, making The House Next Door a fascinating read for both horror lovers and general readers alike, casting its nets far and wide to entrap readers of all sorts in its unsettling clutches. The ending, which seems to disappoint some readers, really feels right to me and is by no means anticlimactic. Anne Rivers Siddons succeeds in transplanting classic Southern Gothic horror into a modern, idyllic setting in which it seemingly does not belong. This is what makes the house so dangerous and makes the story all the more fascinating."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I've read them all and loved them. Siddons is a fine tale-teller (just as you'd expect from a Southerner) and she has a talent for creating real and believable characters. I'm not a fan of horror and picked this up thinking it was suspense. I was right -- horror suspense!When strange things begin happening at the new house next door to the Kennedys, this book just takes over. I couldn't get away from it until I finished it.Siddons was a long time reporter for Atlanta magazine, honing her craft under one of the best editors of the 50s and 60s. That's why her prose is so magical -- descriptions of people and places are vivid and never dull.This is Siddons at her very best. I hope she writes another suspense novel someday. I'd like to have that to look forward to."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I had never read any of Siddons' other novels, though my wife is a great admirer of hers. After hearing that Stephen King was a great fan of this book, I sought it out. It IS a very well-written, entertaining tale of a REALLY haunted house in an upscale neighborhood. Siddons gets beneath the veneer of suburban living, and shows how the unknown can unravel even the most solid realtionships. This book is atmospheric, spooky and unsettling. While others have called the ending a let-down, I think it works well within the context of the story.Get this one! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"When I started this book, I was expecting some cheesy haunted house tale...but it was actually a pretty creepy story. Not downright scary, but spooky enough. There were only a couple things that annoyed me slightly about this book.The first (as another reviewer already mentioned) was the main characters name, Colquitt. Doesn't really glide off the tongue too well, it was a distraction every time I came to it. Also, in the beginning of the book, Colquitt makes her and her husband Walter out to be upper middle class, saying they're just ordinary people who live ordinary lives. Well, as the story goes, you see pretty early on that they are in fact pretty darn wealthy, and live in a very rich neighborhood, attending lavish parties, spending weekends at the club, and vacationing frequently on the shore, Jamaica, and New York. The initial misrepresentation threw me a little.But overall the story was a good one, it kept me turning the pages to find out what the final horror of the house would be. Basically, a young new architect builds a house for a young newlywed couple. The house is amazing, but before it's even fully completed bad thing start happening. It covers the first year of the houses life, the three different family's that live in it, and the terrifying things that happen to them. Colquitt Kennedy (the next door neighbor) tells the story.In the end, I'd recommend this book to my friends. I'm not an avid suspense reader, but it was a nice distraction from my normal reading. As I said, not super scary stuff, but just enough to be entertaining."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"While I enjoyed this book immensely - the plot and pace - I shared the frustration of the Clare Swanson character when she lost it with Colquitt's secrecy and supposed 'otherness'. Colquitt's self-absorbed perceptions and invented dramas almost overshadowed the real star of the narrative - the house itself - and the actual drama.While all other characters are changed by the events, Colquitt ends up the same navel-gazing narcissist who began her story with peevish feelings of being invaded by the newcomers. Like Clare, I just wanted to shake her out of her theatrics. The reasons for her trepidation were overwritten - and her devastated reaction at discovering the Buck-Virginia affair really dates the story. Walter was a bit of a non-event, whose chief role in the story seemed to be as a contrast to Colquitt's irritating ways."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It had my full attention and then...the ending fell flat!I think the author ran of creativity!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Was not what I expected. Didn't really catch my attention very well. Very slow book took me some time to finish it. If it wasnt for the fact that I have to finish books I start I wouldn't have finished it. I felt nothing for the characters but it was well written. Not a fan of the book but Im sure some people would like the story."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I really like A.R.S., and although this book kept my attention for the most part, I found parts rather tedious. It wasn't \\"oh my god I can't sleep\\" creepy, but actually creepy in a way it was almost believable. The ending, however, left much to be desired. It was like she got tired writing."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Yuck. When the main character of a novel is talking about things like lunch and tennis \\"at the club\\", or referring to new poeple as \\"not of our set\\" I have a hard time developing a lot of sympathy for them. I realize this was written in 1978, but I was around in '78 and knew no one as insanely pretentious as the characters in this book. I think this was my favorite bit; \\"The women wore polyester pants or shifts, and some had fat plastic curlers in their hair. They gazed impassively at the house, and looked with slanting suspicion over at our house and at the other houses on the street, as if knowing their paths would never lead them to streets and houses like this, and resenting it.\\" Wow. Really? I guess I must be of The Polyester Pants Suit Set. Aside from the cultural atmosphere that I found completely alien, this book just wasn't scarey. The explanation of the \\"haunting\\" was completely week, and the ending was silly."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I have read other books by Ms. Siddons and found them to be very satisfying. This book held my attention all the way through and was very well written and plotted out, but left me completely unsatisfied.I was in the mood for a good ghost story and when I found out that this one impressed Stephen King so much, I thought it would be a satisfying one. Unfortunately I was let down. It wasn't scary, it wasn't spooky, and in the end it didn't deliver.This is the story a very nice couple living in a wealthy neighborhood. Next door is a beautiful wooded lot that they enjoy looking at and are dismayed when bulldozers come and a gentle architect begins building the house next door. They get to know him and care for him, they become the best of friends. You learn to like and care for all three of the central characters in this story -- that is truly the mark of a good writer. In succession, three different families live in the house and come to disaster -- you never get to know them well, but you feel sorry for them. Eventually this wonderful couple and this sweet man are drawn to the end together and that's where the major \\"thud\\" comes in. The ending was very unsatisfying and didn't seem well thought out at all.The reason it isn't scary or spooky is because the ghost story portion of the tale is never fully delved into, only alluded to. This book did not gain keeper status on my shelf and I probably will never recommend it to friends. Also, the ending was a little too quick and convenient to be believable....If you really want to read it get it from the library then you'll be glad to give it back at the end."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I guess the bottom line here is this book wasn't scary and it wasn't much of a mystery. Yes, there's some kind of evil presence but I kept waiting for the story to develop and it just never happened. I have to agree with the other review here about the need to kill pets, I was about to put the book down after the numerous animals killed but then it said something about how no more pets died. Skip this book, I'm glad I bought my coyy used since it's going in the giveaway bag."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I'm not at all familiar with Siddons' other work, but was recommended this book by a fellow literary enthusiast. I was remarking how great a book Hell House by Richard Matheson was, &amp; it was suggested that I read The House Next Door.While well written, the book is incredibly dry, boring &amp; extremely contrived. It's clearly a feeble attempt at a &quot;scary&quot; novel by someone unaccustomed to the genre. Again, Siddons is obviously a great writer in terms of style/skill, but this novel was bad. The two stars are merely given as a nod to her ability as a writer, rather than the story itself.I have no idea why Stephen King would have such great things to say about this book, as it is certainly not in league with even his worst effort. The only people I imagine would be pleased with this book are those that do not typically read horror/supernatural tales, but are in an &quot;adventurous&quot; mood."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I enjoyed the story line.

The first book I read by her was &quot;Homeplace&quot; and I went on to read everything she has written. The only one I didn't like is &quot;The House Next Door.&quot; I do enjoy a good horror novel now and then, especially Stephen King...but he and I didn't see eye to eye on this particular novel. I think Ms. Siddons is at her splendid best when she sticks to her usual genre. In fact, I wish she had been the one to write &quot;Scarlett.&quot; That would have been a real page turner!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"The callow lives of a complacent couple get shaken up when the house next door goes bad. As haunted house stories go, this is not particularly scary and compares unfavorably with \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" and \\"The Shining.\\" The book's most notable feature is its portrayal of a bland suburban couple who manage to be offensive and banal at the same time. Are there really people like this? At the end, I wondered if Siddons deliberately created two unlikable people to create a sense of ambivalence in the reader about the effect of the house on their little sheltered lives.By the last page, I was simultaneously rooting for the House Next Door and for the book to end."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This book wasn't awful but it just wasn't that good either. I have to admit though, I am biased because I like ghost stories and this book is about a haunted house, so I was of course expecting ghosts. Nope.

Very predictable."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This is the first book by this author that I have read and probably will not read another by her. First, the book was not the least bit scary. Second, I found her phrasing somewhat annoying and pretentious. (Silence always \\"spun out\\" across the telephone line or a conversation.) Third, the characters were also pretentious and were high society snobs. Yes, there are \\"evil\\" doings at the house next door but let's go have martinis at the club or take a three hour lunch and have Bloody Marys \\"rich and thick and sprinkled with snips of fresh dillweed, in outsized frosted glasses\\". Blech. The story itself was OK and kept me interested enough to finish the book to see how it ended."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I have to wonder if we all read the same book. I am a huge fan of horror novels and I have read some goods ones and some bad ones. The House Next Door falls under the \\"bad ones\\" category. It has a very, very mild creep factor to it, but it's such a boring read and those creepy moments are so sparse, that it has no right on the shelves next to the greats written by Edward Lee, Bentley Little, Stephen Laws, Graham Masterton, etc....Colquitt and her husband live next door to a new house that is haunted, cursed, evil? By the end of the book, who cares? People who live in this house are affected by it in not so wonderful ways, but would we call it horror? Not hardly. This is the type of \\"horror\\" I might suggest to my grandmother. So if you are one of those people who would love to believe you can handle horror, but don't really have the stomach for it...then this is your book. If you enjoy reading horror by the best, under covers, scared half out of your mind and too afraid to even get out of bed and go pee.....this is not for you."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"this book made me glad to have lived my entire life in new jersey. luckily, everyone in the south is not this boring and pretentious. even their names are obnoxious. do people like this really exist? that would be the real horror.don't bother."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This was not a scary book. I have read scary books, and this was not one of them. The majority of The House Next Door is spent on the social culture of a tight-knit neighborhood and not on anything frightening.

No cell phones, records in the stereo, etc. If you like horror, do yourself a favor and avoid this one."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This is an early book.

There were too many sad things that happened in that house or because of that house. I don't need a happy ending but this ending was beyond awful for me.

Not this one!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"No, it's not scary like The Exorcist or Cujo, but it definitely does has a \\"creep factor\\" that makes this a fun little book worth reading! Set in Atlanta suburbs, the main characters are (whether they realize it or not) vaguely snobbish. Perhaps just because they live in their own little world and nothing \\"ugly\\" invades their space. Maybe that's why the \\"house next door\\" is even more appalling than it would be elsewhere. Here we are in this upscale Atlanta neighborhood with a house next door that doing some very strange things to its unlucky occupants. Nope, not a big mystery or hide under the blankets book, but definitely a nice curl-up-in-the-bed-with-a-hot-chocolate book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"OK, a lame heading indeed! But I couldn't come up with anything better.One thing that I can say for sure is that Siddons wrote a terrific novel. I was really affected by the ending so I'm curious what some people are finding objectionable. I generally don't like this type of epilogue myself, but I'm not sure if it was this that people didn't like or was it the overall ending?Because I can honestly say that the ending of this novel affected me more powerfully than the ending of any novel that I've ever read. I actually put the book down and slapped the arm of the chair when I realized where it was heading. And I think that this was why the author didn't feel it was necessary to describe it in exact detail. No, we're not told exactly what happens to the Kennedy's, but I didn't need it spelled out for me. I picked up the book again in spite of the fact that I didn't want to finish. But I did.I can recommend this novel to any discerning readers out there who want their horror on the personal and humanistic level. No, there are no scary monsters in this book, except for those that the House draws from the hearts and souls of its tenants and neighbors who venture too close."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Ms. Siddons has created a true masterpiece of modern horror. Beautifully written and extremely low-key in approach, this tale of a contemporary house in suburban Atlanta (not even built at the start of the book) begins almost innocently as the residents of the neighborhood discuss the house to be built and speculate about the new neighbors. But soon enough, things go spiraling out of control as the residents of the house (and of the entire neighborhood) are victimized and destroyed by the evil power the house seems to have. I've read this one almost to pieces; here the chills are all the more effective because they seem as if they could actually happen, somehow. A gem."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"From beginning to nearly the end, I couldn't put it down. They give up their work, friends, and nearly their sanity to save anyone else from what entity this house may hold. A little slow to start, but WOW, once it picks up during the first chapter... you're in for the long haul. As for the ending, well... it doesn't allow me to sleep well at night (or go house-hunting for that matter). Invest your time in this one!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This novel is pure evil - brilliantly conceived and almost perfectly written. Although unrealistic, the dialogue is more interesting to read than if it had been more authentic. Siddons has created a masterpiece of horror that actually succeeded in shaking me up for an entire afternoon. I finished the last chapter over lunch one day, and couldn't concentrate on the real world until the next morning. Everything seemed to flow from the world she had created, seeming somehow twisted, not right. A must read - one of my all time favorite horror novels, in case you didn't notice."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Some the the reviewers of the book have not been so intrigued by it's suspense but I was, I liked that it wasn't your normal run of the mill mystery novel. It gave me more than the average who dun it. I admit I was not on the edge of my seat but I was genuinely intrigued by the characters and the mystery that surrounded them and how they dealt with the things that happened in the 'house next door' and what it eventually did to them. The ending was very unusual."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I loved this book. I found it very crisp and it never waivered in its intensity, although it had amusing and delicious moments of yuppy socializing and two fantastic heroes:Colquitt and Walter Kennedy, who refused, by the end, to allow the horrors next door to continue. Yes, they had to perform a drastic deed to end the tyranny of the architectural monster-house, but no one can say they were wrong to do it. There is a major question left for the reader to ponder at the end of the novel...I won't spill it here, and spoil the book for the lucky readers to come... I say &quot;lucky,&quot; because this is definitely a 'treat' book that will keep you up all night and turning the pages frantically. And I have to say I miss Col and Walter and Razz and Foster Grant. House is also a charming love story. It's about good, popular people who love each other unconditionally... In fact, I think it is one of the few suspense novels that portrays a truly loving couple, for Col and Walter never fall out of love with each other, no matter what horrible things happen around - or to - them."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This was the first Anne Rivers Siddons book I read and I did enjoy it. It was a scarey story about a plot of land that was developed (the last one in the neighborhood) and anyone who lived there had horrible things happen to them. Three different families lived there and things escalated and got worse. The closest neighbors, the Kennedys, were aware of each family's problems starting with the first couple who built the house. They also befriended the architect. With each move a different neighbor got involved with the new owners and they would also get sucked into the nightmare happening. It was never explained why this was happening and it had to be stopped or would keep happening. This story kept you on the edge of your seat until the end. I would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense along with the paranormal."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"First, I want to say I enjoyed this book. I don't read horror stories as a rule, but the reviews on this one were good so I gave it a shot. Also, I like books about houses. And this story had a house from hell. The story carried me along, and kept me from getting too irritated with the flowery, over-written narrative.Walter and Colquitt (!!) Kennedy are the most self-satisfied, smug, snobbish couple you could imagine. They are living in their own bubble, with their very self-satisfied, smug and snobbish neighbors. Even towards the end of the story, when everything that can go wrong has, she says about the ordinary people who come to look at the house, \\" I realized that I had never in all my life really known that those others existed. I could not imagine their lives. We could not have spoken.\\" That sums up her attitude about everyone who was not in her circle of friends.Yet she is caring enough to go the distance for....... well, I won't tell about that. Every emotion she feels is overwhelming- horror, terror, heartwrenching-- everything she feels is over the top. No middle ground for her. And the love she and Walter have is also love like no other, etc. etc. It's all exaggerated to the point of overkill.But, aside from the dramatic writing and the blatant snobbery, the book was good. And I'm glad I don't live in that high class neighborhood. Too spooky for me."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Colquitt & Walter Kennedy are a comfortable couple living out their dreams in an affluent suburb and then the lot next to them is sold . . . It has some very sinister undertones and I'm looking forward to discovering what happens next.This was a great book. I remember picking it up because it was on Stephen King's recommended reading list in Entertainment Weekly a few years back. It's a story about a group of upper class people who have lived charmed lives until construction begins in a previously unbuildable empty lot in their development. From the beginning ominous events occur and as time goes by the incidents become much more appalling and life changing for the residents nearby. I don't want to give too much away but if you like a good old fashioned soap opera/spooky tale this is as good as they get."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this intense and imaginitive thriller. It was told in a style that made you feel like you could very much relate to the characters and the events as they were occuring. Even thought the source of the hauntings is never really revealed, the reader will come away with a sense of closure and finality. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"... and it's beautifully written. No big monsters or slimy things, just the creeping feeling that things have gone wrong and are going to get worse. You hope, then you pray that there is something that can be done, or maybe a way out. Like Shirley Jackson and The Haunting of Hill House, this is a meditation - or a nightmare - on the power of our environment, specifically our homes. Read it in a house you love and trust."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"I started reading Anne Siddons novels in the early/ mid- '90's, and end up loving most of them. I read the House Next Door years ago, and thought it was a rather good departure from her normal 'genre,' although if you are a fan of her novels, this little gem should be right up your alley, too!IMO, her earlier books far outshine her more recent offerings, and The House Next Door did not disappoint. I thought the 'horror' element was subtle, and halfway 'believable.'"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Stephen King wrote a book \\"Danse Macabre\\" that is a history/critique of horror. In it his has lists of books/movies that impressed him greatly. One of them was \\"The Great God Pan\\" which is just a mess as far as I'm concerned, another recommendation was this book which is not only scary but believable. Also the ending seems predictable but throws in twist that is unforeseen. Even despite the horror it is a window into a way of life that in itself is interesting and would stand alone as a book much like \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\". If you are looking for a good read, this is it."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This is my first A.R.S. book and I really enjoyed it. Parts of the book were a little slow ... it is not a quick moving book, but I did not want to put it down anyway. I read a lot of true crime, Stephen King, and Dean Koontz, as well as other mysteries, and this book thrilled me and haunted me like so many of those others have.I agree, Colquit, is a an odd name, not easy to read - as one reviewer pointed out... and as another reviewer pointed out there are no ghosts, and as other reviewers pointed out there was some killing of pets ... but these are minor flaws. Take the book as a whole and you have a haunting story and the ending leaves you hanging. (BTW: The killing of the pets went along nicely with the whole premise of the haunting - the 'evil presence' took things near and dear to these people - pets fit right in.)One reviewer pointed out that she has not enjoyed other A.R.S. books like she enjoyed this one, so I am a little wary about reading her other books, but I will give them a try nonetheless (at least a few).I think this book felt very real. The characters felt like real people and this brought the story home to me. It made me feel like this is possible - much like a Dean Koontz book. Many of Stephen King's books don't feel like the stories could actually happen - but this one and D.K.'s books have that quality and that is what freaks me out - and that is what I enjoy about those books - and this one!I recommend it!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"This story of a house built by an enthusiastic young architect, narrated by a next door resident, Colquitt Kennedy, is masterful and original, its closest relative being another entry on that short list, Shirley Jackson's classic The Haunting of Hill House. As Colquitt and her husband observe over some years, the house is inhabited by three families who all leave under peculiar and tragic circumstances. Meanwhile they have become close friends of the young architect. As time goes on, the Kennedys first suspect, then know that the house is evil, that it destroys its inhabitants morally and psychologically. And they begin to dread that there might be a particular source for this evil-- and what should they do about it? The novel is very well written , in clear and vivid prose, by Ms Siddons-- very different from the eerie, poetic writing of Jackson-- but this makes the horror of the ending all the more powerful. As in Jackson's novel, we are left unsure whether a protagonist or protagonists are correct in their dread, or are they merely unhinged? For in this novel, narrated in first person, has the house claimed even the narrator as a victim? and the last little afterword of the plans being found later and the prospect of another such house is chilling-- brr! An excellent novel."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Firstly, I have to say I really enjoyed this book. The writing was excellent and the storyline was very good. What I liked about the story is that it tells how two people deal with one trauma after another (or should I say, one broken friendship after another). They never let things get the better of them and always got on with it.With regards to the story itself, although interesting...is very farfetched and can be interpreted in a two ways: 1. That everything that happened to people in the house was due to a curse or something supernatural. OR 2. Colquitt and her husband are infact crazy and also murderers. Everthing that happened in the book can be logically explained. The story of the three families that lived next door are all very tragic, but it could have been all coincidence. Colquitt got very close to all families and so knew the story, but who knows what goes on behind closed doors? These things happen. Nothing supernatural happens during the whole story.The ending is very, very clever and I never predicted the twist in the story. This book has twist at the end, that is in the same proportions to the film the &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;. It makes the book for me. Even the epilouge adds a clever finishing touch to the story.I take it that Colquitt and her husband must have been jailed for what they done at the end....I mean it would'nt have taken a genius to figure out that it was them that actually commmited those crimes.Finally, I was so impressed by this book that i'd like to read more of A R Siddons. However, being a guy in my twenties and judging by the titles on her other books, can someone tell me if they are just weepie love stories for girls only?"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"It's difficult to believe this book was initially published in 1978 or that it was only Siddon's second book. There is nothing dated about it! The story pulls you in, with a feeling of dread, that builds step by step. I picked up the book on the recommendation that it is a top notch example of it's genre. I can comfirm that is so."},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Anne Rivers Siddons. Que voil&agrave; un nom inconnu pour moi! Jusqu'&agrave; un certain jour de 1992, o&ugrave; j'ai d&eacute;couvert son roman et l'ai feuillet&eacute; dans la librairie, tr&egrave;s rapidement parce que je n'&eacute;tais pas seule. Un unique souvenir m'est rest&eacute;: le pr&eacute;nom de l'h&eacute;roine. Pas le titre, juste... le pr&eacute;nom!! Colquitt. WOW!! O&ugrave; a-t-elle pch&eacute; cela? (Si je pouvais, je le lui demanderais parce que je veux savoir d'o&ugrave; a vient, c'est original comme pr&eacute;nom) J'ai aussi vu qu'il s'agissait d'une histoire un peu inqui&eacute;tante, et cela me plaisait bien. Toutefois, je ne l'ai pas achet&eacute;. Neuf ans plus tard, je suis retomb&eacute;e dessus tout &agrave; fait par hasard, &agrave; la biblioth&egrave;que de mon quartier. L&agrave;, je l'ai reconnu (encore &agrave; cause du nom) et je me suis dit &quot;je vais me payer la traite !!&quot; Alors je suis repartie avec lui dans mon sac. De retour chez moi, je l'ai lu tout d'un trait (d&eacute;vor&eacute;, en fait). Apr&egrave;s, j'ai remu&eacute; ciel et terre pour me le procurer.Ce qui m'a tant plu dans ce livre, c'est l'horreur dans l'ordinaire: de toutes petites choses, du moins au d&eacute;but, et toujours plausibles. Dans ce type de r&eacute;cit, il faut que la trame soit plausible d'un bout &agrave; l'autre, sinon, a ne marche pas et le lecteur peut d&eacute;crocher. Elle l'est. De l&eacute;ger malaise en petit d&eacute;tail troublant, d'incident en accident, le quotidien se d&eacute;r&egrave;gle tranquillement et chaque nouvelle situation, un peu plus &eacute;trange et douloureuse que la pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente, met rudement &agrave; l'&eacute;preuve les liens mutuels d'amour et la cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; des deux h&eacute;ros. Qu'ils soient riches ou pauvres n'a pas tellement d'importance. &Eacute;tant donn&eacute; que Colquitt et Walter &eacute;taient des gens &agrave; l'aise financi&egrave;rement et semblaient jouir d'un statut social relativement enviable, ils avaient bien plus &agrave; perdre, en parlant de leurs craintes &agrave; leur entourage, que si c'&eacute;taient deux &quot;nobodys&quot; sortis de nulle part. C'est la raison pour laquelle, selon moi, Anne Rivers Siddons les a plac&eacute;s dans cette situation au d&eacute;part. Quant au genre de vie qu'ils menaient, c'&eacute;tait bien typique des ann&eacute;es 70. Le lieu non plus n'a pas d'importance: l'histoire est tr&egrave;s intemporelle (une autre belle qualit&eacute; du roman) et aurait tout aussi bien pu se passer &agrave; Miami en 1990, &agrave; New-York en 1960 ou mme &agrave; Londres en 1900... elle aurait mme pu se passer dans une banlieue hupp&eacute;e de Montr&eacute;al! L'horreur n'a pas d'ge, pas de lieu et ne suit aucune mode.Petite critique de ma part: en tant qu'&eacute;crivain, j'aurais peut-tre davantage tir&eacute; parti de certaines situations potentiellement explosives. Quand Walter est arriv&eacute; un soir, par exemple, et a trouv&eacute; sa femme et Kim dans la cuisine de la fameuse maison (peu importe pour quelle raison, c'&eacute;tait l'&eacute;tat d'esprit de Walter qui comptait &agrave; ce moment-l&agrave;), quelque chose de &quot;weird&quot; aurait pu se passer. Sans qu'il y ait n&eacute;cessairement du sang &agrave; profusion, Walter aurait pu r&eacute;agir plus intens&eacute;ment et poser un geste regrettable... &Agrave; tort, bien entendu, mais cela aurait ajout&eacute; &agrave; l'horreur de la situation. Il faut lire le livre pour comprendre ce que je veux dire!Il me reste &agrave; dire que j'ai bien aim&eacute; la mani&egrave;re dont Colquitt parlait de ses chats et de la faon qu'ils avaient de &quot;changer leurs queues de place&quot; (c'&eacute;tait ainsi traduit en franais), j'ai trouv&eacute; cela bien mignon!! J'ai eu des chats moi-mme et j'imaginais sans mal Razz ou Foster prendre des poses en changeant sa queue de place de temps &agrave; autre.La fin du roman. Quelle fin! Moi aussi, j'en ai &eacute;t&eacute; surprise et je me suis dit &quot;voyons! ai-je manqu&eacute; quelque chose??&quot; Mais je ne d&eacute;teste pas qu'un roman se termine sur une question... Au fond, Anne Rivers Siddons a laiss&eacute; au lecteur le choix d'imaginer sa propre fin. Vraiment, un excellent roman!"},{"Title":"The House Next Door","review":"Having read all the reviews of this book I was expecting a so-so experience, but I think the really negative reviewers have got it wrong. I don't think there is anything off-putting about the narrators, they are not &quot;snobbish&quot; or shallow, or tedious. I did not find them annoying. I just really enjoyed the story. Having read A LOT of horror, I can say this one really raised the hairs on my neck many times, particularly with the middle story. THAT is very very creepy! It was compelling, suspenseful and genuinely horrifying at times. Aside from a tendency to string together too many &quot;and's,&quot; the writing is wonderful and not distracting from the story.Its not perfect: I agree that the ending is a little bit of a let down, but that was a minor point.

During those ten years, he finds out how to live in the wilderness by looking for a library to learn what to eat and what not to eat. While living in the mountains, he also looked for the Gribley's farm. He finds the farm by going to the library and asking the librarian, Ms.Turner to help him find ancient maps about the Gribley beech. He succeeds in finding the Gribley Farm covered in moss. He also found the fence surrounding it so that other hunters will not shoot animals inside his territory. Sam makes traps to catch rabbits and other animals. One day he sees a duck hawk flying around in the air, and Sam sees a nest where the Hawk was flying around. Sam goes to the cliff and climbs up to the nest and finds three little baby hawks. The mother saw him and started poking into him with her beak. Sam took one of the babies and went to a flat place on the cliff and found some edges and climbed down with the baby hawk rolled up in his sweater. He got down, set down on a boulder and named the hawk Frightful. Sam trained Frightful for the next 4 months and taught Frightful how to hunt, and catch his meat on a stick that Sam threw up in the air for Frightful's training.This Silver Newbery Honor story tells the reader about how to live in the wilderness. Sam has mastered all the skills that he needs to live in the wilderness.

If you would like that lifestyle you should read \\"My side of the Mountain\\" with Sam Gribley.In \\"My side of the Mountain\\" Jean Craighead George has written a great outdoor adventure when young Sam Gribley endured months and months in up state New York on his great grandfathers land.In \\"My side of the Mountain\\" young Sam Gribley tries to prove his family wrong that he can run away to his great grandfathers homeland and he does. He also has a great experience while he is in the in the woods of up State New York.In \\"My side of the Mountain\\" Sam Gribley captured a falcon when it was a very young. The thing is when Sam tried to get the falcon the mother falcon of course attacked him with her razor sharp talons she struck Sam's shoulder going extremely fast and Sam was in horrid pain but in the long run it was worth it. Sam trained her to hunt for him. Sam named her \\"Frightful\\". Without \\"Frightful he would have a big hunting problem Sam could still trap animals and eat them but with \\"Frightful\\" he would not be in good shape because \\"Frightful\\" got the majority of his food.The story \\"My side of the Mountain\\" the main thing that Sam needed to have was knowledge of his surroundings. For example in the book if Sam didn't know about plants or how to catch and cook animals because if he didn't know how long to cook meat he could get very sick because it's not like he has a microwave that he can just punch in the time he needs for it to cook and if he messes up on making the food it's not like he can go to his cabinet and get food he will have to go out and hunt with \\"Frightful\\".This fictional story \\"My side of the Mountain\\" is an informal and exiting story about Sam Gribley having to endure nature's glories and not so glorious things about nature.

I didn't know how important this book was to me until I introduced it to the next generation and found we could still enter that tree house, wonder about the moss growing as a dietary supplement... admire the ingenuity and the need for safety which this young protagonist handles first through pain and then through self-awareness and determination. This novel takes us to a mountain landscape where the basic needs of survival are met and where the basic needs of humanity: fun, love, power and belonging also take form as the seasons roll on. It is a story of hope. A great book to read aloud and one that should be read in episodes so that every inch of the valley, every minor quandary can be given due regard as you continue in the daily routine. Escapism and its opposite all in one. Many more have followed in this genre... does it have a name? Survivalist adventures? Paulsen's \\"Hatchet\\", Lasenby's \\"The Lake\\", Scott O'Dell... enjoy."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My class just finished reading your book.

This is exactly what happened to Sam in this book. This story is a realistic fiction about an eleven year old boy, Sam, who lived in New York City. Sam wanted to be alone in the Catskills.

Aaron had also left New York City but for a different reason, he wanted to be missed. Sam and Aaron about a month later left the Catskills and went home. Their outdoor knowledge helped them when they returned home.I liked this story because Sam happened to go where I live now. I also liked the whole idea of staying outdoors.

The book is about a boynamed Sam Gribley who decidedto leave his home in thecity at the age of 15 to lie inthe wilderness> Sams grandfather owned land up inthecatskill mountains and that is where sam wanted to go. He thought he could escape his crowded family life andlive on his own. No one believed he would be able to do it andthat he would be home shortlye.One ofthe first things sam needed to do was make himself shelter. he did this bu hollowing out a large tree by burning the inside out. Ithinkthatwas a really cool thing to do because I would have never though to do that. Sam also had to learn to fend for himself and catch his own food.Another thing I find reallycool since we go to the super market for food and wouldnt know how to even start to hunt for food. He learns to start a fire with flint and manages to survive for years on his own!sam makes a lot fo woodland creature friends including racoons and badgers but the best one was a baby falcon that he stole from a nest after doing research and deciding he wanted one. He names her \\"frightfull\\" She grew to be a great companion andeven help him to hunt for food.sam evetually needs to find human friends and over thenext few years makes a bunchof them. Sams two best friends are Aaron and Bando who visit him a lot on themountain. His parents eventualy find out where he is andcome visit himto check up on him. His father is satisfied with how his son is surviving.Inthe begining of thebook we see sam as a scared kid, I think by theend of the book hehas become very sure of himself and proud that he was able to make it on his own. It was almost easier forsame to surviveandtake care of him self in the woods then inhis crowded city apartment!I would recomend this bookto everyone.

Sam's adventures were such a great tale of freedom and self reliance while also serving as a representation of the self made man and the American dream.

It made me feel it was written FOR me,... until the end. Much like ET's final scene and it's saccharin cop-out, this book turned from a book for boys, into a book written by an adult for boys to teach us a \\"very special lesson about family.\\"Shame upon you Jean Craighead George! Shame upon you and your children, and your childrens children. Shame on you for taking a character that I cared so much about, and making him betray himself and all he had worked for in order to create an ending that the writers of Webster, Home Improvement, and Erkle would be proud to call their own. (If you like these shows, run don't walk to the nearest bookstore and buy this book!)Shame on me for being suckered in as a teenage boy reading a book about a teenage boy, written by a middle aged mother.I was so insensed by the ending of this book, that I used my very next writing assignment in class to add an additional chapter, one where the main character appologized to himself for this betrayal, burned all his bridges behind him so that in the future he would not be able to betray himself again, and returned to the character that he had been for 95% of this book.

The story didn't keep my interest and when I was reading it I would always daydream. In the story he did the same thing almost everyday becuse there isn't much to do when you are in the forest.

Although it was given the Newberry Honor and was put on the ALA book list and is considered a piece of quality literature, I personally thought this was the worst book I have ever read. Published by Viking Penguin in 1959 it is a fairly old novel, but at an 810 lexile it is a confusing book for young readers.The book is about a young boy named Sam Gribbly who runs away from his crowded apartment in New York City to live to the Catskill Mountains. He found a hemlock tree and burns a large cave in the tree and decides to make that his home. He finds a falcon nest and takes one of the birds' babies and trains it to hunt for him. He spends months on end hunting, fishing and trying to survive.The dictionary is a suspense thriller compared to this book. There is practically no dialog. There is no humor in this book and it is very dry and uninteresting. This book was also very redundant. If you ever are having a hard time sleeping then try this 177 page sleeping pill!This book was very confusing. The ending made you have a lot of questions because it made no sense what so ever. The author packed too much info in the end. I didn't even under stand the beginning. You would have to read the book middle to beginning to the end!I really did not like this book at all. It is bad reading for youth readers. I give it a 2 out of 10, because a thought the book was boring, confusing and redundant but the book did have some very good descriptions. So unless you want a $9.99 time waster, stay away from this book!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"We as a class had to read \\"My side of the Mountain\\" and then give a report on it. I did not find the book very interesting for myself because I enjoy historical books, My favorite author is Mary Pope Ausborn.But, if you like nature, it would be a good book for you. Sam is tired of the busy city life and all the noise from his brothers and sisters, and his Dad making fun of him so he runs away to the Catskill Mountains, where he learns to make a fire (with the help of Bill) and he has to catch his food, (he just has to learn to survive on his own) This book is about the challenges he faces and how he overcomes obstacles to survive.I would not read this book again, but since it was required for class, I had no choice. Most of the girls in our class were bored throughout the story. I think the boys liked it better. It just depends on what interests you have in books.And yes, I had to write this review as part of my grade!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I did not like this book because I thought it was boring.

Well, Sam did in My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George. Sam has many great adventures and learns how to survive. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat.One event that occurred in the book is when Sam meticulously climbs a cliff to get to a peregrine falcon's nest so he can capture one of his own. He must be slow and steady on the steep cliff because one slip can be the end. Sam keeps going and going until he feels a sharp pain on his back. It's the mother falcon. But still he keeps on going.Another event is when Sam is embittered after being sprayed by a skunk. He was pursuing three raccoons when he found himself suddenly tripping over a skunk.

He has many adventures while he was there, and all of those adventures are told about in this book. Everyone tries to, or thinks about running away at some point in their life. Sam Gribley, though, gets farther than most people. He talks about what it was like to run away from home, how he got by on the land, what it felt like to live alone, and may other interesting topics. I would highly recommened this book to anyone!

He also says that he can live and stay there in the Catskill Mountains where his great-grandfather use to live. He hitch-hikes over to the mountains and finds his great-grandfather's ranch. The house is so messed up he has to make himself a home in the forest. When he is making a house in a tree he steals a baby falcon from its mother and trains it like he always wanted to. Fearful, Sams pet falcon, goes up to be trained and very trustworthy to Sam. Sam finds himself with other people in the forest that come and go for sight seeing. Sam and Fearful learn to survive and stay protected from other dangerous animals and humans. Sam and Fearful have scary and wild adventure living at Catskill Mountains.The book, My Side of the Mountain, was a very so-so book. It didn't have any high or low points it was just how to survive in the wilderness. Sam, the child in the book, knows how to survive, he knows how to do everything and he's only thirteen-years-old. There's not alot of action in the book but, alot of survival skill stuff. I don't think I would read the book again because it got boring after awhile. It was pretty much the same things throughout the whole story find food, stay warm, work on something, and sleep. That was really interesting (not really). I would recommend this book to thirteen-year-olds who like the wilderness. I give this book three stars for have a good plot but, not a very good story itself."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I found My Side of the Mountain to be a entertaining and a pretty well written book, or at least uniquely written. It is about a boy who decides to move off by himself to live in his ancestor's old farm that's over grown and been abandoned for several years. The book is told in first person perspective by the boy himself. This creates the effect of you, the reader, reading the boy's journal of what he has done during his stay on his ancestor's farm.I did think that the book should have less detail, such as the recipe for acorn pancakes, and more detail on the action and events. The author seems more interested in writing how the boy changes during his stay in the wilderness than an actual entertain plot. It is an idea, but it makes the book less entertaining IMHO.I also found the ending to be a bit lacking, and kind of dumb, though I won't spoil it for you here. I just think that the ending happened to suddenly and without very much detail and I think it needs to be explained a little bit more. But you need to read it to understand what I'm trying to tell you.Over all, the book is a good read for kids and preteens, but high school students may find it boring. But I still recommend picking it up for something a little different."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I think that the book was about a rich boy in the city who ran away from home to get attention. I also think that it would have been better if the boy was injured or killed in the woods. If you like storys about a kid going into the woods and nothing happens you will like this book. If you like books about a kid going into the woods and it is like real life get another one. In this book no animals attack the boy or any thing like that."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This is a horrible book!!!!!!!!!!! don't read it it will scar you and your children for life!!!!!

I will just toss out a few random commments. I respect Sam's ability to carve out a life for himself in the wilderness. Sure there is natural brutality out there, but the author implies that if a kid is determined to run away, it is better to head for the country, rather than risk the cilivilzed dangers of life on the city streets.But let's get real here: how long can Sam avoid being caught by rangers, tourists, truant officers or even his parents--naturally desperate to find him? Is it wise to defy Nature for an entire winter, alone in a tree? Is it likely that he could last that long with no serious illness or broken bones? Nor was he attacked by large, vicious animals. This is a great, fun read which will hold your interest. I just hope it does not lure teenagers into trying to duplicate Sam's brave but foolhardy challenge to both Society and mother Nature. It ends with a compromise (life as a hermit vs family membership) which does not undermine family values. I especially liked the many sketches showing plants, animals and objects which can be fashioned in the wild. I bet that Sam Gribly proves a heroic role model for many Scouts!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I read My Side of the Mountain over 20 years ago.

The plot is that Sam is trying to live in the mountains, but has a hard time living there. In this book, it tells how Sam makes his home and his food. Sam's character changes because at first he didn't know anything like hunting and that but in the middle of the story, he knows a lot. Sam isn't selfish because he share and makes food for his visitors, like Bando. (You'll know who Bando is in the book.)Sam wouldn't know how to hunt or make his food if he hadn't lived in the mountains. So living in the mountains made Sam learn to hunt. Sam learned how to make his house. How he makes his house is amazing. The book shows pictures of his house. Sam describes how he made his food. Like his house, it shows you a picture about it.My Side of the Mountain is a great book and tells about how Sam changes in the story. Readers will love this book, so did I. So I would give this a 4 star book. Also there is a sequal to this book and it's called: On the Far Side of the Mountain. It has the same people but a new adventure. So read both books!Edward, a sixth grader"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Living in the wild is hazardous. It takes courage and wisdom as shown in the audacious story, My Side of the Mountain. Written by Jean Craighead George and published by Viking Penguin, the book won the Newberry Honor, the ALA Notable Book, and the ALA Booklist. Also, by the author are three sequels; On the Far Side of the Mountain, Frightful's Mountain, and Frightful's Daughter. I enjoyed reading this tremendous book.It begins with Sam Gribley running away from home. When he finally gets to the wilderness of the Catskill Mountains, he finds his grandfather's farm. Before long, he is all set with everything he thinks he'll ever need in his new dwelling, but, soon he starts finding men who are looking for a wild boy. Could they be searching for him? And if they are, will his quiet life in the forest be ruined eternally?I enjoyed reading about Sam's intellectual ideas. A couple examples of this are as follows. In one part of the book, he gets this superb idea to construct his house within a dead tree. In another part of the book, he figures out how to construct a deer skin coat. And in yet another part of the book, he tricks a hunter out of his deer meat (venison). He also does this shortly in the book with other hunters in order to have food and clothing.I also enjoyed how the author provides friends for Sam even when it looks like he is all alone. Here are a couple of examples of this. In the story, he meets a young college scholar in the forest nicknamed Bando. In another part of the story, he steals and trains an infant Peregrine Falcon that he later names Frightful. In yet another part of the story, he befriends a twelve year old assistant journalist named Matt who is probing the Mountains for \\"the wild boy\\".I was chuckling to myself when he chose to name the birds that lived by him after his old cranky neighbors. I was also really excited when I read that he was going to try to capture and domesticate a Falcon. I also enjoy it when he first found the tree. Although this is a terrific book for all ages, I would especially like to recommend it to middle schoolers. It is a book concerning family, action, intelligence, comprehension, and endurance. All that is needed to love this book is an adventurous outlook."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"my side of the mountain is an awsome book.the story is about a boy named Sam that runs away from homeand how he survives living inside a tree with only a penknife,a ball of cord, some flint & steel & the clothes on his back!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"This book in whitch I speak of, was the best book i've ever read.

One evening I picked it up to scan a few pages and found myself returning to my own childhood as I sat and read the whole book. The book was introduced to me in fourth grade and back then I would read it over and over.The idea that a young boy could leave home and live in the forest and off of the land was amazing. For hours, I, and like-minded friends, would sit in the five-acres of woods and streams behind our homes and try to re-create Sam's animal traps, start fires with flint and steel and catch fish with whittled hooks.This book is a classic. The original had dark charcoal drawings of Sam and his surroundings, making Sam seem like anyboy. However, the copy I found for my son had been updated with the cover showing Sam with blond hair.Also, as with so many other things, George has written sequels, many years after publishing the original. This is a children's classic that would have been better left alone, but one must always be greatful to George for having written it.Highly reccomend this book for elementary school children and to adults trying to remember a time when the feeling that anything was possible seemed real."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Imagine moving away from your family to go to your great grandfathers land and live in the woods with just an ax, string, pen knife, flint and $[...].

Without \\"Frightful he would have a big hunting problem Sam could still trap animals and eat them but with \\"Frightful\\" he would not be in good shape because \\"Frightful\\" got the majority of his food.The story \\"My side of the Mountain\\" the main thing that Sam needed to have was knowledge of his surroundings. For example in the book if Sam didn't know about plants or how to catch and cook animals because if he didn't know how long to cook meat he could get very sick because it's not like he has a microwave that he can just punch in the time he needs for it to cook and if he messes up on making the food it's not like he can go to his cabinet and get food he will have to go out and hunt with \\"Frightful\\".This fictional story \\"My side of the Mountain\\" is an informal and exiting story about Sam Gribley having to endure nature's glories and not so glorious things about nature. I would give this book a ten out of ten because I never wanted to put the book down. Over all \\"My side of the Mountain\\" was an awesome book."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain is an fantastic story!

I read it in 6th grade for an assignment. So I had to read it all but I could barely get through the 1-4 pages. A book about a kid who lives in a tree? I tell ya where do they get these ideas!THIS BOOK STUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Enjoy the adventures of sam gribley living in the great catskill mountains. Sam has been living in the mountains for some time but I'm going to start at the begining. Sam had run away from home and went to the catskill mountains the first day were pretty rough sam could not start a fire and had trouble finding or catching food. Soon enough sam was able to light a fire and catch his food but there was one problem he needed shelter. One day sam stumbled upon a huge tree it had to be more than 400 years old. As soon as sam looked at this tree he knew he had found his home. There was one problem the tree had rotted wood in the middle. Sam thought about the indians and hadan idea he was going to burn te tree. Shelter-Check, but sam needed to gather food for the long and cold winter.As sam was collecting food he heard sirens he ran up to his tree and found a man sleeping by his fire now sam had no talked to another human for along time and was eager to wake the man up. His nam was bando and he was the greatest help to sam apart from frightful.Bando was a professer at a school and he mde clay pots and flutes ad even a raft and fireplace.Sam needed Warm clothes so he went out and heard gunshots seconds later a deer cam running through and then died right in front of sam. Sam had now made deerskin pants and a blanket. It was halloween and sam wanted to share food with the animals so he left some out the animals would not go away for days and sam got sprayed by a skunk. After that christmas came up and bando returned and his father. Bando made jam and gave him a 5 pound bag of sugar.I really liked the book because it not only tells you how to survive but it makes you want to try it some day it sounds easy but it is not. I have always loved to camp and jean is s good at writing exactly how it feels to live off the land. My favorite parts of the book are theones where he discribes how he built somthing or how he made somthing its great."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Two years ago my friends and I read this book as a group project for our reading reports. We were all so bored with the story and couldn't finish it in time for when our project was due because of the billon pages of pure trash. I think the author is great but this is one of my least favorite books. Also, if you don't like reading long books then I don't think you would want to read this one."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I really did like this book alot yet things didn't make sense and the story did not seem real."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"One word says it all. TERRIBLE! This book was so boring that I think I actually died while reading it but was revived when my cat jumped on my face. Thank God, I mean me, for that! Seriously though.... a boy is in the wilderness for some reason. He doesn't know anything about surviving in the wilderness. He learns everything he needs to know through his experiences and becomes quite the expert on survival. Oh boy!! How many of these stories can people write? They're all the same with different settings and different names. Terrible!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I'm not much of a complainer about books, but this book was just simply dreadful. It put me to sleep. I mean, who wants to know how to start a fire ? This book had a pointless plot, a stupid storyline and the author wrote like this: Then he did this. Then he did this. Then he did this.DON'T GET THIS BOOK. IT'S THE AUTHOR'S WORST!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I decided to read this book because my friend said it was a really good book. Boy was she wrong! It took me about 2 weeks to finish this stupid book and I usually read boods in three to four days! So a boy runs away and makes a place to live in. . . WHO CARES????? This book was dull and boring and I can hardly remember any details of this book anymore. I don't even remember the boy's name!!!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I disliked this book. It was really dull. I would of rather read the Boxcar Kids a hundred million times. I would never recommend this book to anyone!! I made a bad decision to read this book. Please don't make the same mistake."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"i thought it moved really slow. it seemed unrealstic. our book club chose the book. only one girl liked it. too out dated."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"What was Jean thinking? How in the world did his parents not report him missing? Of course, he lives in a tree. This book is so unrealistic because there could not possibly be a tree with a thick enough trunk in New York to hollow out. Of course, I wouldn't know, because I fell asleep after the first couple pages. I don't know what all of these people read, but it couldn't be this book. Now, you are probably wondering why I finished it (I mean skimmed it). I was forced to read it by my 5th grade teacher. She was probably scoffing at us behind our backs \\"ha, ha! I'll make them read this book\\". Why can't Sam have any troubles? You couldn't possibly train a wild falcon. It would scratch your eyes out before you even had a chance to touch it. I recommended this book to only one person, my worst enemy. So, please do yourself a favor (a BIG favor) and stay far away from this book."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"THis was an exellent book. I would have to say this is one of my very favorite books. After I read it, I even tried the dandilion salad. Not the normal ceasor salad! This is a wonderful book for childern or teen-agers with an imagination. I usually only read books once, but since I enjoyed the story and it's drawings so much, I read it seven times. Even if you don't like the outdoors, the charecters are great"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"The book My side of the Mountain is a good book all ages.This book makes you feel like you are living in the hollowed out tree with Frightful and eating nature stuff.But at the end Sam was kind of mad because all the people he meets come to his tree and spends the night.So his family comes out to live with him in the trees.I recommend this book to anyone who likes books."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountain is an outstanding book.

Frightful was funny."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"My Side of the Mountian by Jean Craighead George is an awsome story. I think the book seems too good to be rated. Sometimes I don't even know that it's fiction because Craighead uses her words carefully and thoughtfully."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"Very good book! My reading teacher, Mr. Ross, says it helps you survive in the woods and it's also a great story. I think that's true. Although most of my friends say it's boring. I rated it 3 starts--that means it's great, because I'm very exigent with rating."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I'm not a big fan of survival stories,but this one converted me. It has a unique,interesting plot. How many teenage boys these days choose to run away to the wildnerness? Sam showed great maturity in forging a life on his own in the Catskill Mountains. It was amazing how he tamed a falcon to be his companion. Some humans even visited him occasionally. If I had to live alone in the forest or on a desert island,I'd definitely take this book. Aside from some contrived parts,it was marvelous! Buy it from Amazon! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I loved this novel as a child, and my students love it today! I wish I could go into the wilderness with Sam and Bando. I would move into that tree in a heartbeat!

Another one of those nature books where some kid runs into the woods and tries to live. Whoopee Ding! Big Deal! But when I read only the first page, I was already completely drawn into the book, and I couldn't put it down. I recommend it to people of all ages. It's one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"My side of the mountain","review":"I think that &quot;My Side Of The Mountain&quot; is the perfect book for children who love to read about adventures, and even try out their own adventures!
