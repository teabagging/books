Slow, plodding, awful dialog."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King is an excellent writer, but this book stinks. Although his stamp of excellence occasionally peeks out from its pages, the story fails. Here's why:1) There is no clear point or plot. Every few pages throughout the book I asked myself, \\"Why in the hell am I reading this?\\" Had the book been written by a no-name author, and not marketed as a \\"#1 Bestseller,\\" I would have put it down after three pages. Maybe two.2) The characters are undefined. I had no picture of who they are, what their personalities are, what motivates them, and half the time what their names even are.3) The world Stephen King has created is all over the place. Is it the future? Is it the past? Is it both? Is it an alternative reality? Is it the American southwest? In an alternative universe? I have no idea, even after finishing the book.4) I found Stephen King's perversity a turn-off. If it's weird, scatalogical, and sexually deviant, chances are Stephen King addresses it or hints at it here. I was hoping he would avoid that in this book; I was wrong.5) He often uses a peculiar, undefined vocabulary to define things the reader cannot know. And, by the end of the book, he never defines them. Thanks a lot! As if I'm going to wade through six more volumes of this crap to make sense of his fantasy world. (I know people say this series gets better, but he lost me.)6) The weird magic gets annoying, and is inconsistent. In some ways the book seems to be hyper-reality-based, and then suddenly there is magic, which throws everything for a frustrating loop.7) The whole book is vague. I would have preferred some sort of introduction to give the book a context. Something like (and I'm totally making this up here): \\"In the years after our modern world suffered an annihilating nuclear Holocaust, there remained, on a parallel version of our planet, a race of man . . .\\"I sense this was a practice book for Stephen King -- a tester by which he sharpened his novelistic teeth."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is all just filler because this new rating system is crap and I don't have that much to say about this product."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The preview of this only contained the forward by Mr. King. I decided to take a chance and bought it anyway. It was readable, and at best OK. But you could tell it was written when he was young. If it was $2.99, that would have been a better price, but the story itself seems to lack cohesiveness."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Well I read this book and it is a little bit confusuing. I had to reread and analize. Roland the Gunslinger is very interesrting, but it is hard to follow becuase so little is told to you. SK is great in bring to life all that is around and all that is happening to Roland. SK's fantacy reality is unmachthable in this book. His keeps you wonder what is going to happen and yet you have a little insight to what is going to happen but yet you are not sure if it is so. It has been compared to JRR Tolkiens Lord of the Rings.I dont think that there is not much to compare. SK makes his world as diferrent and not earth, witch we see when jake is moved to Rolands world after dieing on earth, and Tolkien's world is earth, or the begging of earth as we know it. As for the jorney both authors keep you on a steady but intense ride of what is going to happen next. Still SK leaves to many holes in Rolands past and he gives to much insight on people we dont even want to care about. As for King he does a great job on telling you just enough to keep you interrested on what going on and what going to happen. It is worth the read just so that you find out if the &quot;Gunslinger&quot; is going to acomplish his goal( to get the man in black) and to continue the jorney for the Dark Tower. The fantcy is great, yet King mixes it with reality and weaves it together beautifully. I dont think it is the best book of the series but it is by far an interresting read. Yes I reccomend it for you to read!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I love SK's writing, but I absolutely loathed this book. I forced myself through it to get to Book 2, but ended up disliking Book 1 so much that I threw it across the room when I was finished. I'll give Book 2 a decent shot, but if it's not significantly more engaging than The Gunslinger within a couple of hundred pages, then I'll probably throw it across the room and give up on the series. I wanted to love this book, or at least like it, but I didn't even find it tolerable. Wish me luck on the next book in the series (I'm reading Duma Key now to soothe my wounded book soul)!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I was listening to the Audio CD version and after about the 5th CD, I didn't care anymore.

Unfortunately, the sample chapter download for the Kindle is nothing but author forward, with no story included. I may buy the book anyway, but certainly not based on the sample.Unfortunately, I can't submit this review without actually rating the book, so I'm giving it a default of 3 stars. Please be aware that I have NOT read the book, yet, so this is not a real representation of the book itself."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Generally, when I read a book, I know who I am reading about, and am going from place to place in a logical and chronological sequence, with sufficient reason given whenever an unexpected timeshift occurs. Instead, I am given a character whom I know NOTHING about (his name isn't even given until midway through!), chasing someone for god-only-knows-what reason, going somewhere with no area description at all, and randomly switching time periods to somewhere and somewhen which, again, we know nothing about. How ANYONE is expected to be able to follow this is beyond comprehension."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is very fascinating. It's full of suspense and mysteries that will make you want to read more. I recommend this to older people there is some cursing and is fairly difficult to read because it jumps to different parts and mentions different characters. This book is one of the best I ever read. This book is about a future world with a desert wanderer called the Gunslinger. This book didn't teach me anything but it gave me a bigger imagination and made me think creatively. Stephen King did a good job writing this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is very fascinating.

The universe mirrors our own in many ways, but in others is so completely different. Little is explained this early on, so uncertainty and confusion are quite prominent. However, it is a very well written book, and has a good pace. It picks up toward the end, and it holds a wonderful and eerie dream-like quality, making the reading of it seem just as if you were asleep. The ending is better than the beginning, but i think that is probably only just because, as we get more familiar with the world and the characters, it becomes easier to fathom out.I am quite looking forward to the next novel in the series, if just to get a few explanations, and to see where he is taking Roland the Gunslinger next."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've been a fan of King's work for quite some time now. I bought 'The Dark Tower' when I was younger. I started it, and could not get into it. I recently picked it back up, and tried again. I'm glad I did.This book drops you right into a fantastic world that has some faded similarities to our own world. And in other ways, this world is completely alien. King does a few refreshing things here. For one, the world has not 'ended' or 'died.' The world of the gunslinger has 'moved on' and left humanity behind.Its an oft-repeated phrase throughout this novel, and the novels that follow. The gunslinger is the last survivor of the last civilized culture, which has since perished, along with the gunslinger's friends and family.Despite how cliche that might sound, the character of the gunslinger is intriguing. He's a deeply conflicted character: deadly purpose incarnate, but with honor. He seeks The Dark Tower, in a world that has 'moved on' - and nothing will stop him.The ending of the novel is really just the beginning of this tale, and for readers who aren't in it for the long haul, it may be disappointing.It just made me want to get on to the next novel. I read the first three of this series in 2 weeks; ravenously devouring one after another. Now I'm anxious to start the fourth book. I highly recommend this book, and those that follow."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger by Stephen King is a great book. It has everything that you would expect from this exceptional author. It has horror, suspense, violence, and relationships. There is a great balance between action and suspense, with just the right amount of filler and details between action sequences. It even has the epic struggle between good and evil that has become so important in most Stephen King books. In my opinion, it it the best Stephen king book I have ever read and I'm looking foreward to reading the other books in The Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book has been out for years, and even if I had never read it I would love it if I read it today. This is the book that started my enjoyment of reading. I read this book when it first came out in paperback, and it was so enjoyable that I became a true 'reader.' Even if you don't like some of the King books that have came out lately, this one will not let you down."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Awesome start to the Darktower series, here we learn about Roland- the last gunslinger, learn a little of his past and get a glimpse into a dusty, dying world where time is skewed-different from our own, but what also seems connected to our own. We meet Jake, who is thrust into Rolands world from our world by the man in black, and learn of beings much more powerful than the man in black. Roland is shown a vision of his world and universe, and the possibility of infinite universes, his own place in time and space, and learns how his own world is dying. Its a mix of sci-fi, fantasy, and western with a touch of-or even underlying- romanticism."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is a carnivorous style of writing mixed in with a well-developed character driven story. I really loved this book. It's action was fast and well thought out. Meaning it wasn't just a &quot;shoot and kill&quot; type of story. King's characters seem to move with million of calculations in each step.Although some of the characters are a little out of place, they go along with the contrast the entire has with itself.Also, the back stories will keep you guled to the rest of the Darktower series. There are a lot of great twists and turns. I highly recommened this novel."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I loved this book. I originaly started with the fourth volume of this series (it was a gift from my dad, and he hadn't noticed that it was a series until I told him...) and I instantly fell in love with Roland's dying world. Since I couldn't understand much of the story, I decided to start it from the begining. I wanted to know more about Roland of Gilead and his group of companions... I found the first novel a bit dry at the begining (very understandable), but it got easier to read once I got started. I litteraly devoured it (I usualy don't read fast) and finished it within a week, which is a record for me. I just love the way King describes this cruel, dying and magical world in such a crude and beautiful way. I didn't learn much about the gunsligner's quest, but I SO wanted to read the other two books, and definitely re-read the fourth. I recommend this book, and this series, to anyone who isn't scared of falling in love with loneliness, fear, death, and their beauty."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I don't like Stephen King's novels. I find them dull, wordy and they are some of the only books I can't finish. Then I came across The Gunslinger. It is a book of magic, of another world, of pure and unadulteraded genius. This is the series Stephen King was born to write. From the first sentence you are drawn into the world of the Gunslinger. And you don't escape until you reach the end of the book. I couldn't put this book down and when I finished I read it all over again. I'm not going to go into a long description of the book, I wouldn't do it justice. You have to read this one for yourself. Enter the world of imagination, and from what I gather if you are a King fan, you may recognise some of the characters. The only critisism I have is when is the author going to give us the next book in the series?? I can't wait."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"If you thought Stephen King was only about horror then you my fellow readers were wrong. Stephen King has created a whole new world of adventure, love, terror and impossibilities from his own imagination. In the beginning Roland, the last Gunslinger, is chasing a man named Walter across a desert. During his chase he meets a boy named Jake from New York. Jake was sent to this world by dying in his own. Over a period of time Roland grows fond of Jake. And Jake like wise grows fond of Roland. But Roland is so obsessed with the Dark Tower that he would rather Jake die than loose the trail of the man named Walter. In the end Roland finally catches up with Walter and learns about his future from him. A future that looks rather promising."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have read every Stephen King book but 3 and those are next. This is one of the worst. It took me a year to plod through this short book. That being said, by the time I finished I could not wait to pick up the next one in the series. I think of it this way, it was like the first chapter in a book of normal length. I'm about to start the last book in this series and just can't wait. To everyone out there who may have just read the first and gave up, DON'T. Keep reading."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is really not meant to stand alone. If you read just this book, you will probably not like it very much. It's rather slow moving and has a very unsatisfying conclusion. However, pair it with the second book in the series and you will probably think that Stephen King is a genius. So I give it 5 stars, not because it earns them by itself, but because the overall series is worth 5 stars and this is but a part of it (though for what it's worth, the rest of the books are easily 5 stars on their own). So if you pick this up, be sure to plan on reading the second as well. If you don't enjoy that one, then the series isn't for you and you can stop."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"In a world part fantasy and part old western that is at some points a mirror to our own, a gunslinger named Roland is on the pursuit of the man in black. Roland is the last gunslinger and survivor of humanity in a world that people say has \\"moved on\\".Roland travels in the West, chasing the man in black, who you discover is a great sorcerer. The only clues leading to the man in black on the flat, dry hardpan of the desert are the leftover ideograms of his fires. Roland continually feels that he is getting closer to the man in black, but he also feels that the man in black is aware he is being followed and is leaving traps for him.Roland finds his way to a man named Brown who befriends him and allows him to refill his supplies. While talking, Brown learns of Roland's visit in the previous town Tull. He finds out that Roland saw a strange man, who before his visit, had died and had been brought back to life by the man in black. Brown also discovers that Roland met a girl named Anne, and got in a relationship that almost delayed his pursuit of the man in black. Brown is shocked to hear that Roland was led into one of the man in black's traps and was forced to kill an entire town of crazed people, including Anne.After walking across the desert for 16 days, Roland meets and befriends a boy named Jake who is living in an abandoned way station. They both must find the man in black as they continue to the other side of the mountains, where you will discover why Roland is following him. Roland will have to make many decisions regarding his friend Jake in order to continue his journey.I would recommend The Gunslinger to anyone who enjoys fantasy adventure books due to the interesting although complicated plot I found. The book is perfectly structured, and the characters are well built and nearly unforgettable. The words that Steven King uses are so powerful that they can paint a picture in your mind and make you feel like you are a part of the book. I believe that this book is so fascinating that not only will you jump to the rest of the books in The Dark Tower series, but you may also read The Gunslinger once again."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Sorry, I don't know how to be clever with this one. It's been a long time since a book this exceptionally well-written has made me this unexpectedly angry.First of all,1. Every character of any importance in this book is male. Normally, I wouldn't mind that in the slightest - it hasn't stopped me from loving The Hobbit or Tintin or any of the other boys'-adventure classics.It's just that,2. Every woman in this book is defined by sex. From poor world-weary Allie, whom the gunslinger graciously consents to bed in spite of her appearance, to the supremely disgusting preacher woman, to the hostler's lusty daughter and even the gunslinger's own mother, there's not a lady in sight who manages to escape being someone's sex object. Hell, you can't even shoot one without her falling dead in a \\"whorish sprawl.\\"(And yeah, I get it. Tull is a town full of grotesques. But it stinks to have such a magnificent variety of broken men - the drug-addled barfly, the greasy unctuous hostler, the twitchy piano player - and nothing for the women but subtle gradations of 'slut'.)Still,3. The worldbuilding is *fantastic.* I turn a shade of scintillating emerald green every time I think about it. Crafting an original, interesting, believable world, making it feel at once \\"familiar and strange\\", and weaving its peculiar words and customs and vistas into the story without bogging down the action or keeping the reader's thumb constantly on a back-page glossary... is a terrifically hard trifecta to hit. I am so much in awe.Furthermore,4. The man can *write*.\\"Her voice cut through the babble like a dull ax through a calf's brain.\\"\\"The wind moaned, a witch with cancer in her belly.\\"\\"'Go slow,' a dragging, clotted voice said.\\"I would take a pair of pliers to my own anatomy to write sentences like these. The way King can hotwire the English language, often using nothing but simple sentences and sixth-grade vocabulary, makes my toes curl.However,5. The ending totally wrecked my will to continue. When your good(ish) guy finally gets his chance to stand up to Vast, Unfathomable Evil and plug it right between the eyes, and basically gets told, \\"oh, sorry - you don't have enough XP for that. Why don't you level up, maybe collect a few motley companions, and try again a few books down the road\\" ... then I'm pretty much done.I know that this is an adventure on an epic scale - the magnum opus of one of the biggest names in the business - and that I'm going to miss out on some truly wonderful stuff if I don't hit Continue. I just don't feel like collecting plot coupons, being waterboarded in wet panties, or investing a bunch more reading-hours in a series that doesn't need my help or approval in order to enjoy its fantastic (and truly well-earned) success."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"King drew me right into the story from the start.

The Gunslinger is the first in The Dark Tower series (8 books total), and it's a story as Un-Stephen King'ish as it gets. A lone shooter, The Gunslinger, traverses his In-world in the search of the man in black and, ultimately, The Dark Tower, through a dreamlike mirror of our existence, complete with references to modern day like Beatles' Hey Jude or Joyce's Ulysses, yet utterly different.I started reading the series at the urging of my boyfriend, and couldn't put the book down (on book 2 now). The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that at some point closer to the end of the book I got upset. All of a sudden the whole quest seemed no more then a boy's play, with men at large being obsessed over a search for manhood. I wanted to yell, please, what about strong women hero characters? But that's just me, don't listen to me. Read it. It's brilliant."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This series has been on my TBR list since I was a teenager! I own multiple copies of the books in the series: Bound copies on my shelves, Kindle copies, and also audiobooks. Yet, I have never read them! I have finally taken the plunge into the series, and it was not at all what I expected! I was hoping for the \\"creep factor\\" that I have experienced in other King novels, but it was missing here.In the first installment of The Dark Tower series, we are introduced to Roland Deschain, a Gunslinger whose sole purpose is to meet up with The Man In Black. In his journey along the way, he meets up with a boy named Jake and takes him under his wing.Parts of the book really dragged for me and, even though I finished book, I still feel a bit lost! I will continue on with the series and hope that I get hooked with the next one. This is definitely my least favourite King book, and I much prefer his horror books to this fantasy series so far. However, I am trying to be optimistic that the series will pick up given its popularity. I like the whole good versus evil vibe, and I am hoping that I won't be disappointed!This is my first narration by George Guidall, and his voice was a nice choice for the book. However, his reading does tend to speed up during the more exciting scenes, and I actually had to put my iPod on speed to follow along at a regular pace.MY RATING: 2 stars!!

The Gunslinger, the first in the series, pales in comparison to, but is a good indicator of, the quest a reader is embarking on when choosing to read the series. While most would agree that this is one of the weaker volumes in the series, it is a great start and sets up the story to come. Definitely read this book. If you like it, continue on, but if you don't like it, do not judge the entire series based on this one. At least read the next book to make your decision on whether or not to continue with the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I will start out saying that this is my third time attempting to read the Dark Tower Series. The first time I picked up this slim volume was probably in 10th grade. It was a little over my head at the time but I really enjoyed the way it was written. That first time, I don't think I made it more than 100 pages into The Drawing of the Three and my Dark Tower introduction ended there.The second time was when I was broke and interning in New York City and I needed something to occupy all the time I was forced to spend in the apartment due to lack of funds. I picked this up again and got so much more out of it (this time reading it as a sophomore at Bennington College). This time, I made it all the way through the Waste Lands but never picked up Wizard and Glass.Finally, I made it to the third time which I just finished this week - in less than three days. Something about it this time really enraptured me. I could have finished it in one day but something felt good about slowing down the pace a little bit. In his new introduction, King wrote that the way this book was written felt very different than the rest of the series. This is actually what drew me in the most. I have never been an avid fan of Stephen King. I had read a few books like 'salem's Lot and From a Buick 8 but never really cared for him too much. I don't know what has drawn me in to this series so much but it really is amazing. I love the dark, plodding action that this first volume details.From everything I have read on Stephen King's other works, he is know for being very verbose. Even though this book is comparatively short when looked at versus his catalog of work, there is something to be said about the sparse way he brings us into Roland's world. Any writer can throw a million descriptions out to give the reader an idea of what is going on. What is so interesting is how King works with negative space in this novel. It is almost more about the lack of description rather than what is actually being said. Without a lot to go on, this creates an amazing fantasy world that is bleak, empty and apocalyptic without creating any cliche image of what this would look like. It is left up to the reader in a lot of respects.There is so much to be said about this wonderful book and a lot of it has already been said. All I can say is that the third time really is the charm. I will definitely finish the series this time. The story has drawn me in so much now that I can't imagine NOT finishing it. I have already finished The Drawing of the Three (again in less than three days) and can't wait to start The Waste Lands again. There is a reason why so many people are drawn to this series. What's great is that everyone has their own reason. So go ahead - find your own reasons why you never want to stop reading about Roland's quest for the Tower."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"possibly the best and most rediculous book ive ever read. When you finally realize this is going to make no sense and go with it its amazing. I have since gone on to read all 7 books and plan to start over again. I refuse to give away any plot or details"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Admittedly, I felt lost on several occasions while reading this, the first book in the Dark Tower series. For me at least, that was most of the fun. Trying to figure out what this world of Roland Deshain's is, what happened that made it this way, and what the hell is the Dark Tower and this elusive Man in Black? There are some great moments in this story that shed some light on the proceedings, but just enough to wet your appetite. The last several pages alone were worth the read in my opinion. This novel/series may not be for everyone, and to those that have tried to get through this book and have stopped for one reason or another, the writing definitely takes a turn for the better in the subsequent books. Give the Dark Tower and The Gunslinger a try, you won't be disappointed, but if you are, then I apologize."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have not read any of the other books in the series but after reading this first volume, I hunger for more. The story's beginning drags on at an almost agonizing pace, testing the reader and revealing few clues concerning the import of Roland's quest. His meeting with the dweller and foray into Tull cement mid-world's morbid atmosphere and Roland's grit but leave the reader grasping for context. Yet, as the narrative and Roland's backstory unfolds I was drawn into the mythology. I agree with other reviewers that Jake was a flat character and indeed his last lines belie a complexity he had previously failed to embody. But for their patience, readers are rewarded with a satisfying dialogue between the gunslinger and the man in black with the tease of even greater truths to come (for who knows how many lies MIB had woven with truth). My favorite reviews reveal little but give a taste of what the reader should expect. My advice, read on."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"(MINOR SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.)I decided that I needed some good literature to wash the bad taste left by the last series I read out of my pallet, so I recently picked up The Dark Tower series by Stephen King, all seven books. This book, \\"The Gunslinger\\" is the introductionary first novel that starts the epic of the Dark Tower.The Gunslinger is set in a world that is part post-apocalypic, part fantasy, and part western. It chronicles the journey of the mysterious gunslinger, Roland of Gilead, as he follows the Man in Black across a desolate wasteland.The best thing about this series is the worldbuilding. I very much liked the way the wasteland was developed and shown, and the touches of culture, and the metaphysical aspects of it. The universe(or multiverse, rather) that the Dark Tower exists in(which in turn connects to the rest of King's stories and universes) isn't seen until the final section, when Roland finally catches up to the Man in Black, though it's definitely worth it to come that far.The Gunslinger is well written, well developed, has some very good dialogue(especially between the Gunslinger and the Man in Black), a nice premise, a high level of originality, and a good story behind it. The book is almost as much about Roland's past as it is about the ongoing journey, and there are quite a few sections devoted to flashbacks and memories along the way.Not to say the book isn't without its flaws, however. If there is anything in the book I honestly didn't like, it was Jake. He was a completely flat character who couldn't have been more boring if he was intentionally written that way, and the only interesting thing about him was the implication that his presence in the Gunslinger's world means.(People from other worlds can enter this one.) Thankfully, he doesn't stay around for long. I don't think I've been so glad at the removal of a character from a story so much since I read Terry Goodkind's \\"Temple of the Winds.\\"I also felt that was sometimes an unnecessary level of enforced mystery and ambiguity. Not mystery the way you see something unexplained and it's left unanswered until later, but the kind where the characters sometimes ignore what a normal person would talk about and avoid discussing what plainly needs discussing for the sake of ambiguity. Again, the story is helped with this problem now that Jake is out of the picture.The Gunslinger is a good first novel in The Dark Tower series and a solid read, though the presence of Jake and a few other problems will require a bit of patience. The second book is where the series really gets off, and is definitely worth getting to."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The beginning of one of the best series ever! This was a gift for my father. I love all of the dark tower books!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Definitely an interesting piece by King. It's nice to see something outside of the horror genre that still holds glimpses into that horrific, twisted, wonderful mind of his :) I found the story a bit hard to follow at first and actually felt quite disoriented going into even the final quarter of the book. The imagery is amazing as always with King, but I found it hard to care about the characters in this book (which may be due to the main character's own detachment from them) but found at the end of this book that I definitely needed to follow the story line into the next book. I think if the ending hadn't been filled with so many questions that I may not have continued. Hopefully the following books will be of the 4 and 5 star variety."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've read several of Stehen King's books, I think the Gunslinger is a very easy read, you can finish it in one afternoon. The story is not overly complicated, but it keeps you turning the page. I don't like giving plot \\"spoilers\\" I'll just say the reader follows a man on a mission of revenge, and Stephen King sure knows how to create a \\"moody\\" setting, this book gives you the \\"chills\\" in a sense because it's a dark post-apocalyptic type world where the reader can constantly feel the tension! I haven't read the entire saga that follows but this book has whetted my appetite and I may read the whole saga."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"After having completed all of Stephen Kings \\"horror\\" books I moved on to other horror authers such as Dean Koontz and Richard Laymon without giving a second thought about reading the Dark tower series as the fact that it was more fantasy than horror did not appeal to me at all. I had bought this book (but none of the others from the series) a couple of years ago but only read abot 20 pages before giving up.Last week, missing Stephen King books but not yet ready to re-read any of them, I picked up this book and thought I'd give it a chance since it was only 238 pages.At first I struggled and wondered if it was going anywhere, but after about sixty pages this book really picks up and I found myself unable to put it down, especially after the introduction of the boy, Jake.(And finding out how Jake got to be in the Gunsligners' world was one of the biggest surprizes i have ever gotten from reading a book - It was fantastic!)There isn't much of a storyline to this book as it was written as sort of a prologue to the Dark Tower series. The storyline is simply that a man know as the Gunslinger (who lives in a similar yet different world to our own) is travelling through the desert in search of someone - or something - he calls The Man In Black.Many other reviewers have said that they found this book dull but went on to really enjoy the rest of the books in the series so if you find this book hard-going please bear with it and try the next book in the series, The Drawing Of The Three, which I am currently reading and is even better than the first.I probably would have given this book five starts but I was so gutted when one of the charactors died (I wont spoil it by saying who) that I had to only give it 4 stars.If, like me, you are a fan of King's horror novels but are not sure about his other work, please give this series a try, you wont regret it!."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I heard about this for so long from friends, finally reading it. The book starts slower than I thought it would and there's not as much action as I hoped. The main action is the shootout. It's mostly about a quest for now, so that's why I recommend to those who like books involving quests. I have the second book to start, hoping it's better."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Though partially inspired by Robert Browning's poem, \\"Childe Roland\\"--, and the fact that the story has been alive for 20+yrs in the author's mind is a testament of the power that the story held over the author.There has always been a feeling that \\"The Gunslinger,\\" at under 300 pages, is just right to introduce us to the world of The Dark Tower and Roland as the last Gunslinger. He is a likeable, realistic character who shares a wide range of feelings and reflections that will make you wonder if you should love and hate him.The Gunslinger is an easy to read and just hints at the history, tragedies and issues of Roland's life. His search through the barren wasteland in search of the elusive Man in Black shows through flashbacks a small inkling of the real complexity of the series to come. The incredible realism of the characters in this strange world is fascinating. The book is a true joy for all fans of magic, horror, quest and westerns. Roland appears to be a complex mix of individuals including man in Clint Eastwood's \\"Man With No Name\\" type westerns.It's difficult to find a fantasy that can really make you sit back and think. This series has great characters, a fairly fast paced story, one of the most original worlds since Tolkien and of course is beautifully put together by Stephen King. He creates a universe, that slowly but surely was connected to most of his other books. It is amazing how all the bits and pieces of the other books fit into the Dark Tower series and you think \`Yeah that's how it should fit together.'This whole series of books rank among my favourites and now that they are on my Kindle I have reread them again for about the 10th time. I'm sure if you read the 1st book The Gunslinger you will be hooked... whether you are a Stephen King fan or not."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King is one of those authors I've loved since I was a young teen (I even visited his house during one summer vacation.) However, being a young teen with a short attention span - and King having the tendency to pen some rather thick tomes - I never finished any King novel I started. Pet Cemetery; Gerald's Game; It. I even wrote an 11 page book report on Cujo my freshman year... having not read the entire thing. So King and I go way back, sorta. We've shared some good, albeit truncated, times.Well, I have finally got around to finishing my first King novel; the trick was apparently that I needed an audio book. The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland Deschain, the titular Gunslinger, as he traverses a barren desert in search of Man in Black, a shrouded and intriguing antagonist with God-like abilities to possess the minds of people and even raise the dead. Along the way, Roland meets a young boy, Jake Chambers, whose strange past causes Roland to think heavily about the world he lives in, and whose companionship is just another woeful test set forth by the torturous Man in Black.The Gunslinger is a somewhat disjointed narrative - a Fear-and-Loathing-esque head-trip - one that jumps from present to flashback to alternated reality. But for me this form does a good job at putting us in Roland's own disoriented mind. King's description are spot on without being insensate wordy and his characterization is excellent. All in all I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed my trek through Mid-World, and narrator George Guidall was a fitting and entertaining companion. I look forward to continuing the journey."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"A must read! Excellent start to the series that leaves you wanting more. Roland's journey already well on it's way in this first book that leaves you wanting to know the rest of his tale."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I remember picking this book up the first time when I was 12 and being scared by the opening scene. Who was the man in black? And why did Clint Eastwood want to catch him?I waited years in between books as King decided if he wanted to finish the series. Unfortunately he got into that car accident and decided to rush the last three books which gave the series a whiplash finish.But to be sure, the first 4 books in this series are amazing and could stand up to any other epic book series. But this book has a feel different than the others. This one is raw, real and filled with the love of a young Stephen King who just wanted to create his own world."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Many people have heard of The Dark Tower. I am currently reading the series, and I will publish a review for each book as I read them. This is the first book in the long series, and it really makes me hungry for more. Warning: this review will have spoilers.The Good: The characters are realistic and belivable. Roland really does feel guilt for his actions. He makes some really hard choices in this book, like having to sacrifice Jake in order to get to the Man in Black. Several questions are raised: how much does Roland really want to give up if it means getting to the Dark Tower? There are some very suspenseful scenes (my favorite was the chapter with the Slow Mutants) and some sad ones (having to kill his girlfriend to spare her a miserable life, sacrificing Jake, etc.). The Man in Black hightens the suspense when he propechies Roland's future.The Bad: Nothing was bad about this book!In short, this novel was awesome, and I cannot wait to buy the next few books in the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Over the past 6 months I have been reading Stephen King's Dark Tower series, today I have finally finished his last book of the series; and, it did not dissapoint. I am already missing reading about Roland and his epic quest to see the dark tower, King managed to keep me hooked in the whole way and rarely was there dull moment. The first book in the series 'The Gunslinger', was a nice and short entry into the beginning of Roland's quest, leaving me desperately wanting more. This book came highly recommended to me by a friend and now I am highly recommending it to any one reading this review."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"From what I've read he writes without a plan so everything becomes like a road movie, some sections about as exciting as driving. I took my bike up to a mine the other day and it was about as exciting, but then I had the fresh air and the actual thrill of being in a remote area where miners once worked. The ending was cool and I have the next one on hand to read at some point. Maybe I should hold my judgement."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've read this book many times and will never get tired of it. This was my first time listening to the audiobook though and it was almost better than reading it on my own. Actually hearing the demands of this destitute world being placed upon Roland's shoulders was quite intense.King did an amazing job in creating this world. Most novels/series that go back and forth between our world and the created world focus mainly on the here and now. King focuses on his world and brings in aspects of ours. It's refreshing to see things switched up a bit.If you don't know me, I should probably tell you now that Stephen King has and always will be my favorite author. The first novel I ever read was The Stand when I was seven and haven't looked back since. It's intriguing how that book actually ties into this series and so many other books of his.And with that, I'd like to say 'thankee sai' for writing your books for so many years and keeping me entertained!Also, if you really enjoy Stephen King's work and really liked this book too, check out the graphic novels. They are quite impressive...Courtney ConantAuthor ofThe Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra (Volume 1))"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I had been looking for a new series for quite awhile. I have to say I quite like this series so far.It is a little slow moving at first, but I am told that it picks up speed greatly as the series increases.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Stephen King or just likes fantasy in general. It has undertones of horror, which makes it even more rich.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As much as I like horror, I've never read King's The Dark Tower series, so I thought it was time to start. The series begins with The Gunslinger, a book that takes place in a nightmarish-post-apocalypticish-wild-Westish setting in which a gunslinger named Roland is following a mysterious figure known only as the man in black--with passing references to a dark tower. At first I was irked by being thrown into the tale without a full understanding of what was happening. It slowed my interest initially, as I had to piece together bits from the present as well as Roland's recollections of his past. But as the tale progressed, I came to enjoy discovering the elements of Roland's world, and when the book ended, I ran to my keyboard to order Book Two.What I enjoyed most was the balance between mystery and fatalism. It seems that characters know--if only subconsciously--what is to come and what has come before. Along his journey, Roland encounters (among other things) a boy named Jake. He and Jake travel together, though they both sense that Jake will end up being sacrificed in the end. There is also the suggestion that the man in black, while somewhat elusive, is making sure Roland catches him. Jake makes references to things he doesn't quite understand, things like movies and subways from a time before the world moved on (and this, despite the fact that he also makes references to having already died in such a world).The last chapter makes up for any confusing scenes in the beginning, insight coming like fireworks even as more mystery develops. I won't give away much--only to say that the dark tower sought by the gunslinger is the crux of it all, and it's something he doesn't find in Book One. The ending definitely leaves the reading longing for the next book in the series (so watch this space for an upcoming review!).Finally, as an English teacher and writer, I enjoyed King's Afterward, in which he reveals some of the history behind his writing of the novel, including the fact that he was inspired by Robert Browning's poem \\"Childe Roland.\\""},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I had read this book years ago but wanted to reread it prior to reading the rest of the series. A truly enjoyable story where you really don't know what's going to happen next. Not what I expected from a Stephen King book, but that's what makes him a great writer; the unexpected."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Just finished this one and bought Book II immediately. This is a book that opens lots of threads that I expect will be resolved over the rest of the books in the series. Despite all the threads this book opens, it holds together well as a novel and is a compelling read. Stephen King is a wonderful story teller and this book is no exception. It feels like the Series will build into something really special, but for me, it's early days in the series and we'll see how we go..."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Can't wait for more. i read it in one day, on to the next. i i i i i i"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"One wonders at what point in this narrative King determined to expand his tale. it appears early on as though headed for a traditional conclusion but somewhere towards center one senses a slowing, literary palaver."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Being a constant Stephen King fan, I have not really paid much attention to this series over the years. But decided when I got the Kindle to jump in. It seems to be quite a story, fasinating, scary, and even thought provoking. I am very happy with this book and have started the next. But I know that Stepehn King will not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Started reading it, back when first book was released, and thought it was trash. What a fool I was.... Into 3'rd book of the series, and it is absolutely wonderous."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger was unlike anything that I had read before. I had gone into it with high hopes because I have heard great things about the entire series from numerous people whose opinions I trust. I was... confused upon reading it. The pacing throughout the entire books is askew and seems to have no rhyme or reason to it. It starts off interesting, becomes a bit tedious, goes back to a quick pace, slows down again, etc.Parts of Roland's story, such as his past, were very interesting and the only thing that kept me hooked on the story. But, there are only so many times I can hear about his traveling the baron lands and nothing happening. It honestly seems like parts of the book were written by two different people because of how poorly they mesh. King is a great story teller, that can't be doubted. But for some parts of this book he completely swung and missed.By the end of the book I was unsure whether or not I wanted to continue to the next book in the series. I wasn't in any danger of not finishing the book, but then again that is almost never a problem for me because I just like to finish a book if I start it. The end though did leave off at a promising spot that I hope leads to a more solid series overall.There is plenty of intrigue in the premise of the story, and I have no doubt it can turn into something great. The trick will be to improve the narrative before putting the reader to sleep and having them miss those good parts.I'm leaving this with a 3/5, but I will continue on to the next book in the series still optimistic. I don't think everyone would have led me wrong, and King has been tested time and time again while proving to be a literary genius."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I had to make two attempts to read this book. The first time, I put it down about 50 pages in, bored. I decided it just wasn't for me. A decade later, after having so many people lambaste me for not having read this series, I tried again.I am so glad I did.This first book is just OK. It's a decent read. It isn't anywhere near King's best (and it shouldn't be, being so early in his career), but it is SO WORTH READING. This mediocre book starts you on one of the greatest literary journeys you will ever take. Get this book, power through it, and from there onward this entire series is 5-stars all the way!!Hile, Gunslinger!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Good start to what i hope will be a great series. Occasionally confusing but i expect that everything will be explained in 7 books!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Before describing my own feelings concerning this work, I must take issue with other reviewers. First, Scorpio: Not all of this book was written at the age of 19. In fact, as far as I know (correct me if I'm wrong), very little was written at the age of 19. I know that the opening was written then, and perhaps the plot was sketched out, but King wrote much of this during his writing of Salem's Lot and The Stand. Second, although I may be in the minority here, I did not find this to be a hard read at all. The first time through it, the book was a tad confusing, and I found myself flipping pages to check on what exactly had just happened. I do agree with the reviewer who described the book as \\"disjointed\\"; this is especially obvious during and around the Tull sceneI recently picked this book up and read it as a refresher before tackling book five and the later editions in the series; I was able to finish it in a very short amount of time. In fact, the book was over, it seemed to me, before it could really get started. Perhaps this is because of the length and detail contained in the other Dark Tower books.The Gunslinger must be viewed with respect to the other books in the series. Personally, I do not believe that King could have introduced the series better. King creates an excellent and grabbing set of characters and setting; the lack of details we have concerning these characters (i.e., we don't know Roland's name until more than halfway into the book) and Roland's quest makes us want to read more and discover the rest of Roland's world. It is true that later editions of the series are more action-filled or give us more information; this does not, however, make Gunslinger any less interesting.As an aside to Mr. Nejad, who said that it was sad to see Roland go at the end of the epic, \\"WHY?\\" I am praying that you mean it was sad to not be able to read any more about Roland, NOT that Roland does not survive the epic. I despise people that give spoiler reviews; people who read these reviews are people who HAVEN'T READ IT YET; why ruin the entire epic for them?"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I just want to say that I am so glad that I read this novel while I was a teenager. I must've been around 14 or 15 when I first picked this up. First reaction: total absorbtion. I absolutely LOST myself into this book for about two weeks. Incredible- I lost myself in this book in much the same way that I got lost in music (Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation, for example) later on.This is perfect reading for young adolescent males. It is a complete exploration of the mentality and spirtuality of a &quot;lone wolf&quot; male fighting against a world that has long since gone to hell. Most teenage males are by definition &quot;lone wolves.&quot; At least I was in the early 90's, maybe all that has changed. I hesitate to proclaim Roland a role model. However there is no doubt in my mind that his image gave me an idea of how a man may act when in dire straights."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"In NEEDFUL THINGS, Stephen King decided to end an era by making this book the last of the Castle Rock series. In the last decade of so, he has focused on a new series called The Dark Tower. Most of his latest novels have had some sort of crossover with the Dark Tower (HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, which is available in paperback). His latest novel is BLACK HOUSE that is a collaboration with Peter Straub. Mr. King let it know that some Dark Tower questions would be revealed in that book so I decided to reread The Dark Tower again by starting with THE GUNSLINGER.This novel tells the story of the last of the gunslingers, a group of warriors similar to the Jedi knights in Star Wars. He is a man with a mission and it is the search of the elusive Man in Black. This story is similar to the errant knights stories (i.e. Don Quixote, El Cid, among others) from centuries ago. Our hero will walk in search of the Man in Black, going through old towns seeking help and will also meet Jake, a boy from the planet Earth. This is the beginning of the series and just like any beginning the reader will be left with questions. The main problem that I had was that I read this book about 15 years ago and I forgot a lot of details. I might try to read the series again before I tackle BLACK HOUSE. It might help me appreciate the novel even better."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger is the best book I have ever read, period.

I'm somewhere in the middle of those two, not knowing what to think after reading this book. King does a nice job of creating a different kind of world in which Roland interacts with people, and does his best to keep the reader hooked. King throws in some actions sequences (see The Slow Mutants and when Roland leaves the town of Tull) to keep the book interesting for readers. But The Gunslinger doesn't seem to have a purpose or reason. Sure, we know that the main objective of the books is for Roland to rach The Dark Tower. But King is writing mechanically along the way, spacing things out as if they needed to be. I haven't read any of the other novel in the series, and just because The Gunslingers didn't impress me, doesn't mean I won't continue on with the series. But even King himself says in the Afterwod that when he writes a Dark Tower novel, he is taken away, and is trying to figure out where and when and even how Roland will continue on his journey, and wherehe's come from in the first place. Because even though he writes in flashback scenes in The Gunslinger, we still don't know much about Cuthbert or Jamie or even who the heck Susan is and why she means so much to Roland. Maybe things will be explained later on in the other books. Maybe."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"An epic adveture through parallel worlds. Mind boggling action and suspense.

I had been reading all of his books with Randall Flagg in them to get some background. What you get here is a scattered, slow as molaaaassssessss story, that you have to force yourself to read. You are given bits and pieces of stories, with nothing explained. This story does NOT build to a climax, in fact, it doesn't build at all. The ending...supposedly a climax... seemed very hokey to me (but lets face it steven king has been known to let you down after a great book with a cheezy ending. I finally picked up the second and subsequent books (i waited so long b/c i didnt care for this one, and yes i am a HUGE stephen king fan)... and i was hooked. The sequels are great, and YES you must trudge through this book before you read the rest of them. This book is a necessarry introduction to the rest of the series.

My best guess is the Gunslinger lives in some world that is half reality half dream. I am thinking King was doing his fair share of hallucinogenic drugs while he was writing this book. But here is what I THINK is going on. Roland, the gunslinger, is in pursuit of the man in black, who can help him to find the Tower, his true goal. Along the way, he meets Jake, a young boy who becomes his travelling companion. And they run into various adventures, misadventures, dream-like sequences, and the reader gets to flashback to Roland's youth.The main problem with this book is I have no idea when or where it is taking place. I am hoping that this becomes clearer in the second installment, although seeing how I didn't like this one too much, it may take me a while to get to &quot;The Drawing of the Three.&quot; I have heard that perserverance in this series pays off.

I put it on the first book in hopes of catching some people before they start reading. Let me start by saying I found this series on a site detaling the \\"best 25 sci-fi/fantasy stories of all time\\" and I know there's no accounting for taste but this series is average at best and I can't imagine anyone putting it in even the \\"best 100\\". Each book is overly long (not meaning too many pages but too many pages for what is covered) and scenes are overly drawn out. I'm not going to go into specifics of the stories because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but the ending blows....hard and if you manage to make it that far you're going to wish you hadn't. If you're looking for good sci-fi/fantasy look elsewhere (I recommend Dune, The Chronicles of Amber, The Name of the Wind, The Darkover novels, The Farseer Novels, The Last Hearld Mage, pretty much anything but this series).

Then around the fifth or sixth book it starts going downhill.

So this is a review of this book and this book alone. I know a lot of you are saying that's not fair to the book, but I've always believed strongly that every book should stand, more or less, on its own. And this one does not.For the life of me, I can't figure out what's so appealing about these type of series. These stories tend not to be exceptionally complex, just exceptionally long, broken into minutia in order to stretch it out into six or seven novels. I guess I'm just not sophisticated enough. Or maybe I just get bored easily.Anyway, this book bored me. There were some interesting scenes and characters. But overall, it just seemed like King was wandering in his writing along with his hero. As for the Gunslinger, I found him one-dimensional and unlikable. I know he gets more background in the future books, but I shouldn't have to buy them in order to like him at least a little bit.There's no story here. Just the set up of a story. It could've been a hundred pages and not lost anything important. Did we really need all that wandering? Did we really have to go through that damn dark cave for so long? Roland did. But we're the readers. We get to cheat and skip to the more interesting stuff.The problem with books like this is that they drown us in details. I don't mind colorful phrases and poetic expression. But sometimes a desert is just a desert, a cave is just a cave. It's just too much.The worst sin though is that this book left me with absolutely no compulsion to read the next because it would only continue on to the third and the fourth and so on. I have a life. More importantly, I don't have enough time to dedicate all my reading time to one writer and one story. It's just asking too much.Anyway, a friend told me the ending of the saga, and I couldn't believe it. If I saw that in a B movie, I'd be annoyed. But for a writer of King's caliber to resort to such a trite, overused, and just plain uninspired conclusion is inexcusable. Even the writer himself agrees by his apology in the afterward.None of the above matters of course. If you love King, you'll love him. If you're on the fence, you could go either way. But I've said my piece. Go ahead and click that negative button now."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have this book and it's amazing. I paid it 2$ used. it's insane to sell only the file for 9$ . The book itself worths 5 stars, but please next time choose a fair price"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer: the sample is bad. It is all intro, no actual text from the story. How can I make a buying decision based on this?"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is not a good book. This is the first in the highly regarded \\"Dark Tower\\" series by Stephen King. It took me three attempts to get through it over the course of about 12 years. The book simply lacks any sort of momentum. Ostensibly telling the story of a gunslinger pursuing a Man in Black across the desert, the book reads like a series of short stories melded together awkwardly into a book, which indeed is what it is. As soon as the action gets going, it's interrupted by someone telling a flashback story, which in turn is occasionally halted while someone tells a flashback story within that flashback. And there's a reason why the characters, upon the conclusion of each story roll over and fall asleep. And I don't think I give anything away when I say the book concludes with the Universe Song from Monty Python's Meaning of Life.There are only brief glimpses of King's greatness in this book, which I think he acknowledges in the introduction. I hear the second novel in the series is much more highly recommended, so I'll eventually pick it up and give it a go, but for now, I really need to get out of this universe. It's giving me a headache."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I purchased this item to replace one I had lost. It is in paperback form, but is an expanded edition. This book is higher quality than your standard edition paperback and looks very nice on the bookshelf with the rest of the volumes. It is a great buy for a Stephen King fan."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King is a terrific writer, but The Gunslinger was a disappointment. Most of the book had just enough suspense to keep one reading, but it was boring and the ending was unsatisfying. Some events, such as the characters being attacked by the slow mutants, were put in simply for suspense; and had little to do with the plot."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"On the previous review page, I saw that many people enjoyed this book. All that I can think is that perhaps I missed something. I found this to be one of the most disappointing books that I have read in quite some time. The characters were uninteresting, the plot read like a re-hashed version of a bad futuristic sci-fi movie, and I never found myself caring for anything that King wrote about. The best way to summarise the plot would be to say that a man walks through a desert for 300 pages {\`it's hot, I'm thirsty, it's hot, I'm alone, etc. etc.} and then meets a man, falls asleep {which is what I kept doing throughout this book} and then . . . sequel? Eugh. Maybe this is all necessary for the rest of the series, but it's put me off them."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Roland of Gilead is the last of the gunslingers, a knightly order brought to ruin. He is implacably following \\"the man in black,\\" part of his quest to reach the Dark Tower. Roland is a man made of the toughest leather, but in this world of magic and demons, he will find that he will go to places he never wanted to go and do things that he never wanted to do.This is a fantastic fantasy book and an excellent beginning of the series. The milieu is quite fascinating, being a mix of the post-apocalypse genre and high-fantasy. Roland himself, the only really developed character in the story is quite interesting, reminiscent of the cowboy characters of yesteryear. The action is good, with demons and magic and danger interspersing with a realistic West.I really enjoyed this book, and cannot wait to go on to the next one in the series. If you like good fantasy, and want to read a really different one that is also really good, then get The Gunslinger!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Most writers would be blessed to have one masterpiece in their careers - Stephen King has two: The Stand and The Dark Tower series. Rereading TDT (for the third time!!) was like coming home to good friends. King created characters so rich and adventures so vivid that you simply can't let go after the series ends. I've found that people who normally don't like King LOVE this series. I think it's a joy ride, full of highs and lows, joy and sadness, fun and suspense...and characters you really care about. (If you like books on tape, Audible does a superb job with the audio version -- great for commuters!)"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"His shirt, the no-color of rain or dust, was open at the throat, with a rawhide thong dangling loosely in hand-punched eyelets. His hat was gone. \\" And so the reader is introduced to Stephen King's renowned Gunslinger Roland Deschain, the enigmatic wanderer and chaser of the man in black.I'd read much about King's rabidly adored (or hated) \\"Dark Tower\\" series and having just finished his fabulous \\"It\\", I was looking to continue the whole dark, deep and moody thing. The first in the series, \\"Darktower: The Gunslinger\\" certainly fit the bill...though not exactly what I expected, the book sets the tone for a deeply intricate and cheerless fantasy seemingly set in an apocalyptic old west.Readers must take it on faith that King is leading somewhere good with his epic series, because this first book provides no answers and very little clarity, while building a hugely labyrinthine world and an elaborate mythology. I find King's writing a bit clunkier than usual, and it contains an overwhelming amount of symbolism and vague foreshadowing that I can only assume comes to fruition later in the series...since very little of it did so in \\"Gunslinger\\".The read was enjoyable, but any reader should assume a commitment to continuing with the series in order to achiever a fulfilled experience. I was left wanting more, but I'm not sure if I feel that in a good way. &#9786;"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've read a great many Stephen King books over the course of my life, and been a huge fan of his writing. When I discovered this epic, something that was a blend of Stephen King's notorious horror writing and a fantasy world, I jumped on it.To put it lightly, I couldn't put this book down. It was shorter than I'm used to with King's books, but was a fantastic opening to what promised to be an epic series. This particular book deals with Roland and his journey through his broken world after the man in black. We get little glimpses of the conflict between these two, but never a clear idea of what exactly happened between them, or why Roland is chasing the man. All we know is an undying hatred between them.A small town, through a desert, under a mountain, and finally he catches the man. I wont tell you the rest. But I can say, Roland picks up a companion, Jake, a young boy who is taken from his home world and thrown into mid-world without any idea of what's going on. The bond forged between Roland and Jake is one that will break your heart, in the worst way.This is a must-read for anyone looking for a good fantasy read. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger was a pretty darn good novel that I found very difficult to put down. From the very first line, which I consider to be among the best in literature, King hooks his reader and begins the long task of reeling the reader in all of the way along the beam to the Dark Tower.The only way that this novel fails in any regard is that, from the beginning, this is obviously a set-up novel for much more to come and as such it feels at times (very few times, but there none-the-less) that King forces the story along at a hell-bent pace to get things moving on towards the next installment in the tale. I think that due to the pacing of the rest of the novel, that the end suffers a bit as it slows things down again and then goes a bit off track. The final confrontation, to me, was a bit disappointing, but things quickly move forward and we are left eagerly awaiting The Drawing of the Three.It's been a LONG time since I first read this novel and that was in it's original form. I don't really remember well enough to be able to tell what was added or changed, but for the most part, I think that the story was much more clear and concise and there was a lot less confusion than when I read it the first time. On the other hand, there were passages and events in the book that I remember as clearly as if I had read them yesterday, so the original version was extremely powerful in it's own right. The one thing that I missed while reading the revised and expanded editionwere the beautiful full-color illustrations. However, I have the original trade paperback version, so I could flip through from time to time and catch up on the artwork that I had missed. One last note on this edition, I found it odd that with all of the changes and edits that were made, there is still on character that is referred to by two names without really clarifying that it is indeed the same person. I guess Allie could be a nickname for Alice, but when the name Alice is introduced it's well after we've been dealing with the character and I thought that King was talking about a different character for a bit."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have read this first book of the series and frankly am not too sure why it has such a following. Fans of this series compare it to LOTR and to me they have nothing in common at all. I guess it just isn't my kind of story. The forward mentions movie The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and I do see a similarity there. Mainly in that the Good is maybe not so good, the Bad is maybe not so bad and the Ugly...well, yeah he is ugly. But in a way they are all ugly and all bad, with just a hint of some good thrown in. Some say it is the quest that they like, but after reading just one book, I can't see that the quest is that interesting. I don't know if I will read any more of this series or not. I give it 3 stars because for me this is an average book with an average story. Nothing great about it and I am not sure if I have ever read anything worse than this, maybe years ago when I had to read something for school."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Just to be clear from the start...The Gunslinger is one of my absolute favorite books, period. By Stephen King or any other author. That said, it's gotten the most mixed reactions of any King book that I recommend to other people. I don't know if it's the contrast between the expectations of what a King book is supposed to be and what he presents in The Gunslinger, but it's not universally loved. I guess fiction that fits mostly into the fantasy genre can have that effect, as it pushes the ability to suspend disbelief to its utmost limits. I've read this book over and over, more often than any other in the series, because of its raw intensity. King's youth and ambition shine through, driving the plot with relentless urgency. I was instantly hooked by the story's opening line, \\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\\" I didn't know who the man in black was, or who the gunslinger was, but I wanted to find out. And I wanted to know why the gunslinger was chasing this man, and if he would catch him, and what would happen if he did. I was drawn in immediately, and I've never stopped being fascinated by the Dark Tower series since.People have remarked to me that this book is slow, but I have trouble understanding that. During the course of the novel, Roland shoots and kills an entire town of people single-handedly. He confronts a speaking demon in a deserted way station where he finds a young boy from Earth, a boy who shocks and confuses the gunslinger with his tales of skyscrapers and automobiles. He takes mescaline, giving him the necessary head-trip to bed a demonic succubus and hear her prophecy. He fights off dreadful mutants in a pitch-black mountain tunnel, where he must let Jake fall to his death in order to catch the man in black. In addition to these harrowing scenes, Roland receives a mind-blowing vision once he finally catches his nemesis. The man in black sends him to the very edge of existence, where he passes through a barrier into an alien world linked to his own. He learns that the Dark Tower holds together an infinite number of worlds and universes, and is guarded by an evil being that would see it and all of existence fall into nothingness. After waking from this vision, he embarks on a quest to ascend the Tower and right all the wrongs of his fallen civilization. Like I said before, the Dark Tower story fascinates me, and it all begins here. King draws on his affinity for the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and the fantasy of J.R.R. Tolkien to create the beginning of the most imaginative and ambitious work of his career. Mixed reactions or not, I love this book, and I think it's one of the most thrilling King has ever written."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"There just isn't a suitable word to describe the masterpiece King has created. When I first picked up this book my mind was convinced this book would be an adventure of a lone wanderer to some mystical place. For the most part this is true but King played, what I would call, a double plot for this book. One of the plots is just that, a lone wanderer searching for a mystical place. The other plot is unique in the sense it is a plot for the reader: to discover the setting and background of the character. I do not want to give away the original setting King has created but I will say I was convinced it was just any old arid desert. As you read you will realize otherwise. King weaves this story with time frames such as those in the past events and the gunslinger's present journey. King has also mastered his ability to take a basic character and build upon an entire emotional and mental structure. He makes you understand the way the character thinks allowing the reader to predict his next words or perhaps no words. This novel had hardly any bland pages. Every event led to another and ever other was seemingly original. The end of this book can be a little much for the human mind but I do not want to discuss anymore to prevent giving away any surprises this book has in containment. This novel is a five star novel and one I absolutely recommend reading. This novel begins a journey that unravels into what I believe to be extraordinary series of novels: The Dark Tower."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Clocking in at under 300 pages, The Gunslinger is a very quick read that is absolutely stunning in its creativity, its depth, and its power to draw the reader deep in to the mysterious life of Roland Deschain. This is the first book of a seven book series entitled The Dark Tower and we find our reluctant hero a gunslinger perusing not only the Tower but the man in black. At first we know of no reason why, but Roland's enigmatic figure draws us to believe that we must support him.We come into his life after a single introductory page that reads \\"RESUMPTION\\" a word that would have more meaning if the entire series had been read. However, for the first time reader it is simply resuming his quest through the deserts while chasing down the man in black. It is obvious he had been doing this before and he would do so thereafter. The tale is not so much about the chase, but rather why the gunslinger is doing so. Two tales are told within the story that gives depth and meaning to the gunslinger's life while much stays in the dark for later books.The story itself is mesmerizing. Roland has a unique way of speaking, and King has a unique landscape to paint for us. The world has \\"moved on\\" in this unrealistic, realistic world. Things that are similar to our world are represented as being in the past in Roland's. The world is, therefore, not so fantastical as to be unbelievable. Even Roland's temporary boy companion talks of places, things, and people that the reader should be familiar with. This blending of reality with an unrealistic locale and culture simply enchants.The pages breeze by and the story is only party told, only glimpsed at in a glimmering of intricate moments. One can't stop at the first book, but must pursue the tale further. I'll set my watch and warrant by it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've been looking for a new series to get into for some time and overheard some of my co-workers discussing The Dark Tower series. Needless to say, this is not a new series by any means, but one that is getting popular again, due to the newest book being released early this week.The tale of the story is genius and incorporates many different themes, including western and parallel universe. There are also tons of metaphors which really make you think.Overall, it is a quick read and definitely makes you want to read the next!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The Gunslinger\\" is the first volume of Stephen King's epic, seven volume, \\"Dark Tower\\" saga, and like the first volume in any series of books, serves primarily to set the scene for the later books in the series. As a result, very little happens in this book. We are introduced to our hero, Roland of Gilead, the last gunslinger, who is a cross between Clint Eastwood in \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" and Aragorn from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and follows him across the desert, over mountains and through an abandoned subway tunnel, in his pursuit of \\"the man in black\\"; a pursuit which culminates in the commencement of his journey to the dark tower. However, very little is revealed in this book. By the end of the book, the reader is still not told exactly what the dark tower is and why Roland is traveling there. We have to wait for later volumes for this information.I am generally a fan of Stephen King's writing. I think he is one of the most underrated authors of all time. Nevertheless, the multi-part format of \\"The Dark Tower\\" books just doesn't work for me. I have never been a big fan of multi-part novels, since the fact that the story is drawn out of such a large number of pages annoys me and makes me want to stop reading, and \\"The Gunslinger\\" is no exception. It is unnecessarily slow moving and could have benefited from a bit of editing. Another down point to this book is that it is essentially comprised of five short stories that are run together to form the narrative, making the storyline episodic and somewhat disjoint.Overall, I didn't hate this book and I think the idea behind this series has enough potential to make me want to read volume 2 sometime in the future, but I suspect that point in time will be the distant future, rather than next week."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"When I read this book, I actually thought that it was written by \\"another\\" Stephen King....someone that was using Steve's name to capitalize on his popularity. After reading the series, I am amazed by how it all comes together."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger, by Stephen King, is the first novel in the Dark Tower fantasy series. It was originally published in five sections in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction from 1978 to 1981. King later revised The Gunslinger to remove contradictions with following books. This novel, a fantasy western, follows the gunslinger Roland in his quest of the man in black, with numerous flashbacks to Roland's past that give the reader information about his past, if not too much insight to his character (which comes primarily via his actions).The Gunslinger is highly stylized. It is filled to the brim with imagery, almost to the point of distraction for the reader. This gives the book a slower, deliberate pace and makes it reminiscent of a Sergio Leone/Clint Eastwood movie (which King acknowledges in his revised edition). All told, this is a fairly unique offering from the very versatile King, and is even stylistically unique among the books in this series. The original novel is more or less complete in itself; there is no cliffhanger ending.The book is entertaining in and of itself, and works both as a stand-alone novel and as the introduction to the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"You don't have to be a Stephen King fan to love this series. This first volume draws you in and binds you to the main character, Roland, and leaves you with so many questions you can't help but move on to the next book. Be ready for a time investment, because this will hook you from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King is a divine author. The weaver of your most horrifying nightmares, turning them into novels that make your very eyes bleed. The Gunslinger, along with Stephen King's IT, were,in my opinion, his best and most intriguing novels he has ever written.The Gunslinger forms its amazingly twisted plot around Gilead, the last Gunslinger. This Man has amazing skills with his dual revolvers, so much skill that an entire village lies at his feet within seconds. Gilead is in pursuit of the Man in Black, a mysterious figure that lurks in the area. Gilead, on his way, finds a young woman named Alice, and a young New Yorker boy named Jake, to whom he develops a stangely fond attachment to.This novel is read in the third person, with some flashbacks and poetic moments. It is a very mature read, involving strong violence, some language and brief adult content. The book itself is a great, exciting novel that will provide hours and hours of haunt and action. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"King's DT series is nothing short of excellent. While some would argue that the series lacks cohesion and that some compelling ideas are introduced but never explored (particularly in the 3rd installment), King's heros' journey is still simply incredible. If a mixing of flavors on one big plate is appealing (fantasy, sci-fi, romance, western) these books will deliver. It's Tolkien, Owen Whister, and Akira Kurosawa all in one place. As a point of interest, this series is the nexus of many of King's other books - The Stand, Hearts in Atlantis, Eyes of the Dragon, and 'Salem's Lot to name a few connections."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Has its ups and downs; the magic wears off for each successive listening, but I have to keep listening because I am addicted to George G's narration, I always have been. Also King's style is unique; I'm sure I will listen to this at least 1,000 more times before I give it up."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book was great. I will definitely continue reading the series. The universe that King has created is complex and intriguing.This is not a western. That was my main concern when I picked it up. I didn't want to read a western. This is a fantasy quest, along the lines of Lord of the Rings, but gritty, dark, and not nerdy.I am now reading the comics, which are based on the book, and they are beautiful."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Excellent! It took forever to get the 1st book on CD. Now my collection is complete."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The reason this is one of my favorite books of all time has nothing to do with the science fiction or fantasy aspects of it, or the writing itself, which is terrific, but because it's so un-King like. At its root, it's about the yearning inside every man to conquer something seemingly unconquerable, a theme brought out beautifully in the final twenty pages. There is no reason to even read beyond the first book of the cycle, everything you need to feel is right here in this one. People who have nothing but distaste for Stephen King would never believe he could write this well. I like this book even more so than The Stand."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book had me hooked from when I started it and read the opening line of &quot;The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed&quot;. The world that King creates is so strangely like our own. The only thing about this book is that he spends too much time on flashbacks and doesnt explain enough about them. It takes only a little away from the book and the rest is enough to keep you reading long into the night. I cant wait to get the next one! Keep writing Mr. King, and give us a 5th book soon!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This one took a few pages to get started, but once it got going, it was tough to put this book down. This is definitley something different from the standard King novel. The main character is Roland of Gilead. The last of his breed of the once feared Gunslingers. From crossing the desert in search of &quot;The Man In Black&quot; to his shootout in a not so friendly town, this is the start of the best tale ever written. And the story isn't over yet. One of the first lines of the book is &quot;The Man in Black crossed the desert. And the Gunslinger followed&quot;. Hopefully you will pick up this book and follow it's trail all the way to the end at the side of Roland."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"A master of storytelling, King's 'The Gunslinger' is a great introduction to the voluminous 'Dark Tower' series. He uses just enough reality to keep us going, but enough fantasy to keep us interested.The later books can bog down a bit just by shear volume, but this one is crisp.A great read for anyone."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"You have to take this advice, or you will miss out on some of the best writing by Steven King. If you think the Gunslinger is boring, try out the next book, it is well worth it. You wont be sorry. Once you start reading it will consume your life until the book is finished."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Part of the Dark Tower series of books, this is truly exceptional writing by Mister King. I can never put these books down. They are strange but for some reason, totally believable! This is a story that could go on for ever and ever. I really enjoy reading these books and it seems as if each new episode of the story just gets better and better. If you decide to read these series, I recommend you start from the first book and work your way down the whole series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The introduction into the odd world of the story's main character Roland is quite possibly King's finest work. Moving away from his norm of fright/horror, this book takes place in a world in which the world's last gunslinger travels across a rapidly dying world in search of The Dark Tower, a mysterious unexplained destination. However, in this world we see signs that it was at one time the same world as our own (or at least very similar). What makes this book the most interesting is not what it tells you, but what it doesn't tell you. It allows the reader to make their own theories as to what has happened to the world, what is happening, what will happen. The Gunslinger (and the books that follow it in the Dark Tower Series) is one of the best works from this modern writer and is definately worthy of your collection."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"One of the greatest works of fantasy, Mr. King jumps easily from horror to this genre. And isn't the usually big-almost-without-an-end book that he usually writes, is not too big, yet is long enough. And it left you wanting to read the sequel. This is one of the best of Stephen King, a saga that will last longer than him, hopefully he will get to write the other 3 sequels to end this 7 part saga."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book was great but you cant just read this one it gets you into tons of king books this book is so cool it even has others after it on the same story including THe drawing of the 3, the waste lands, and wizard and glass there is sure to be more coming. I really recomend this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The gunslinger is the first of four awesome books. People who read it don't usually don't enjoy it and this saddens me too often. To my opinion this is the shortest yet the best written book of the series and one of the best books ever to be written. Whithin it lies a great mystery that opens a path to the Dark Tower. I feel that this book is very difficulr to read and grasp. To grasp it, one needs to be deeply inside the gunslinger's mind. Enjoying the series of books starts in enjoying &quot;the gunslinger&quot;. Give it a thought before you give in and compensate by reading the second book (which is far less difficult to read)."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"a very good fantasy with a western twist. the story starts out with a man named roland who is a gunslinger(a kind of knight meets cowboy in my opinion.)who is wandering through a desert looking for a notorious &quot;man in black&quot; who he believes will have the whereabouts of a place called the dark tower, that roland believes will have all the answers including the one of while the world has moved on without him. later roland befriends a kid named Jake who is from Earth.

Size indeed defeats us all."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This first book in The Dark Tower series starts out at a slow pace, but as always Stephen King's descriptions quickly birth a new world in my mind. \\"The Gunslinger\\" also known as Roland is on a quest, the story begins with him chasing after \\"The Man in Black\\" also known as Walter o 'Dim. This first in a series leads you and gives you a dim idea of what is to come, but doesn't reveal to much...still it does make me want to read the next book, to find out what this world is about. It leaves me with questions such as What is this world? Is it another version of earth? Is it afterlife? All good questions that I look forward to finding answers to in the next few books. Overall I can't give it a five start simply because I found it slightly confusing, but still a great book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I really enjoyed this series. It definitely captures your attention. I recommend this to my friends if they get into the genre."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stphen King's The Dark Tower series are not really horror but fantasy. The world he sets the books in are more dream like, but they are parallel with the world that human beings are living in.I found The Gunslinger to be a very good start with the series. I read some reviews and most people said the book lacks of action. But how? The Gunslinger goes back and forth between Roland's past becoming a gunslinger to his search for the Man in Black (which is one of Stephen King's greatest enemies, Randal Flagg). Even though its a shorter book, I found this to be a page turner. It does have somewhat a H.P. Lovecraft feel to it, but that's only me.Nonetheless, The Gunslinger is by far one of my favorite Stephen King books, and it will lead on to one of the bst series in books.The Gunslinger is a five star rating in my eyes!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King writes yet another great book!

In this first book we meet Roland Deschain, the last of the Gunslingers who at first seems like a simple cowboy chasing someone across the desert. This quickly changes as we learn more and more about Roland, his dying world, and the man in black. With a mixture of a western movie, fantasy, sci-fi and mystery The Gunslinger is the start of an adventure that follow Roland's quest for the Dark Tower.This is not your typical Stephen King story; instead it is an epic journey that touches many of the books King has written over the years tying his universe together in a fun and unique way."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I just want to say it's not a problem with the author. I have read It, The Stand, and Under The Dome and loved them all. I look forward to reading more of King's work. This one sadly just didn't work for me. The world just wasn't explained enough, couldn't understand the character's motiviations, some kid just gets dropped out of the sky from another dimension, high speech vs low speech (what does that even mean anyway). It got to the point I was so preoccupied figuring out wha and what everyone was that I lost track of the story I was reading. Just distracting.I got halfway through, realized I didn't remember half of what had already happened, and didn't care how it ended. I hate giving up in the middle of a book but it just would have been forced."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As the first book in a series, it's expected, as short as it is, to just be the introductory book for the main character, in this case, the mysterious anti-hero, Roland. And what a strange character he is.We meet him when he gets to a ramshackle of a rundown place run by a small down-timer by the name of Brown (no relation to yours truly, obviously), who listens to his story of how he came to this point in time to this very place, or rather, the town where he came from. Not his birthtown, just his last resting place. And the tragedy that played out there.In that story we learn of his unique ability with guns... and eventually, how his ability can be a curse, not only a cure.From that story, we also meet a young boy, Jake, who has memories of a mythical place without a name (though it's obvious where), and a time that, according to Roland, is nothing but myth. And on to the journey to catch up to the mysterious man in black.I saw it interesting as to how there were two main villains in the story, the first being in Roland's first story, Sylvia Pittston, a hyper-religious woman, described as HUGE... yet lustfully voluptuous, who can command an entire town as the town's only preacher (and if you know the Bible well enough, you can tell she twists one of the story's play-out incorrectly, making her a false preacher that can command masses to do tragic things). Who's also with child, good thing it's not Roland's.The other, the man in black, always seems to be a step or a mile haed of Roland... then Roland and Jake. Until the right time, that being HIS right time. Then you read something scientifically valid as well as Biblically sound- about how there are mysteries to this universe that no one can truly understand, no matter how much they study it.And then, in the end, a strange little twist that will continue into the next story.So, what flaws were there to earn the 3/5?First, some of the descriptions were rather rough reading, so I felt that I had to force myself to read all the way through them, then that struggle ended when I got to the last chapter (there's only six). The other flaw being the typos. If there's just a few of them, it doesn't really bother me. But if there's quite a load of them or if they actually interfere with the storytelling, then it agitates me. In this case, there loads f typos (stopped trying to count when I got to ten barefly after the first half), and a couple of them did end up interfering with the story, which never fails to get me undone.Nevertheless, great story with an interesting metaphorical AND metaphysical concept, genre-bending/blending, and unique and unusual characters. Some much more memorable than others."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the first of Steven King's Dark Tower series. It is well written and has a lot of action in it. It is Steven King. I reminds me of a bizzaro western. It has nothing too scary. I liked it. There are some adult situations, but nothing graphic. Some of it reminds me of a good western action book. Some parts are a little weird, but remember who wrote it. In general, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Disclaimer: My review may spoil the \\"plot\\" for some readers.The Gunslinger is definitely not my favorite Stephen King novel for a number of reasons. First, entering the world of this novel is notably difficult because a lot of events have already happened prior to chapter 1, so King has to tell a lot of the story in flashbacks. Even after he fills in some of the gaps, readers are left wondering why Roland must catch the Man in Black in the first place, a question that I don't feel is ever answered effectively. Second, it's not REALLY a novel; it is a collection of stories involving the same antihero. At times, Roland's journey seems pointless, making his betrayals of Alice and Jack feel cruel and unnecessary. Third, when Roland finally catches up with The Man in Black after a bizarre and seemingly pointless encounter with the Slow Mutants, he is given no real information, just a Tarot card reading with a deck composed of made-up cards. If King had used conventional and recogonizable cards, we might have been able to pick up on some deep archetypal message, but by including nonsensical cards such as The Sailor, The Prisoner, and The Lady of the Shadows, King undercuts any universal archetypal powers he might have invoked. By that point, though, I could have cared less.However, if you are looking far bizarre imagery in a dream-like narrative set in a illogical hybrid universe that seems to blend medieval Arthurian elements with spaghetti westerns, the Lord of the Rings, and Biblical allusions, then you will probably love The Gunslinger. It is way too surreal for my tastes, though."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have always heard about the Dark Tower series, and finally decided to get it. Although you can actually feel how young King must have been when he wrote it, is a very intriguing tale, with an easy narrative, and a compelling in-universe. Good enough to get the next one and keep reading."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Fascinating, intriguing book. Writen so well, building up a convincing fantastic new world.

I can't put it down!!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King's \\"The Gunslinger.\\"How the world must move on in order to surviveStephen King's \\"The Gunslinger\\" is set in a world that is virtually a broken mirror reflection of our own. Here, the last of the world's great heroes, Roland of Gilead, chases his biggest villain, Marten Broadcloak through the desert that seemed endless. This world is littered with shadows of a world that used to be, machines of an age even before Roland's own birth that no one no longer knows how to use. So, Roland chases his nemesis through this world that is falling apart, piece by piece. He stops occasionally, interacting with locals and refilling his supplies, but the intense drive to catch this criminal always remains intact, at the forefront of his mind. He is a single minded machine of his upbringing, killing when necessary and deadly when called to arms.Roland of Gilead provides the reader a hero to side with, though later in the story his worthiness of being the good guy comes into question quite sharply. As Roland moves through this world, he notes the significant changes around him, how even the earth itself seemed to be dying. Crops no longer grew, people no longer procreated and raised healthy young children, and the animals seemed to just be hanging on by a whisper. His own mule died while he was dining with a desert hermit and the man's crow ate the eyes from the dead mule. Death seemed to be the only release from the torment of a dying world. He meets a young boy that died in his own world only to awaken in Roland's, only to sacrifice this young son for the chance to achieve his ultimate passion, to reach the Dark Tower and perhaps, save the world from dying completely.The story shows many religious and political implications, from the man in black crossing the desert running from the last gunslinger, to the sacrifice of the \\"Son\\" for the greater good by Roland himself. This story was written in King's youth, just after a time of social upheaval and change within the United States. The world lost a great man, people gained equality unknown previously, and society seemed on the edge of an ultimate show down between the world's nuclear powers. The main message that started this saga was that the world could no longer go on as it always had, ignoring the needs of the needy, suppressing the people not in agreement with the social norm, and blatantly segregating segments of the population because of race, color, or national origin. The world must \\"move on\\" in order to achieve the ultimate goal for equality and fair treatment for all. If it did not \\"move on\\" the world was surely on the path of destruction, as it was pictured in the post-Apocalyptic world in which Roland traveled. President John F. Kennedy, in my opinion, was the inspiration for the Roland, combined with the ideal movie \\"gunslinger\\" like Clint Eastwood portrayed for many years. (See the movie \\"Hang'em High\\" for an example.) His valiant struggle for equality for all Americans, combined with his steely handling of the world wide issues from Cuba to Russia gave him the title according to Time's Magazine as \\"The world's last gunslinger.\\"Works Cited:King, Stephen 1982, 2003, The Gunslinger, Penguin Putnam Inc."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Excellent! This is a good read. It starts out a bit slow, but soon captures you and draws you into the story."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is obviously well written, but I could not get into it. It did not create a interesting world for me like Tolkien does. Other reviews had prepared me for the slow pace of this first book and I did finish it, but in the end the gunslinger was not a character I found endearing like Frodo or magical like Gandalf. It is quite possible that I am getting too old for fantasy, who knows. I did buy book 2 of the series but put it aside after 20 pages. Not for me."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"My favorite part of the book was the thoughtful and candid introduction by King, \\"On Being Nineteen.\\" It's downhill from there. Being in between books by Rothfuss, Abercrombie and Martin I grabbed this thinking it might measure up. Not even close. I'm not going to say it's awful, and was a step up from the last Sci Fi book I read, Neal Ambrose's Snow Crash. But I found myself dreading the book, which is not the relationship I like to have with what I'm reading. It seemed clear that King wrote this at an annoying age, when we all think we know everything and are the deepest souls in the world. Much of the story sounds like a first year college student, just discovering mushrooms, blabbing on about the infinity of the universe. I'd love to know King's honest opinion of this book. I'd be proud of it for sure, but would probably provide an intro later in life, like he did, making sure to explain that I wrote it at 19."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Dark Tower novels are like Tolkien on steroids.

Its grandiose vision, combined with its modest initial scope, betrays the vaulting youthful ambition of the author, yet these four small stories stand out from the rest of King's work for their haunting and poetic character.The combination of vision and craftsmanship in these tales is unequalled in any of King's later work. The three (so far) sequels to The Gunslinger attempt to flesh out King's vast vision, leading to literary bloat. Sometimes what is indicated but left unsaid is far more powerful than what is fully explained. The whole story will be worth reading if you have a few months to give to it, but The Gunslinger will only take a couple of hours and will reward you with one of the few true masterpieces of postmodern imaginative fiction."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I know, I know, I am kind of playing favorites here, but I throughly enjoyed this novel. I read mainly VERY long fantasy epics, like right now the Wheel of Time and Shannara trilogy, so when I am overwhelmed by these, I turn to this old favorite.

Besides, how can you go wrong with such a combo like this book offers?"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Eerie, imaginative, and vivid all describe &quot;The Gunslinger and the Dark Tower&quot;. This book is the first part of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series of books by Stephen King.This book is about the gunslinger, whose real name is Roland, and his quest across a desolate land. This land is a twisted mirror or our own. He walks through the desert in the pursuit of answers to many questions he has. These answers are held by the man in black. In his pursuit he has a romance with a woman named Alice, who lives in Tull, a town in the middle of the desert. He also adopts Jake, a boy from Earth, as his son.This book makes you want to read it until the end. Even in the end it leaves many questions unanswered. I actually want to read the next book in the series, which is the first time a book has made me want to read another book. This is why I believe this book is great, because it leaves you wanting more."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I won't say much except this.

I was astounded by the great illustrations, too. I had a few occations of trying to get into the whole story, but the more I tried, the more I liked it. It was different King, and then again it wasn't, and I liked it a lot. It's strange, mystic, gothic and scary at many times. The world of the Gunslinger and his hunt for the Man in Black really enchanted me, and I couldn't put the book down. As I realized that this was the first book in a serie, I couldn't wait to get my hands in the others.

It is a story so immense that I hope he doesn&quot;t finish it for another ten years. It will be worth it.I have read almost all of King's books. Although there not all equally good. They are all great stories. I hate it when people criticize him. Most of the time they are speaking from positions of ignorance any way. They are people who obviuosly are not very good at reading to begin with because they cannot grasp the ideas that he presents. Read the Dark Tower.

I am a big King fan, yet you don't have to be a King fan to appreciate this novel. It is quite different from most of his others. What is very intriguing about this book is that one is not sure where it is set. It is set in a time when the world has moved on which would lead one to believe that it is futuristic, however at the same time the setting could be considered both medieval and western. In this novel we get our 1st glimpse of Roland one of King's most notorious characters. Roland is in search of the Dark Tower which is basically the center of all worlds. Due to his search Roland has hardened, he has made many sacrifices for the tower. The tower and his guns being perhaps the only thing that Roland loves. Everyone that i have ever recommended this book to has loved it and i am sure that you will too. King will not be remembered as a great writer, but he will be remembered as one of the best storytellers of alltime. Read this book, it is a must."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I loved this book. Roland and his persuance of the Man in Black is a very eerie piece of writing and the way King ties it into The Stand(another scary,brilliant piece of his imagination) is creative.

It scared me to death and The Green Mile made me weep uncontrollably. I've gone several years without reading any of his books. Excluding him from my Currently Reading list wasn't by design. I was just going through a different reading cycle.Lately, it seems that I have been reading a good bit of, let's face it, CRAP! Some of the books were enjoyable, some were painful and others were utterly forgettable - which is the worst in my opinion. I needed something to get me out of the rut I was in so I thought that Stephen wouldn't let me down. I had never read the Dark Tower series and knew that King considered it one of his great works. So, I went in to this with very high expectations. The problem with high expectations is that you are bound to be disappointed. And, I can tell you that I was disappointed for the first 50 pages. \\"How can I rate a King novel 2 stars? Everyone will think I am an idiot.\\" Honestly, he would have only gotten the 2nd star because he is such a beautiful writer. It had nothing to do with the story. I thought that I might have lost my reading mojo. Time after time, I'd read several pages and realize that I remembered nothing of the story they contained. I re-read about every page in that section at least twice and some of them four times. But, I persevered. There was no way I was going to have a DNF on this one.I am so glad I pulled through. This turned out to be a 4-star book for me (and I bet if I re-read it in a year or so it could be a 5-star). Maybe you just need to be in a Stephen King kind of mood. Whatever the case, I am excited to read book 2 (next on my list) and I hope to finish the series of 7 books by the end of the year.I won't bother with a full recap of the plot. I'm not even sure I truly understand it. All you really need to know is that Roland Deschain, the gunslinger, is searching for the Dark Tower. The first book chronicles his travels over desert and mountains to find the Man in Black (a sorcerer.) He meets some very interesting (i.e. strange, disgusting, heartbreaking) characters along the way.A few of my favorite quotes:*\\"At nineteen, it seems to me, one has a right to be arrogant; time has usually not begun its stealthy and rotten subtractions.\\" This is actually not from the book but from the Introduction.*\\"The gunslinger occasionally moaned with the wind. The stars were as indifferent to this as they were to wars, crucifixions, resurrections. This also would have pleased him.\\"*\\" \`Beans, beans, the musical fruit,' the raven recited, inspired. 'The more you eat, the more you toot.' \\" I'm sorry but you have to love such a talented author who can work this into a story.*\\"The gunslinger removed one of the shells from his gunbelt and twirled it in his fingers. The movement was dexterous, as flowing as oil. The shell cartwheeled effortlessly from thumb and index to index and second, to second and ring, to ring and pinky. It popped out of sight and reappeared; seemed to float briefly, then reversed. The shell walked across the gunslinger's fingers. The fingers themselves marched as his feet had marched on his last miles to this place.\\" Like Jake, I was mesmerized. Beautiful. I've thought about this for days after reading.*\\"Time's the thief of memory.\\" True that.*\\"I was made for light.\\"There were a couple of things that were a little strange. The song \\"Hey Jude\\" was mentioned multiple times. I'm hoping I'll understand the connection at some point in the series. There is a reference to matricide that I don't yet understand. And, my e-book had a few pictures in random places. I could have done without them. They didn't add anything for me.Bottom line - READ THIS BOOK. Life is too short to not read Stephen King. And, you won't be nineteen forever - be arrogant while you can. It's just obnoxious at 40."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I bought it, so I read it.

Looking forward to reading the entire series........ .... .. .... ...."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I consider myself a pretty loyal Stephen King horror book fan. I ate up everything he put out in the early part of his career, except for this series. Something about the premise kept me away. But after hearing everyone rave about it, I had to at least give it a try.Epic doesn't even begin to describe this story. Everything about this book screams that King is trying to create a masterpiece that rivals other fantasy epics like The Lord of the Rings. King uses a lot of metaphors (sometimes way too many), a lot of philosophical discussion about the universe, time, space, and our position within all of it, and a lot of dreamy (and unimaginable) imagery. All of this is to paint a picture of another world/dimension/universe where time has been altered and things have gone wrong. The only person who wants to do something to fix it is the protagonist, Roland, aka the Gunslinger, who has been trained to kill and is armed with his special guns. The story opens with Roland in the middle of his journey to fix all that is wrong in the universe, or perhaps its just to avenge all that has been done, we're never sure. What we do know is that he's chasing after The Man in Black, who has played some significant part in why things are so messed up in his world. Roland wants to kill The Man in Black (with his guns, of course!), but before he does, he wants The Man to give him information about The Tower. What is the Tower? Well, according to The Man in Black, The Tower has something to do with the universe, time, and a higher power. I didn't quite get what it was all about, and I don't think Roland or the reader is supposed to either, not until the very end of this saga (and several books later).It's an interesting premise, the problem is, I don't quite understand or believe it enough to invest any more time in it. Unlike King's previous efforts, I never immersed myself completely in the story to the point where I forgot I was reading a novel. You can feel King's ambition and desire to create an epic, unworldly story that somehow delivers a statement about the universe we live in. It's not quite pretentious, but almost.There were parts of the story that really grabbed me. King is a master at tapping into basic human fear and shaking you up, but unfortunately in this novel, the scares run few and far between. Also, Roland's character development was too slow to keep me interested. I never really \\"got\\" him or his struggle and as a result, I don't care if he finds The Tower, because I don't really care about him and The Tower sounds too abstract and unbelievable anyway.So sadly, this is where my journey with Roland ends."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This being the first Stephen King book I have ever read really made me want more.

The bad guy is none other than Randall Flag (The Stand), a truly evil character, King's best villian. The story, though is rambling and unstructured. There is the feeling that the fleshing out of this excellent short work into novel form was rushed. A few more revisions prior to release and this would have been work worthy of standing with King's best. All in all, a good read for King fans. If you are going to try him for the first time, (Where have you been, in a cave?) then try The Night Shift, his best short story collection"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger in my opion is one of Kings best written novels.

He is on a quest to find the dark tower and set his world right. Then theres Jake, A boy from our world voilently thrust into the Rolands. Jake is the key to the man in black.

Reading this book you have to understand that it is merely the beginning, and yet it is a very good book in itself. In &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; you enter the life of the last gunslinger in a world that has &quot;moved on&quot;, in his quest for the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; which in my opinion symbolizes the domain of the universe, some form of heaven. In this first book the gunslinger follows the man in black, who is his enemy. It takes you a while to understand and identify yourself with the gunslinger's world, but when you do, you can't get enough of it. I recommend it if you are planning on reading the others that follow. I am currently reading the third (The Waste Lands), and I have to say that you really get hooked when you are reading the second book"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"While reviewing the first book, \\"The Gunslinger\\", of Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series, I am trying to not let the brilliance of the subsequent editions cloud my judgment on this one. I am a \\"late\\" fan of King (still working my way through all his novels), and I finally decided to begin the journey to the Dark Tower. However, after reading this first installment, it took an editor's note from King himself to get me excited about continuing with Roland on his quest.The main problem I had with this book is that absolutely no context is given for Roland's world on his travels as the book opens. Roland is wandering through a land that looks like our own but definitely is not, contains mutant monsters, and for some reason a \\"Man In Black\\" that Roland is compelled to follow.As I continued reading, those mysteries were only beginning to be touched on as the novel came to a close. Thus, I spent way too much time trying to figure out just what the heck was going on (a task that is nearly impossible without reading the next few installments anyway) and less time just enjoying the adventure.At the conclusion of my reading, I wondered exactly how Stephen King was going to make an interesting story out of this. Little did I know that King is actually utilizing a form of background storytelling, where the events in this book are not fully explained for two, three, or even four books down the line. I did not care for this type of narrative, as it creates way too much confusion and too little of the mystery that King likely was gunning for.So, if you are looking to start your own quest for the Dark Tower, you still need to read this book, but keep firmly in your mind that the series absolutely explodes in the next few books, which is far different from the glacial-like pace of this first try."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"To be honest, I almost gave up on the first book in the Dark Tower series. It just wasn't worth it. However, they told me to persist, and I would be rewarded, and it turns out that \\"they\\" were right. I'm almost done with the second book right now, and it's much better. Now, as for the first book:PROs:+ It's short+ Necessary intro to a great series+ Roland's actually a pretty cool protagonist, even in the first book, and the \\"man in black\\" is a pretty cool villain+ Gets better as it goes--the last section is really interestingCONs:- Starts off slow- The language King uses is ridiculous, especially his use of similies. This is supposed to be a serious tale, but his writing made me laugh out loud at it's sheer badness. For example: The gunslinger is apparently skilled at reloading his weapons on the fly. So how is his reloading \\"trick\\" described? \\"...and still the hands did their business, like overeager dogs that want to do their rolling-over trick for you not once or twice but all night...\\" The gunslinger's water skin is \\"...like a bloated sausage.\\" You get the idea.- The supporting characters seem to follow a logic of their own. *SPOILER* For instance: A barmaid is describing a resurrection the man in black did in her town. A man dies of drug overdose, and the man in black raises him. So what does the barmaid do? She freaks out, runs to her room, locks the door, cries, laughs hysterically, comes back down stairs, and starts talking to the re-raised man as if nothing had happened. Puh-lease! *END SPOILER*Bottom line: The other books are good! Honest! Slam through this 300-page monstrosity, and move on to \\"The Drawing of the Three\\"."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Dark Tower series is a must-read for Stephen King fans and The Gunslinger (Volume 1) is necessary to fully understand the back story and the rest of the works. That said, it's not that great a book on its own. It has a different feel and pace from the other books. Fortunately it's by far the shortest of the series. So put in the effort on this one to enjoy the rest of the series. I found The Drawing of the Three (Volume 2), The Wastelands (Volume 3) and Wolves of the Calla (Volume 5) to be the most entertaining on their own while still advancing the overall series thread."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is a surreal work of fiction. It starts out slow, goes nowhere and makes very little sense. Not sure what all the hype was about. I certainly will not be continuing with this series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger as a stand alone book would have been 5 stars. Unfortunately it is 1 of 7. If you are planning to read this as a series I would recommend you look to the reviews of book 7. I finished what I started, but the end was much weaker than the begining. If this is Mr. King's hope to match the greats of Sci Fi Fantasy, he has been measured and found lacking. As a side note, I really don't have enough interest in Mr. King's \\"On being Nineteen\\" to read it in each of the first four books. Reading it once as the kindle free sample was quite enough and should be warning enough of tales to come. This was added well after the original book was written."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Well, maybe there is more to say cuz this book is one pardon the phrase &quot;badass mofo&quot;. It has it all: action, drama, suspense, romance, just everything you think of when you think of a hardcore Clint Eastwood Bonanza movie vibe. Roland is a great main character too, real fresh-faced killer mentality with a hint of compassion at the same time for the less fortunate along the way in the journey, or his love interest Alice who he has to end up killing ironically. To sum this piece up a must read for those hardcore King fans like myself or just if you like a good mysterious plot-twisting tale of dark wizardry and zigzags throughout. Good stuff and I'm not even an avid reader either, imagine that, it's just that easy to get involved, go hed phonics monkeys, join in. lol peace out"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is just the beginning of an awesome journey! I actually began this series out of order, but once you start you can't stop! I'm jonesin' for they newest installment of the saga! This is the kind of King only the fans know about, not all out horror he's so popular for. This is a great work of fantasy, and there are hints of it in other stories that all link together for what is already a masterpiece though has not concluded! It's very addictive, I've went back and read each book in the series twice."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"In this first installment of Stephen King's Dark Tower epic we meet Roland, the center of the ka-tet on its way to the Dark Tower. In this chapter, Roland is on the tail of the man in black, chasing him across a vast wasteland in order to confront him. This series is Stephen King's masterpiece. In my mind, Stephen King's multiverse rivals, but of course, cannot surpass, Tokien's Middle Earth. This first book is a bit slow at the start, but is worth working through for the mind-bending ending and of course the following books, which, in my mind, each surpass the previous book. King's series is an immense undertaking, which he has, sadly, said might be his last works."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I had difficulties following the story at times, but couldn't seem to put the book down for any length of time. As it progressed, I found myself picking it up and reading \\"just a few more pages\\". By the time I finished, I had already ordered the next book in the series, and today ordered the next two. ... If you have patience to wade through some of the areas that are occasionally slow and/or difficult to follow, this is an enjoyable story that will hook you on the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I first stumbled upon the Gunslinger in middle school and have been hooked on the Dark Tower ever since. With it's gritty fantasy feel and an eerie undertone, it sets the reader on a spellbinding journey following Roland's quest for the Dark Tower. King's stark descriptions of this world and it's people are totally amazing. I highly recommend this book and the following volumes."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I had stopped reading Stephen King becuase it seemed like everything he was writting was just a rehash of his earlier stuff. He was using cookie cutter characters and catering to the mass market. My wife was reading this series and kept talking about it. I picked it up and was glad I did. King was back. The characters in this book were different and you cared about them. The story was something that King hadn't done before and it was something you wanted to read. I couldn't wait to get on to the next ones. They are all great."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is a book that exceded my predictions. Stephen King did an excellent job of connecting the characters so that they seemed real life people. The book is about a gunslinger named Roland who is in search of &quot;the dark tower&quot; which is a place where he is destined to go for some unknown reason. In the beginning chapters there is great action scene of Roland taking out an entire town of people. The antaginist in this story is &quot;the man in black&quot; who Roland sees as somebody acting against him, but in reality he acts as sort of a guide to Roland. There are also many characters in the story such as boy who Roland befriends and takes him along on his travels. You also learn more about Rolands past and other characters involved. I gave The Gunslinger 4 stars which is a rating that this book deserves."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This novel is indeed a good start to a series, however there are too many flashbacks without any real discriptive histories. The character Roland isn't developed like King's other characters, he seems to try and grow without letting the readers have a foundation. I've started book two, and can say honestly that King's growth as an author is evident."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The ending is what makes this book worth reading. For the most part it is pretty tough to get interested because there are only 2 characters and you can't really relate with either of them. And for the most part nothing happens, just a whole lot of walking accross the desert. Its not exciting in the least. But you do get sucked in just because you want to know what is going on and you don't have any idea until you reach the end of the book. I loved the ending so much I have already begun reading the second book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"1) Too bad King read his own book. A professional actor/reader would have made this so much more interesting than King's droning voice. The Insomnia auidobook was much more interesting to listen to.2) I quite midstream as the story just was confusing at times with little or no information on the world created. Some parts mirror our world and others don't.3) The one thing I did like is that there was a real sense of dread around each bend. You didn't know what traps the Man in Black had laid for the Gunslinger and this is what kept me going at least to the mid-point.I had become disenchanted with King's work about 7 years ago and this is the first thing I came back to since then. I felt disappointed to the point that unless I have three really good friends whoes' opinions I trust tell me to read a particular King book...only then will I give King another chance."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is a gem but it's risky business. Warning: Do not buy this book, risking your time and money, unless you are firmly committed to reading the second book in the series, The Drawing Of The Three. I read The Gunslinger, then The Drawing Of The Three, and have just started reading the third book, The Waste Lands. I couldn't put the second book down, devouring it as fast as I could, and I can hardly believe my good fortune in having five more books to go before the climax in The Dark Tower, book seven.Several reviews have compared The Gunslinger to The Hobbit - as a precursor to the rest of the books in the series. But The Hobbit is a book that stands firmly on its own legs. The Gunslinger is not. The Gunslinger only begins to make sense while reading the second book. There were times that I thought I'd never make it through The Gunslinger. I had tumbled into a world that didn't make sense. I was confused and disoriented in this new world. I was angry and disgusted and thought I had wasted my money. But I had committed to the series by buying the first four books and I had to get through The Gunslinger before moving on to the others, so I persevered. Thankfully!I highly recommend this book as your ticket into the world of Roland, The Gunslinger. This is Stephen King at his best."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The Gunslinger\\" is the first book in Stephen King's epic fantasy series, titled \\"The Dark Tower.\\" This book is very, very different from the fantasy that you can pick up in bookstores or purchase at Amazon. This epic has a very different feel to it when you are reading the book. I would say that this book is a western type of fantasy, with particular emphasis on the western part. Most of the book takes place in the desert and villages in it, and this will give the feel that distinguishes this book from others. Stephen King is a master of the English language and his words paint a clear image in your mind.The book starts off teaching you about the gunslinger, who we later learn is named Roland, is chasing the Man in Black. The book is like a mystery in a way as as the book progresses you learn about the gunslinger's motives and we eventually learn his real obsession. Roland stops at a village and falls in love with a woman. In this part of the story King portrays a romance between the gunslinger and his girlfriend. Later on in the book Roland the Gunslinger meets up with the child Jake, and Jake continues with Roland on his quest to find the Man in Black. At the end of the novel Roland will have to make a hard choice concerning Jake and the Man in Black. The story has a good set up but does come across a bit slow throughout the novel.Stephen King originally wrote \\"The Gunslinger\\" as five different short stories, and they are all published here as one novel. Each part of the book can be appreciated as a story in itself or as a part of the whole fantasy epic. On another note, King's idea for this book came from Robert Browning's epic poem, \\"Childe Roland.\\"Roland the Gunslinger is a man obsessed with finding the Man in Black. The last part of the story is defintely the best as you learn lots about why Roland has been following the Man in Black. We learn how Roland is set out to find the Dark Tower, which is supposed to hold a room that is basically the control room of all the universes.King is a greatly talented author and it shows here. King brought an inventive fantasy story and put in many different flavors so this book will appeal to a wide group of readers. As curious as I am to find out more about Roland's quest, I am going to hold off reading the books until the next two books of the series are published, probably next year, so I won't I will be able to read most of the series all at once. This is a masterpiece that shouldn't be passed up.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the first in Stephen King's Dark Tower series and right away it pulls the reader into the desolate landscape of an Alter-Earth, where similarities between our world are noted and the differences are savored (and cringed at). Comparable to Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series (although definitely intended for a much older and mature audience)this involves one man's quest for a Dark Tower (which presumably could save his dying world), a man that is a cross between a knight and an American West gunfighter (hence the title). In this he is following a &quot;man in black&quot; who may have answers he so desperately needs. This is entertaining reading at its best, adventure, intrigue, a must for any fan of Stephen King. I'm not that big of a fantasy novel fan but this book and it's sequels are excellent motivators to peruse that genre. Bottom line, if you're looking for some fun while reading check this book out. If you do you'll not only finish this book but you'll find yourself going right for the next one, until you find yourself waiting (rather patiently I might add) for Mr. King to put out another one of these tightly woven, highly interesting stories!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"There are usually three reactions people have when Stephen King is mentioned. I love him. I hate him. And I like the movies based off his books, but I can't stand the books themselves. Whichever way you roll, you do have to admit that he's one of the most famous and successful writers of our day. He's often called the Master of Horror, however, very few of his books can actually be classified as being part of the horror genre. Oh, he does have his straight up horror novels, but the majority of his work is misclassified because his reputation is for horror, and that's what sells his books, regardless of whether or not they actually fit into that genre. He has stated in many an interview that he is a science fiction and fantasy fan, and has always wanted to write a grand fantasy epic to rival the Lord of the Rings. And if you look at them, most of his books are really more science fiction, fantasy, and thriller, rather than horrorThat is where The Dark Tower series comes in. He had an idea for the beginning of such a grand epic story, and he wrote it in high school. It was titled The Gunslinger and it is the first book that he ever wrote. It was published in a literary magazine, and later re-written and published as book one of The Dark Tower series once he'd gotten his foot in the door of the publishing world. The Dark Tower series as a whole has taken him decades to complete, oftentimes he would set it aside for years because he was basically making it up as he went along and couldn't think of anything to happen next. It was not until the famous accident when he was run over while jogging near his home in Maine that he realized he came inches away from dying and didn't want to snuff it before finishing his epic. It spurred him to get the final three books out within a couple years of each other and finish the series off.The Gunslinger begins with Roland, a Gunslinger, who is something like an Arthurian Knight if he were to have grown up in the old west rather than ye olde England, chasing after the Man in Black. Those who are familiar with other works of Stephen King will recognize Randall Flagg in the Man in Black, though his name is not revealed in this book. The world is dying around him, and through a series of flashbacks we find that the Man in Black is the cause of it. Roland pursues him across an endless desert wasteland, seeking vengeance for the deaths of his family and friends, for countless wars and rebellions, and the very breaking down of reality itself. Long ago he began a quest with his friends to find the Dark Tower, the center of the universe, to set things right, and the Man in Black may be the only one that can show him the way.As he chases after his quarry he encounters a boy named Jake, whom the Man in Black has transported from our world to Roland's as a means to slow Roland down. Being a good man at heart Roland cannot leave the boy behind to die in the desert and so they travel on together and finally reach the mountains beyond the desert, catching the Man in Black at last, at the mouth of a cave. He is given a choice, sacrifice the boy the next time they meet in exchange for details of the Dark Tower, and the companions he will need to find in order to reach it, or forever lose any hope of undoing the wrongness that is tearing reality itself apart.The Good? This is the very first book that Stephen King ever wrote, and therefore it is relatively clean, lacking the graphic sex and repeated use of the F word for which he is so famous. The story, though simple, is written in such a compelling way that it pulls you in, offering up questions about the past and the future of Roland that you can't help but continue reading to find the answers to. Roland as a character is well developed, with a clear goal in mind that he will do anything to achieve. The atmosphere and tone of the book are extremely well done. This book feels like the beginning of the grand epic story that it is. For the majority of the book, there is only Roland alone with his thoughts and inner demons. You might not think that to be very interesting, but King does it in such a way that you just can't stop reading.The bad? Stephen King is well known for the fact that he never outlines or plans anything before sitting down to write. He gets an idea and basically makes things up as he goes along. Though this is less evident in The Gunslinger, because the plot is so simple, and there are so few characters in it, you can still see where he just pulled stuff out of nowhere when he painted himself into a corner.The ugly? Stephen King uses a type of viewpoint called Third Person Omniscient. Normally, in a third person story, you see the story through the eyes of a single character at a time. You know their thoughts, their emotions, and their reactions to everything that happens. With Omniscient, the writer will give you thoughts and internal details from more than one character at a time. You're not in any one character's head, you're in all of them, and which one whose eyes you're seeing the world through can change at the drop of a hat, and normally with nothing to tell you that the viewpoint has changed. Some people, including myself, can find this to be confusing at times. It can also lead to the reader not connecting well with any of the characters. In a huge science fantasy epic like this one, it is vital that you connect with the characters, because you're going to be with them for a very long time. Luckily there are really only 3 characters in this book, so its easy to get attached to them early on so there's less confusion later in the series when more characters are introduced.All in all, The Gunslinger is a very good book. It lacks the hard language and sex that put many people off Stephen King books, and despite my dislike of King's writing style, it is very well written and thought out. It's hard to make something this interesting and compelling with a cast of only three characters, and he's done excellently with it. The atmosphere of the book is great, you can really feel the hopelessness of the dying world weighing on Roland's back with every step he takes, and the hope that he feels as he chases after the one man that may be able to give him some clues on how to set it right again. Roland's internal struggles play out very well, and you're teased enough with things to come and things long past that you want to continue on to the next book. As the beginning of a large epic the likes of which King wanted to rival Lord of the Rings with, it's rather short and simple. However, it is exactly what it needs to be to get this story rolling. Even if you do not go on to read the rest of the series, this book alone is worth reading for the simple reason that it is a perfect example of excellent writing and imagination the likes of which you would not have though Stephen King capable of, looking at his other works. I wish more of his books were like this one, clean and well written, rather than full of sex, horrible language, and not very well thought out or coherent.I'm giving this book five stars. It loses a point or two because of the confusion of the Omniscient point of view and a little bit of rambling due to King's making it up as he went along. Other than those two small issues I have nothing to complain about, not enough to lower it to 4 stars though. It was an excellent book that I certainly recommend you read."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I hadn't read a novel by Stephen King in years. Though I would have considered myself his number one fan back in the early days of King's writings, I found myself let down more and more in later years. It seemed his novels got longer and longer, but in a more rambling way and I found myself skipping through parts in search of action. I finally had to give up and didn't read anything by King for probably ten years. Then I took a chance and picked up Under the Dome and though it was long, I found myself getting caught up in the story. I didn't love it as I did novels like--The Shining, The Stand or Carrie, and it did take me almost a month to finish it--but for the most part I found I enjoyed it. Then my daughter came home from college last week raving about this Gunslinger series. Her words--\`You have GOT to read these! I LOVE them!' She even brought the first one with her, The Gunslinger, just to make sure I had a copy. I haven't seen my daughter get so excited about a book(s) since she read The Alien Chronicles, a saga by Deborah Chester back when she was ten years old.Surprise, surprise, it only took me two days to read The Gunslinger and my daughter (Kari :)) was right. I loved it! The old excitement I used to feel when picking up a new novel came roaring back. Was I just in the right frame of mind on this one? Can't say. But the story grabbed me right from page one and I had to force myself to put it down to take care of normal everyday business--like feeding the family, washing clothes etc. I had the old Stephen King \\"smile\\" back. Yah!!Roland is on a quest. He is chasing the man in black because he needs to learn what this stranger knows about a mysterious lone tower. Roland, or the gunslinger, as we start to think of him, will travel to the ends of the Earth, and any other dimensions he might run into, if he has to in order to reach this mysterious tower. He's not even certain what will happen when he finally gets there, only that he must. But at what cost?Jake is just a young boy the gunslinger finds in a deserted station in the desert and Roland knows he must take Jake with him. He grows close to the boy and enjoys his company. But Roland is haunted because he fears the time is coming when he will have to make a choice between catching up with the man in black, or saving Jake's life. Jake understands this as well and doesn't know if he can trust the gunslinger, a man he has grown to love in the short time they've been together. Roland is a hard man, but he also has a high sense of honor.I won't give anything away here, but the end of this novel had me chewing my nails down to the quick. It's been a long while since I've read anything I've enjoyed so much. I hope the others in this series will continue in the same way, because if they do, this series may very well drop my long-time King favorite, The Stand, down to second place."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Of course, I've heard about these books for years, but I never considered myself much of a Stephen King reader. Sure, I read some collections of short stories, and I loved THE SHINING and THE STAND (movies), but the length of the novels always kept me at arm's length. But, when I was looking for my next audio book listen, someone recommended this series, so I decided to give the first book a try.THE DARK TOWER 1: THE GUNSLINGER by Stephen King (1982 (orig); Plume, June 24, 2003 (revised))(This is a great summary of the book) From Amazon:In the first book of this brilliant series, Stephen King introduces readers to one of his most enigmatic heroes, Roland of Gilead, The Last Gunslinger. He is a haunting figure, a loner on a spellbinding journey into good and evil. In his desolate world, which frighteningly mirrors our own, Roland pursues The Man in Black, encounters an alluring woman named Alice, and begins a friendship with the Kid from Earth called Jake. Both grippingly realistic and eerily dreamlike, \\"The Gunslinger\\" leaves readers eagerly awaiting the next chapter.***As for the book itself, I loved the simplicity of the world Stephen King created in this first novel. The struggle within the main character came through perfectly, and when the young boy Jake was introduced, I was hooked. I wanted to know how Jake's world tied in with Roland's and why Roland was so intent on his pursuit of the man in black. I also truly appreciated how few words were used to create this world and the characters. As far as the audio book goes, this was a great choice. The narration was great, and the story moved along at a nice clip for audio listening.I'd recommend this one for people curious about the series and those who, like me, are not die-hard Stephen King fans. The concept of the books is fascinating and compelling and left me wanting more of the same.Source of book: Purchased from Audible.com"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've been unsure of the Dark Tower series for a while. I've never been a big fan of King's other works and was hesitant to really get into his most complex and epic work. I was wrong. This is great literature, forget science fiction or fantasy, at its best.The Gunslinger is in many ways the perfect introduction to a long serial epic such as The Dark Tower. It's not too long and does a great job of defining both the main character of the series as well as his ultimate goal. Motivation, friends and enemies can all be fleshed out later. The length is great because, if you turn out not to be a fan, you haven't invested yourself in a massive work (I'm thinking of friends who sloughed through Dune only to find it wasn't their cup of tea).If you've never read a Stephen King book before, don't take this as an indication of his other work. It's different, but in a very good way."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is a great read. I have never read any of the series before picking this one up. After reading The Gunslinger, I went and got the entire Dark Tower series and wound up loving them all.This book is a great introduction to the series, it starts with Roland chasing after a mysterious man in black. As he travels through towns, across barren deserts and through bleak caves he encounters demons, goblins, and religious fanatics each section leaving you begging for more and more. The real kicker in this book comes at the end, just when you think it will end a certain way, your mind gets screwed with and you have to read the next novel to find out what happens. The ending to this book is great!The book is a combination of fantasy, sci fi, horror and western generes and masterfully blends them all into one brilliantly constructed, bleak, horrific version of our own world. This book is filled with emotion, action, violence and is a fast paced thriller that will inspire you to finish the entire series ASAP.Definately pick this book up, you will love it and you will read through it in a minute! Not only is this book great, but ever book in the Dark Tower Series is brilliantly written and does not let your attention stray for a second.Buy It!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As someone who read the first 4 novels in this series and then waited years to read the ending, I can stay it was worth the wait! From the first line of \\"The Gunslinger\\" I was sucked into a world only Mr. King could create. By far my all-time favorite series that I have read twice and will read again. Definitely a masterpiece of fastasy!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The first instalment of Stephen King's fantasy series is unashamedly inspired by that other fantastic series, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". King made no attempt to hide this and refers to it in each of his surprisingly-interesting forwards, but the thought of reading something so obviously \\"inspired\\" put me off. It was only after the release of the final book in the series I was persuaded to pick up \\"Gunslinger\\", and was appalled at how brilliant it was.It's easy for people to say King's off his game, but he wasn't then and he isn't now - the final book, released only recently, is testament to this. \\"Gunslinger\\" is arguably everything that Stephen King isn't: beautiful, poetic, and not really horror. Technically it's fantasy, post-apocalyptic fantasy, and on top of that it's a Western of sorts. It's a glaring divergence from King's usual style, but what appalled me was that it was good. Very, very good, and despite the assumption that King's unfamiliarity with the genre would prove to be the novel's downfall, it is also full of everything that King is wonderful at: suspense, mystery, and very real characters.A review column isn't the place for a synopsis, so I'll keep it brief. This book has one real character and that's the mysterious hero, the eponymous gunslinger who is a throwback from a bygone age that existed before the world \\"moved on\\". The brevity of the novel lends itself to this kind of storytelling, in which we follow a single character in a series of events, a tale told in a surreal, rippling narrative that is like looking through water at an alternate world. The other novels don't keep up this dreamlike form of storytelling, which makes \\"Gunslinger\\" all the more precious.If you like King, you'll love this, regardless of the change in genre. If you pick this up and hate it, you'll still come away with a fresh idea on what novels are all about, reminded why people write. Simple story. Complex characters. You don't have to read the others if you don't like it, but if you want a fresh piece of fiction from an established super-writer, then for God's sake try \\"Gunslinger\\"!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I picked up The Gunslinger at a local B&N about 4 years ago. By that time the first 4 books were out so I didn't have to wait to get into the series. When I finally got to the fourth book (Wizard and Glass), I had to put it aside for a while because I had reached a difficult time in school and needed to concentrate on work. I was also feeling a little bored with the first 400 pages of it. When school ended in June '06 I decided it was time for me to finish up. The books had been eating away at the back of my mine. I was dying to know what would happen to Roland, Jake, Eddie, Susannah, and Oy. By that point the final (and long awaited) ending to the series had been released. I had to resist the temptation to look up spoilers on the internet. I was so glad I did. The ending did not please a lot of readers, but I thought it was the perfect ending. King managed to take what, from any other writer, would only have been a so-so ending and turn it into a life changing experience (at least for me). With my new outlook on life I highly recommend the series: The Gunslinger, The Drawing of the Three, The Wastelands, Wizard and Glass, Wolves of the Calla, Song of Susannah, and The Dark Tower"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is a beautifully written book.The good thing about this book is that it is fast paced and is highly fascinating.It is not the usual book you would pick up and read.This book would make you want to read all the sequels,for one simple reason.And that is that this book doesn't give us a clue as to what the dark tower is.But it still gives us hope as to what is yet to come.In this book Stephen King combines \\"clint eastwood\\" with \\"Tolkien\\" to give you a magnificent abnormal cowboy,Roland.This book doesn't explain who Roland is,really...it kind of drops you into a story that is already happening,and gives you a bit of the backstory as you go on.But not all of it...just enough to satisfy your hunger.And draw you on inexorably forward.The scene in Tull(a place in the story)gives you insight into the gunslinger's psyche,which is why it is surprising that he develops such strong feelings toward Jake(a character in the story)later on.However,you never doubt that it is the Tower that is Roland's highest priority,so you know what he will chose toward the end of the book.The final scene,when Roland finally catches the man in black(some of his enemies),is both a little anticlimatic(you expect there to be a much more violent encounter)and very deep(you learn things that you will not understand until they are revealed in several books later).Also,you get a good look into the working of Roland's world..and all worlds..and you see how King has drawn lines between som many of his books and is drawing them together into a web of interconnected stories.It is truly an incredible beginning to an incredible tale.This interesting book introduces most of the characters that will be with Roland throughout his quest for the DARK TOWER.It is well paced and doesn't go as in depth with the characters as some of his other books do.However,it does its job very well...which is to introduce the characters,give you some insight into them,foreshadow what they may be capable of(under the circumstances),and begin the delicate task of weaving them together.It also does a pretty good job of explaining the concept of KA and making you wonder if coincidences really exixt,or if it is all part of some great plan...I would not advise you to rush through this book.They are details that will become relevant later in the story.They are so many things(I guarantee you)that you would not understand until you read the others.So have a little patience.This book(a good way to put it)I would consider to be only an introduction.The real story starts from part 3-the wastelands.Until you reach that book,you have to read the first two and just keep the basic facts in your mind until the time comes in the later books to understand it...This is a very easy yet difficult review to write.Because I guess that is just the way it is.Because normally a Stephen King review/Book would involve a normal \\"world\\" like ours with normal people who are tortured in his stories!But in this book STEPHEN KING creates a whole new world,which I am giving you a formal invitaion to Enter.And do so with the utmost importance,because STEPHEN KING know no mercy!..........enjoy...Nigel"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The Gunslinger\\" has no easily understandable plot. It is the introduction to the epic that follows. In the beginning, I was hopelessly confused. I had no idea why Roland was looking for the man in black, where he was, where he was from, or what the heck was going on. By the end of the book, I knew a little more, but not enough. Maybe that is why so many are addicted to this series.Beware: this is a bloody, dark, and violent tale with a main character you aren't sure whether to cheer for or despise. Is he a hero.....or what? Now I will have to read at least the next book in the series to see if I can learn any more. But this book in itself was an unsatisfying read. I don't know if I want to sign up for the 7-volume-epic ride. Especially if they are all as bizarre as this one."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is without a doubt the best book I've ever read. It is written in such a poetic, discriptive form that it is hard to put down. A very original idea and plot, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As many other people have said, including Stephen King himself, this book is quite a bit different from his normal horror-style books. The writing in the book is done well, and leaves a certain amount of mystery that leaves you wanting to read on about Roland of Gilead, the gunslinger himself. Unfortunately, the vague past given about Roland can leave people confused or just make them loose interest. The first book is slightly different from the later books, but it is interesting in its own ways. The little links to our world definately add to the story, making you really think about the world you're reading about. This book is definately worth reading, but be prepared to have the urge to read the rest of the sprawling series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Somewhere around 30 years ago Stephen King began a saga (one which many of us wondered if he'd ever finish) of epic proportions: The Dark Tower. Personally, I think it is his best work. The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland, Jake, the man in black, and the Dark Tower. It's a series of interrelated long short stories. And you can tell it is an older piece of King's, it reads like an older work of King's (even though he has somewhat revised it slightly in this latest edition). But still, even though it hasn't the narrative speed the other volumes has, it has its charm, and it is vital in introducing us to the character of Roland and Roland's quest. If you haven't started this series yet, why wait? He's finished the story. Get to it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Fans be warned: \\"The Gunslinger\\" is definitely not typical King fare. But I wouldn't have it any other way.The basic premise of the book is as such: Roland Deschain is the Last Gunslinger (a kind of uber-cowboy, so to speak) in a seemingly post-apocalyptic world, traversing the desert in pursuit of an adversary aptly named the Man in Black.King will amaze you with the deep descriptiveness of this novel. You'll actually SEE the desolate look of desert town dwellers, actually FEEL the sand whip at your face.All in all, \\"The Gunslinger\\" is just a beautiful novel, and the start of something much greater. If you enjoy(ed) this book in any way, be sure to pick up the rest of the Dark Tower books (\\"The Drawing of the Three\\" is the next book in the series, FYI)."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Master storyteller Stephen King launches one of the greatest epics of modern times, The Dark Tower, in this introductory novel - The Gunslinger. In barely half the length of an average King novel, we are introduced to the main character of the series and given an eerie look into his background and a foreshadowing of his future.The Gunslinger, also known as Roland, is on a quest for The Dark Tower - but more immediately he must track down the Man in Black and try to seek vengeance for all the wrongs he has caused along his path. Along the quest he picks up a companion - a boy named Jake - who claims to be from a different time and place altogether. And this is only the beginning...If you are a fan of great quests and fantasy writing the likes of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (King admits that Tolkien's stories were an inspiration for this tale) then you will thoroughly enjoy the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Right from the start the Gunslinger grabs your interest and doesn't let it go. King gives you a character you know nothing about and has you hooked on him after five pages. In a world very similar to our own, the gunslinger is on a seemingly never ending quest after the Man in Black. In this battle of good and evil, King shows why he is one of the great writers of today.Roland (the Gunslinger) is the last of a lost group of heroes. The story carries you with him across a desert and through a mountain in pursuit of the Man in Black and in search of the Dark Tower. On his Quest, the Gunslinger befriends an overly sexual bartender named Allie and a young boy named Jake. Roland's speed and sureness with decisions has major effects on his relationships with both. King also mixes in brief stories from Roland's past that fill you in on what and who he really is.With a very deep final chapter, King finishes the novel with a strength that no one else could. This ending grandly sets up the next book in the series, where one can only hope that King keeps the greatness of this novel alive in the next instalment of the Dark Tower."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"He wrote this book in 1970(published in 1982) and it started the series that holds his whole literary universe together. A little tough to read especially if you have been introduced to King through his newer works, it is still by far one of his best. Once you read this book you will be compelled to get into the series. I highly reccomend the book and the series. But you don't have to take my word for it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King is one of the greatsest writers, alive or dead. However, when I came to read the start of what I thought was going to be a fantastice, un-put-downable series, I was sorely disappointed. I read it all in one hour, in the hope of finding a half decent paragraph which made any sense, but I didn't. Never mind, King, one failure out of many successes isn't so bad, but still....."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book just isn't any good. There are moments of enchantment and fantasy. However, they are bogged down by King's pretentious use of character dialogue (you need a dictionary at every page of the book) and King's unimaginative way of using made up words (to obviously describe made up worlds and their societies) without defining what the words actually mean! It's bad writing at best. It's as if King wrote this thinking it was going to be special and great and that it was going to be his \`Narnia' or \`Lord of the Rings.' Not even close, bro. I sadly bought the second book when I bought the first one. Not even going there... I look forward to reading his new book, \`Under the Dome.' However, skip this bloated piece of self indulgence and save your cash..."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I suspect King imagined countless scholarly students pouring over this work in another 100 years, following a carfully-crafted path of symbolism much like Chaucer's works referenced in the afterword.Along with his usual tedious description, King gives us a story written in a characteristicly pompous voice. With no real plot and characters drawn in fluid terms that don't every quite allow us to engage with them, this novel doesn't make for an entertaining read.If you want to follow King down the rabbit hole he dug, you'll enjoy The Gunslinger. But if you believe he would do well with an editor who had an affinity for chopping large swaths of description and one that insisted on him having at least some thread of a reasonable plot, then don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I read this book 6 years ago before I started college and it's as memorable as my freshman semester's party induced blur. This book's no party though. Some dude wanders around in the desert for 300+ pages. Wow."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have a hard time getting into King's books, because he is so slow going. This book started out slow and ended slow. Do not waste your money buying this book. Unless you have insomina."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"poorly written story. much of it seems rushed and just doesnt make sense. i am a fan of steven king horror books, but this story sucks. i felt no excitement or sense of completion at the end of the story, no sense of climax. i know this is a series, but there is no sense of reward when finishing this volume."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I haven't read the book yet, this is just a review about the \\"sample\\" for kindle. The point of a sample is to read some of the book, not a forward, not a story of how the author got inspired to write the book. That was the entire sample for this, heck even that didn't get to finish!I would like to really sample the book before purchase."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I enjoyed all 7 books in the series up until the last title - The Dark Tower - only to find the ending a complete disappointment. This was especially disheartening since the series itself took about 10 years to come out and I had been waiting years in between for each volume. I have enjoyed most of the Steven King novels I have read particularly the non-horror titles such as Dragon Tears and The Dead Zone. This final novel in the Gunslinger series however disappointed completely. I would like to see it republished with an ending that is fitting of the talent of the author."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I couldn't get into it. I'm a woman and I was either bored to tears, or felt like I was watching a western on TV for the millionth time. Maybe like some Clint Eastwood westerns, it appeals more to guys than women. For me that was it anyway."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"A Good Review of a Bad BookThe man in black fled across the dessert, and the man in black followed. After that sentence the rest of the book is confusing. THE DARK TOWER: THE GUNSLINGER, written by Stephen King is a very slow moving book. There isn't much description and the plot is very confusing. The characters are never really introduced or described. The book just starts out with you in the middle of the action. When the gunslinger is running across the dessert.This book does have a simple plot. This book is basically about a guy, named Roland, or the gunslinger running across the desert. You would think that the plot would be easy to follow but it's not. Stephen King uses unknown words to try and make his book interesting.I would not recommend this book to any one, but if I was locked up and the only way to get out was to recommend this book I would have to say that science fiction people and fans of Stephen King might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I am not going to go into detail, I see a this has already been done quite well. This is the first book in the Dark Tower series and it was great. I thought the writing was superb and the story enthralling. If you enjoy Stephen Kings novels be sure to check this book out. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I should say that in spite of being an academic, I'm a big fan of King's (Harold Bloom be damned). I've intensely enjoyed several of his stand alone novels and so looked forward to reading what many have described as his magnum opus. The Stand, Christine, The Dead Zone, Different Seasons, Needful Things...these are all excellent reading.Which is why I found The Gunslinger disappointing. The word that keeps coming to mind is enigmatic. King is a master of keeping things secret, of letting you dread what they might be until you find out for certain what they are. Here, however, the lack of information only kept me from caring about Roland, his quest, or the companions he made. I just wasn't emotionally invested, and for King, that's highly unusual.I've noticed that a lot of the positive reviews regarding the Gunslinger were written by people who have gone on to read other volumes in the Dark Tower series. So I find that encouragement enough to go ahead and give The Drawing of the Three a chance. And now I hear that King has made revisions to The Gunslinger since completing the series. So, I'll take that as a good sign that the story heats up somewhere in the next thousand pages. After all, King has earned the benefit of the doubt; he's given me several hours of enjoyment in the past."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the start to a story that will bring every emotion out of you. The characters, landscapes, different worlds, languages, fantasy, majic all tie in together and create a simply wonderful journey for a reader. To read this book and the entire story, please keep an open mind, let your imagination runn wild, and remember that this is a story that came out of a writer who struggled with this for 23 years yet he leaves enough for you to decided a lot of things for yourself. All the loose ends become tied together so keep reading. But above all read the books for the story not the ending, but I promise you'll be suprised and hopefully as I was, incredibly enlightened."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"First in the long-running Dark Tower series, The Gunslinger is a poetic, nightmarish tale set in a world parallel to ours. I found the single-minded Roland of Gilead a compelling figure, and his dreamlike journey evocative and fascinating. There is a bleak, end-times feel to the world he inhabits, which perfectly suited the late 20th century when this novel was first published. Some readers may be put off by the dreamy quality of this story and by the lack of a resolution, but for those of you who intend to climb that Dark Tower, this is the place to start."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"... and not as good as the second book. Looking forward to reading the rest!!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Now I have read about 5 of Kings books and most of them were written in a way that flows and is very enjoyable to me. This book however, seemed to jump around alot and be hard to stick with. The storyline was interesting and the action is awsome but the overall writting style put me off and that is why I gave this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This was the kind of book you can read during a saturday/sunday reading fest. I liked the lead character Roland a lot. If you like those, &quot;End of the World&quot; type stories, where there are only a few people left alive on the earth, you will love this story."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The first book of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. You've probably read all of the other reviews, and know a little of the background, so I won't get too much into that. I just want to warn that this book is very unusual, mostly in a good way. It is quite wordy, and you'll probably have to refer to a dictionary for a good handful of definitions to a few of the more obscure words. It also doesn't flow quite as well as one would expect it to, you have to really dig your heels in and focus. In fact, it is almost as though the story takes place in a dream, where events can sometimes seem muddled by the lack of comprehension. One thing that I didn't really understand is, how could Roland feel practically no remorse for killing the woman whom he slept with a number of times and lived with briefly, and yet, whenever the boy Jake dies, he is terribly upset? In other words, Roland isn't quite so well balanced here, although he has plenty of room to improve. I will admit that I read through this book as briskly as I could, for there are a lot of dull parts. It's probably his shortest novel, and yet, as he admits in the afterword, took the longest to write. I'm just on book two of the series so far, but trust me, it gets much better. It was an early effort, though, and it isn't so bad considering how old King was when he wrote it. A unique blend of fantasy, western, science fiction, and horror, you might just want to check this out, see how you like it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I thought this book was great. From the moment I started it I could not put it down. It is my least favorite out of the series, but it is still an excellent book. I recommend this book to anyone who likes western fiction or fantasy. Roland is like a lone cowboy, but the world around him is full of fantasy. It only gets better when we are introduced to new characters in the next books."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"If you like action adventure and just plain wierd shi*, then I would sugest the GUNSLINGER. We get to fallow the jorney of a man who is a bit more like a cowboy with an attitude. I have to say that this book is a bit better than the average book so pick it up."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"[this was in very good shape ] [ASIN:B001MNF7IO The Dark Tower #1 (\\"The Gun-Slinger Born\\", Volume 1)]]"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The most regrettably revealing thing about \\"The Gunslinger\\" (Stephen King's first entry in the lengthy \\"Dark Tower\\" series) comes in the Afterword, wherein the author reveals that the novel was written in bursts over the course of 12 years, and certainly reads like it. There are jagged, even clumsy, transitions (giving the whole book an awkwardly episodic feel), and a large number of typographical errors (note: I read the first-edition Plume version) that made the prose itself look sloppy, and pulled me out of the story--however momentarily--every time. I have been a fan of King's horror fiction for years, and finally decided to embark on \\"The Dark Tower\\" series due to the glowing accolades of fellow King fans--\\"The Gunslinger,\\" however, exhibits a decent, fairly compelling story saddled by the author's then-developing writing ability. Let's be honest: King didn't come out the gate the compulsively readable author he is today, and this book is crippled further by the fact that it's trying to speak in a separate voice from his more 'conventional' fiction. The resulting prose occasionally comes off as a pretentious, unhappy marriage of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" meets dark, grisly horror, with King's own square-peg voice trying to jam itself in a round hole. As a beginning to a much larger whole, \\"The Gunslinger\\" is passable, but leaves much to be desired, and probably would have given King a rejection notice had it been his first novel. That being said, \\"The Drawing of the Three\\" (book 2 in the DT series) shows King's prose in a more confident, creative, and readable spot. I'm only 100 pages into it so far, and the difference in quality is astounding."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is simply captivating. The reason I gave it four stars was due to the fact that you can tell King was young when he wrote this. This is the book after new revisions and 30 pages extra. I can only imagine what it was like on initial release. There are points where things don't quite make sense. I am hoping they tie in later.Also, in this surreal world there are parts of the world that are basically stole from our world. The names primarily really got me upset. He also uses some key \\"big words\\" over and over. It is a very entertaining read, but even for a person who isn't good at grammar, like myself, it is easy to pick out mistakes."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The Dark Tower\\" was a very far-fetched book. It contained some very confusing parts that made it somewhat difficult to read. There was not much of a beginning to this book. It felt like the author just threw the reader right into the plot without defining the book at all. I found it very difficult to get into the plot because the style of writing was very confusing because of flashbacks that pop up without any warning. Instead of just beginning a new chapter for a flashback, King just started a new paragraph and it became very confusing. I believe that \\"The Dark Tower\\" could use some work especially with the development of the story.The book begins with the gunslinger chasing a man known as the \\"man in black.\\" He follows him through the desert for several days. The gunslinger then comes to Tull, which is a town in the middle of this desert. What the gunslinger doesn't know is that the man in black has cast a spell on the townspeople so that they will attempt to murder him. The gunslinger meets a woman who runs the bar and sleeps with her in her room above the bar for the few days that he is in town. On his last day in town, his is buying supplies and is ready to leave when the townspeople attack. He however is a gunslinger and manages to shoot all forty-one people in town and escape with only minor injuries. The gunslinger stays in town one more night to recover from the fight and leaves town the following morning. He continues across the desert for a few more days before coming across another village. He becomes friends with one of the men in that town and stays the night in his hut. The next day he heads out again on the trail of the man in black. Many days later he comes across a farm occupied only by an eleven-year-old boy named Jake. They become good friends and after gathering food and water they both continue across the desert. A few days later they come to some mountains and after a day's climb they spot the man in black far above them. About a week later they catch him on the other side and the gunslinger shoots at him but is unable to harm them. Next Jake and the gunslinger enter tunnels under the mountain and find railroad tracks with a handcar. They continue through the tunnels for a few days before coming across some strange creatures that try to kill them. They however get away and continue on the trail of the man in black.This book wasn't extremely hard to understand after I got used to the flashbacks to the gunslinger's childhood. The plot became easier to understand, the further I read and it became pretty interesting. The author does a very good job of taking a far-fetched type of story and making it semi-believable. His descriptions were very good in that the reader could almost see what he was trying to show. The character development of this story was fairly poor because people kept kind of appearing. However, the book was still fairly interesting. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who is very down to earth or to someone who has trouble staying with the author because the book jumps around a lot and some of the content is very hard to believe. I would however recommend this book to people who can follow the author's descriptions and who can understand far-fetched plots. \\"The Dark Tower\\" is a pretty good book for someone who can understand the type of story but, overall I was kind of disappointed because I have read some much better works by Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King, to me, is not the greatest author I have ever read but is by far my favorite. In all I have read nearly thirty of his books and was very disappointed to hear of his recent retirement plans, though I knew of rumors for some time. Hearing that his final three books--after From A Buick 8, which I just received as a birthday present--were to be the final chapters of the Dark Tower series, I decided to begin reading them considering I had passed them over in the past.There are some good things about The Gunslinger. For instance, it's a short, quick read. At only three hundred pages it's a rather speedy read, though not his best. What I love about King is his characterization and snappy dialogue. Here we receive none of that. Yes, I'm aware that the gunslinger himself is supposed to be a shady character and wasn't annoyed by that, but there is little information on the other characters. Added to that, we have short, choppy scenes and dialogue. The only memorable part of the book to me is when he felled Tull in its entirety.I'll finish reading the Dark Tower series--or at least the other three that have been published to date--but stick by my decision to call 'Salem's Lot his greatest work. (Along with the Dark Tower series I have saved The Stand and will be reading that shortly.) To fantasy lovers like myself, it is not the best work of fiction, but enjoyable...a good read for traveling, I'd say."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is light compared to his other stuff. I didn't mind it though. I'm half way through his second novel Drawing of The Three and I'm liking it much better."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Dark Tower starts out with the catchy opening line of &quot;The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.&quot; Unfortunately, Stephen King doesn't make it really clear as to WHY the gunslinger is chasing the dark man in the first place. One can only presume that the gunslinger is the good guy and that the dark man is the bad guy that needs to be killed ASAP.For the first hundred or so pages you read about the gunslinger hanging around wasted towns in the middle of some Sahara desert from hell. The next hundred pages or so deal with Jake, some kid that comes from our world. In addition to that, Jake and the gunslinger start chasing the dark man through the desert. In the final three hundred pages the two main characters follow the dark man to a large mountain, where the gunslinger finally confronts him.The last chapter, &quot;The Gunslinger and the Dark Man&quot; is one of the more interesting parts of the book. The two of them have a discussion along the lines of &quot;what if our universe were just a speck of dust on a blade of grass, and that blade of grass was inside another universe, and that universe was inside ANOTHER one&quot;, etc.So with that in mind, if I look at the BIG PICTURE, The Dark Tower is just another novel in a universe filled with novels. To me, there was nothing in this book that made it outshine anything else. While reading this book I got the feeling that Stephen King wasn't sure what he wanted this book to be--Western (The Gunslinger), Fantasy (Tarot cards and a primitive setting), Literature (Childe Roland to the dark tower came . . .), or Horror (The Dark Man, the Slow Mutants). Stephen King also borrows a little from the Bible (Abraham and Isaac = Gunslinger and Jake), which isn't surprising, since he's done it before.I'll credit King on one account, though, he does know how to keep a book flowing. But once I get to the end I don't feel like I've got anything to show for it--except I can say, &quot;I've read it.&quot;In the Afterword, Stephen King says how, &quot;A sort of hush fell over my previously busy creative life--not a writer's block, but a sense that it was time to stop goofing around with a pick and shovel and get behind the controls of one big great God a'mighty steamshovel, a sense that it was time to try and dig something big out of the sand.&quot;So Stephen King supposedly dug deep--and all he could dredge up was about 2 or 3 main characters, a desert, a mountain, and some flashback scenes? He dug something big allright--a big dissappointment.He should have dug deeper."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Not to totally down Stephen King (because I am a fan!) I couldn't get through this book. I'm sorry, but it was just so BORING. It is a western, which is not what Stephen King writes. It wasn't a pleasant read for me, unfortunately. Sorry Stephen, but this series was just unreadable for me!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I loved books 1 & 2. Unfortunately it's midnight, I'm on vacation and I just found out that amazon doesn't have book III available for the kindle.As fellow kindle readers, I'm sure you can understand the pain.Amazon should have a giant disclaimer for any incompete series they sell on the kindle before you purchase he first book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I must admit I was a little skeptical at first.

I have read 1,2,3 and almost done with 4. Leaves me on the edge of my seat I can't wait to find out the ending."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This saga is so different than anything Stephen King has ever written and truly unique. It's the shortest of the books in the Gunslinger series and a good opening to a magnificent adventure. I had this book on my shelves for years and couldn't get into it. I tried to read it twice and gave up after the first 20 pages or so. A few years back, I decided to give it another chance and read the book in just a few hours. Once I got a feeling for the story, I really found myself able to get into the world that King was describing.This book is not at all dynamic by itself, but it sets up a foundation for what is to become the best series I've ever read. Do yourself a favor and give this a read...and then the next book...and so on. You will not be disappointed. Once you enter the world of Roland of Gilead, The Last Gunslinger, you will never want to leave."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I am very late to start reading this series but I am very glad that I started. I finished this book in only one day which is a rarity for me, but it was so well written that I could not help myself.The Gunslinger is by far my favorite Stephen King character to date. He is mysterious, there's alot to learn about him, and I think he looks like Clint Eastwood from back in the day.Despite this book being short a lot does happen and you might not understand it all, but no worries because there is 7 more books to learn from.Any King fan or someone looking for a long series to read needs to read this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is one series by Steven King that I simply love. I have collected all the books to the series twice now, and have read it at least 5 times and am happy to get the latest in the series. It simply put: The book gets into your head and you cant get it out til your done reading it!!!! I love it!!!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is book one of The Dark Tower series; it could stand on its own if someone actually wanted to only read The Gunslinger. I will not be that person. What a great story. It was crafted so gradually, I had no idea what was really going on until the end - which is how a great book is written. It sort of sucked me in one page at a time. The book is about a man tracking another man - and throughout the story we find out why - and where we are in time. That's it. So simple, yet this story is so full of nuances that I couldn't put it down. I am officially all-in on this series and can't wait to start the next book!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"It's quite a big deal when one of the most renowned authors of our time is influenced by the greatest artisan of fantasy writing. Stephen King was enamored by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series of books and thus they became the inspiration that motivated him into creating what he considers his magnum opus: The Dark Tower series. King wanted to write a fantasy journey that he felt was just as epic and large in scope as the Fellowship's quest to destroy the Ring of Power atop Mount Doom. Though at the same time he wanted his tale to reflect his own personal style of writing and identity. With this in mind, King chose to forgo the traditional genre conventions of elves and dwarves in the favor of guns and cowboys while wrapping it up in his unique flair of mysticism. The result is a look and feel that retains King's knack for the unexplainable but still maintains a distinction from his other literary works of horror. It's unlike anything King has written before and frankly, it's unlike anything I've ever seen.The plot is very minimalistic, but I feel that was by design. Roland the Gunslinger is on a mission to defeat The Man in Black, an adversary he's been hunting for years. Though ultimately, The Man in Black is the stepping stone in his mission to find the Dark Tower. The central nexus point of time which has supposedly disrupted its natural flow resulting in the abnormalities seen in the book. While this is minimal when compared to other novels, the core of The Gunslinger is about Roland's journey and the people and places he sees along the way, making it more about the quest itself rather than the destination. Reading this book felt like being set adrift on a boat in the middle of the ocean. You have no bearings or sense of destination; you can only go where the wind takes you, wherever that may be. I liked the sense of freedom this gave the narrative, but if you're looking for a deep plot than you'll be disappointed. This is a book that's meant to let your mind and imagination wonder, not ponder.But what really sets The Gunslinger and the rest of the Dark Tower series apart is that it's an amalgamation of various different genres. By the book's cover it has obvious roots in the western genre, with King even admitting to being heavily inspired by the classic spaghetti western \`The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.' But there's much more than that, such as strong elements of low fantasy with the more fantastical segments taking place in a world that is supposedly like our own, and even some science-fiction from the elements of time travel. There's also a strong sense of mystery that surrounds the book and its characters. Who were the Gunslingers? What's the Dark Tower? And who or what is The Man in Black? Like Roland himself, you just have to press on, and hopefully the answers will be waiting at the end. This union of vastly different genres would have normally made for an incoherent novel that's trying to accomplish more than it can handle, yet King manages to keep it from falling apart in a believable fashion.Reflecting the arcane aspects of the world and his mission, Roland the Gunslinger is a man of mystery. He's the quintessential western folk hero, an enigmatic figure on a righteous path for justice. But as the story progresses and more insight into his past is revealed, the reader slowly begins to unravel more of the mysterious wanderer. Though while he's an excellent lead, he's hardly a character you can form an emotional attachment to. Whereas the young boy from the future, Jake, felt like the heart of the book for me. The companionship between Roland and the boy really brought a smile to my face and the perilous journey to find The Man in Black and the Dark Tower all the more daunting. The villain, The Man in Black, felt more like an entity rather than an actual character in the story. He's given very minimal attention and exposition, but his dark presence is always felt. Longtime King fans will recognize him as Randall Flagg, a character that King has included in many of his different works.Special attention must also be given to Stephen King's incredible prose that he uses to illustrate the book's mystifying flair of wonder. However, for me this came off as a rather double-edged sword. When The Gunslinger is at its best, King is able to transport the reader into a semi dream-like trance, further immersing them into the incredible world King has crafted and suspending their disbelief on the unexplainable events that transpire. The potential downside for me at least, is that some passages felt more like a disorganized mess of thoughts rather than a coherent narrative. Moments like these were frustrating and really pulled me out of the story.In the end, The Gunslinger was a bit of a mixed bag for me. I liked the sense of adventure and mystery King instilled with his unique style and the mashing of several classic genres into something that King can call his own. And while I don't usually prefer shallow plots, I am willing to make an exception with the direction King was taking the book. Yet I felt the narrative sometimes fell flat, and the ending was very unsatisfying. The Gunslinger is definitely worth checking out for its peculiarities, even if I don't absolutely love it, but I certainly do like it enough to see where this journey ends."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I love this book and couldn't get the second one in the series quick enough. Felt the same about the third. That's when it happened. I have been reading these on my Kindle and when I went to get the third one it is not availiable from Amazon. Are you kidding??? I can buy the paper version from them. I love the Kindle system but this may be the straw that broke the Kindle's back for me. I actually got the book for a dollar cheaper and down loaded it to my iPad. No problem at all. So Amazon it sad that you can't even support your own stuff."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've been a Stephen King fan since I was about 9 and 20 years later I'm finally taking on one of the Dark Tower novels I've heard fantasy nerds rave about. I find this entire genre perplexing and have held my nose up around those who enjoy this sort of thing.King seems to just be warming up in this brief novel (and at 8 books and counting, he certainly was just getting started) about The Gunslinger and his quest to capture \\"the man in black.\\" As I sort of figured I would, I enjoyed the opening salvo, an ode to westerns. The further the book got the more the narrative turned to talk of wizards and fate and Fate. If this were anyone other than an already highly regarded author such as King, I would no doubt have been rolling my eyes in parts. Some scenes were rather memorable and exciting and I loved the paintings included. I look forward to reading book two with equal parts excitement and trepidation."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This review might contain small spoilers for later books in the series.I found the story of The Gunslinger difficult to follow in the beginning. Just being tossed into a fantasy world without much description of it's general history I found to be a little confusing. As the book progressed I found it became easier to follow (maybe it just took me some time to get into the story). I really enjoyed the overlap with pieces of the 'real' world. My favorite character was Jake, and I was disappointed when it seemed that his storyline would be cut short.Overall I didn't really care for this book, but the introduction to key characters and the world in general makes it essential to continue the series. I'm on book five now, and really liked the books after this one. So if you read this one and you're not sure if you want to continue, at least give the second book a try before calling it quits."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"i had read the first book of the dark tower series years ago and never went beyond book i. now i am hooked and already on the fourth volume of this series. stephen king has a way with designing his characters so that you are invested in their lives and quests. The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland. He is a hero and an anti-hero for his time and all of the times he crosses over into. King offers us images we are familiar with and twists them so while knowing them they become strange. i enjoy this about his books."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Reread this after reading The Wind through the keyhole just to re acquaint with my old friends.

Roland is compelling and well-developed. As his history is revealed, your entanglement in his world and his quest is almost inevitable. His reprehensible traits are well-balanced with his admirable, making him a rich character to follow. I look forward to his continuing adventures!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"4.5 stars.\\"The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed.\\" With this line, the first book in The Dark Tower series was born. After having read this book at long last, I can see why Stephen King views this as pretty much his masterpiece. With rhythmic, beat-poetry-like narration and a surreal, almost hypnotic setting, I can honestly say that while I had no idea what was happening with this book (I'll explain), I loved every paragraph along the way.Roland Deschain is a gunslinger, of the Wild Western lot, and possessing an almost sacrosanct duty to keep peace and order in his land. He is the last of his kind and has spent as long as he can remember chasing the man in black, and, more importantly, the elusive Dark Tower. The setting of this book was surreal, a somewhat transcendental afterlife which had elements of the romanticized Wild West--desert, saloons, gunfights--mixed in with stylized speech patterns and bits of details long forgotten, taken from present day. The effect is an air of \\"otherness\\" which gives this book a very distinct feel as the story progresses.The main character, Roland, was one of those dark, mysterious figures that plays things close to the chest, has an array of deadly talents, and has the quiet authority that duly impresses. Quite simply, he reads like a badass, and proves how much he is one throughout the book. At the same time, however, there are moments of clarity in which the reader can see how human the gunslinger is, particularly in contrast to such an inhuman wasteland that serves as backdrop for this book. It was very easy to feel for the character, despite how hardened he was.While certain elements weren't really made clear--namely what, explicitly, the Dark Tower actually was--it's the open-endedness of that question that keeps you turning the pages. The newness and the compelling characters certainly kept my interest; however, the rather nonlinear plot left me wondering what the point of the story was, if there was one. By book's end, I wasn't sure if I'd found an answer to that or not, but I still feel compelled enough by the story to give the second book in the series a try. A haunting combination of science fiction and horror elements, The Gunslinger is hands-down a well-written and fascinating book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This tale is resumption of the best story ever told. I could never imagine getting more out of a book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I had a hard time liking roland because he let the boy die but was happy that he saved the boy in the drawing of the three"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have tried for a long time to like Stephen King... starting quite a few books (simply because all my friends read him) and seldom finishing them. This was no exception. I guess this simply isn't my cup-of-tea style of book, although I assume he is a good writer."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The imagery in this novel is awesome. The bulk of the story is in a western style post apocalyptic desert. There's saloons, gun fights and creepy abandoned towns. The Gunslinger also had flashbacks that took us to some kind of medieval-style fantasy world and we even meet a character that took us back to current time New York. I couldn't figure out how they all fit together though. I spent most of this story trying to piece together details to help me figure out the plot. Roland, The Gunslinger, is on the tail of The Man In Black and chasing him through the desert. I think he is chasing him to find some kind of tower. I am not sure why we want to find The Tower. The book is full of creative details that I spent too much time trying to figure out in hopes that they might be connected to the plot. For example, in this futuristic world, poker is called 'Watch Me'. It took me half a chapter to figure this out and it added nothing to the plot! I was starting to have a hard time turning the pages. There wasn't enough back story to explain what was going on. Roland also had a very disconnected character and in the beginning I took this as part of his 'bad ass take no prisoners' persona. Then we get introduce to the kid and I realized that the characters are just underdeveloped. I felt no heart ache in their moments of loss and I should have. The reader spends the entire book chasing after The Man in Black to find The Tower. We never find out what The Tower is and we never find it. Very unsatisfying. Stephen King failed to hook me with this first book and I won't be continuing with the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

Many people have recommended the series, but I guess I've been biased: I didn't think Stephen King would be able to write a good fantasy novel, let alone a series. I was wrong. Dead wrong. From the first sentence, \\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed\\", I knew I was hooked. Just shy of a week later I had nearly completed the first four books of the series. And in my opinion, that's a great review in itself. If you like fantasy novels, mystery, a bit of horror and good old western tales (be it books or movies), this is a book for you!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This first book will leave you wanting to read the rest of the series. One of my favorite books!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have not read any Stephen King in many years; a reference to the number 19 and The Gunslinger, by a coworker, got me curious. Now, I am hooked.The Gunslinger is neither a western novel nor a horror novel in the classic sense of either of those genres; it is more of a combination of fantasy and suspense with a splash of the horrific and a touch of the western. Excellent character development kept me worried as to what was going to happen next. The use of Old West objects, and some mid-century technology, in this future world made the world of the gunslinger bizarre and familiar at the same time.I am trying to tell you how cool the Gunslinger and his world is without giving anything away - this is not as easy as I thought."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\\"There's really not much more you need to know about this story except what's right up there. That's the essence of the whole thing - a chase. A man in black, who has obviously done something terrible, and a gunslinger, who is obviously going to set things right.If, by \\"set right,\\" you mean \\"kill a whole lot of people,\\" then you're pretty much on target.This is the beginning of Stephen King's Dark Tower series, a story told in seven volumes that manages to be the lynchpin for all the worlds that he has created. It's a story that was 22 years in the writing, and almost never got finished. It's an epic story, all about the endless quest for the Dark Tower, the center of all reality, the axle upon which the wheels of creation move.Roland, the gunslinger, is hunting for this tower. He wants it more than anything in the world. He has lost everything in pursuit of this tower - his friends, his family, his world - and yet he pressed on. The man in black has information for him, can set his path towards his goal. If only Roland can catch him.On his way to the man in black, Roland finds a small town taken over by a mad preacher woman, a sympathetic hermit, and a boy who doesn't look like he's terribly local to this world. All of them help point the way to the man in black, and none of them make it to the end with Roland. Even he is unprepared for the terrifying reality that awaits him when he and the man in black finally have their palaver....There truly is something magical about this book. Even if there were no other Dark Tower books, it would stand out as a good story, well told. Part of this is its deceptive simplicity - moving from point A to point B, with only a few flashbacks to fill in the backstory. Well, quite a lot of flashbacks, actually, seeing as how King did set this story in a featureless desert with a singular protagonist, and there's only so much you can work with without dipping into the well of the past from time to time.The glimpses of Roland's past that we get to see are tantalizing - they tell of a rich and cultured world that is nonetheless hard and merciless. The gunslingers are all that stand between civilization and chaos, and there are precious few of them left. Roland and his friends know they may be the last of their kind, but that doesn't deter them from pursuing their guns and growing up to honor their fathers.The fact that we know from the beginning that they all fail just makes it all the more poignant to watch them try.It's hard to talk about this book without trying to talk about the rest of the series, and it's even harder to convey the feeling of reading it when the series was still ongoing. My father, a huge Stephen King fan, had these books when I was a kid, and I eventually got into them, and was - like so many others - immeasurably frustrated by the pace at which King was writing them. I finished this book, which does not necessarily have a happy - or easy-to-understand - ending, and I wanted more. I wanted to know what Roland was going to do now that he'd had his palaver with the man in black, and I wanted to know if he would ever find the Dark Tower. Whom would he enlist in his quest, as the oracle had suggested? Whom else would he sacrifice, as he did young Jake?Speaking of which, the relationship between Roland and Jake is an interesting one, especially as I got older and re-read it. When I first read the book, I was probably around Jake's age - eleven years old [1]. Reading Jake's story of how he came to Roland's world was horrifying enough, but to see how their relationship would eventually end was even worse. The idea that there might be something more important to, say, my parents [2] than I was - well, that was horrifying. To think that a purpose might exist for which they would let me fall to my death.... That's not the kind of thing an eleven year-old boy wants to think about.From the point of view of an older person, a grown man, I found something uncomfortable about their relationship. The bond that formed between man and boy was instant, and intense, and having grown up in a culture where a strange man being that friendly to a young boy would be automatically colored with the taint of pedophilia, well, I had to work a little harder to stay in Roland's head. The fact that I know that wasn't where King was going with the relationship helps a little, but every reader brings his or her hang-ups along when they read and some of mine are a little more persistent than others. I'm sure any psychologist who needs to put a down payment on a yacht would be happy to help me work on it.All in all, it's an excellent beginning. What follows is a massive tale, a great quest that spans time and space and reality, culminating in Roland's final understanding of who he is and why he exists. Not all of it is as good as this book, but it's still worth reading, I say ya true.So put on your good boots, don't forget your hat and horn and donkey. It's a long trip to the end....-------------------------------------------\\"This is not the beginning but the beginning's end. You'd do well to remember that... but you never do.\\"- The Man in Black-------------------------------------------[1] This is another example of the Eleven Year-Old Boy Rule: if you have a major character in your book who is not an adult, chances are that it will be an eleven year-old boy. King is a master of this.[2] Because if Roland isn't a father-substitute then I don't know who is."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"A mysterious Gunslinger tracks a mysterious Wizard through a mysterious barren wasteland.Story:The story reminded me of the first season of LOST. It has all of the pieces of a familiar world, but the pieces don't quite fit together. The story begins with a Gunslinger from the old west, tracking a wizard dressed in black. The Gunslinger, named Roland, is on a single minded quest to kill the wizard. The quest takes him through a mysterious world that is a combination of the mid-west and the old west. At times the characters seem alive, dead, undead, or somewhere in between. The book doesn't give a lot of answers, but it's entertaining trying to figure out what is going on as you put the pieces together in your head.Writing Style:This is a page turner. The Chapters are broken down into scenes that last 2-5 pages and the book is less than 300 pages overall. The sentence structure is simple and the scenes are set with imagery. \\"The mountains dreamed in the background.\\" If you thought, \\"Huh? Mountains don't have dreams.\\" This isn't the book for you. But if you had an image in your mind of distant mountains barely visible through a haze of shimmering heat, then you should enjoy this.The story has a few flashbacks which answer some of the mysterious questions about the characters, but these flashbacks do break the momentum of the story. You just get glimpses of pieces, with no real answers.Characters:Roland is a gunslinger from the Old West. He's driven nearly to the point of madness.The Wizard has magic powers and seems to know a lot more than he's telling.There are a host of other characters who seem to be from different time periods. Because the book is so short, and there is so much mystery, the characters feel a bit light.Action:There is some gunslinging in the book and it's quite violent. Bullets do really bad things to a body.Maturity:There are sex scenes, violence, gore, horror, language, and complex situations.Kids should NOT read this book!Overall:The book does a good job at building a sense of mystery. The plot is not overly complex. The characters are not complex. But this is a page turner. If you found yourself addicted to Season 1 of LOST, and you were itching to find out what happened next, you will blow right through this book. Overall, the story is pretty light, but it is a good intro to a fantasy series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Quick read as well as a great start to the dark tower series.

I love this book the second time around."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I had never read a stephen king book when i first read this, 10 years ago, and i was certainly skeptical. Long story short, I was blown away by the style and how captivating the story and characters were. The world's concept alone is mind blowing: wild west meets post-apocalyptic meets King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table meets the Wizard of Oz. It's crazy stuff.This is a truly great story and, in my opinion, the best book in the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I'll be perfectly honest right up front. This book took a while for me to get into. It seemed to drag on for a while before it started picking up. Once it picked up, I couldn't put it down. Roland is a character with a deep rich history that i would have loved to have read more of, but that comes later in the series. No let down here. Four stars because it took so long to get going. Definitely worth picking up if you want a series that is fairly well screwed up as only King can do them!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I used to tell myself, you will not read this book. My inner monolouge went something like this: self, if you dare lay a finger on this series, you will become the biggest nerd in the world. Reading fantasy epics now, are we? Ohhhho, what next, Orcs, trolls, Lord of the Rings conventions dressed up as Froddo and the gang? I taunted myself with these ideas, and fled from the Dark Tower as surely as Roland and co. did when confronted with the quest originally. Well, let me tell you, nerd I may be, nerd I have become, or if you like, Nerd I am, I like green eggs and ham...and I like the Dark Tower too, thankee sai.I have to tell you, when I first closed the dusty spine of The Gunslinger, my first thought was meh, it was all right. Not great, but readable, sure. But I'm fed up now, stuffed of the book, maybe ready to close the door on the epic forever. The next day I take myself to cycling class, and while I'm plonked down on the bike, with the cheesy mountains painted on the wall behind me, and sweat flooding into my eyes, I think: The dark tower's closer. I'm getting there...I am...oh God, why didn't I bring water?....Another hill?!! Cycle faster, I've got to get away from that man in black!Lovely, crystal clear moments like this when the book comes back to haunt my daily life make me know without a shadow of a doubt, how good it is. I had Roland on my brain for a few weeks afterwards. Roland, and his silly little quest for the Tower. But was it so silly? And does he ever find the dang thing? Little questions like that would flit into my brain at odd intervals, and I would think about that strange Clint Eastwood-esque fellow, out in the desert all alone, traveling across the sand dunes. Stephen King said Roland wouldn't leave his imagination alone, and he wouldn't depart from mine either.Next thing I know, I'm at the library, checking out the second volume."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have just completed Stephen King's The Dark Tower. This is not a review for THE GUNSLINGER alone. It is for all seven volumes of The Dark Tower series, which should be read as one story.The Dark Tower, SK's magnum opus, is based on two fictional concepts: 1) Robert Browning's long poem \\"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\\" (provided in full in the Appendix of the seventh volume, THE DARK TOWER) and 2) Sergio Leone's series of movies starring Clint Eastwood as a gunslinging drifter.Is The Dark Tower worth reading? If you appreciate epic fantasy, yes. If you can tolerate occasional gaffs in writing style and convention, yes. If you despise horror, the supernatural, adventure, and action, and if you think such literature must be trashy pulp, no.THE GUNSLINGER introduces you to Browning and Leone's dual concept and to Jake. THE DRAWING OF THE THREE sets the mode: that of contemporary fantasy with portals to parallel worlds. And it introduces Roland's partners. THE WASTE LANDS is a good adventure in a parallel world. WIZARD AND GLASS for the most part digresses into Roland's past, but it is a superb story of romantic adventure. WOLVES OF CALLA stops along the way to the Dark Tower as Roland and his partners rescue villagers and display their gunslinging. SONG OF SUSANNAH is a story of unusual pregnancy, blending action and horror in a setting of modern America. THE DARK TOWER brings the long quest to a conclusion, with tragedy but also with ample good cheer. (Do read THE DARK TOWER'S Coda.)Though SK is one of contemporary humanity's more prolific, famous, and wealthy writers, do not confuse ability to sell with ability to write. I quail from the idea of every aspiring author trying to emulate him. For example he has a certain habit with concrete imagery. Stylists encourage concrete imagery, but SK gets carried away, at times making his prose feel phony and cheap. Mostly apparent in his descriptions of sex and violence, this habit pops up in other regards, as when he describes disease and excretion. In Writing Tools, Roy Peter Clark says, \\"Know when to back off and when to show off.\\" With universally familiar phenomena like sex and excretion, we do not need detailed concrete images. Those are times to back off.Also, SK likes to show off his skill with offbeat jargon in dialog and character viewpoints. But this makes too many of his characters appear alike, and unconvincing.And SK can be a bit verbose. Especially in the later volumes of this series, he seems to follow Strunk & White's admonition \\"Delete unnecessary words\\" less than he follows the apocrypha \\"The thicker the book, the more impressive it is.\\"Though I consider SK an occasional, worthy digression, I prefer standard prose, polished by authors (and editors) who pay close attention to Strunk & White's The Elements of Style. I award The Dark Tower five stars because I do not consider flawless prose a requirement and because The Dark Tower is a good story.Be it ever so, and I thankya."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The first part of the part was strange and a bit confusing. Perhaps that was the point. The second part of the book picked up the pace. Jake was a memorable character and the choice of the gunslinger with regards to Jake broke my heart. The meeting with the man in black was a bit anti-climatic. However, by the end of the book, I liked the gunslinger, even with his terrible flaws. I will continue with this highly acclaimed series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I'll be quick to say that I don't read fantasy, unless it's obviously a book like the Gunslinger.

Gunslinger gives you a nice introduction to Roland and the world he lives in. Great and entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed\\". The Gunslinger is a quick introduction into the Dark Tower Series. I have read the series 3 times in 15 years, and plan to read it a couple more. Every time I read it I can't stop picturing Clint Eastwood, in one of his spaghetti westerns, as Roland. I love the way King can create a world, and make it seem so believable. Roland is the best hero / villain combined in one character I have ever found in a story. He does not let anything stand in the way of his relentless pursuit of the Man in Black. Although admittedly not the best book of the series, still very good, and necessary to complete the entire tale."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger, by Stephen KingThe Master of the Macabre began writing this series of novels in the late 70's that dealt with a post apocalyptic world of guns, mutants and sorcery. The sensational saga began with this book, The Gunslinger; a weird hybrid of Western, horror, fantasy and science fiction. Roland is the main character, a deadly gunslinger on a quest to find the Dark Tower. Along Roland's journey he crosses the path of a strange assortment of characters and freaks. In one town alone he is forced to kill almost the entire population who relentlessly attack him as if possessed by vicious demons. During this engrossing encounter Roland unloads his trusty revolvers on the wicked and reloads them as if possessed himself. Sticking to the basics of the popular mainstream western genre Roland carries a pair of tuned 1873 Colt Single Actions he inherited from his father that are commonly referred to as the Peacemaker. It is a good description, for those looking down the barrel of these must quickly make peace with their maker... This is definitely an interesting beginning to an unreal and uncanny tale that took Stephen King decades to complete. This story and its series actually tie into a great deal of other books within King's horrific universe.Luckily for those with little patience or ability to focus on a book, Marvel Comics has been publishing an adaption that is illustrated pretty well by Jae Lee. I have read them all and have been pleased by how faithful to this outstanding series of books it has been. The luck continues because anyone interested could easily buy these issues in graphic novel form... all bound together and cheaper overall. This goes the same with an ongoing series of The Stand by Marvel Comics."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is easily one of my favorite series every, and the first book is damn near perfect in eyes. I enjoyed the whole series though, and thought it ended in a way that it should have.The first book is well written, has memorable characters, and is risky. It's not scary, and yet not timid. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I had heard great things about the \\"Dark Tower\\" series and finally decided to go ahead and give it a shot. This first book, \\"The Gunslinger\\" sets the tone rather well for the series, but is really unlike any other Stephen King book. It was a bit difficult to get \\"into\\" until after halfway through it (which didn't take long; it's a fairly short book).Once you get past the halfway mark, the story really gets going. Prior to that, all the \\"set-up\\" of following the Gunslinger on his quest to find the \\"Man in Black\\" is just...weird...for lack of a better description (even for the Stephen King world).The story is a good one, though. It's hard to describe without giving away some good tidbits of the Gunslinger's tale, but I recommend getting through this one. The others become REALLY engrossing from that point forward."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I first read this book when I was in high school around five years ago, when I borrowed it from a friend. I almost didn't give it back! Roland intrigued me, and the story just sucks you into the world that he lives in. You can't help but be drawn to the last gunslinger and his journey, the decisions that he had to make. Recently, as I was browsing at a book store, I saw these books again and-- I couldn't help it: I bought this and the next one right then and there. It made that big an impression on me. I'm not really a Stephen King reader -- he's talented but I never really was a fan. But this one-- the Dark Tower series will turn you into one."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"One reviewer quipped: &quot;It's a guy thing&quot; Whatever! What, only guys can enjoy a good read? Please.... Well, I am all woman and I LOVED this book! Roland is perhaps one of the most well written characters of the last century. A Flawed Hero...I have waited anxiously for each book and purchased them as soon as they were available."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King at his best! This book captured my attention and started me on the quest for the dark tower. It explores western and science fiction territories. It tells of good and evil and what one will do to reach his goal. The book gives the reader moments of sadness, happiness, and horror. All in all it is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I read this after a friend read it and loved it. I read it and thought it was mediocre at best. However, I refused to give up on the series and possibly miss out on a great saga, and I am very glad I didn't. After I read part II: The Drawing of the Three, I came to appreciate this book for what it is; a prologue of sorts, much like &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in the LoTR Trilogy. This book introduces you to Roland, and starts his massive quest for the Dark Tower.Each book in the series leave enough questions to keep you reading the series and wanting to understand everything. As the saga progresses, everything starts to add up and connect. That said, judging the series on a single one of the books would be a crime. I loved this, though it isn't his usual captivating horror. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"When I first ventured in to the realm of Roland of Gilead, it was thanks to an audiobook I received from my cousin at Christmas time. When I learned the title, I can, without any shame, say that I was less than enthused. That book was, The Drawing of The Three, the second book in this amazing masterpiece of American literature. From just the &quot;Argument&quot; section of DOTD, I was hooked. Upon completing the book, I was desperate to know more about the mysterious Roland: where he came from, what made him so driven? I immediately procured &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; and must say I enjoyed it thoroughly. It does answer many questions, but in typical Stephen King fashion, leaves many more to be answered. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that I believe DOTD is the place to start. Begin there, get sucked in to this amazing world, then backtrack and read the Gunslinger. All hale the King!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I want to say this carefully, because, in the end, \\"The Gunslinger\\" is a good book. It's mysterious, moody, and full of memorable imagery. You'll most likely be very glad you read it (especially in this new revised edition, which, interestingly, is tighter and yet breathes more at the same time). But you should be aware that this first volume in Mr. King's epic (and soon to be completed!) dark fantasy series does not quite reach the \\"must-read\\" status easily achieved by subsequent volumes in the \\"Dark Tower\\" epic. I'm betting, in fact, that many of you out there who read this book will say something positive but ultimately lukewarm at its close, something like this: \\"Good book, I'll have to pick up the next one one of these days.\\" And that would be a mistake, because you should pick up volume 2 (\\"The Drawing of the Three\\") immediately, not \\"soon\\" or \\"someday\\". The second volume is THAT good, showcasing King's imagination firing on all cylinders, with memorable, amazing scenes happening right out of the box. The plan may have been at least partially intentional... King may have said, \\"let's give the readers something more reserved and thoughtful at first, and then hit them hard in volume two by stirring in the really amazing and visceral stuff.\\" Anyway, read \\"The Gunslinger\\". It's great (I actually give it about three-and-a-half stars). But do yourself a favor and stay on the ride and keep reading the other books, when things really take off. Trust me, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"There is really something great about this. There is a bare bones emphasis on dialogue and scenery that his extremely well done. The characters are very interesting. The major action is de-emphasized. Clearly something for the fiction buff in the long, hot summer, but has something great and beyond just escape fiction in the telling."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is different from many of King's other works, but at the same time, it encompasses everything else he has written. It is best described as a western with a sci-fi twist. Roland is certainly one of the most complex characters King has written and he has many facets that are not discovered until later books in the series. Once you have read all 4 of the books in this series, you will find yourself re-reading other books just to pick up on the connection to the Dark Tower series. Insomnia, Hearts in Atlantis, The Talisman, The Black House, Salem's Lot, and The Eye of the Dragon as well as The Stand are all directly connected to the Dark Tower series in quite obvious ways, but everything else King has written is encompassed in the world we come to know in the series.If you don't read anything else written by King, you should read this series. It doesn't contain the horror so obvious in most of his other works, but you won't be sorry to have spent time on these books."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"When you will read this book you won't understand a lot of things (where, when). but dont afraid to waste time this book is so intresting and beutifly written that you will find yourself buying the following books in this siries.in them you will discover a holl new world that will follow you in your dreams. King succeded to make a wonderful mix of fantasy humor action and science fiction that I never met in any book. (I gave this book only 4 points comparing to the others in this series, atherwise it worse 5)"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"King draws you in to the alternate reality of Roland of Gilead by only hinting at the similarities and disparities between our worlds. There is clearly much that is left to know, but we are given a strong sense of the peril to Roland's world and, by association, our own. This short tale begins in the middle of Roland's quest to save the mythical Dark Tower from a danger we can only guess at, and leaves us as he begins the next stage of his journey. In between, we come to realize what the quest means to him through the sacrifices he is willing to make.For me, it's a masterful opening to a series that has all of us waiting anxiously for the continuation."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have read the entire set and repurchased the first three as a gift for my son. I think I'll borrow them back whe he's done and reread them! They came quickly, and packaged so that I could wrap them up and put them underneath the tree in plenty o f time for Christmas."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I'm finding it difficult to decide exactly how I feel about this book. At parts I loved it and at others I was bored by it. I think I will need a reread at some stage to more fully comprehend everything. It was enjoyable though and I look forward to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This one is the hardest to get into but once you do you wont regret it. ive read the series twice now"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"...and remembered why I liked it so much. Such a gritty, realistic intro to a unique and yet weirdly believable world. I definitely need to reread this series, although I remember being somewhat disappointed as the books progressed.

I like the aspect of a western as a knight."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"My third... ok fourth time reading and its like watching a favorite movie and seeing something you missed before.

I finished it in about 2 days, and loved every page. The story continues to be riveting, and the character of Roland is one of King's best creations. Good stuff, I highly recommend this book. Now, Mr. King, if you could only write these books more often than one every five years. Talk about an epic saga!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"AWESOME THIS BOOK KEPT ME GLUED TO IT UNTILL I WAS DONE. MAN IF YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE I SAY,READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This series of books are outstanding, absorbing, and surprisingly intellectual. The series is also very dark, much more so than I expected from the description on the back of the book, but King describes the moved on world with such poetic grace that one still wants to visit it. All in all one of the few literary masterpieces we have seen in the last few years, and will probably last for a long time into the future (although I think people 50 years from now will have a bit of trouble understanding the slang King loaded into &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot;). King continues to surprise me by balancing his mediocre works with literary masterpieces."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As a new listener of Stephen King, I did not expect to be drawn into the story by the characters. Each character comes to life so completely that you feel as if you know what they are thinking and feeling personally. I had thought of King as a author of horror, but this and the other titles in the Dark Tower series are not scary but rather a saga of a man who is committed to his quest of finding the Dark Tower. Some of the events seem a little like fantsy, but yet there is so much the reader can relate to that it is not a total trip into the unbelivable. I would recommend the entire Dark Tower Series to anyone who wants to be absorbed for hours. A totally wonderful series!!!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Personally, this was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The story follows a man on a lonely journey to pursue the mysterious man in black who holds the secret to his future. The scenes are dazzling and the symbolism will blow you away. This book will keep you reading until the climatic end with a special scifi twist to it. I definately give this book five stars :)"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've read most of the other reviews on this book and it seems to be at one extreme or another in terms of ratings. To those of you who gave the book a poor rating, I only ask that you give the book a chance. It's hard to appreciate this book without reading the rest of the series. I recently went back and read The Gunslinger again after reading the rest of the series and found it to be a much better read."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The First in a series of wonderful books, The Gunslinger takes the reader on a completely unexpected and yet familiar path. I read the whole freakin' thing in a day! It engulfed my interests and attention completely and wouldn't let go. It is most definetely my favorite book of all time (besides Insomnia). In closing, I implore you: Please read this book. You have no clue..."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is one of Stepehn Kings greatest novels written to date. It is an epic saga of good versus evil. Roland the last of the Gunslingers fills us with awe as we join him in his journey to the Dark Tower to save his dying world. Throughout his journey Roland is searching for the ominous Man in Black, who supposedy knows the direction to the Dark Tower. To meet The Man in Black Roland has to look at his past and defeat his inner demons"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The gunslinger is a hero with a moral and ethical code that guides him on the path of his quest. While not a fan of most of Stephan King's other horror type book, I found this very enjoyable, bringing in science fiction type view of a future world and one man's quest to reverse/repair what has caused his world to 'move on'. Main problem is that the next book in the series has not come out yet"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King embarks in a very long tale that only begins in this book and is supposed to take 5 or 6 other books to finish. Reading this book you have to understand that it is merely the beginning, and yet it is a very good book in itself. In &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; you enter the life of the last gunslinger in a world that has &quot;moved on&quot;, in his quest for the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; which in my opinion symbolizes the domain of the universe, some form of heaven. In this first book the gunslinger follows the man in black, who is his enemy. It takes you a while to understand and identify yourself with the gunslinger's world, but when you do, you can't get enough of it. I recommend it if you are planning on reading the others that follow. I am currently reading the third (The Waste Lands), and I have to say that you really get hooked when you are reading the second book"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger by Stephen King is the first book of his popular Dark Tower series. I believe at the moment there is a total of eight books that contribute to the series. To make it clear, I am not a Stephen King fan. I have read some of his books and for most of them, I found myself not liking more of them than the opposite. I've always wanted to give The Dark Tower series a go simply because of the brilliant things I have heard. The Gunslinger is the introduction to the series and gives us readers a chance to get our feet wet. At only 280 pages long, it's perfect for the introductory type books. Not too short but not absurdly long. The problem I have with the book is well, how boring it all is. I definitely expected something more grand, especially due to this being an introduction and as an author, you'll want to capture your audiences attention for the future books to come in the series. The Gunslinger is definitely anything but grand and in a way very disappointing.The Gunslinger introduces us to the character of Roland, the gunslinger himself. Right in the very beginning, you'll find out that he is on a task to chase and find the man in black and ultimately, to find the Dark Tower itself. Exactly why you have no idea. The more interesting part of the book is the alternate fantasy world (mid-world? limbo?) the characters live in. It has this American old west feel to it as many parts of the land is barren. It's hard not to picture of Roland as some kind of cowboy in a classic western movie. But besides that, the world is not exactly the world we live in today. His world has \\"moved on\\". Think of it as some sort of post apocalyptic world but not to the heavy extremes. Roland will meet characters that have been part of the before world, something he doesn't quite understand himself. Point is, the world they live in is fairly weird and it adds a mysterious feel to it.Between his travels from different places, the story would give us a flash back of Roland's childhood. The problem is everything just feels a bit odd. I had to constantly remind myself that the original version of this book was written many, many years ago. The author at that time was just starting his career. Much of the book surrounds Roland yet I'm not sure if he's the good guy, the bad guy or someone in between. It feels like a mess at times and the author definitely does help in any way with his writing style. Many users will feel completely frustrated throughout the book because not much is made clear. Again, why is the man in black so interesting to him? There is so much useless drivel going on that it can get quite hard to focus on what exactly is happening in the book. Patient readers like myself who made it to the end are still left with more questions than answers. However, I think that was the point the author wanted to make. Towards the end of the book, the conversation between Roland and the man in black does make some things clear. It portrays the feeling like this is some whole Matrix/Men in Black sort of thing.What the author does do quite well is portraying the world around the characters. He doesn't need to use a lot of words and yet everything is still so vivid in my mind. I guess that shows Stephen King's genius mind at work even when he was still considered an amateur. Action wise, there are some pieces of it here and there but not exactly what I call the main attraction of the story. Roland is a gunslinger and so obviously he has a pair of guns to work with. There was a part in the story where it flashes back to Roland's earlier life battling his teacher that got me more excited than anything he did in the present.Without a doubt, The Gunslinger is a very weird book when you first pick it up. You really need to have an open and vivid imagination to see things through. I have even read that fans of the series did not so much like this introductory book and that things will definitely get better starting with book two. After reading the description of The Drawing of the Three, I can completely agree as well. It definitely sounds much more interesting. The good news for me is that the series has ended as I wrote this review with a total of 7 books in the series. The 8th book is set sometime between the 4th and 5th novel, chronological wise. I will definitely put the next book in the Dark Tower series in my \\"to-read\\" list but just when I will get to it I can't say."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"While reading this book I kept having to go back a few pages to an entire chapter to see if I missed something. The story jumps around in such a way that it is difficult and sometimes impossible to figure out what has happened.The parts of the story I understood I liked, not loved. Apparently this book took some 13 years to write, and I think part of my problem following it was when the writer would set it down for a year or two then pick it up and start writing in a different way with a different idea of who the character was supposed to be. I could be wrong but that was the idea I got from reading this book.I heard my friend raving about how great this series is, I picked it up to see what she was talking about. After reading it front to back (and several chapters two or three times) I still have no idea what the fuss is about."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Being a huge Stephen King fan, I was eager to read this book once I found out about the Dark Tower series. The book immediately drew me in and I soon read the other 3 books that had already been published. The final, 7th book was a Christmas present that I cannot wait to read. The Gunslinger draws the reader into Roland's life immediately, although if you do not typically read Stephen King styled writers, The Gunslinger may be... wierd."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"&quot;The Gunslinger&quot; was one of the first books I ever read by Stephen King (sometime in the early 90s), and even though it's not one of my favorites, it's still worth reading if you like King's fantasy novels. It takes place in another world where Roland, the gunslinger, pursues The Man in Black across dry, dangerous terrain, entering town after town and stumbling across various characters who will ultimately lead him to a mortal battle with The Man in Black.This series/book isn't like King's typical horror fare (i.e., &quot;Cujo&quot; or &quot;Carrie&quot;); it has more of a western/sci-fi feel to it. That's probably why I didn't like it as much. But if you're into this type of genre, then you'll more than likely enjoy the Dark Tower series--&quot;The Gunslinger&quot; (#1), &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot; (#2), &quot;The Waste Lands&quot; (#3), and &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot; (#4)."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"According to King's afterword, this book started from a single sentence he wrote while still in school. He added on the rest of the 'story' (and I use the word loosely) during and between other books. It was written in pieces and tossed together when there was enough material to make a book. And it definitely shows. Leaving some things unknown and creating some psychological suspense is one thing; leaving the reader with only the barest bones of an outline is another. Why not make up the whole story yourself? You're practically there already after slogging through this mess. See Roland travel. See Roland commit mass murder. See Roland find a small boy. See Roland find railroad tracks in the middle of the desert. See them get attacked to create some pointless drama. Finally, we come to an ending. Existential philosophy is discussed. Grand things are spoken of in the vaguest possible terms. Roland experiences some powerful enchantment and ages ten years in a night. Shrug. Ho hum. He walks on as if this is something that happens every other week. Nothing is explained, no details are given, nothing connects with anything else.Admittedly this book is just a setup for the others, but it's still the most uneven mess I've seen from King (and that's really saying something, considering it has The Stand to contend with). It could have easily been trimmed down to 75-100 pages and used as an introduction to the next story. As a book in and of itself, it's an incoherent, meandering work that wouldn't have come close to being published had it been done by a first-time novelist. There are a couple connections with the following books; that's because after publishing this one, King had to scramble to make some sense out of the details he put in before. Apparently, thinking out the whole story ahead of time was just too much trouble.As for reading some of his other books (The Stand, Insomnia, Eyes of the Dragon etc.) because they're supposedly tied in with the Dark Tower: well, not they're not, exactly. Insomnia has one mention of a dream. For the others, it's because one guy (Flagg) shows up all over the place. My guess is that King made up those stories going along, came to a point where he needed a villain, and slotted in the same one rather than come up with something more original. Yawn. Let's just see if he can redeem himself in the end with this series. I remain curious."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"...I'll tell you my story about what happened to me. I bought this book recently, and read the first part of it, and was bored. Then a friend of mine told me about the subject matter of the later parts of the book, and I was passionate to read it. So today, April 11, 2000, I began reading it at around 5:30 in the morning and finished it at 6:30 at night. I read the last few pages with shallow breaths and wide eyes, and when I was done, I put it down and took a deep breath. What a way of living! I am amazed. I have previously read Cycle of the Werewolf, The Green Mile, and Desperation (as well as many short stories in Night Shift, Skeleton Crew, and Nightmares and Dreamscapes), but none of these amount to the incredible power that Stephen King can put into his work. For those of you who think King is an all-out horror writer, THINK AGAIN! These books are... Something else. Not to give anything away, but due to the subject matter, they may make some people think that they are fantasy. After reading just the first one, though, you may think otherwise. I have a whole new way of looking at life now. By the time many people read this review, I will be deeply into The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three. Soon enough I will be reading III, then IV, and the three more to come! Stephen King, you are incredible. Simply put, this book ROCKS!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This one was hard to rate. It's a very strange book. There is some fantastic characterization, as always with King, but then again the story barely makes sense at times. One thing I didn't like was the \\"fated\\" feel of everyone in the story. It damaged my suspension of disbelief, as I felt the author was so clearly making everything up and shaping it so things had to go his exact way. In short, there is some fantastically good imagery, and some might love it, but I didn't get drawn into the story because I found people to surreal."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As any Constant Reader of the King Experience knows, it takes some time and inner searching to glean what the man is saying. Some novels are pure pulp; some are psycholgical explorations; others, pure science fiction. In the Dark Tower series, I have felt an attempt at alienation - non specific, that is to say not aimed at any type of reader or fan(atic)- but something to say to those who believe in Vampires or sentient rabid dogs, spaceships buried beneath the soil of Maine, Insane trucks, laundry machines or malevolent lawnmowers - those who would judge the work THE GUNSLINGER simply because of the first few pages. &quot;I don't want to read a horror Zane Grey novel! &quot; they shout. I don't either, and I didnt. What I read was a book full of the joy and terror of a man exploring a new type of storytelling. A beginning to inflame the thirst of New and old Constant Readers. Magnificent imagery, convoluted turns of reality. Just enough to cling to the promise of the next installment of The Dark Tower. Excellent work. Superior continuity... unbearable &quot;waiting for the next thing&quot;."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Dark Tower series is outstanding. But episode one is often slow, slow. Achingly slow travel across endless landscape. Much of it was apparently written by King early in his career. Skip to The Drawing of the Three, with its recap at the beginning. Then enjoy, as episode two is great, with its clever travel from Roland's post-apocalyptic world to our world of the 60s then 80's then 90's. Book Two becomes much more sci-fi fantasy. You'll miss little by going into the more current Drawing of Three, a much better book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the first installment of THE DARK TOWER series, begun when King was a student, and finished 12 years later. Until recently, I hadn't realized King was a fantasy author, in addition to his other accomplishments. I was a kid who grew up reading THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and spending hours searching attics & basements for a gateway to another world. So I decided I might like The Dark Tower.After reading customer reviews, and A Dark Tower Primer, A List By Elena, I expected this book to be inaccessible. I thought it would take time and background reading for me to get into it, and that perhaps I never would.Nothing could be further from the truth. I was hooked before I had finished reading the first page.Why? The first 16 pages describe a lone figure crossing an absolutely barren landscape in pursuit of another lone figure. What made those 16 pages so compelling?Mostly, it's the descriptions. King describes the desert so you can see it, hear it, even smell it. As the narrative continues and the lone figure begins to interact with other characters, a vivid individual is revealed - so gradually, so slowly - behind the archetypal \\"gunslinger\\".I didn't find the book as puzzling as I expected from the customer reviews. It seemed clear to me it was taking place in some sort of post-apocalyptic future which exists in a parallel universe or dimension to our own. It's not true that it answers none of its own questions, it just doesn't answer all of them, as befits the first chapter of a series.My only criticism is that the prose falters at a few points. Surprisingly, not in the part of the book written when King was very young (the beginning) but later, when he was already an experienced published author. I'm only referring to a few phrases where my absorption in the book was broken by a thought such as \\"eew, why did he choose those words?\\" The only example I can find or think of is a phrase such as \\"the boy threw up his hands\\" (he did? How had he managed to swallow his own hands?) I only mention it because normally this never happens when I am reading a King novel.In this book, there are long scenes in which nothing very much happens, or only dialogue and description, punctuated by 2 scenes of extreme violence. Usually people who like \\"action\\" and people who like dialogue and description can never agree on a book. Usually people who like reading violent scenes don't like long descriptive passages, and people who do like them can't bear reading about violence. But this is not your usual book.If you like fantasy, or if you like King but have never read his fantasy work, definitely check it out. Dark Tower fans need no recommendation, of course. If you like descriptive narrative prose, you probably look down on King, but overcome your prejudice long enough to take a look at this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Displaying elements of modern culture intermingled with a story which is part Fantasy, part Science Fiction, part Horror, and overall Western is a weird feat only achievable by Stephen King. He manages to put together the most unlikely of stories with a good mix of horror, humor, action, and a high gross-out factor in parts.This is the story of Roland, the last of the gunslingers as he pursues the mysterious Man in Black across the desert and over the mountains, striving to reach his ultimate goal, the Dark Tower. Why? I have no idea. What he plans to do with at tower when he arrives is a topic to be discussed in future volumes. In the meantime, enjoy the action as Roland encounters a talking bird, drops acid, is designated the Antichrist, discloses the secrets of his past, and encounters a succubus (but not necessarily in that order).This unabridged audio version was read by the author. I had previously mentioned that Stephen King is a better writer than reader in my review of \\"Blood and Smoke\\", but my opinion of him moved up a notch here. His reading here was still not the best I've heard (Frank Muller is a master here), but better than some professional readers. This story ends on an open note which piqued my interest in following Roland to the second in the Dark Tower series, \\"The Drawing of the Three\\"."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"First of all, I have to be clear that I am just an occasional reader of Stephen King. When it comes to the horror or fantasy/horror genre, historically I have been more a reader of Clive BarkerThe Great and Secret Show(although it's been a few years since I've read his stuff as well). I have read The Stand, but at this moment, I am struggling to recall what else I've read - I've definitely seen King's work in other media (film, tv).Regardless of my reading preferences/ history, I've had a very passing familiarity with this series, but it was only recently that I became intrigued enough to purchase the first book, The Gunslinger, and give it a shot. Overall, I was not particularly engrossed in it at the beginning. It seemed to start slow and the story of what happened to the Gunslinger in Tull seemed pretty boring. It definitely picked up towards the middle and through the end once the Gunslinger encounters Jake Chambers and we get a bit more background on Roland's history.After reading several books in the Song of Ice and Fire seriesGeorge R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones 4-Book Boxed Set: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire), I was kind of taken aback at how short this book is, but I understand it's just the first of seven (now completed), so despite a slow start, I did end up finishing it in a short timeframe. It left me with a lot more questions than answers, and despite being slightly uneventful, I am now interested in finding out more about the characters, the world of the book, and where exactly it's heading (towards the Dark Tower, I presume!)."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This was one of Stephen King's earliest attempts at writing a novel, and it kind of shows. It's slow at times. A little grey. There are some great action scenes, but mostly you end up not caring much about the main character and not understanding the world that he lives in.However, the very next entry \\"Drawing of the Three\\" is one of the best in the series, and The Gunslinger is required reading to understand it. It's worth getting through the 220 or so pages to get to the other books in the series. And the Gunslinger isn't completely unenjoyable. It just doesn't live up to the rest of the series or the greater story of the Roland's quest for the mysterious Dark Tower."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\\" I remember buying a few books from the book store: Swan Song, Earth Abides and The Dark Tower. I was pumped to read all of them, so sort of as a joke, I read the first sentences of each novel to my girlfriend and asked her which was the best. Of course the best was from The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. It's funny because Stephen King also admits that was one of the best lines he'd ever written; if not the best line beginning a novel. There's just so much power in that sentence that it's repeated at least four times in the series in difference forms.We begin as the sentence says. The Gunslinger is following the man in black; the reason why, we don't know. But who needs to know? A Gunslinger is reason personified. In the story, we don't learn that much about who Roland is. He doesn't talk that much, but his quick hand makes up for what his mouth doesn't say; he isn't real friendly, but his presence is powerful, Clint Eastwood-esque. The tale doesn't have much plot - it just is a journey with tales interwoven throughout. He tells a tale to man named Brown of his mishappenings in a place called Tull; then he finds a boy named Jake at a Way Station in the middle of no where - the boy remembers nothing, therefore Roland hypnotizes the boy and sees how he got there - what he sees, he doesn't fully understand, but we do. Then they travel together, following the man in black. It's very simple and straight forward.The Gunslinger is the best written Stephen King story to date; you could really tell he loved what he was writing and the story loved surging through his fingertips. It was like reading a poem; in fact, the series is loosely based off from Robert Browning's 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came' which is a long poem - and I gotta say that their is swagger and style to the first installment to this mega series that reads much like a poem.It's not action packed; it's not a Stephen King-esque horror novel; it is, in many ways, beyond Stephen King. And if you read the series, you'll understand (quite literally, you'll understand). The best way of describing this novel is an exact combination of Cormac McCarthy (No Country For Old Men, The Road) and Richard Matheson (Hell House, I Am Legend). Still to this day this is the best written fiction novel that I have read and is the best in the series. Don't read it if you're looking for cheap thrills; read it if literature means something to you."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Having heard great reviews about this series, I decided to pick up the Gunslinger and really enjoyed it. It is a pretty short book, but I found that the world created by King was extremely rich and it really drew me in... I was especially interested in learning about the motivation behind Roland's relentless pursuit of the mysterious Man in Black.Again, this was a great book and the beginning of an enjoyable series!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This review is for the whole Dark Tower Series. Not just book 1. It's a true Magnum Opus by a master storyteller. Not many authors can drive you through a series this size and make you wish for more. It's a wild ride and a whole lot of fun. I would call it adventure fiction rather than horror, which is my true favorite genre, even if it's not treated as such by most marketers."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"My dad brought me to the book store when I was 13 years old. I, with great luck, picked this book out. It made me into a reader for life. The world sucked me in. The vague, but intriguing story held me from cover to cover.So if you're young, or you want an open ended adventure to suck you in for many thousands of pages (meaning this and the rest of the series) then dive in and read these books. They are something to behold, and they just may make you enjoy the art of writing all that much more."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"King takes his reader on a journey to the dark tower. This book is the perfect introduction. This book is not only about a journey of Roland of Giliad, but a book that takes its readers on a journey. From page one, It is me who is on the journey, hopeing to find why my world is falling apart. Roland is the character of mankind. King does a great job of making that character come to life and envelope all of us. This book relates a story that is ages old. Ever since humans have been seeking, they have lived this story. I would recomend this book to anyone who searchs for meaning and purpose in their own lives. It is more than a book. It will take hold of you, so be careful."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I am a huge fan of Stephen King's Dark Tower series of books. I think that \\"Wizard and Glass\\" is possibly the best book he has written so far. I am always evangelizing others on the greatness of King's massive uber-story. Yet book one, \\"The Gunslinger,\\" seems to be one heck of a stumbling block for most folks.This is understandable. The story begins with Roland (the main protagonist of the series) in his darkest place. He has become hardened, unable to love. The story ends with him making the most heartless of decisions. \\"The Gunslinger puts the capital \\"G\\" in Grim.Yet this almost unbearably bleak backdrop is essential to what the story of Roland and the Dark Tower becomes. In it we learn of what Roland is--a \\"Gunslinger\\"--and how he became one. We learn of the treachery that has set the course of Roland's destiny in motion.Most of \\"The Gunslinger\\" comes off like a flashback wrapped inside a horrible hallucination. Bad things happen and there is no fulfilling end to this part of the tale. It understandably turns a lot of folks off to going any further with The Dark Tower.I am here to tell you to keep on pressing on. King's story is, in my opinion, turning into one of the most epic and worthwhile tales ever written. The dryness of the Gunslinger is more than compensated for in the following books."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've just completed the first in The Dark Tower Series, and I have to say, I think, this is one of King's best told stories yet. I was a little disappointed to see one review suggesting that this book is &quot;a guy thing&quot;; so, ladies especially, I wanted you to know (coming from a woman, mother, wife, etc. and long-time King fan) that this book has a little bit of everything told in a parallel world that will keep you turning the pages, in true Stephen King style. Roland, the last Gunslinger, is a likeable, and realistic character who shares a wide range of feelings and reflections that will make you love and hate him. His dealings with his women, his mentors, and his too brief travel mate, Jake, make him a rugged, yet soft-hearted hero, one that I will not too soon forget. The book is hard to put down, and will make you long for the next pages in the saga, even before you've finished."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Unlike many people who have left reviews here, I view Stephen King's first Dark Tower novel, &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; not as something to be suffered through in order to get at the riches which lay beyond, but as an excellent stand alone novel.Lousy at some may think it is, I actually fell in love with that old version of &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;. No, it's not your typical, linear, run of the mill story. If that frightens you, stay away from this book. It's written in an artistic, vague, almost pretentious way (King edited some of this out in the new version, but the core stil remains). Obviously some people find this annoying, but I love it. To me it is almost the novel equivalent of a Sergio Leone movie, because his movies can be described much the same way. Needless to say, I was more than understanding of King's admission that &quot;The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly&quot; was an inspiration for this story.So I very much surprised when I learned that King had gone and &quot;revised and expanded&quot; this novel which I loved. Blasphemy! I thought. Of course, I went and bought it anyway. My feelings on the new version are mixed. I like the additional scenes (almost like watching the cut-scenes on a DVD), but overall the novel seems to have lost something to me... lost a bit of that original pretentious magic.Slowly but surely, King has degenerated his Dark Tower story into just another one of his crazy romps where seemingly anything and everything goes. I, for one, will always prefer that mysterious, haunting image of the last gunslinger, following across the desert. But that's just me."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger was my first non-movie view of Stephen King's world and boy, I was impressed. I went in expecting a fast-moving, horror-ridden novel that would leave me sleepless for a week. It was well-paced, and it did have its moments where your hart gives a lurch or two, but if it left me sleepless, it was because this novel just ROCKS.It's difficult to find a fantasy that can really make you sit back and think. We've got plenty of fantasy, but the struggle is to find something deep and thought-provoking. I finally found the object of months of searching...a novel that isn't predictable, too \\"mushy with theme\\", is dark but not in an unsettling fashion, and can make me think..It's name is The Gunslinger and it is the best new novel (in the since that I haven't read it before) that I've read in a while. It has believeable characters and dialogue, a hint of magic and mystery, a truly intriguing setting, great writing..and most importantly, a healthy dose of thought-provoking ideas.And if that isn't the basis of a great novel and series in the making, then I don't know what it is.A full-hearted recommendation to deep fantasy lovers."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"First, if you are a Stephen King fan, this novel is unlike his other works. Secondly, if you don't like Stephen King's other works and you enjoy reading fantasy, you will like this book. This book is unlike any horror novel written by King. If you have read the Eyes of the Dragon, this book is similar to that.I read this book for the first time three years ago. Since then I have read the entire series and read this book two more times. It seems like King is telling two stories. One is of Roland's past life and the other is the situation he is faced with. I find Roland's past as interesting as the current plot. For fantasy lovers, I might compare Roland to Aragorn from Tolkien's work. One of the last great men of a great people. Willing to die for his cause and for honor. He is the best at what he does, he does not feel pain, he cannot quit. His task is to find the Dark Tower. Where he will find it and what it holds he does not know.What happens. The gunslinger is following the Man in Black. He tells us the story of a town he destroyed because of the Man in Black. We meet Jake, a boy sent from our world to Roland's by the Man in Black. We follow Jake and Roland across a vast desert as he trails the Man in Black. Nothing can keep Roland from the Man in Black, and in the end Roland talks with the Man in Black.I like this novel, I like this series. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"&quot;The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed.&quot; With these first words King begins one of the greatest epics to come out of fantasy fiction in a very long time. Many wonder what Stephen King will be remembered for once he shuffles off this mortal coil. Will it be Salem's Lot, or The Shining, or The Green Mile, or The Stand? Those will be remembered the way one remembers Sir Edmund Spenser's Amoretti, or John Milton's Samson Agonistes, or Virgil's Ecologues. All are important works in their own right but all are vastly overshadowed by greater, more penetrating, works. For Spenser it was The Faerie Queen, for Milton it was Paradise Lost, for Virgil, The Aeneid, and for Stephen King it will be The Dark Tower Series. Stephen King creates a world of infinite depth and complexity in this series. The world he creates is one of decadence and misery. Baudelaire would have been proud, Eliot would have wept, indeed, the third book in this series is named after Eliot's famous poem, The Waste Land. The atmosphere alone would have made this a great book, but it is the character of Roland which makes this an epic. In Roland, King creates a modern day Epic Hero, a charater in search of a great prize, The Tower. This first book gives us only a superficial glance at the world of Roland, and I suspect it is King's intention to not give us an indepth look at Roland and his world in this first book. After one reads &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; one feels like a man in a thick fog looking for a path to follow. As one progesses through the series the path becomes clearer and one begins to see objects, that like magic, simply appear before them. Here we see Roland pursuing the Man in Black, an old enemy. He pursues him at the expense of all, including a dear companion. Yet, like a force of nature, Roland continues, unrelenting, uncompromising, unstoppable. His will leads him through monstrosity after monstrosity, horror after horror, tragedy after tragedy. This is the cycle we see in the first book and this is the cycle we see throughout the epic. It is Rolands will which makes him a hero, not his training as a gunslinger. And throughout all of the stories we sense that there is something underlying the very fabric of the story. A indescribable force that one cannot see, only feel, like a breeze from the wind. Is it the Man in Black's teacher, an even more ancient enemy to Roland? Is it a character that has not even been revealed in the first book (or even in later books)? Is it the Tower itself? It is Rolands attempt to discover that force that makes the Dark Tower Epic the masterpiece it is. And I say here and now that this series will be Stephen King's Legacy for future generations, just as The Aeneid was Virgils, just as Paradise Lost was Miltons. He may be remembered for other works but none will ever surpass this one. This is King's most advanced writing out of all of his fiction. I dare anyone to read this epic and prove my words wrong."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"&quot;The man in black fled acsross the desert, and the Gunslinger followed.&quot; With these words, Stephen King began what is turning out to be one of the best epic fantasies since Frodo started on the road to Mordor and another Dark Tower. Much like Middle-Earth, Roland's universe (which we later learn is called Mid-World) is not shown to us all at once, but rather revealed to us slowly; we discover it as the characters do. Similarly, very little at first is revealed about Roland's quest for the Tower, just as the Ring-Bearer knows almost nothing about the task he must perform -- save that both journeys will be fraught with peril, hovering at the brink of disaster and madness, and that each may cost more than the hero is expecting (or willing) to pay. Roland in particular has lost almost everything he holds dear in his quest before The Gunslinger even begins; the first we see of him is as a lone figure, all but used up, still doggedly trailing his adversary west to the sea. In the course of this somewhat-episodic story, we slowly learn more about the mysterious Roland, and his strange world, which parallels our own so eerily (note the effective use of the song &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, which startles the reader even as it provides an anchor of familiarity in this semi-alien environment). We meet Jake, the boy from our own world who was pushed into Roland's (almost literally) when he died in a New York traffic accident, and whose character has unexpectedly come to inform and influence the story as much as, if not more than, that of Roland himself. We encounter the darkly magical aspects of Roland's world, both in his encounter with The Speaking Demon below the Way Station, and in his strange, eerie tryst with the Oracle in the Mountains, surely one of the most atmospheric, best-written passages in any of King's novels. We pass under the mountains with Roland and Jake, encounter the hideous Slow Mutants (which provide us with a clue as to just how the world began moving on), and just as light begins to (literally) appear at the end of the tunnel, the bleakest moment occurs, and we learn to what depths Roland is capable of sinking to attain the ultimate goal of his quest. Along the way, we slowly begin to learn about Roland's childhood -- his training as a gunslinger, the day he witnesses a hanging partly brought about by his actions, the serene majesty of a Harvest Dance in the Great Hall, and the first inklings of trouble between his mother and father. Later, we learn how Roland's confirmation of his mother Gabrielle's adultery will force him to take his final test, and become an apprentice gunslinger, at the youngest recorded age for such an event. These flashbacks inform and echo the rest of the story -- i.e., young Roland's realization of his mother's treachery and Jake's growing certainty that his friend will betray him; the sacrifice of the hawk David, and another sacrifice that will grow to haunt Roland ever more deeply as time goes on. This novel, which according to King took the longest of all his books to write, is very well-constructed, a good story in itself which also implies that there is much more to be discovered in the successive volumes (and this has indeed proved to be true). Most of all, I love the implications of the final chapter, the long palaver between Roland and the man in black, which suggests that not only is Roland's universe dying, it may be nothing more than a mote of dust within another, vaster universe. This concept is hardly original to King (even he admits he got it from someone else), but rarely have I seen it so well-executed as it is here. In fact, the entire story is infused with the idea that Roland's world, moving on as it is, is just one of many continua that are endangered in this story. Jake's final words to Roland, in fact (&quot;Go, then. There are other worlds than these.&quot;) would indicate that this is in fact so. Roland's strange, threatening, yet somehow beautiful world -- much like Middle-Earth -- is one of the best settings for a fantasy/quest story that I have ever seen, and the more that is revealed, the more enchanted I am. Roland and his journey may not be exactly on a par with Tolkien's tale of Frodo and the One Ring -- but it's pretty damned close. King's most ambitious work may well turn out to be one of the best fantasy epics ever created -- and if you haven't started it yet, you really should."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is a worthy introduction to the world of Roland and his quest for the Dark Tower. It sows the seeds for what is shaping up to be a definitive, ingenius masterpiece of a series.A very short novel, but it gets its job done. It gives us an overall character sketch of Roland and his obsession, gets Jake into the mix early, and tells the tale of a bit of adventure in the final days before Roland finally meets Walter, the man in black.Besides its foretelling and awesome conclusion, The Gunslinger, when considered alone, is little more than an adventure story in a strange world (albeit beautifully told, as always when discussing the King). When considered with the entire series, it becomes obvoius that King is deliberately laying the ground for something absolutley huge.So go ahead, read this one (You can do it in one sitting, I know you can), and then pick up The Drawing of the Three. Now that's classic King."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Most of Stephen King's books fall into the category of horror, but he has also touch on fantasy elements. In addition, many of his works have an epic quality to them; The Stand is one of the best examples of this.The Gunslinger is the first volume of Stephen King's Dark Tower. The book first appeared as stories in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction before being collected in a limited edition by Donald M. Grant. The book eventually appeared as a trade paperback available to all. The series is ongoing, with the latest volume to appear in either 1997 or 1998.The story takes place in a strange world that contains familiar elements (patrons in a bar at one point sing Hey Jude). The focal point of the tale is Roland, the last of the gunslingers. His quest for the Dark Tower becomes his reason for living.Stephen King is the reader of this audiobook. I have also felt that Stephen King writes as if he was talking out loud. This makes his reading more interesting and illuminating. While his voice is not trained, he more than anyone else is able to illustrate the world he created. He also is the reader on the other two volumes.I enjoy listening to audiobooks, but I normally don't buy them. Stephen King's unabridged works are exceptions and his own readings are at the top of my list and the Dark Tower series is his most interesting work."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"THE GUNSLINGER is a book that tends to be hard to explain. It is a story about a gunslinger (there's a zinger!) who is searing for the &quot;man in black&quot; (and it isn't Will Smith!). Upon his journey, he befriends a little boy and is forced to examine himself. It was a very well written novel. It wasn't too long like many of King's novels tend to be. One of my favorite parts was when the gunslinger battles with the SLOW MUTANTS. This book is classic fiction. It's different from a lot of the mainstream fantasy in so many ways. 1) It's dark fantasy. To be taken seriously. 2) It's not one of those &quot;Oh, but it will have a happy ending&quot; type novels. 3) It's real. So real you can actually walk through the pages. The illustrations were good too. If you'rw wondewring why this version costs more than a few of the others it's because of the picture. I think it's better with the pictures. It's meant to be illustrated. Buy this book. It's on of those you'll be proud to have collecting dust on your book- shelf."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book was ok but it didn't have the usual horror that King puts into his books.

This book invites you to join Roland and his friends on great adventure and quest! A Great Book that will have you running back to get the second book in the series!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is a hard book to rate. It kind of starts in the middle of nowhere and the middle of nothing. The first time I read it I was tempted to give up on it a lot. I kept wondering where is this happening, when is this happening and what the hell is going on? But we meet Roland in the middle of his adventure. My advice is to read it, no matter how confused you get, then read the next 2 in the series and then re-read the first one. It'll make a lot more sense the second time around.

I really liked the scene were Roland kills the whole town. Very well written."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King somewhat strays from his usual wicked, haunting, tales by exploring a deeper side of his talent. The Dark Tower Series is by far one of the most arresting storylines you will ever come across.

It's magical realism says that anything can happen in this book, that nothing is taken for granted, and for that reason the reader is absorbed. This writing approach reminds this reader of \\"The Morning Tree,\\" by Austin Reams.The Morning Tree\\"The Gunslinger\\" is clearly King's first books because the plot appears to be created from moment to moment. There is no distinct end: rather each chapter seems to stand on its own as a short story, which is not a detraction. The subsequent books in this series are reportedly more developed. This reader looks forward to them all."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"After months of hearing about The Dark Tower series, and since I'm already a big Stephen King fan, I decided to finally read the first book in the series, just to see what it was all about. It took me until the last page to decide what I thought of it. All I can say really is that I liked it, and I'm planning to read the next one, but of all the Stephen King books I've read, this was the most difficult and unusual. The problems I had with this book were not stylistic; the book is very well written, and the characters, though mysteriously aloof from the reader, are well developed. The title character, known throughout most of the book simply as the gunslinger, is not easily identifiable as a hero and is deeply complex. There are mysteries surrounding his past, as well as the lives of most of the characters and the reality in which they live. I think it was these very mysteries that I didn't really love. They distressed me unexpectedly. However, being the first book in a series, it's understandable that there will be unanswered questions. Anyone who ventures to read this book should be prepared to read the rest of the series! I certainly will."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Roland, the last gunslinger, pursues the man in black across a Western landscape, a land where time is winding down, meets up with a woman and a kid (from our world), and flashes back to his past and his destruction of an entire town. While the story has potential and intriguing imagery, it is written in so convoluted a manner that the characters and story suffers.

Thank you so much"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Dark Tower story is the one tale Stephen King said he always wanted to tell. Well, it certainly didn't disappoint, but the time interval between books made it a little hard to be faithful to the series.Roland is a distant relative to the round table and King Arthur, I believe. He is a knight in a sense, in a futuristic world where the champions of the old west have regained prominence as the \\"jedi knights\\" of King's world. Tutored since birth and tested at the gunslinger's bidding, these supermen with pistols have no equal in the world where they are born.Roland's quest throughout the series is to find the Dark Tower, and I believe, the man who messed with his family. He takes a roundabout way, showing his prowess with all aspects of wielding a six-gun, as he winds his way through an endless desert in search of his goal. He finally passes through the great expanse and finds himself facing a giant ocean, with some very strange creatures as his welcoming committee.I loved this story, and Roland is a great character. I went on to read books two, three and four, but stopped there. I waited years for the ensuing books to come out, and when they finally did I felt rather betrayed. I haven't read the Wolves of Calla yet, but as I said, up to that point the story is magnificent. The Gunslinger definitely puts the hook in you, you won't want to stop there, especially with the doors on beach in the next novels - YIKES!Kevin Gerard - Author of Diego's Dragon, Book One: Spirits of the Sun"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is more than likely the one that disapeared from site read by Frank Muller Original version before revision & so the picture so idiot posted is wrong, that's the new revision that you can still buy not this one. Please fix site info so there's not confusion. I wish you still sold this."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I read about 100 pages of this, stopped it, then after reading some reviews on the collection of books in this story, decided to muddle through. It was hard for me to get through it, but once I did, it really left an impression with me. It's hard to explain, but looking back after having read all 7 of the books, this one is most certainly a great start. It sets a mood that just clicked with me.I really didn't appreciate it as much as I read it or even right after I read it. Really it did not resonate with me until I was into the 3rd or 4th book.Anyway, as I know other reviewers have pointed out, the first of the series is the hardest to get through, but once you do, you'll quickly be rewarded for it and looking back will likely remember this book more fondly."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Loved It! Recommend this book to anyone looking for an action type story setting, and to have entertainment from start to finish. This book makes you want more every chapter, which is why it is such a fun book to read. In the desolate world portrayed throughout the book, you can frightenly make an eerie comparison to ours.Although it contains a rather boring, almost confusing beginning, because of who he meets, and all he talks to, readers who elect to read on are really amazed by how great and entertaining this book really is.The line \\"The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed,\\" clearly sums up the whole plot of the story, and the gunslinger's motivation. He is willing to sacrifice all, even his own life, to find the man in black.Through meeting many people along his journey in this story, one can have a peak at his past. Several people that he meets are really just traps left by the man in black to avoid the gunslinger.The Gunslinger comes across as a very rugged, adventureous kind of man, who loves to kill, so to speak. Although he makes some friends along his journey, he sacrifices them to find the Man in Black. The Man in Black is a very mischevious character, who is greatly determined to escape Roland, the gunslinger, by setting traps for him...A very exciting and adventureous book. My kind of book! Recommend it to anyone... This book was recommended to me by the very Chase Kildgore himself."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"Childe Roland to the dark tower came ...\\"Yes, but not for awhile. He started in this book, originally written (or at least conceived) more than thirty years ago. Only in the last year has the final installment hit. Newcomers won't have to wait to get there, but they will have to make it through the clunky bits--including this book--to arrive at the tower themselves.Stephen King's broken world of western mythos, magic, and gloomy terror begins with the pursuit of a \\"man in black.\\" The pursuer is Roland, who we meet as a sort-of Mad Max/Aragorn character combination. And he is nothing if not determined. \\"The Gunslinger\\" will kill the wicked, sacrifice the good, and dirty his soul to attain his goal.What it's all about doesn't really come clear in this book. And I'm not saying it should, but at the time that I read it, Stephen King freely admitted that he wasn't entirely sure himself. That, plus the years spent on-and-off this cult bit of literary history, makes for some disjointed, occasionally boring writing. Having said that, it's well worth the reading, not only for its moments of horrific brilliance--not for nothing is he called \\"gunslinger,\\" as we learn in an early, blood-drenched western-style massacre--but also because this modest tome sets up one of King's finest works. But that's the next book ...(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the first installment of Stephen King's Amazing Dark Tower series.

Trust me."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King's The Gunslinger was excellent! It is the first of four books in the series of The Dark Tower. The Gunslinger is part fantasy and part science-fiction. The Gunslinger is following the man in black, but this is not his ultimate goal. The Gunslinger wants to reach the Dark Tower. The Dark Tower is a very mystical place because King does not reveal what the Dark Tower really is. Even the Gunslinger doesn't know. He just knows that he has to find it. With each coming day, you find out a little more about the world that the Gunslinger lives in, which is different from he world we live in today."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I just finished reading the Gunslinger for the second time. I read it the first time in 96 or 97, and within a month or two I read books 2, 3, and 4. This is a great fast read; after reading it you will definitly continue reading the next 3 parts which amass to around 2000 pages. I would compare the Dark Tower series, to the Lord of the Rings, it is that enjoyable. There is nothing disappointing in The Dark Tower except when you finish book four there is not a book five, or six etc. The Dark Tower is a great book to start reading though there may never be an ending. I can't wait to see The Dark Tower movie."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"this is Stephen King at his darn best!with this book, he has created a magical world. i only hope he can finish it before leaving this planet. at the pace he is going, it doesnt look pretty for us Gunslinger fans."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is a very good book, but hard to grasp.

Must be because it's a mysterious book.) Dark Tower. In this book, he gets declared the anti-christ by a possessed preacheress, slaughters an entire town, travels with a boy from our world, encounters a demon, and finally catches up withthe man in black, plus much more.The gunslinger was an excellent character, a cold dark one, but nonetheless a good character."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"A GOOD PLACE TO START KING.

I originally read The Gunslinger about three years ago and was unable to put it down until I finished with it. Not only does this book create the perfect beginning to an excellent saga, it could also be used as a stand-alone story. The quality of the writing and the pace at which it flows are done masterfully and to this day, I still think this is one of King's best books. From the opening sentence, &quot;The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed&quot; to the closing paragraph, this book will have you hooked.I have read and reread this book three times in the last three years, and I plan on reading it many more times as each time I read it I feel as though I know the gunslinger (Roland) even better. Don't miss out on this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This printing of the book is definitely not up to King's usual standard, though much of the blame may be placed on the publisher. There's numerous typos (at least in this edition of the book), with letters like h substituted for n (she raised her nands to her face, for example), and there is the odd grammar mistake. It also appears disjointed, with things happening without any explaination, or only a partial explaination. For example, a demon that possesses a woman is killed (we know this because the gunslinger says it is dead) but no explaination is given for how it was done, etc."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book was both interesting and entertaining, two attributes that complement each other nicely. This novel is a dark fantasy/sci-fi, so don't think it's a horror novel at the start. It's also the first book of a series of seven(four have been published), so don't think it's going to have a complete ending. The action and romance scenes are both tasteful and abundant. You learn Roland the Gunslinger gracefully, and all the other characters too. I'm on the second of the series (The Drawing of the Three), and I found it comical with the &quot;lobstrosity&quot; scene. Anways, read this book and follow up on the series if you're midly interested in dark fantasy or sci-fi by King."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Roland is a wonderful charactor, a woman's man?

The storytelling abilities of Stephen King fully shine through, and this story is certainly worthy of him - fascinating, brilliantly told, and engrosing.

The Dark Tower serie is the best (if any) of Stephen King"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Fantasy fans, please note that this book is usually located in the HORROR section in book stores. I liked the character of the &quot;Evil&quot; enchanter, whom I thought was the most charismatic and enigmatic character in the novel. Most of all, I loved the haunting, dreamlike quality of the novel. Compare this book to, say, Donaldson's &quot;Mirror of Her Dreams&quot;, and you'll see how masterful King is in setting up the characters, context, and the mood with economic precision. The ending leaves the reader shaking with anticipation for the sequel."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"When I needed a book, to do for an English class, I turned to Stephen King. The cover and title intirgued me enough to pick it up, and needless to say, the book was awesome. What makes the book lose points is the ending and the time jumps. King tries to use the jumps between the main plot and Roland's childhood to try to explain the action, but i found the jumps were confusing and kinda pointless, but maybe im wrong. The ending although it ends the first book of the series is kinda weak in my eyes, but otherwise the book is a great read. The storng point of the book is that it always seems to pull your atention back into the plot, by illustrating Roland's confrontations and his need for his trusty Revolvers. Finally, I felt that this was a good opening book in a series becuase it leaves so many anwsers unanswered that your almost obligated to continue."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is one of my favorite-ever books. It definatly is not for the young reader. It has some vulgar language, and many chapters are all about killing. But for the older and more matuer reader, it is a classic. The book concerns a dark man who wanders through the desert after nuclear war wiped out most of the world. He is on a quest to find the man in black, who he has been following most of his life.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"What a strange little book. The entire series is weird, but this one is just ... plain ... strange. That's not to say it's not good ... in a strange sort of way. You should read it first, just to get the feel for how strange some of the much longer (and better) books later in the series can get, but this is the poorest of the four out so far. I finished this irritated by the gunslinger (although he hadn't reached the heights of irritatingness he would reach in Part IV) and his little friend, Jake. I don't know why I'm recommending this, but I am. Strange."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King somewhat strays from his usual wicked, haunting, tales by exploring a deeper side of his talent. The Dark Tower Series is by far one of the most arresting storylines you will ever come across. By the end of the Gunslinger, you will realize how fortunate you are not to have to wait 4 years for the next book to come out. Take your time reading the other three because waiting on a new one is a task....believe me."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"i can personally say that, despite my wide collection, this is simply the best stephen king book ive ever read. this fact is in no way biased by the fact that i happened to be reading The Girl Who loved Tom Gorden about the same time"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger was a great book (It did dissapoint me alittle with his talking about earth things and electrictiy(I am a serious fantasy fan)).

Thank you for listening."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"A review of Stephen King's &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger.&quot; by Robert Tyler Gasperson. It has taken me almost seven years to sit down and actually read this novel. I was 13 or 14 years old when I checked out the audio tape from the library. I got about halfway through the first side of the first tape. Then I had to turn it off. It was too wordy for me at the time. The story moved to slow and the words were over my head. I was young and couldn't get interested in the story. I wanted things to move fast, to get interesting, instead of actually thinking about what King had to say. At the age, if I couldn't get through &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;, I wonder what my thoughts would have been about a book like &quot;It&quot; or &quot;The Stand&quot;. I think I would never have gotten interested in King's work if that was the case. I started this novel about three weeks ago, just reading in my spare tie. Now with an older mind and a little ore reading experience, my interest was sparked and just about couldn't put it down I took a trip with Rolland to the old man's house in the desert and listened as he told the story of how he killed everyone in the small city of Tull. I walked with him through the desert and watched as Rolland found the boy, Jake, at the Waystation. I observed the relationship between the boy and the Gunslinger as they crossed the desert and entered the forest. I watched as they chased the Man in Black. The first four parts of the book was just an intro. They told of the long Journey that Rolland took to find the Man in Black. It told of the past, how Rolland won his guns. It told of how the boy ended up at the Waystation. The chapters also explains some of how our own planet Earth is connected to Rolland's home world. These chapters tell of the magic that fills the lands. They tell about the entities that scour the surface for the food that they desire. They also give all the details about the life of Rolland. The final chapter is the essence of the book, or even the essence of the universe. The Man in Black meets the Gunslinger with the anticipation of telling him what he needs to know to complete his quest for &quot;The Dark Tower.&quot; The Man in Black went to explain the finite essence of Rolland's mind. He explains how much more there is to the universe or, more than that, universes. In the words of the Man in Black he says: &quot;Imagine the sand of the Mohanie Desert, which you crossed to find e, and imagine a trillion universes - not world but universes - encapsulated in each grain of that desert; and within each universe an infinity of others. We tower over these universe an infinity of others. We tower over these universes fro our pitiful grass vantage point; with one swing of your boot you may knock a billion billion worlds flying off into darkness, in a chain never to be completed.&quot; When I read this, I thought about it. I have had this kind of thought before. I always wondered what was beyond the proton, neutron, and electron. What if there was a universe inside each particle. It could even get smaller than that. Each atom in that universe had universes in its particles and so on and so forth. Mind boggling isn't it. I would have to give this novel three out of five King points. There was not enough detail and interest in the first four chapters, yet the final chapter did very well."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I will keep my thoughts and veiws breif, becauseI am not a professional writer,but I have to tell the world that this series of novells by King is Brilliant, and to those who read this, you have to go and find Wizard And Glass.

Roland, the last gunslinger in that world, tries to catch the Man in Black, a figure we won't learn about it until the end. During his travel in the desert, he finds Jake, a boy that dies in our world and is pulled strangely into Roland's. The circumstances of Jake's death and why he is part of Roland's &quot;ka&quot; aren't very clear in this first book. With the reading of the Man in Black's Tarot cards, we learn briefly and a little confusing about Roland's future in his quest for a Dark Tower. About the Tower we get little, if almost no information in this first book about what it is and why Roland wants to find it. The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger, is a complete novel in itself, it doesn't have events unatended, even though, the situation is just beginning, and the reading of the next books of the saga is a must for those that enjoy this first book.

At first I started reading this knowing full well it was all lead in and it might be slow, but in one sitting I had already finished 100 pages. Still I was unsure if I liked it but as days went by I found that I couldn't stop thinking about this book. I had to know what was going to happen next and I had so many questions that it drew me in every time I picked it up. Stephen King did such a great job with this first book, that even though it is setting the stage for what is yet to come, and it posses more questions than it answers.

In this story Gunslinger Roland is searching for a mysterious Man in Black, who just might be able to help the Gunslinger find the Dark Tower.There are a lot of subtlety and vision into Roland's life that is intriguing, to say the least. Roland is a kind soul, but very capable of violence. There is a shootout in this story- that's not to say this is a western because it is far from it. But, who would have thought Hey Jude would be playing in a saloon. King is at his best at spinning yarns that stagger the imagination of the reader.

Once again, King has quenched my thirst for amazing reading material."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have always been a fan of Stephen King. I was a avid reader of his scary stories, most notable favs of mine, Salem's Lot, Firestarter and The Shining. I could never get enough of his tales and you could see through reading his novels he was influence by the likes of storytellers, Alfred Hitchcock and (the grandfather) H.P. Lovecraft.However, the day I purchased the Dark Tower, I was not prepared for the story that would unfold. The infamous line that starts this incredible tale of Urban Fantasy boarding Scifi, 'the man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.'- should go down in history as one of the most powerful beginning storylines in literature. I am not a fan of the graphic novel because the novel alone brings so many incredible and outlandish visual to the minds eye as you read the text. As a artist, writer and avid reader, I was allowed to unleash my imagination to the farthest reaches of the cosmos reading the Dark Tower.The tale is so enthralling, that the chase becomes almost secondary because of the interesting characters the gunslinger meets along the way. The man in black is the gunslinger Rolands what professor Moriarty was to Sherlock Holmes. He is an intriguing antagonist or maybe he is a cataylst. Almost giving the main a reason to exist.As much as I love Stephen King's scary stories but once I began reading The Dark Tower series, he had me at- The man in black.

People either love or hate this one. Even fans who love the entire Dark Tower series, point to this as one of the weakest and hardest to get through. However, I am pleased to say, they were wrong. Maybe it is because I read the version that Stephen King revised to match the tone set forth in the other books.I don't want to give anything away or give a blow by blow synopsis. I do want to say go into this book with an open mind. It is not a typical fantasy book, but is more of an action adventure.

I have put it off and put it off. I love Stephen King and his endless talent for writing but I admit that once in a blue moon, he produces a dud...after all; even gods have off-days! So, I feared that his Dark Tower books may have been under that category.On my 36th birthday, my better half presented me with the entire Dark Tower series. I was speechless and I plan to read and review each and every one of them. It won't be hard considering that I just finished \\"Gunslinger\\" in less than two hours. It sucked me right in.

Just trust me, read it for yourself and please do not wait as long as I did to start the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I travel quite alot over the road, so I have been listening to audio books for about ten years. Audio books are a great way to ward off sleep and keep you entertained while enduring the tedium of travel. I was first introduced to Roland Deschain in the short story included in \\"Everything's Eventual\\". I remember thinking it was strange and didn't fit with anything that Stephen King had ever wrote, but I was immediately interested. I'm not a big Stephen King fan but have enjoyed everything of his I've read. After finishing \\"Everything's Eventual\\" I went in search of King's additional writings about the Gunslinger.To my delight I found that the final installment of the series had just recently come out in audio format, good. It was quite tome, in audio book format it was 29 hours long with 24 cd's, even better. Also there were seven volumes in the series, that was the best part. Did I mention I drive alot. Well I figured that I better start at the begining and was somewhat disappointed to find the first installment was only 7 hours long, but no matter there were six others and judging from their girth I was going to have a lot to listen to for the foreseeable future. Never did I suspect what that future held.The Dark Tower series is at once strange and compeling. After you get past the initial difficulties with language and setting, the people of Roland's time speak with a strange dialect and live in a world that at once is and is not our own, you become curious and drawn in to the narrative.This series is absolutely amazing in audio format. The oral tradition of sitting around the fire listening to stories told over generations is clearly embodied in this work. The mythical story of the Gunslingers and Roland Deschain draws you in so completely that I've missed exits on the highway and sat outside of my house after driving many hours to hear what happens next.I own over fifty audio books but this series is the ultimate example of the genre. Incidentally, the entire series took me over a year to listen to, but the characters are so mesmerizing that even today, two years after completing the series, I still think about them. And as Stephen King says all of his stories end here, so, if your a King fan don't be surprised at the appearance of characters from his other works. I'm not a King expert but I imagine some of his most enigmatic characters are the ones we meet during Roland's quest. The ones with which he has some unfinished business.For anyone that has not been exposed to audio books or has snubbed their nose at the thought of being read to, give \\"The Gunslinger\\" a chance.\\"Death but not for you Gunslinger\\""},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"If you can not commit to a series DON'T READ THIS BOOK, this is just the beginning of a fascinating story. Reading only one book may result in the negative reviews I've seen, think of each book as a long chapter, and the gunslinger is just Chapter 1.Meet Roland Deschain of Gilead, the last gunslinger, and join him in his quest to find the man in black, he has spent years on this task, and this is just his first step towards his real quest which is finding the dark tower. As I write this review I am starting book 5 of the Audio Books (unabridged); I have never looked forward to my 1 hour commute (each way) until I got hooked on this story, I LOVE traffic jams now. Book 1 and Book 5 are read by George Guidall, books 2-3-4 are read by Frank Muller which I liked much better, and because I started and continued right away with each book, the change really bugged me. But the story is so compelling that I just got hooked again. Join the journey!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Definitely one of King's better works. Very imaginative, and the protagonist is one of the finest knights I have encountered in any work. This is not a work of horror, but is instead an introduction to an entirely new universe, one that ends up tying together many disparate works by King, including \\"It\\", \\"The Stand\\", \\"Salem's Lot\\", and others.Reading this will not move you to take on a new philosophy, but you will be transported to a place that is enchanting, whole, and intriguing. This book showed to me that King can be quite a bit broader in his writing than I had previously assumed."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Book 1 in Stephen King's 7-part epic, The Dark Tower series gets off to a slow start with poor pacing and muddy storytelling in setting up his mammoth (from what I hear) storyline. The series does get better and becomes more interesting from book 2 and on from what I've been told so I'll give the next book a try to see what all the hoopla is about."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Even though it is somewhat disjointed and occasionally some of the seams show (The Gunslinger was actually written and published as several short stories/novelettes in F&amp;SF over a several year period), this is an excellent read. In basic format it is a classic 'quest' fantasy (as it should be, being based at least partially on the Childe Roland epic poem). Where it differs, startlingly so, is in its protagonist, a 'noble' knight remade in the image of an impossibly competent Old West gunslinger. Unlike much of the other King material I've read, Roland is almost totally defined as a character by his actions. His decision to remain in a town he knows is a trap (and leading to his slaughter of the entire town), his method of fighting in his 'coming of age' test, his sacrifice of Jake -- each item adds to the defined character, and it is not a very pretty picture that gets painted. At the same time, his very stubbornness and single-minded continuation towards his goal, regardless of obstacles, is a traditional picture of a hero type.The world that Roland inhabits and his 'man in black' quarry reminded me a lot of some of Zelazny's work (like Jack of Shadows and ...And Call Me Conrad) -- not quite our world, hazy, different, but with some recognizable sign-posts along the way that connects in some form with our mythos/archetypes. In some areas, it's a little too hazy, most especially in not giving the reader a roadmap to the 'rules' that govern his world - we go from everyday 'bullets work like normal' to 'raising the dead' to 'time warpage' without any real guide to what is possible or normal in this world. But the background history he gives Roland is just enough to whet the reader's appetite to look for more pieces to his puzzle world and the reason behind his quest.Overall, not a great work, as while it stands alone, it is obviously only a part of a much larger story, and the disjointedness is sometimes jarring. Still, this is a quite memorable and different story than the average King blockbuster."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Potent, dreamlike, dark, but also... gratuitous, indulgent, offensive.There's no doubting King's ability to write evocative prose, to create a scene. There is, however, much reason to doubt his ability to write a coherent story: fabulous gloss, but not much going on underneath. Definitely nothing healthy. Don't get me wrong - I can \`enjoy' (as King seems to want us to) an atrocity as much as the next ghoulish reader, but I want it to mean something - to hit me. Although he's ten times the writer Goodkind is, King is similarly too blithe about brutality for it to really be brutal. Contrast this with, for example, Banks'Use of Weaponsand Card'sEnder's Game: both include stingingly ugly incidents, but they actually sting because they're not hurled about so casually, and we are able to feel something for the victims and even the perpetrators. The gunslinger, however, can shoot everyone in a whole town without causing a fraction of the emotional reaction in the reader. The townsfolk are so obviously one-dimensional characters, foils - I mean, sure, the whole thing \`looks' amazing, the consistent mood and scenery reminds me of the incredibly rich visuals of the TV seriesCarnivale(whoever directed this could definitely do \`The Gunslinger' justice), but we're so detached from these dreamlike, no, not \`characters', that's too strong a word for them - they're more like props: there's a piano in the saloon bar, there's a guy who'll get shot later. King loved the movie westerns a little too much - he hasn't merely recreated their mood, he's included the scaffolding holding up the shopfronts in the Hollywood back lot. This is more a tribute to (wonderful) artifice than an attempt at story.There's a weakness in making Roland's life automatically worth so much more than anyone else's. He becomes a little absurd - like Rambo standing invulnerable in a hail of bullets - because he's American and has his shirt off, and the others are just faceless gooks, bit players in a deliberately farcical melodrama. Death here really means nothing - they're just falling down like kids in a playground game.Again, King's skills as a presenter of scenes can fool you, or maybe that's all you might be asking of him, but this book really lacks substance - ironically in the same way that so many glib \`happy ending' books (that you might be trying to escape from with King) lack substance. So many fantasy novels, for example, have no suspense because we can all see a mile off how the author is going to indulge his lead characters with wonderful powers that mean his evil nemesis never really had a chance, and that he'll get the girl. However, for King, the doom, instead of the victory, is just too easy - we know the gunslinger's going to be tortured, and going to bump into all sorts of abuse along the way, because that's the evil deus et machina that King is - but it's still lazily pulling God out of the box to ruin things with no attempt to make this square with a wider sensical plot.I mean, really, what's going on with the ridiculous \`man in black' who, for all his pretensions of grandeur and mystery, \`might as well go by the name Snidely Whiplash and twirl his handlebar moustache' (thankyou Tony Hines). There is no attempt to even vaguely explain his godlike powers - maybe he writes to the same ACME people that miraculously supplied Wile E. Coyote with anything he could imagine. How can we feel the tragedy we're supposed to with Jake's death when it's just a card being turned? Now the man in black telekinetically controls railway bridges - uh, right, great. And why is this demigod running from Roland? Why is he devoting himself entirely to torturing this man in these odd ways? Maybe I'm meant to be asking these questions to hook me into the story, but I really don't care about the answers: I don't trust King actually knew - he just ran with something that felt good to him.And while we're talking about ridiculous characters - did you pick that pretty much every woman we meet (Soobie, Allie, the Oracle, even Roland's mother) - are ruled by their sexual cravings. Yeah, that's pretty much what women are like, isn't it: they just want sex so bad that they let men order them about. I suppose this is a fantasy, but this aspect is particularly puerile. I reckon King would be better as part of a team: someone else comes up with a structure - he then comes into the picture by creating the ride.I could almost go along for the ride alone. My edition has the first couple of chapters of Volume 2, \`The Prisoner', and, sure, King can cast a spell. He's particularly good at openings - creating a striking scene, and hinting at all sorts of intriguing mysteries that you'd like to have solved. However based on this volume I suspect he doesn't have anything substantial waiting for us - just more of this enigmatic darkness. But I don't think it's enough for me, impressive as it is. Give me some charm, some humour, some insight. Give me some reason for Roland having to be minutes away from death before he finally stumbles across a mystical door, or a way station, or whatever will be next - apart from the reason that it feels more dramatic that way. In the dream that is Mid-world anything can happen, and that's not a good thing if it's lazy and random. Well, not good for me anyway - but if you enjoy the vibe, man, of brutality in competently evoked settings, if you just want to escape the nauseating sentimentality of so many \`feel-good' books and would like to feel bad for a change (in a detached, clearly contrived way from the comfort of your armchair) just for the heck of it, go ahead, pull up a chair."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Sometimes something grabs you about a book. You are not sure what, you are not sure how. Somehow a writer just is able to captivate and create something that is awe inspiring. I remember the first time I heard whispers of the Gunslinger. This was during middle school and I had read so many of Stephen King's books by that time. Yet this one was not anywhere to be found. Yet long and hard I searched, thought of, dreamed of, this mysterious book called the Dark Tower: The Gunslinger.Finally Plum came out with a trade paperback edition of this book. I got it RIGHT AWAY. I looked at the picture of the front. There, the man, Roland, the Gunslinger and that bird on his shoulder. I dont know how it caught me, but it did.My parents and I got into the van and started back home, a fifteen to twenty minute drive. During those fifteen minutes I was silent, a ghost, in the back seat, reading the first part, the Gunslinger, of this novel (the novel itself is a collection of a group of short stories S. K. wrote for a magazine and then was published as a limited edition hardback by Donald M. Grant publishing company).\\"The Man in Black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed.\\"That was/is the first sentence of this novel. It was like reading the Bible for me (as a Strong Christian, I am one who will hang on every word or at least strive to as I read the Bible), it was that captivating, it took me into a world that I had only fantasized about. Of course unlike the Bible, this book is fiction (which is too bad since after reading this book my friends and I started a Gunslinger reading club and we all wanted to be like Roland). A fantasy realm that is in my opinion just as good as the Lord of the Ring series. In fact, I will stand up and say very proudly and with much ernest that out of the whole 20th century, the only two series that are worth anything are LotR and the Dark Tower.King and Tolkien are the two masters of the 20th century literature. And I would fight the hounds of hell against anyone who thinks otherwise.Stephen King created a universe, that slowly but surely was connected to most of S.K.s other books. The Gunslinger is probably the greatest Male figure in all of literature of the fantastique. He is strong, but he is a romantic; he is intense, but he knows how to crack a smile; he is heroic, but he is not without his achiles heel. This is how a man should be, in life and in soul.If you want to read a book that with captivate you, that will bring you into a ghostly realm of action, adventure, romance, betrayal, theology, philosophy...then read the Dark Tower series, starting with this book. Your breath will be taken away and you will be launched into one of the second greatest epics known to literature.I will let you know that Stephen King has come out with a redone version of the Gunslinger. You can keep or take it, I really love it, but I also have to say...I love the haunting mystique of the original version that I got so long ago. The new version is somewhat changed here and there, there is a new way of introducing the first chapter of the first part. There are new revisions of characters. Still...like I said...that one version so long ago...was what really captured me and made me see that the Gunslinger is the greatest novel of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"For a long time I resisted buying and reading these books. I don't quite know why. I like Stephen King. I like post-apocalyptic dark fantasy alternative reality. But for some reason, I just balked. Then I finally gave in and managed to get almost all of them within a couple weeks (exceptWolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower, Book 5), which I've only just managed to track down, leaving me hanging half-way through for some months), and I started reading. What a world, what a world - and what a fascinating character is Roland Gilead, the last of the gunslingers.From the sounds of things, Roland is ageless, near immortal, and has been chasing after the Man in Black for a very long time. It is while chasing the Man in Black through the desert that Roland meets up with the boy Jake at an abandoned way station - and Jake appears to be from our world; how he got to Roland's world is a mystery.I won't ramble on about the plot - there are over 500 reviews here, plus long editorial reviews and I'm sure the plot is expressed well by someone else. I tend to throw out spoilers when I try, so I won't waste your time. I'll just say this: if you, like me, are unsure whether to go ahead and read these books - stop second-guessing yourself and go for it. Not only is the story entertaining, but it is also multi-layered. I have a feeling that reading it multiple times will result in multiple understanding - I've actually just finished reading it for the second time in less than a year, since I just gotWolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower, Book 5)and thought it best that I re-read the first four books before going on, so I can refresh my memory, and I can see things I've missed. I think people who aren't generally fans of Stephen King's works might still enjoy The Dark Tower series, because it is different than his usual fare in many ways, even though it has webs of other stories that occasionally wind through it. Definitely give this series a try."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"A Reaction to The GunslingerThe Gunslinger is a more valid literary contribution than most readers would expect from Stephen King. A complex story of a man both more and less than moral and the beginning of his quest to save his world, it is shares themes of redemption with King's other masterpiece, The Stand. Roland Deschain, the Gunslinger, was a kind of knight/diplomat of the civilized but brutally straightforward land of Gilead where hard men with guns and near superhuman talents maintained peace and order. Twelve years after Roland's land experienced a revolution and fell to chaos we meet the last gunslinger on the trail of a magician who holds the secret of \\"The Dark Tower.\\" A picture of the romantic yet unrelenting force of justice, the gunslinger sees the world in tones of gray and commits ever escalating crimes as his humanity begins to wane.On his way to the Man In Black, who is his way to the path that ends at the tower, Roland meets a young boy who died in our world and awakened in the gunslinger's own. Roland comes to love Jake but believes him to be a trap left by the Dark Man, which comes to be true, as Roland must choose between the boy and the tower.The flashbacks that tell the story of Roland's childhood and imply the nature of the world filled with \\"love and light\\" have a similar texture to White's The Once and Future King and lend a sense of majesty to Roland's lost life. The Gunslinger's recollections also hint at a world not as great as he thinks, a world where hurting children is a valid educational technique, the highest level of people are strong killers and the makings of revolution are already present. These segments only add to the rich story by creating a allowing a different perspective, through a different narrative position, and shedding a full spectrum of light on Roland's gray tale.In addition to King's usual horror, the reader finds a different use of language and adjectives that lends itself to a higher level than many of King's shock and grab stories. King's utilizes every bit of talent he has in writing sharp, short sentences that create a stilted tone whose word choice implies great depth. The world of The Gunslinger isn't supposed to feel whole but it does feel real and worth the attention. The phrase, \\"The world had moved on since then. The world had empted.\\" (Pg. 11) takes on a dusty yet romantic quality and becomes a suiting basis on which the picture of a world gone wrong is aptly painted. After the first ten pages the reader becomes engrossed in this story and its main character.Of course, many classic themes in King's writing are present, the used deus-ex-machina and foreshadowing move the story along and provide for dead ends. The good versus evil theme is obviously carried through the notion of knight seeking out a means to redeem a dying world. The common King characterization also pervades this book, providing description both physical and moral that praises common Christian values and down-home sentiments.The quest for the Dark Tower, revealed at the book's climax as the lynchpin of all existence, and setting to order whatever is wrong there is an important enough theme as to provide the Dark Tower Series its name and to dominate most discussion and action throughout the seven books but it is the Gunslinger's story. The quest for the tower is the main focus of the books because it is Roland's quest, his focus. The Gunslinger is the preamble of that quest, the last few months of Roland's twelve-year ordeal to find the way to the Dark Tower. It is the last hurdle Roland faces, the sacrifice of his humanity for his honor, that makes this book so appealing."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is the star of an epic series: The Dark Tower. I was pulled immediately into reading this wondrous tale because I was influenced by King's other works.To start off, this book can easily be finished in a day or two, partly because of its length, partly because of the great way it's written. King explains a world he has created, known as Mid-World, and Roland of Gilead, the Last Gunslinger, searches endlessly for the Dark Tower, for reasons I will not discuss so I don't ruin the storyline for those of you who have never read this book.King uses a great combination of description and character-development, and he makes the plot run smoothly. As for the description: there is not too much, nor is there too little; it is described perfectly, so that you know just how Roland's expression looks when he sees an evil monster; so that you know how the mountains look as Roland climbs them, so you receive just enough description of the desert hardpan to imagine how sickly hot it is. This factor alone is just a sample of the great story telling witnessed when reading this book.And as for character development? The characters act as though they were in a real-life situation, simply put. Roland wouldn't say, \\"Oh no, here they come, I must beat them to the exit!\\" He would say something along the lines of a brief swearing, then he would run and complete his mission. Which is probably what anyone would do in a situation where you're cornered by *taken out to avoid giving spoilers*, don't you think?What makes Roland's character so unique: his weapon is not a sword, a dragon, and a magical fire spell, which all exist in the lame novel Eragon; Roland uses two revolvers. That is probably the most unique character I've ever seen in an epic tale. This is one reason why Roland is such a memorable character: he's unique from any other person you've read about in your life. You may try for the rest of your life to find a similarity between the Last Gunslinger and another epic hero; you'll find none. His personality also plays a role in this: he gains friends, but tries not to become attached to them, because he needs them to search for the Tower. This also makes him a unique character.And the plot: try all you want to predict what'll happen next. I've had feelings of, \\"Okay, I just KNOW he'll make it out alive of this situation.\\" The truth? That you don't know who will die and who will live. I know, I know, you see this type of stuff in New York Times reviews, what with all the plot-twists they talk about in every book they review. But in the Gunslinger? It's true. There are actually plot twists existing. And that's what made me read this book for several days straight. And after reading the Gunslinger, you'll wanna read The Drawing of the Three.That's all I'm saying about this book. It tells a great story about an epic hero with a distinct and definite goal: to reach the Dark Tower. And he'll do ANYTHING to reach it. So I advise you to read this great tale of friendship, twists, conflict, and sheer terror as King unleashes a myriad of beasts and freakish monsters he himself has created..."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is one very good book. I really like the characters here because I really believe this is a story you will not be able to put down. Many people dont have time to read but when you pick this book up you will not be able to put it down. Make sure you have extra time on your hands or else youll become glued to the book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As a serious scholar of English literature, I had often pooh-poohed King as a novelist. Even the biggest of fans has to admit that his popular fiction, although certainly riveting as page turners, could hardly rate as first class. However, after reading The Gunslinger I hold the man in high esteem as a writer. Using the poem, Childe Roland by Robert Browning as a touchstone, King has created a world that is compelling and literarily sound. His use of language and symbolism is deft. I think when all the points are tallied, King will be remembered as a literary giant. If you are unsure about his writing ability then give his Dark Tower series a chance."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"And let me tell you, this book gets a lot of it. Frankly, it's really over the heads of some readers of King's popular fiction, mostly because this was written off and on between projects all the way up until its release. That gives the book a bit of a disjointed feel, to tell the truth, not within the individual episodes (there are six), but between them. All the same, the story and the writing here is wonderful, and should be appreciated by any fan of King or writing in general.Some of the negative reviews may draw their roots from confusion regarding the book itself--King doesn't do a good job explaining himself. Frankly, I'm thankful that he didn't. In a world where all the new fantasy reads like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, magic and the fantastic seem to have been discarded in favor of a kind of warped science. Don't get me wrong, I liked Jordan until the novels stagnated, but I didn't realize how much I missed NOT KNOWING how everything worked until I read this book.This story is full of the fantastic above all else. Walter, in particular, is a memorable character who I hope receives a treatment in the second &quot;flashback&quot; book of the series. The intertwining of popular culture (I can't here Instand Karma without thinking about the chasm scene) with King's own fantastic elements in Mid-World (a play on Middle Earth?) are at their best in this book, rivaled nowhere expect possibly The Wastelands. Even the philosophical jaunt into metaphysics taken in the sixth episode smacks of the fantastic, and it's wonderfully executed. All things considered, this would be a wonderful read even in itself, and it stands apart in the Dark Tower series as exceptional."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Jorma Knowles:&quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger&quot; is, in my view, one of the best novels that the author, Stephen King, has written. The main character, Roland The Gunslinger, is complex and fascinating, and worthy of the series of books that he is featured in. The story of the book seems at first glance to be simple, but deeper into it you realize that it is much more complicated then you first thought. Roland is the last Gunslinger, a sort of knight who is charged with protecting the bleak and violent world that he lives in (it is referred to as having &quot;moved on&quot;), and his quest is simple: he is searching for a strange, distant thing called &quot;The Dark Tower,&quot; something that has been seeked by the other Gunslingers before him. As he walks across a vast desert, he encounters various obstacles and other supernatural things (althought this NOT a horror novel) and finds a young boy from our universe named Jake, who actually died where he came from and was transported to the Gunslinger's world by an evil wizard who Roland is pursuing named simply &quot;The Man In Black.&quot; (who is really a man from the Gunslinger's past named Walter) i wont tell you the end of this volume (the first) in the Dark Tower saga, but i promise that it will surprise you. Overall, the novel is well-written, with wonderful prose that is much different from Steve King's other work, and so utterly involving that you will find yourself caring for it's characters and it's story so much that you will jump right over to the next book in the series ( The Dark Tower: The Drawing of The Three) and not be able to put it (or any of the other's; the latest, the fourth, is coming out in November) down"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book sets the stage for one of the greatest series and one of the greatest pieces of work Stephen King has ever done. King creates a fantasy world all his own where there is only one gunslinger left, Roland of Gilead. In this first part we learn of his quest for the Dark Tower and his search for the man in black. The book is wonderfully done and if you've read it you've no doubt read the rest of the series. If you haven't though you really should. Part II is even better and by then you'll be starving for the next book, The Waste Lands. For anyone who thinks King is just a horror writer simply read this book. Enough twists and turns to keep you planted on the sofa and reading for hours."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have always been a great fan of Stephen King's books, but when I read this and others in the series (particularly Wizard &amp; Glass which is the 4th Dark Tower book), I found myself engrossed to the point that I literally could not put the book down. A totally fresh idea from Mr King and a welcome change of genre for me.I wait with baited breath for the next one. Will Roland ever be able to free himself of the guilt he carries for the untimely deaths of so many of his friends? Will he ever find love again? And will he ever reach the elusive Tower?I can't wait to find out. Even my Mother loves them."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Dude, Roland ROCKS!

Dude, that dude is BAD!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I was looking for a something epic to start reading while I travel. I'd heard The Dark Tower had a cult following and that the fans were pretty hard core. Well I wanted to become hard core about a book as well.This first book, I just didn't get it. The writing was great, and some of the scenes were excellent, but I had a hard time understanding what the hype was all about. I wasn't really sure what to expect and I think I had a totally different impression of the book prior to going into it.After starting the second book, The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three, I now really enjoy the world of Roland (main character) and look forward to continuing the series. I guess it's true what some reviews say, you just have to get through the first one to start really getting into it. So I suppose I'll say it again:It Gets Better. . . just plow through The Dark Tower I so you can get to The Dark Tower II. Looking back at Dark Tower I, I'm glad I read it, but had I not continued the series I would have regretted it. It's hard for me to recommend this book to my friends without knowing they will commit to reading past it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I can't help the way I feel. This may be Stephen King's magnum opus, but I think it's a magnum flop. The Gunslinger is not at all entertaining, intriguing, or thought-provoking. It's not even fascinating in that pretentious, learned literary way. No, it's just incredibly boring; if boredom doesn't get ya the confusion will stop you in your tracks. Throughout the book, you don't know why the characters are there, you cannot understand the significance (if any) of any of the boring things they're doing, and after a while you're so bored that it makes no difference to you that it makes no sense. You just stop and wonder why you are wasting your time when there are probably twenty or thirty GOOD Stephen King books you could be reading instead. Even if you're disappointed in the outcome of a particular King book, such as 'It,' you will probably still have been thoroughly entertained during the course of the book, and if nothing else you will at least have learned the names of the main characters and their purpose within the first chapter or two. Not so with The Gunslinger.I checked out many of the positive reviews on this book and am not surprised to find out many of them are actually reviews of the entire series, which, from what I understand, does \\"pick up.\\" If I were going to bother finishing the series, I'm sure I would recall the utter drudgery of The Gunslinger and, might be able to consider it in retrospect as a \\"series intro\\" or a \\"means to an end.\\" But considering it that way still does not, unfortunately, magically transform The Gunslinger into a good book. And for me, life's too short to read an entire awful book and then take a chance the others in the series will somehow prove to be less awful."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The first book in the Dark Tower Saga is definetly slow. It took me a long time to even get myself to read the book. I have to say, don't judge the series by this one book. You have to invest some to get the true value of this series. To this book I have 2 Stars, but the series deserves a 5. Give the series a chance, this first book is really short, and the second one really gets the ball rolling. I know it's asking a lot, but it is well worth it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This is the first book I have ever dared read by Stephen King. I stole it from my HS Library, perhaps out of the typical fun that emerges from shoplifting or perhaps to do a duty that the Gunslinger would approve of.This first book hits right at the gut; Stephen King doesn't explain any of the incredible things that happen, he just writes it as it is with an undying darkness and classic prose. I do not recomend this book for the average King reader, as I have progressed through this series I have relealized that the Darkness has brightened and autenticity has kinda lost its edge.This first book stands alone as rebellion, complete and utter rebellion, I could feel, see, smell, and taste the rebellion and darkness as King wrote it. The second book memerized me like eye candy. The third kinda enterained me and kept me on the edge. The fourth and third books were labelled \\"TEEN\\" in my library. The first one once was placed in the most dangerous of adult sections. It sits of my drawer now, it shall stay there, illegitimate in the dark, gunslinger-esque way that stays in a small 300 page book (as compared to the others) unchanged and simply amazing. I recommend this first book only for someone old enough to deal with the real world: drugs, murder, prostitution, and a little bit of that gunslinger justice, good but not Too good.Thank you Mr. King for this excellent book.Regards,Bill StublerPS: To the young readers, read book III and IV first and then go to this book when you're ready."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"In the mid 80's when THE GUNSLINGER was released to the general public, I read it because, perhaps like you, I read everything King writes. But I didn't get it. I tried to read book 2, but couldn't get through it. In November 2001 a friend brow beat me and said, &quot;You gotta read these books.&quot; I did. I am so glad. But, if you haven't stated yet, I'd recommend reading The Drawing of the Three first, The WasteLand second, Black House (not part of this series) third, and the best book of them all Wizard and Glass fourth. Get all them behind you and then for background read The Gunslinger. I think it makes more sense this way. If you read King much you know Flagg is everywhere, but I never really drew the other connections between Flagg and Walter and The Crimson King, and Jack's flip universe in The Talisman, and the Low Men in Hearts in Atlantis, and ... you get the idea. Steve's got a theme going here, get on board. It's worth the plunge."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"were a mysterious man travels through scorched deserts with slinger's guns hanging from his hips.

Some parts were faster than others. I'm heading for the next one."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The gunslinger, takes you to a world that is beyond our own but shares some common history. It takes you to the start of Roland's great quest, and makes you wish you could go with him. It also shows you that Roland quest, is the most important thing in his life. After I read this story I never had more anticipation in my life as I waited for the next installment."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've read the whole series, and honestly that is the only way that this book can be appreciated. When spoken of in the context of the series it is a magnificent piece of work that leads your mind into realms of thought that you never knew existed. However, when it is looked at as a single book it is fairly weak. It ends with only a hint of closure that the dark man was found. As another reviewer has stated this easily could have been merely added onto the second part of the series (The Drawing of the three), and then it would have bolstered the strength of both stories. My four stars are generous when they rate just this book, but when used as a rating for what it fortells of what is to come, it is a pitiful grading scale because mere stars cannot define its impact."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I admire Stephen King tremendously for his writing skill, but I thought &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; was something of a disappointment. It's a lot shorter than his other books (it only took me 4 days), but that may be a good thing in this case, since the story seems to wander with no purpose. There are veiled references to some things in Roland's past, but hardly anything is revealed. There are several mentions of the Tower, but nothing is explained until almost the end, and even then it's vague and doesn't fill out the story nearly as well as I expected. I just picked up the second installment of the story, and I've heard it's a lot better. I hope so."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book started really slow, but by the end it was amazing. I excuse the slowness however, since it is all necissary for setting up the rest of the book and series. The insights in this book are truly ingenius: for example, tward the end of the book one of the characters points out that only enemies can tell the truth to each other, friends and lovers lie out of courtesy. It is a well done and facinating story. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"+AH4-After reading this book, you'll DEFINITELY want to read the continuences. This was a good book--very amuseing and Stephen King has good writing techniques. I hope you'll enjoy this book as much as I did.+AH4-"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger was a very interesting and intriguing book. I like books with new concepts, not the same old love story or action book. The Gunslinger tale is very unique. My head was constantly swirling attempting to grasp where exactly Roland was. King does an amazing job describing the landscape, action scenes, and thoughts of Roland the Gunslinger. I look forward to reading the rest of this series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The best way to describe this book is, it's one of those books that makes you attack people if they interrupt you while you're reading it. It's fantastic. Roland the Gunslinger is, by far, King's most convincing and haunting character, and the rest of his ka-tet are also fantastically well-written. This book makes you wonder where King comes up with this stuff."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is book about a super-hero persuing an arch villan in another dimension. It's like a darker version of the Batman comics. Everything about it is unoriginal. The most unoriginal character is The Man in Black. People who see UFO's have reported being visited by mysterious &quot;men in black&quot; since the 1950's. The 1997 feature length film was based on a comic book. The Gunslinger is just Superman fighting Lex Luther. The other characters are stupid and don't do anything. Other than that, it has a very thin plot. I mean, why is the Gunslinger fighting The Man in Black anyway?"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I started reading this book three years ago, at the age of 13. I got 60 pages into it before it was stolen, but I remembered loving it. When I finally got a new copy and read it again this year, I was let down. King explains that he wrote the book over 12 years at different times, and clearly his skill improved with time. The book is at varying levels of quality. The first part seems like a EC-comic western, with bizzare, degenerate characters and bleak, unexplained culture. The book crawls along until the pulse-quickening fourth part, &quot;The Slow Mutants&quot; and the hallucinegenic final chapter. It's a short book, and quick reading, but it's a weak introduction to the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad book. But it's rather slow, and gets a bit dull at times. Don't give up though, this is the first in one of the the best series I ever read! The second is the best, and the third and fourth are great as well. Just read this as an opening, and then continue to the rest (they're great, trust me). Long live the dark tower series!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King published his first novel, Carrie, in 1973. This started the beginnings of an unstoppable career, which today, includes over 150 published works, over 40 movies, and most recently a series of seven comic books based on the Dark Tower series.Stephen King was inspired to write the Dark Tower series after reading a poem written in 1855 by Robert Browning called Childe Roland and by the spaghetti western movies such as, \\"The Good, the Bad, the Ugly.\\" This first book is considerably shorter than all six of the rest of the books in the series, but sets the stage for the ride of a lifetime. The opening line, \\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\\" was written while he was an undergraduate in college. This first sentence traversed readers into an epic saga that has taken over twenty years to journey through.The Dark Tower series is a grand tale of good (Roland) vs. evil (Crimson King). This is a tale has been told since the beginning of time since the Bible and in recent works such as the Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien and the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. All these stories tell the epic battles of courageous heroes fighting incredible odds to save humanity from evil, (respectively the Jesus vs. Devil, Frodo vs. Saroun, and Harry vs. Lord Voldemort). The Dark Tower series is so entwined in Stephen King's writings that references, subtle and not so subtle, to the Dark Tower are found in sixteen of his other works, including It, The Stand, and Bag of Bones.I would recommend this book and Dark Tower series to young adult readers ages thirteen and up and to any one who is entranced by epic battles of good vs. evil. After you start the journey of reading the Dark Tower series, I would also recommend sidetracking and reading all the related relevant works to the Dark Tower series to help enhance your adventure while following Roland on his quest to save the Tower and humanity."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"If you are not familiar with the D.T. series you owe it to yourself to read the THE GUNSLINGER first, before any of the others.Sure it's weird a little at first and kinda hard to get into, but the information and relationship you form with Roland is vital (in my opinion) for you to be fully engulfed in the rest of the series.I really loved the DT series and will be recommending it to people for all my days. He is a master of his craft (well .... both Roland and Stephen actually) and by reading this first you will feel the full flow of the story, just as ol'Stevo would have hoped I'm sure."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book has very little introduction to the world of the Dark Tower, you basically start off in the middle of the story and have to learn what's going on as you read. For this reason the first book can be frustrating. However, by the time you start the second book things become much more clear and it's easier to get wrapped up in the story.Even if you dont like the first, it's well worth it to read the second book."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Even slow readers will have no problem plowing through this book. It's important to come into this book not expecting a WoT, SoT, or ASOIAF. Although the paperback version is some 300 pages, it would be about 150 pages in the same font and typeface as the others. If you read this book, simply expect a character introduction and a very enjoyable (extended) short story.This book was definitely a good change of pace from other books that I've read. There isn't too much fluff and pretty much everything that happens is explained thoroughly and not excessively. There isn't too much going on in the plot: there's one man, and one objective. There are only a few flashbacks and they are all fully integrated and understandable withing the context of the quest. There's no huge build-up that the world is about to end, only a simple struggle of man against man.If you are expecting a huge, epic journey from the start, you may be disappointed. If you want to read a book that gives a solid introduction into an epic journey, pick this book up and I assure you that you will pick up book 2."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have read The Gunslinger four times now. Every time that I read it, I tell myself, \\"It's time to read the entire series.\\" But for some reason I always quit after this, the first novel in the series. I'm still not sure why I have never continued on with the other books, but I am currently on another mission to read the entire Dark Tower saga. After finishing The Gunslinger (again) I think that I finally realized why I haven't gone on to finish the series. I think that I am afraid to find out the answers to all the questions posed in this amazing novel. I'm just afraid that I'll be disappointed with the ultimate answers. The conversation at the end of this novel is totally amazing and completely invigorating on an intellectual level. So how can Stephen King possibly follow it all up? I hope that he does in a grand fashion. Because this time, I intend to find out those answers."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"One of my favorite fictional books of all time. I can't remember how many times I've re-read this book. Stephen King at his best!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I started reading the Dark Tower series a few months ago. I am about halfway through and I have thoroughly enjoyed it so far. I purchased the updated and revised version of The Gunslinger and at first I was really annoyed with the book. Now that I am in book three of the story I overlook how I felt initially, but for those preparing to start the series understand that The Gunslinger is by far the slowest and most difficult book to read.The book follows the Gunslinger across a desert and in between words following the mysterious Man In Black. Even though the book is at points slow there are some really great moments that are very relevant in the entire story. I am reading the Waste Lands right now and a lot of what takes place in the Gunslinger is still relevant to the story. Reservations aside I recommend this book wholeheartedly. The storytelling is top notch and the world that Stephen King created is rich in detail and large in scope."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The first installment of Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" saga takes place on a pseudo-old-western world of ghost towns and scattered settlements and vast, encroaching deserts, where saloon pianos play Beatles songs and other out-of-place (and time) elements keep creeping in, on a world apparantly descended from a much more advanced civilization. An alternate world that apparantly faced some kind of global catastrophe and somehow re-emerged as a re-creation of the American Old West should come off very campy, but as you get into the book you quickly realize that it's not coming off that way at all, and the juxtaposition of believability on what should be absurdity results in an unnerving air, perhaps suggesting the breaking down of what we think of as reality, or the threads of fate knotted up in kinks.The heroes of the book are a ruthless gunslinger named Roland (constantly in pursuit of a mysterious 'man in black') and a boy named Jake from 'our' world who's somehow crossed over into this dessicated husk of a post-apocalyptic reality. There are a lot of nasty, often detestable characters in here, many of them nominally on the side of good. Included in this, though not to the extent of some of the others, is the title Gunslinger. I usually don't like the 'selfish anti-hero' role, the supposed good guy who's willing to mow down anyone in his way and sacrifice anything or anybody in pursuit of their own purportedly noble goal, but in here it works differently. The main reason way, I think, is you see the character starting not just to question his own actions, but really just becoming aware for the first time of just how far he repeatedly goes to assure the success of his quest. There's an impending sense that as the book goes along he's going to eventually come to a realization of how brutal he truly is, but that by then it may be too late, and also a catch-22 sense that even if he does decide he wants to stop or change, the quest, once its true nature is revealed, may for once actually be too important - on a cosmic scale - to ever stop. Roland seems to begin questioning his own methods primarily through the influence of Jake, whose complete innocence in all this seems to present almost unknown concepts to the Gunslinger. A really, really good and unique spin on the whole philosophical question of how much 'necesary' evil is justified to stop a presumably greater evil. It's also a really good story, a successful mixing of the western, horror, and fantasy genres, and some of the most memorably written passages King has ever done. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I'm glad I jumped on the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; bandwagon! The first installment of the series is a bit basic and slow at times, but it's quite good considering King was 19 when he wrote it. Don't be put off by anything here; just keep reading and the series will take off like a rocket in Part II."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"An interesting turn for King. Not your typical fantasy, but not your typical horror novel either. It's both, and has a Western flavor to it.It's hard to describe, other than saying the story is intriguing. Why is he reaching the Dark Tower? Who is the man in black? What are these prophecies? Where do they come from? What is the gunslinger's purpose?Is this one giant allegory?These are just a few of the many answered questions that this series provides. A thrilling read."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The mish-mash of Western, Sci-fi, and Fantasy is very contrived, and leaves a bad taste in the reader's mouth. The plot was very linear, and the ending just falls away. I will not be reading the next 7 in this series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I was hoping for better. I'm not a Stephen King fan or anything, so I didn't know what to expect. I felt it was kind of slow going with lots of references to things that are never explained.

This book does not stand alone at all, but I'm willing to keep going and see what the rest of the series has to offer."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"It was even better than what I had expected.

You have to read it for yourself in order to know what I am talking about - but I doubt you'll be disappointed..."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"At first the narrator voice was a strange when reading the female lines but after getting used to it I think he does a excellent job and toward the end of the book I loved his narration. Keeps the book very creepy."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Stephen King wrote this book years before he wrote the second. In fact, he probably wasn't certain that he would continue this story as a series. I believe (without looking up the details) that he wrote it as part of a science fiction magazine. With that in mind, this story is a tough one to start with, though it's necessary to start with. Don't judge the series based on this book. It's almost a prequal to the Dark Tower series. The second book, \\"The Drawing of the Three,\\" is more of a true beginning for the tale.That being said, it is important to read this book. In fact, you might be compelled to re-read it after reading the series. It's a sensational series, and I can't think of anything else like it. Whether you end up liking it or hating it, you will be compelled to read onward, because it truly stretches the mind. A captivating read of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The title says it all. The Dark Tower series on the whole is magnificent, but it starts off the wrong way. This book is just 200 pages of drivel where nothing important happens and next to nothing is explained. Borrow it just for the conversation with Walter at the end (which still doesn't explain or clarify anything; if it relates to the rest of the story at all I haven't yet seen how), but everything before it is pointless. I'm glad I gave the other books in the series a chance. I was pleasantly surprised to find out they're not nearly as bad as this one."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Not one of his best, I'm not sure if I'll read any more in this series. I guess it could get better, but not sure I want to invest in them. usually his books start off with cant put it down stuff."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Considering how many novels I've read by Stephen King, and considering that he is my favorite author, I am devastated that this book disappointed me SO much! Some of King's earlier works are not among his highest rated works (according to me) but this book is lower than all of them. For the first time I had to force myself to keep reading this book through to the finish because I simply could not get to any excitement. Ever. True this book may simply serve as an introduction to King's \\"magnum opus\\", but to save his readers from allowing the tragic dismay at the lack of excitement and unfulfilling plot from dissuading them to continue on with the series, this book ought to be combined with the second. After all, this book left me feeling like I had wasted $9.00 on what I thought would be a sure bet. I'm sure that I will continue on to \\"The Drawing of the Three\\", but I will not be buying it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I understand that this book is just the first in a large series but there were so many loose ends that the novel was rather confusing throughout the story, even in the end. None of the characters aside from the main two hang around long enough for you to become attached to them. Compared to other Stephen King books that I have read, this was definitely on the lower end. Many of the characters in the story were also rather disappointing. Most characters hardly stick around for more than a couple chapters, and others are simply memories of the main characters. In a story with very little background, this just adds to the complexity of the story. I am giving the second book a chance now just to see what the hype is all about but I would recommend just picking up one of his many other novels instead."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I know this is a stephen king book and I loved other books by him but still, i just couldn't read this one.It was boring. It put me in a dark mood. I could hardly care what came next. All the dust and the heat and the general background in the book made me want to wash myselft.In short, I tried twice but couldn't get past twenty or thirty pages into the book.I'm not sure what other people would learn from this review but anyway, this is it.I can only recommend people read the start of the book before buying it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Here is where it all starts. The gunslinger, with his donkey.This book, for me personally took two times to get through completely. The second time I attempted this book, it was a lot easier. I think that the last half of this book was a lot easier, and better paced that the first half. Roland is hard character to get to know, but once you understand him, he haughts you and you can't forget him.the character Jake is well-written and hard to forget. The man in black is an easily erasable, no-big-deal character. There are some things in this book that seem like \\"not a big deal\\" at the time, but are kind of a big deal. As, always, a well-written novel."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I'm really trying to like this story, but it's just not keeping my attention. Usually I enjoy a Stephen King book, but this one really just sucks. I don't understand the hype behind the Dark Tower. It was going to be my first e-book, but my sister talked me into The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which despite the popularity was a fantastic book, the 3rd installment of the series was getting a little stale, but 1 and 2 were great. I stopped reading The Gunslinger and am now quite happy reading World War Z, I started it yesterday and can't put it down."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"In the introduction to one of his later novels, Stephen King states that one of the best lines he wrote was the first line of this book, \\"The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed.\\" I agree, as this line is simple yet extremely powerful within that simplicity. The first two books of the series were by far my favorites, but this one especially. With the line, \\"Go then! There are other worlds than these,\\" we get to see a perspective of Roland and Jake that I don't think is really characterized quite the same in the later novels in the series. In addition, the mystery of the whole world is enticing, with revelation in the later novels somewhat spoiling the mystique of this series.One thing that I would have liked to see, however, is more development on the Crimson King earlier, as well as a better explanation of the \\"Good Man.\\" For those who haven't yet read the rest of the series, the Crimson King comes up later, but John Farson is introduced in this first novel (if I remember correctly). It's never really explained, however, how he fits into the whole fall of Gilead, nor his relationship with the Crimson King (other than simply being his servant).Some of the literary devices used, such as the ending of this book, are exceptionally well done. As the reader progresses through the story, I become connected to the characters. Jake's death in this novel still haunts me as surrealistic, but there is a quality to it that makes it seem almost dreamlike, which made be believe he would return in later novels. The idea of a waystation in the middle of the desert being the location where much of the story of the Dark Tower starts is also interesting to me.All in all, I think this novel is very well written, but I would be amiss to say that it's the best work I've read of Stephen King's."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"...I just couldn't put this book down. It's just so interesting--and even has a good bit of action. You can see why Stephen King is the master!Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"When I read the short story called \\"Little Sisters of Eluria\\" by Stephen King, I liked it so much that I was really looking forward to getting my hands on the first book of The Gunslinger series. But, throughout the entire book, I did not experience any of the level of involvement that I did with the short story. I didn't want to stop reading \\"Little Sisters...\\" I have heard that this series gets better as you go along, but I am not one to purchase and read the second book when the first one did not grab me. If I am not pulled in in the first couple of chapters, I usually put a book down. But, because of the short story - and because this was Stephen King, who I respect tremendously, I read on and finished the book. But, I have to say that I was disappointed because I really had much higher expectations."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"the gunslinger is so painfully boring that not only did i stop reading it half way through, i also pitched it into the garbage can...don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"a note to amazon... the sample of this book is only intro material and includes not one word of the story."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I didn't like this book.

The characters are too shallow for one thing. The story seems to just drag on un-necessarily as well, which is pretty bad considering it is a fairly short read to begin with.I might read the rest of the series eventually, but for now I'm in no hurry to be disappointed further, by such a great author."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I confess that I have never been a great fan of King. I honestly found some Agatha Christie novels more creepy than the supposedly horror stuff this guy writes. But that is not the point here, this is not a horror novel. The problem with this book is that it is so difficult to get yourself interested enough to keep on turning the pages. Stephen King at 19 was a poor wordsmith and I repeatedly found myself getting plain bored. And I am a fantasy lover and a guy who enjoys Western movies too. If you are a die-hard fan of the Dark Tower series (some of the later books are good indeed) you may read and manage to enjoy this too, but for a beginner my advice will be to stay away"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"---Now First of All I Want to Say I Don't Mean Any Offense By This Review----Ok, so i picked up The Gunslinger at the library and was eager to check it out since I read all the wonderful reviews given to the book on Amazon. I took the book home and began reading. The chapters are easy and the pages fly.Well, I got to about page 200 and by then I was so confused and frustrated that I had to stop reading the book.There was so much background knowledge which the characters refer to and which King doesn't tell the reader that while reading I found myself saying &quot;What. I don't understand.&quot;I think I mainly didn't like The Gunslinger because it just wasn't the type of book I like. I loved Lord of the Rings, but this book is NOT like LTR no matter what anyone says. It's Louis L'Amor meets The Stand, except unlike in The Stand, King doesn't really allow the reader to get to know the characters.So, if you're a traditional Stephen King fan and enjoy his novels such as The Shining, Salem's Lot, Christine, etc. don't read the Gunslinger."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As of right now this book has 380 5stars and 38 1starsIn my opinion this book is more like a 3 or 4This review is more for the people who aren't king fanbois and are thinking of taking the plunge and tackling all 7 books of the dk series, don'tIt's not worth the time or commitmentBook 1 is pretty goodBook 2 is kinda meh, I didn't like the magic doors to modern day NYC when it was first introduced and I came to loathe the concept in the later booksBook 3 is good, though it doesn't have an ending, the first in a series of many cop-outs by the author, so glad I didn't read this when it first came out, I'd be ripping if I had to wait 6yrs to find out what happensBook 4 is arguably the best in the seriesIn King's introduction he goes into length at how he struggled with writing these 4 books, he didn't know what to do with them so he put them on the back burner, fast forwardHe get's into a near fatal car accident, decides he doesn't want to die with the series unfinished, and bangs out the last 3 books in 2yrs (he should have left them unfinished)Book 5 is an ok story, but it completely stagnates the progression of the story and is completely unnecessary, mehBook 6 is just straight up bad, here is where things start to go south and fastBook 7 is the worst, here is where even the most die hard king fanbois get a wake up call and stop defending all the misstepsThe 1 and 2 star reviews for book 7 are worth checking out before starting this seriesAs a whole it's not just bad, it's really bad"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Every October I try to read on horror book to get me in the mood for Halloween. I have previously choosen a number of Steven King titles, all of which did a great job getting me ready for the spookiest time of year. This year I decided on this book, and must admit that I am terribly disappointed in it. It never seemed to go anywhere, and ended without actually ending. I have since read that Steven King wrote this over many years, and did not have a plan for the story when he started. To me, it felt just like that, incomplete, unplanned, and just a rambling idea. I will not be reading any more of this series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Let me sum up this book in one sentence, \\"There was a man searching for the dark tower.\\" There, I have just spared you the effort of reading this book. This was the first Stephen King book I have read and I believe it will be my last. I am an avid reader of quality fantasy/sci-fi books and the Dark Tower series was recommended by a co-worker. I had a really hard time fininshing this book and when I finally did, I felt like I had completely wasted my time. The world that King tried to create was vague at best. The book went nowhere and I felt like I knew nothing about the characters when I was finished. Many chapters did not make sense and I could not vizualize much of what I was reading. The other books in the series might be better, but I will not be wasting more time to find out."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I am a big Stephen King/Richard Bachman fan from way back when. I love his Gunslinger series. Of course you may not want to take my critique too seriously, because I just think that this author just can't go wrong. Even his early stuff was good and he has just gotten better and better at his craft."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.\\" If you can resist an opening sentence like that, you have more willpower than I. The Gunslinger begins The Dark Tower series, which follows Roland's quest to reach the nexus of all universes. Since King finished the seven volume series in 2004, it's safe to start reading! I also would highly recommend George Guidall or Frank Muller's narrations. (Nota Bene: This is NOT a horror series or story. King may be best known for writing horror novels, but he is a masterful storyteller and writer in other genres too!)"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I've been told countless times to read the Dark Tower series, only hearing good things about it. I do have to say that I am glad I read the introduction to The Gunslinger. It helped me understand what I was to expect from the series and why this first book was so rough to read.Aside from the book being a little rough to understand, the actual story kept me wanting more. It did its job in making me want to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"One of my greatest inspirations as a writer and an artist, The Gunslinger delivers hardcore. This tale is a post-apocalyptic fantasy that is gleaned from a mishmash of genres, fusing such unexpected time periods and societies as the Old West, medieval feudalism, and sci-fi futuristic. Roland, the figure that is central to the tale (and those that follow) is a stoic but tormented figure, part fairy story hero, part gritty Clint Eastwood antihero via Pale Rider or High Plains Drifter. Fans of numerous genres (fantasy, gothic, western, sci fi, post-apocalyptic, steampunk) will thrill at this can't-put-down read, which is refreshingly short for Mr. King (who has a tendency to pack a lot of unnecessary tangents and deadwood in with some of his novels). At under 250 pages, the book is a quick, but not too quick, adventure that will leave you thinking about the characters and their plight long after the last page has been turned."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I am very late to start reading this series but I am glad that I am reading it. I finished this book in only one day which is a rarity for me, but this book is so well written that I could not help myself. I am very excited to keep reading the remaining books to this series, and I also cannot wait for the movie version of this to come out."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Being the first book of the seven book series comprising \\"The Dark Tower\\", \\"The Gunslinger\\" is an interesting, entertaining read. Written by Stephen King with a strong influence by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and Western films, \\"The Gunslinger\\" is a journey into a world similar - yet remarkably different - than our own.The story follows Roland of Gilead - the titular Gunslinger - as he chases the Man in Black. As the story unfolds and develops, the reader gains a bit of an understanding why the cat and mouse chase is taking place. Along the way, Roland befriends a young boy, Jake, who accompanies him on his journey to find the Man in Black. Jake already knows the Man in Black - he has seen him before when he lived in \\"our\\" world, before he was \\"transported\\" to Roland's.The story and writing itself is very good - Stephen King is an excellent writer. With the opening line \\"The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the Gunslinger followed\\", how can a reader not be interested enough to at least learn more about the story? It is a great introduction and first piece to what is hopefully a great series (albeit very long).The one gripe is that sometimes it feels as if King is trying a little too hard to make his story epic - which he was intent upon doing from the beginning. His goal was to create an epic, and at places his writing conveys the idea that he is really, really, really trying to make it become an epic, rather than it becoming an epic on its own.Other than that, it is an excellent fantasy read - which deviates from King's traditional genre(s) - with some provocative writing. Particularly interesting and thought provoking is the conversation with the Man in Black about size (pages 220-223 in the hardcover edition).If you're a fan of King and are looking to read more of his works, this is one that should be high on the list. If you aren't a fan or inexperienced with King and are looking to read a work or two of his, this should be very high on the list. If you're a fan of fantasy or science fiction, this should be high on the list. All in all, this is a great book, full of interesting ideas and written with a different - yet highly inspired - style."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The start of king's magnum opus, the dark tower, the gunslinger. Very quickly the reader is sucked into rolands universe. A gunslinger in a dieing world where at first we don't know very much except that he's chasing the man in black across the desert. The book then starts to feed us bits and pieces of the gunslingers back story and introduces us to a few characters from his past we have not yet met but are starting to learn about. I thought this was a fantastic novel, and enjoyed it from the first page all the way to the back cover. Very well written and imaginative, the gunslinger is a triumph! Read it now."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"King is amazing. had to go get The Dark Tower II as soon as I finished reading The Gunslinger."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Read it. READ IT!!! Not very helpful, I know, but this book is grand, the whole series is grand, and you should read it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I read all books in this series and I was disappointed with the ending. To be fair, I think it's because I had unreal expectations. Up until the last book this series was my favorite (above The Lord of the Rings and the Ender's Game series). The only problem I had was his last book, but only because of how great the six books preceding the finale are. King does a great job of character development throughout the whole series and in some of the gunfights it really feels like you're there along with the characters pulling the trigger. Despite the last book I love this series and recommend it to anyone who asks about it."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This short book is the start of Mr. King's Dark Tower series. While this book is heavy on background, it was still an enjoyable read for me. This book sets up the whole series quite nicely."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I'm not a big fan of King. I read The Shinning and The Stand back when I was a kid and never really understood what the big deal was. Sure he has a great writing style but the man doesn't seem to know how to write an ending. The ONLY book of his that I enjoyed before this one was The Eyes of the Dragon. So usually when I'm looking over paperbacks I skip over the King books. What drew me to this one was the idea of a western/horror novel.(Plus it was on sale for only $6) I've always been a big fan of both genres and the idea of them coming together intrigued me. So I gave it a whirl and am glad that I did. I really enjoyed Roland's style and the bits of back history that King drops in from time to time. He really drew me in and I'm happy to say that I'll be giving The Dark Tower series a chance. I just hope King doesn't let me down in the big finale."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"\\"The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed...\\"These are the magic words which open \\"Dark Tower\\" series, one of the major cycles in the history of fantasy litterature. As we now all know, this first installment was written by a very young Stephen King under the influence of the great western \\"The good, the bad and the ugly\\", with Roland being initially a copy of Clint Eastwood's character in Sergio Leone movie. In the first draft the desert chase was basically a retelling of Tuco's (Elli Wallach) pursuit of Eastwood's \\"man without name\\".Now, this is not a totally easy book - in fact, the first time I started it, I got tired in the middle and stopped... for 10 years! And when I tried again, I was hooked and enchanted. I read all the seven book cycle in the next months and count it as major event in my reading life. The enchantment of \\"Dark Tower\\" is due mainly to two things - a totally unique hero (Roland the last gunslinger) and an incredibly powerful decription of a world with which something is going really, but really wrong. The world of \\"Dark Tower\\" is somehow decaying, falling in pieces, loosing its structure, mixing with other worlds - and it creates an absolutely unique setting. So beware - if you have some deadlines in your work, wait with reading this book, because you could meet the same fate as me and spend every evening and every free moment reading \\"Dark Tower\\". And if you are a Stephen King hater beware even more, because you could suddenly discover that you were hating a major modern writer.This is indeed a very magical and for that reason a very dangerous book! One of the best things in \\"Dark Tower\\" series is that as the Tower is the axe around which evolves all the worlds in the Universe, all Stephen King books are connected to this cycle. There are openings to the Dark Tower in almost all his novels and in the Dark Tower series are the entries to all his books. This is quite an achievement.And all of this begins with the man in black fleeing across the desert and the gunslinger following..."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I am a huge fan of Stephen King, having read most of his stand alone novels however I was a little hesitant to start this series mainly because of reviews I have heard saying that it was slow, boring, confusing and not what they expected a Stephen King novel to be. I admit I knew very little about what this series was actually about, apart from it having a 'western' flavour, a gunslinger seeking a mysterious Dark Tower. I decided to give it a shot after Wind Through the Keyhole came out to judge for myself and I have to say that I loved every second I was reading it! While this book barely explains anything about Roland or his quest for the Dark Tower, the world that King has given us a taste of makes me very excited to continue my journey."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I'm well behind the curve here as this book came out many years ago. But after seeing it recommended by another author online I decided to pick it up. And I'm hooked! It's not like his other stuff and is more of a science fiction book than the mystery/horror novels by Stephen King. Of course his characters came to life just as well or even better than in some of his past works. I enjoyed it so much I'm now on Drawing of the Three.I say if you like King and also like syfy you should thoroughly enjoy The Gunslinger."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger. This is where it all started for Dark Tower fans, this puzzling little novel that seemed to be such a departure from the expectations Stephen King had created with his first several books. I've heard many readers claim that they have trouble getting into The Gunslinger, calling it slow and recommending that people start with the second book, The Drawing of the Three. While I love the second DT book, I can't agree with the idea that this one is anything less than incredible. I was instantly pulled in by the premise of a hardened, unnamed gunslinger tracking a sinister, unnamed sorcerer across a fantastic alien landscape, seeking answers for his greater quest of reaching an unexplained colossus called the Dark Tower. The intrigue inspired by this setup was more than satisfied as I read about the wonders of Mid-World, one of Stephen King's most amazing creations as a writer. The gunslinger, eventually named as Roland well into the book, and his mythical past in Gilead, the provocative connections between Roland's world and ours, the terrifying creatures like the slow mutants, Roland's brute force and intensity...some of the myriad reasons I've been a dedicated Tower fan since reading the first page of this book.In the thrilling climax to the story, Roland catches his Man in Black, and this is where King really hooked me into the entire series. The sorcerer, Walter, sends Roland a vision where he comes to understand the true nature of infinity. He is shown that an endless array of worlds exist, side by side, within one another, or one on top of another, all held in place by the Dark Tower. Walter explains that a room exists at the top, and inside the room....? God? Nothing? That's the mystery, and Roland must solve it in order to save his world, and all the others that would fall should the Tower come to harm. In The Gunslinger, Roland encounters one challenge after another, keeping a stoic, Clint Eastwood \`Man with No Name' persona throughout each successful battle. Stephen King allows his imagination to truly run free in this opening installment of the Dark Tower series, as well as the rest of what is the master work of his career. If you're a fan of King who has put off reading these books for whatever reasons, you've been missing out on some spectacular fiction that spans nearly all genres. It's a great series, and this is a great book to get it started.Having said all that, I have to warn potential newcomers that this particular version of The Gunslinger is a revised and expanded edition. After King finished the series, he decided that he wanted the first book to sound more like the others, so he went through page by page and altered some dialogue, added in several scenes, and made changes to certain aspects of Roland's character, as well as how some of the action transpires. I don't love the idea of King going back after the fact and changing the first book already knowing what he's done with the rest of it, making it look like some plot points were carefully planned from the start when not all of them were. It's not enough to ruin the book, but it is enough to drop it from five stars to four. It doesn't have quite the same tone of the original, which was part of its allure. I do recommend reading both versions just to have the full picture of what King wants the story to be, but of the two, I strongly prefer the grit and authenticity of the original."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger.

This first novel is by far the shortest and simplest of a series that has become notorious for its length and convolution. This book, however, is a fantastic gateway to THE DARK TOWER's universe. For those who are not sure if they would like the series, THE GUNSLINGER is relatively short and a good indicator of what's to come in the series; the reader doesn't have to worry about plodding through a 1000 page novel of a series they may not even like. Additionally, the book is short and sweet -- it leaves the reader desperately wanting more.THE GUNSLINGER is a Western/Fantasy that follows the eponymous character as he chases a mysterious man across a never ending desert. There's a lot going on here: gunslinging (as the title would suggest), alternate dimensions, magic (with a k!), dying universes, and forgotten kingdoms. Luckily, the whirlwind of ideas here serve to be interesting and not intimidating. The book is bookended with commentary by Stephen King which serves as fascinating look at his reflections 20+ years after publication. You might be surprised by how critical he is with THE GUNSLINGER.This book doesn't even come close to cracking Stephen King's top 10 novels (maybe not even his top 20), but it does serve as a fantastic introduction to a series that contains some incredible fiction. I would recommend this to fans of King, but also of George R.R. Martin, Orson Scott Card, and H.P. Lovecraft -- there's a lot to like here."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"SPOILERS:The Gunslinger tells the tale of a lone man travelling across a barren landscape, chasing a \\"man in black\\". The story does not offer any motivation or background for the journey; simply that the gunslinger has placed a duty upon himself. On his journey (initially through a desert, he spends a few days in a quiet town called Tull. In order to get out, he has to shoot and kill every single resident, because they go slightly crazy. Later on in the journey, he stumbles upon an abandoned boy and reluctantly takes him under his wing. Together they chase the man in black, and eventually see him in the mountains. They follow him down a dark tunnel, and after many days, reach the end. The boy falls to his death and the gunslinger talks with the man and black about the future and the nature of the universe.Overall, the plot was entertaining and exciting, albeit one-dimensional. Furthermore, due to the fact that it is the beginning of a seven-book series, many phenomena and issues raised in the book were not answered or addressed, which could make it difficult to read as a stand alone book.One theme present in the story was the theme of solitude. Roland, the main character, is continually referred to as \\"the last gunslinger\\", emphasizing his loneliness. Also, the book ends with the boy - whom Roland had started to grow close to - falling to his death, leaving the gunslinger alone once more.The themes in the book were very subtle, but they relayed a powerful message that was eerie and exciting at the same time."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland, the last gunslinger. Gunslinger is pretty much what it sounds like, only way more badass. The first book whets your appetite for Roland's world--one of many worlds--and touches on the surface of his quest for the tower, the evil of the Man in Black, and Roland's troubling past that has left him without his family and friends.I still am not sure if I like Roland, but I respect him. His discipline and focus is admirable and though I haven't quite figured out what his values are, I believe he has them and sticks to them.Using the word \\"harsh\\" to describe Roland is a huge understatement. He goes where he needs to, for as long as he needs to, and does what he needs to, even if that includes losing the loved ones he has left to get closer to the Tower. Why does he need to go to the Tower? I have no idea. But I'll stick around to find out.Some quotes I liked:--The only contingency he had not learned how to bear was the possibility of his own madness.--It was an old yellow sound, like turning pages.--...but it's very rotten. Like the ideas of certain people, maybe.Just about every time I picked up this book I couldn't put them down. Stephen King's language is as beautiful and intriguing as the characters he's introducing you to.

His best works come from letting his readers know his characters inside & out, & this series is very very strong in that regard.So good, I've re-read each book in the whole series all over again with each new release.

He has sworn to go to the Dark Tower - don't know why. He is following a sorcerer whom he believes can tell him how to get there. Gunslinger carries two revolvers. He is an excellent shot. He has excellent insights into people.

Setting: apocalyptic future in the U.S. Book copyright: 1982 and 2003. Genre: apocalyptic fantasy.--------------------------------------------------------------3 STARS FOR THE ENTIRE 8 BOOK SERIES:One of the books is number 4 . The last book is number 7. The main character is Roland, a gunslinger, inspired by the Clint Eastwood character in his spaghetti western movies (ex: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Roland is on a journey to the Dark Tower to stop evil forces from destroying the world. The books should be read in order. There are many wonderful ideas and stories. There is also too much clutter, rambling, and things I think should have been edited out. The Harry Potter series was better because everything developed the characters and moved the plots forward. Here at times I felt the author was writing short stories and getting off track. Overall I'm glad I read it. And there were a some wonderful parts that I will remember.I was disappointed with the last two books. Instead of enjoying the journey, I wanted them to be over. I did not like Roland's ending. It left a bad taste in my mouth. There was such potential and it felt piddled out. I liked one reviewer's comment \\"in his rush to end this series the author has given up its soul.\\" (Amazon reviewer Roger FitzAlan \\"Aranarth\\")Although not necessary, you might be glad to read The Stand before reading this series. The evil guy in The Stand (Flagg) continues being evil here. I really liked what happened to him in the first half of Dark Tower book 7. Throughout the series there are snippets of characters from various King books, but nothing to recommend reading those books first."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is the beginning book in the Dark Tower series, in my opinion, the greatest story ever told. The narration adds even more character and imagery to an already awesome tale of a strange character in a strange land on a quest that ulimately speaks to the largest unanswered questions we all have.Enjoy the listen."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"All I can say is wow. If you start this book, you will be drawn to the next. Then the next, and so on and so forth. I have just finished the Dark Tower series; if you start this and finish it you will not regret it in any form. While I found the series as a whole incredible and simply amazing, one of the installments (albeit necessary) drug on a bit to much. I hope if you like this book you find the will to read through to the dark tower. It is a modern day epic, and in my opinion, only the lord of the rings and few other sagas can stand with this. Roland Deschain will become you, the tower will draw you as close as it does Roland. Do not believe me? I dare you to read then!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book was a very decent introduction to a cool series. It wasn't one of my favorite King books, but as far as world-building goes, it really hit the spot."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"For the Dark Tower! It's been a while since i have planned on reading the DT series. The reason i held off was because i wanted to read all seven of them in a row, and i had alot of stand alone novels by a few different authors that i wanted to read first(as a matter of fact i still do, but i can't wait anymore!) Also, just last week i recieved Dark Tower six and seven in the mail, and now that i have all of them, it is time i begin! I give The Gunslinger a 4 instead of a 5 because it is a little confusing, and a little on the slow side at times. That being said, since the whole series is really one very long story, i understand the need to have some background and information in the first one to set you up for the rest of the ride.Still, The Gunslinger does have action, and is a great way to start what i just know will be a mind blowing series. This book is very good, and i am planning on the next ones to be GREAT! If you can't tell, i am extremely excited about finally taking the road to the Dark Tower, and i hope to have read them all by the time \\"Wind/Keyhole\\" comes out in April....i will review the books as i finish them!Lastly, my \\"real\\" rating for the Gunslinger would be like a 4.25....but since a \\"4\\" is the closest i can get, i went with that. AHHHH can't wait to read the rest!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger book, the first of The Dark Tower books, is an amazing read. The book is very different from the horror classics that Stephen King is known for. If you are wanting a capturing page-turner, you should begin The Dark Tower series. The Gunslinger is among the best of the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I first read this book in 1999, before I really did much writing of my own. I loved King at the time, but didn't find this one good enough to hook me into the series. As I wrote more and people found out my genres, more and more people said, \\"You got to read this series.\\" So, I picked it up again a couple of months ago. I was sucked in by the main character's visit to the town, which was early on in the book. Then I grew quite bored and found myself going off in my head as I moved through the pages. It wasn't until the very end that it became interesting again. So I've started book two and am over half way through. So far, it seems much better. But we'll get back to that later."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I loved this short book. It really fired me up to read the rest of the series. It's deceptively simple but the image or the man in black being pursued by the gunslinger is a potent one. It works! The rest of the Dark Tower series follow on of course and are, collectively, one of King's finest achievements."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is the first book of seven in the Dark Tower series. It is the beginning of a long & windy road that takes Roland Deschain (the gunslinger) on a wild journey in search for the Dark Tower--a portal and center of many worlds.Stephen King's wild mind brings the reader through all of the emotions by making all the characters come to life; you feel as though you're with them. And of course, as Stephen King likes to do, there is a twisty ending to the entire series that leaves the reader in shock and disbelief. I highly recommend reading the whole Dark Tower series but be warned, after reading The Gunslinger, there are approximately 3600 pages to go but well worth the time!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I read this book a long time ago and I felt it seemed as though it was part of something greater. That something greater is Kings masterpiece series. I thought this book started off a little slow. If you are attempting to read this series, I strongly recommend it. The series was written in span of decades. In a way you can see the way King has grown with this series. If you are able to get through the first part of the book you are on to something special. The \\"Drawing of the Three\\" was by far my favorite of the series. Get ready for the adventure of a lifetime!"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Nearly all of SKs books lead up to this series. From Pet Semetary to Insomnia, each of his books have been building up to this. This series is a definate must read and the twists and turns never stop until you close the last page. Literally."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I can't find anything wrong to say about this book. The foreward by SK, as well as the illustrations simply add to it's overall value. This writing, done by King in 1970, is genuine and enthralling. There is a timeless appeal to a story like this, and King is able to slowly build worlds both seen and unseen, while adding rich and believable characters that stay with the reader. An Imaginative landscape that has no boundaries, The Gunslinger is a classic that has stood the test of time. Whether you are new to King's work or have read many of his novels, this is a great place to start. I look forward to the next novel in the series.DW"},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"While i love this entire series and consider it one of my favorites, this is probably the best of the bunch. Here, at the beginning of his career, King created the centerpiece of his future works. Nearly all of King's books fit into the general framework of the Dark Tower and a few are directly related. It is telling that King works to include stealthy references to the series in many of his books.But why is this the best of the series? It's hard for me to express. The writing conveys such an environment of grit, suffering, and entrapment for the ultimate anti-hero, Roland Deschain the last gunslinger, to fulfill his ultimate purpose within. The greatest success of this work lies in its genesis of this character. It is only because of King's surprising success at creating the dramatic and complex persona of his morally questionable protagainist that the, at first,apparently unwieldy and daunting task of writing such an expansive series was permitted to reach its final completion.This book, and the series as a whole,is a great attempt at recreating the epic nature of life's journey towards destiny, purpose, and finally, its end."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger introduces us to Roland, a man on a mission to return his deteriorating and desolate world back to the glory that it once had. To do so, he must first catch the mysterious man in black, and Roland treks vast distances in order to catch him. Facing a forbidding landscape along with a few traps left behind by his enemy, Roland has no easy time of catching his prey.This book excels on almost every level. Although the characters are few in number, they are set up and described so well that you can't help but be drawn into their lives, especially Roland and Jake. The descriptions of the lands that Roland travels through are also spot on. King truly paints such a vivid picture of Gilead that a movie adaptation would probably never do the book justice.I read a lot of reviews about people saying they don't really like this book compared to the other Dark Tower books. It is different, but this is the one that really drew me into the Dark Tower series. It's here that you see what a solitary, tragic, unique figure Roland is. After reading this book, I just had to know if Roland would complete his quest. I've read the original many times, and read this new version a few months ago. The update makes small changes here and there and also fixes some problems that used to conflict with the later novels. If you give this book a try, you can't help but read the next book in the Dark Tower series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"Gunslinger is the first book of King's that I have read, but I have delved into Fantasy style books for a long time. King's incredible twist on the fantasy genre made for a book that was very hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I do like King, although some of my friends call his works a literary slum, and I think that The Gunslinger may be one of his more important works. The choices that must be made by the hero, Rolland, are exaggerated examples of those that we must all deal with. Do we pursue our dreams at all costs or lie broken and admit defeat? The fantasy of the story only adds to its charm. The way that King has mixed the legend of the Old West Gunslinger with sorcery and magic is interesting, involving, and elegant. This is perfect for those that do not want to dig too deep for meaning, but, at the same time, do not want a meaningless read."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This book is often underrated as the bad egg of the Dark Tower series, but it is probably the best introduction one can imagine into a world so unlike (and at the same time eerily similar) our own.It is very apparent in this book that Stephen King had no idea what would become of the series, especially after you've read the later DT books, but it is still masterful. The storyline is straightforward and the characters are defined. Even Sheb, the pianist who briefly comes into the story, is memorable.The whole book has an underlying sense of this: The Gunslinger good, Man In Black bad. Don't mistake it as simple, however, as it is not. The Gunslinger may be good, but he is not perfect. He betrays his young friend, Jake, and allows him to fall to his death. Jake's last words \\"Go then, there are other worlds than these.\\" still remain rooted in me as memorable.This book is truly a masterpiece. Read it, then the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"The Gunslinger is the book that introduced us to Roland and his painstaking adventure.What can i say apart from this is a masterpiece, and probably isnt given as much credit as it should.I too, was a little apprehensivewhen picking this book up, being so used to his other works, but i have never regretted it. i'll be starting book 6 soon, and not one of the others have disappointed me."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"As his first book in the Dark Tower series, it captivated me enough to continue to the second book. The book entangles you into the life of Roland the gunslinger. After reading it I just had to continue to see what would happen next. Very riveting book. I know some were discouraged with the first book and if you are one of those people... keep on going. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I have always loved Stephen King's between-worlds books (The Talisman, Black House, Needful Things), but the Dark Tower series is Mister King at this best! Roland will have you rooting him on through each adventure, though he is written as a realistic hero with human flaws that can make you slightly disturbed by his decisions. The villians will have you cheering at their demise, or desiring their end when escaping due to their pure-evil outlook on life. The supporting cast of characters will have you wanting them to learn more from Roland, while retaining their own values as they become driven to reach the end of this adventure. Overall, an amazing series of books that may seem excessively long, but with so much content to share it is well worth the detailed descriptions provided by King to keep you visually on target where the story is going."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"This amazing story starts out with the Gunslinger chasing the man in black in a world that has moved on. The book is just great. It entraps you in the gunslinger's world and makes it where you don't want to leave. This book is loaded with lots of action and it is very exciting. The world seems like the Spaggitti westerns with Clint Eastwood and that is a good thing. The gunslinger is just an amazing character that just simply cant be beat. I believe this book is for anyone but if you read this one you will want to read the others."},{"Title":"The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger","review":"I found a copy of this book at a local thrift shop. I plopped down my thirty-seven cents, opened it to the first page and damnit if King didn't get me!Now here I am, I have all seven books (I even have the Donald Grant Artist editions of the last three books) and I'm hopelessly addicted to Roland Deschain and the wonders of Mid-World.I have to new edition of the Gunslinger and I do intend of reading it some day (but not until I finish all seven) and I do think that the first version definitely had some slow parts to it. But when King gets to the action, strap yourself in and hold on tight!Originally, I thought the idea of a pseudo-western set on another world ludicrous. But once again, I underestimated King's skills as a storyteller and writer. I will not make the same mistake again.His imagination propels Roland on his mysterious quest. If you've read the Gunslinger, then you already know. But if you haven't embarked on the journey, I strongly urge you do so. I'm sure you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Wall Street gang","review":"An eye-opener. Even after all the security laws/regulations passed during/after the Great Depression, there is still an insiders club that exists within the Stock Exchanges. And that &quot;club&quot; continues to fleece the average retail investor. The Exchange rationalizes the &quot;club&quot; as necessary to stabilize market prices. When in reality, the &quot;club&quot; introduces instability for its own gain. Corporate insiders have to disclose stock transactions. Why not the market makers? Even though the book is thirty-years old, it still rings true today. The club still exists and the government still has done relatively little to reign in the abuses of the insiders &quot;club.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Wall Street gang","review":"The Wall Street Gang, Richard NeyRichard Ney, an investment advisor, wrote \\"The Wall Street Jungle\\". He forecast the market crash in May 1962, the rise and decline of January 1966, and the crash of October 1973. The \`Foreword' by Senator Lee Metcalf tells how Ney's book guided him in his investigation of utility companies, and the business activity dominated by Wall Street and financial institutions. The information documented the failures of the SEC and the ICC to protect investors. \\"Operations are controlled for the benefit of the insiders who have the special information and the clout to profit from all sorts of transactions, regardless of the actual value of the stock traded\\" (p.xii). Insider deals are frauds on millions of small investors. The crisis for investors is caused by an absence of truth ('Preface'). The very rich and financial interests benefit by reserving truth for themselves (p.xiii). They control the nation's media and information through custom and government sanctions. Those victims who lose money are told its their own fault, not that the market is rigged against small investors (p.xiv). The \\"Stock Exchange as the source of the country's future financial problems.\\" If you learn to buy when Wall Street insiders buy, and sell when they sell, you can win instead of losing (p.xv). Someone who has been defrauded needs a good attorney. Ney hopes this book will provide the facts to bring security and success in the market. He doesn't worry about those who want to suppress the truth.Chapter 1 tells of his career change from acting to \\"investment advisor\\". His charting techniques warned of an imminent decline in the market (p.7). But he found out that the US Senate and the \`Wall Street Journal' did not want his views (p.13). A knowledge of \\"academic economics\\" was harmful (p.4). Most investors lose money in the stock market (Chapter 2). The financial establishment controls the laws and society to benefit themselves. The power of the Stock Exchange comes from the Federal Reserve System and the Eastern banking establishment, and the SEC (p.15). The Exchange controls and influences newspapers, magazines, radio, television, etc. The \\"greatest financial conspiracy in modern times\\" (p.16). Is there a world system of financial control able to dominate each country and the economy of the world (p.17)? Yes, and it keeps itself hidden (p.18). Pages 27-28 explain how the Big Banks control corporations, politicians, and the media to hide what is really going on.Chapter 3 lists the dishonest actions of the \`NY Times' and \`Wall Street Journal' in reviewing Ney's book (p.30). Specialists make as much money when the market declines as when it advances (p.33). Censored by CBS and NBC, etc. (pp.33-34)? Stock Exchange's banks have concealed ownership, the FCC didn't know (p.34)! Ney tells about another unreliable \`TIME' review (p.37). Who really writes the stories? Who owns them (p.39)? One use is to set a \\"bear trap\\" for investors (p.42). Basically you can't trust the news in the Business section (p.49). [The attempt to \\"privatize\\" Social Security is just another Wall Street swindle.] Does the SEC provide a cover for Wall Street swindles (Chapter 4)? Specialists profited from the 11-22-1963 events (p.54). [Multiply those prices by ten to compare to today.] Nixon was a director for IDS (p.55). Are stock prices manipulated to swindle investors (p.61)? Other examples of rulings that harmed investors are on page 63. Chapter 5 questions the relevance of the SEC when new issues are sold at inflated prices far in excess of their worth. Would Merrill Lynch push customers to buy stock in a known problem company and lose money? Yes (p.82). Most regulatory agencies (like the SEC) are captives of the industries they regulate (p.83). One cure is the Federal Advisory Committee Act which requires meetings to be open to the public (p.83). The remaining ten chapters are just as informative.Chapter 6 explains \\"specialists\\" who buy at wholesale and sell at retail. Can they create a price decline to buy low then create publicity to sell high (p.85)? The media misleads the public. This was known in 1935 (p.94-95). Did Nixon tip off his friends about his wage-price freeze of 8-15-71 (p.101)? Selling short halted an advance in stock prices (p.103). Chapter 7 explains why Secondary Offerings are legalized larceny when the market price is controlled by the sellers and results in losses to investors (p.108). Over a million shares can be sold without affecting the price (p.132). Big block offerings are profitable for everyone except the buyer (p.136). It is illegal for an investor to use inside information (Chapter 8). But not for a stockbroker (p.138). They can talk up a stock so insiders can sell before it drops off (p.143). Months later the news caused a jump in the selling price (p.146). But if you know their tricks you can beat the specialist at this game (p.148).Chapter 9 has Ney's tutorial on Buying and Selling. First start with a model to gain knowledge and experience in this new technique. While the market may advance or retreat, individual stocks are in a constant state of flux (Chapter 10). Specialists can drive the price of a stock down to accumulate shares, then manipulate the price up to profit from selling (p.173). Ney comments on the energy crisis of October 1973 (p.175). The following pages explain the workings at the Stock Exchange. Ney illustrates his charting method to study price movement. The Stock Exchange uses deceptions and schemes to defraud their customers (Chapter 11). This occurs because those in government allow this (p.218). The investor must know the laws (p.220). A brokerage firm can be held financially liable for the actions of its salesmen (p.221). The most common fraud is \`churning', trading to increase commissions (pp.224-228). Investors \\"are all basically highly vulnerable because of their ignorance of the market\\" (p.228). Does the Stock Exchange \\"prey upon the unwary\\" (p.229)?Chapter 12 tells about \`churning', or over-trading, the most common fraud. These pages tell how a widow sued a broker and won money for her losses. The Appeals Court limited her damages to the commission paid (p.243). The court system supports the financial class. It led to a rise in securities violations, frauds, and theft by Stock Exchange members. Chapter 13 comments on judges as the servants of the financial establishment. [Is that why Senators vote for them?] Ney describes his experience as an expert witness (p.247). The courts and the press keep these cases secret (p.248). Agreements to arbitration are fraudulent and illegal (p.249)! The Finest Judges Money Can Buy (p.256)? \\"The public is faced not only with rigged stock prices and rigged arbitration proceedings, but with a rigged court system as well\\" (Chapter 14). Ney offers advice on suing a stock broker (p.260). Ney comments on the ideology of the country's best law schools (p.262). Find a lawyer who won against the Stock Exchange (p.263). Chapter 15 discusses how to sue the Stock Exchange. Ney suggests a new Exchange that will work for investors and industry (p.271). The specialist is part of a system for rigging and manipulating stock prices for their benefit (p.273). The laws that protect investors are not implemented (p.274). Politicians fear the power of Wall Street (p.275). What will happen to America as people are exploited to benefit the wealthy few (p.276)? [The impoverishment of people leads to another Great Depression.]This book reminds me of those old westerns where a big landowner (Stock Exchange) wants to swindle people out of their property with the help of a crooked sheriff (SEC) and a crooked mayor (Federal government). Will a lone stranger help the people to free themselves from this oppression?"},{"Title":"The Wall Street gang","review":"A good sequel to The Wall Street jungle, but probably not necessary once you have the picture that it's a rigged game."},{"Title":"The Wall Street gang","review":"This item was shipped fairly quickly.

For example both Eisenhower and Bradly gloss over the military debacle of WWII, the extended battle in the horror of the Hurtgen Forest in late 1944. The terrain there was (and is) incredibly difficult. This battle, fought for no good reason, seriously drained the fighting strength of the American Army and set up the scenario for the Battle of the Bulge. Regan covers this battle among others in a short but vivid manner. Afterall, this battle was the cause of the only GI executation of WWII, that of Pvt Eddie Slovik. Charles Whiting, in his book, &quot;The Battle of the Hurtgen Forest&quot; goes into greater detail but Regan does an adequate job capsulizing the battle in just twelve pages. Regan's review of other battles are equally well done and thought provoking. For the budding military historian, this book should be on the &quot;must read&quot; and own list."},{"Title":"Fight or Flight","review":"This book is interesting in that it can teach a new reader a few points on how to motivate soldiers to go beyond what's expected of them: yet ultimatly it fails to educate. Everything that Regan infers is logical to anyone who undersatand human behavior. Ultimatley, the book fails to provide any insight into the reasoning behind certain actions taken by soldiers. Mr. Regan fails because his inferences are basic and expected. This is a fun book in that it is interesting to a reader who only seeks a few good stories; but if a reader seeks to learn the motivation behind exceptional soldiers who are ready to sacrifice everthing for country, I suggest you look elsewhere.

Amazon came through."},{"Title":"The life of man with God","review":"Thomas Verner Moore was a one of a kind man, and this is a one of a kind book. I know only the rough outline of Moore's life, he had a long career as an American priest psychologist and educator in a rather middle of the road or liberal-ish religious order. The radical holiness, orthodoxy and deep prayer this soul felt drawn to, led him to a late vocation to the Carthusians, the most austere sort of hermit monk, at a monastery in Spain--apparently, without his ever withdrawing in the slightest from a deep concern and solicitude for the spiritual and mental health needs of people in every walk of life.Normally, Carthusians don't write and publish books. Carthusians pray, in silence and solitude. However, the Carthusians called upon the multi-talented Moore to found the first Carthusian monastery in the United States, and he was also given permission, after a time, to resume his writing career, first with a book which drew lessons for the home life of families from his Carthusian experience (!), and then with the present volume, \\"The Life of Man With God\\". As Moore says, it's not a Carthusian book--it's not about the Carthusians and their spirituality. Yet, unavoidably, it's a book by a Carthusian (an unusual one), for the rest of us, about the spiritual life.The idea of \\"The Life of Man With God\\" is to connect the classical stages of development of the soul in sanctity, with the real life experiences of priests, active and contemplative religious, and practicing Catholic lay people of all sorts who are living an interior life, via a written survey conducted by mail, in which respondents answered a series of 30 questions about their spiritual life, about which they narrated and reported as much detail as possible. Moore attempted to decide which stage of spiritual maturity the various respondents were in (he uses a modified form of the stages of maturity described by Chautard in \\"The Soul of the Apostolate\\", apparently because Chautard's stages are based specifically on increasing degrees of freedom from sin and attachment from sin, a specific enough measure to be able to place respondents in specific stages based on what they report of their degree of freedom from willing sin, and with less exactitude also their experience of prayer), and used their often eloquent and touching survey responses to illustrate with real, specific examples, what the journey of holiness is like in real ordinary people of Moore's time. His observations about the prayer of people in the various stages are interesting, for instance he shows from his survey data the stages at which the prayer of quiet or \\"peace experience\\" as he calls it (infused contemplative prayer), ordinarily and increasingly becomes frequent and habitual. As a psychologist, he also offers a certain amount of observations about the interaction of psychological and emotional disorder in the development of the spiritual life.The resulting book is rooted in traditional Catholic understanding of the Christian spiritual life, the life of grace, which it reveals as a living reality in the lives of ordinary American Catholics. It would be easy to question the methodology of the book, which relies on self-reporting via surveys conducted by mail, from self-selected respondents the author may never have met personally. There is no way to know, also, how Moore may have edited the responses (they seem well written) or what was left out. It's not a particularly scientific study, and we don't have the raw \\"data\\" of the survey responses to look at, we kind of have to trust Moore's perceptions and what he's trying to show us. His optimism and happy gaze upon the life of man with God and the life of God in man, I personally found very appealing. I started the book a little skeptical, and was rather won over.I'm not personally aware of any other book that has tried to do anything like what this book tries to do, and certainly not with anything like Moore's competence and orthodoxy. It's solidly centered on growing free from sin in the context of a life of prayer and sacramental communion with the Church, as opposed to some contemporary writings ostensibly about spiritual growth, that quite frankly don't insist on any of that as essential to growth in Christ (\\"centering prayer\\" comes to mind)! I think it's a pretty good book and I found it interesting and thought provoking.Thanks be to God, Thomas Verner Moore was successful in making the Carthusian foundation in Vermont, now known as the Charterhouse of the Transfiguration. Moore himself returned to Spain to the Charterhouse of Miraflores, from whence he went to his eternal happiness."},{"Title":"Birds of the Midwest (Peterson FlashGuides)","review":"I recommend this product to anyone who wants to get started with birdwatching.

What a waste of money!"},{"Title":"Enchantment of the Faerie Realm: Communicate with Nature Spirits & Elementals","review":"_Enchantment of the Faerie Realm_ is not a bad book, really. It has its amazing moments and its less-than-amazing moments. I especially like the idea of faerie tales as meditation exercises; the legends and fantasies dreamed up over the centuries might well be our best key to the nature of the fae. The meditations are also good; I especially liked &quot;Meeting the Flower Faeries&quot; and &quot;Tree Faeries.&quot; I only wish the list of flowers and trees had been longer, but the meditations can be used with any plant, so that's no big deal.Unfortunately, much of the book is devoted to a hyper-organized approach to the fae. There is too much ceremonial magic and not enough whimsy or wild magic. Note that the high points I mentioned above are also the moments in which the book is given over mainly to wild magic. In my work with the fae, I've never gotten the idea that they're a strict bureaucracy. They aren't that organized, and trying to organize them just misses the point. The fae *aren't* like us. They're wilder and more unpredictable, and I bet there are a lot of fae giggling a bit at parts of this book.I also don't like the emphasis on using the fae to work on your psychological issues. If you're going to get to know the fae, it's best to get to know them just for the joy of getting to know them. And, yes, that *will* make your life happier and more interesting, but that is just icing on the cake. Don't use the fae; befriend them."},{"Title":"Enchantment of the Faerie Realm: Communicate with Nature Spirits & Elementals","review":"Not up to par with Animal Speak. This &quot;Faerie&quot; book seems contrived &amp; cranked up as propaganda to put the Fae of many cultures, as well as the Elementals of Nature under an artificial construct of male rule. It seems someone's ego got away with them here. It is not really about what the title suggests. Very misleading.If you believe the realms of the Fae &amp; the powers &amp; beauty of nature should be modeled after &quot;man's kingdoms&quot; &amp; &quot;societies&quot;, instead of the other way around, go for it. Otherwise you will be as disappointed as many, by a closer insight into the mindset of a modern male author, you hoped would do better. I'm very sorry to say I can not recommend this book. In fact IMHO it is a heartbreaking attempt to usurp the Fae, for misguided use."},{"Title":"Enchantment of the Faerie Realm: Communicate with Nature Spirits & Elementals","review":"I have read several books on the subject - this is by far the best...enjoyable, readable, well researched, practical information.

I have read his books and attended his workshops, including workshops on this particular book and his depth of knowledge and experience is amazing. And yet he makes the material accessible to everyone, regardless of their experiences. He helps the reader to remember what we all once knew. He inspires us to seek out new doorways to this magical realm."},{"Title":"Enchantment of the Faerie Realm: Communicate with Nature Spirits & Elementals","review":"First of all, let me just get this out of my system, I love faeries. There, that being said, on with the review. I thought that Ted Andrews did a great job with this book. SOME of his information was good. However, he fell into that all too often trap that most writers fall into these days. He fell into the trap of blind idealism. The way he portraied faeries was decent, however, the world of the fae, much like ours, has good inhabitants and some not so good ones. I would read this book in conjunction with another book such as the living world of Faerie by R.J. Stewart or a A Witch's Guide to Faerie Folk by Edain McCoy"},{"Title":"Enchantment of the Faerie Realm: Communicate with Nature Spirits & Elementals","review":"The author of this book seems to have had no real experience with the subject he is writing about and has not only approached the faerie realm and faeries from a scientific and scholarly point of view, but he hasn't done his research well enough to succeed from that angle. He seems to have taken his viewpoint from theosophical works rather than from actual experience. The New Age philosophy which reduces faeries to elementals or diminished nature spirits is disrespectful. The suggestion that faeries are lesser inhabitants of an Angelic Kingdom who can be called upon or commanded by human ritual as helper spirits or gaurdian angels is dangerous and distracts from recognition of a genuine experience with Faerie.

We get lost in our mundane mental mechanics and so forget all that is beautiful. Yes existence is alive in many ways on many levels.

It not only tells you about the different kinds of faeries there are, but also how you can experience their presence and thus learn and grow from it. It reads remarkably easily, and features ways you can get in touch with your own personal spirits, and how to find out what and who not only they are, but you are. I read it this summer, and it made me realize that, after all these years since I was a child, I still believed in the magic and wonder of the faeries.

Unfortunately, I do not think he is well acquainted with this subject, and I don't think he is comfortable with working with the Fey. I hold nothing against him--the rest of the works I have read which he authored are very well done. However, I would not recommend his foray into the Faery realms. I believe he needs to do some more work if he truly wants to improve this work.

I think this is a good book for doing research on the subject in that it is very descriptive and provides some of the author's own experiences as a guide to be followed, which are very dramatic.There is a meditiation exercise which is begun to be used halfway through which is very redundant and mediocre. I would have rated this one higher only if the pictures had been in color and maybe had more of them because then it would make it more artful and a nice coffee table type book to have laying around, but that and the nature of the exercise were what made it seem like not too bad but not great either.

I was looking for more information on how to tenderly hear, though it couldn't truly be said to be audible. Skimming through his travesty and hogepoge book, it became apparent that this author has not 'gone there'. It's too bad that Mr Andrews gave his book such a great title. Someone could have used it better. I dont know about his other books, but given his pretense at being able to talk on the subject of nature beings, makes me wary. I do not recommend his book Enchantment of the Fairy Realm-Instead, I found a kindred and respectful attempt to communicate a difficult subject by several other authors: I am currently reading, \\"Voices of the Earth\\", by Clea Danaan;and \\"Ecoshaminaism\\", by James Endredy. I also found a near approximation to the experience my husband and I had, on page 122 of the book, \\"Growing Myself\\"- by Judith Handelsman. I am entirely grateful for the recommendations made by other readers, I will look there, as well. However, it also seems true that for those of us who have a desire to explore further, things will come our way to help us, when appropriate.

Ted Andrew makes an attempt to mix modern style faery communication with the older shamanic approach. It just doesn't work. Though the content is good, very well researched and accurate, this book offers very little information on faeries. It is not too good for reference. For reference on faeries, try Edain's Witch's guide to faery folk. This book is more about how to connect with the faeries, yet the guided meditations are not very effective. Half the book is on meditations and it gets a little boring."},{"Title":"Enchantment of the Faerie Realm: Communicate with Nature Spirits & Elementals","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

Funny experience: Woke up one morning and the dishes were clean in the dish washer when the night before they were dirty. My wife and I examined them and were left scratching our heads. I said maybe it was the fairies. She laughed and scoffed at the idea. She opened the refrig and pulled a new bottle of soda out and when she opened it it exploded all over her.

The public view of the practice and practitioners is that of a hopeless muddle of esoteric babble. But to paraphrase E. T. Bell, \\"mathematicians are as human as the rest, sometimes more so.\\" One could make a solid argument that human essence can be boiled down to the creation and appreciation of art, employing a strategy in playing games with the only goal that of winning a non-essential prize, doing things for the mental exercise and seeing patterns where none is immediately obvious. All of these items are found in applied mathematics and in this case it is called recreational mathematics.No artwork requires more thought to understand than that of M. C. Escher, where so many objects start as one thing and are somehow metamorphed into others. Many of the current ideas of fractals can be found in his drawings. So many \\"simple\\" games that we are exposed to have strategies that are mathematical in nature. But some, like chess, seem to defy solid mathematical analysis and show us once again how powerful the human computer really is. As the numbers of such puzzles appearing in newspapers and magazines indicates, a large percentage of the public enjoys a good mental tickler.This collection is a distillation of those thoughts, featuring mathematical explanations of most. The works here show once again that the distinction between mathematics and the rest of the world is an artificial one put up by small minds. Mathematics is a joyous endeavor that provides more joy and frustration than any other ever imagined by intellects on par with that of humans. It is a joy to read about people doing mathematics for no other reason than recreation. It is also sad to realize that so many people who proudly wear a badge of mathematical illiteracy are so far gone that the do not realize it when they are employing mathematics in a recreational manner. For a short time, one of the best-selling books was one describing how to solve the puzzle known as \\"Rubik's Cube.\\" As is explained here, the solution is based on beginning group theory.A welcome addition to the literature, this report of the Strens conference is refreshing. For it shows mathematicians and their ilk having fun doing mathematics. To be blunt, that is something that the public simply does not understand.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"So now this is for sure...I'm officially hooked on Georgette Heyer. The last time something like this happened I plunged head first into anything and everything Plaidy and never looked back- it's not the same, I know; but there are certainly many similarities. There's just something about historical fiction writers who keep the language of the times and make the dialog seem so real as though it were actually written back then.The details of the setting, the perceptions, the fashion, the attitude and behaviour of the people- there's something to be said for this kind of historical accuracy. And when an author has got that under check, well then it's all a matter of storyline and plot. That followed through beautifully for Heyer in this incredibly comical story that caught me laughing out loud quite a few times. I love it when a period read can keep me entertained this way- what a wonderful way to unwind with an amusing tale that manages to keep you hooked until the end.The Corinthian is a story about a worldly, fascinating and wealthy gentleman, Sir Richard Wyndham, and the young, very impressionable and mischievous Miss Penelope Creed. How these two very unlikely people get caught up into eachother's lives is what this amusing book is all about. While Sir Richard's family's match-making gets him almost hitched into a marriage of convenience; Miss Creed's own planned marriage throws her literally \`over the edge' to find both of these exasperated individuals who have lost hope in convincing others of their non-compliance meet on a not-so- coincidental evening. An incredibly original night out on the town, and a series of unexpected events, changes their fate forever.I absolutely loved this fast-paced read. There was not a moment of boredom or even time to ponder in this one. Like a domino effect, the pieces of the story just tumble into place regardless of all the sidetracking events that plead to yet again sway you into an ever developing and changing plot. Amazingly entertaining and as usual, a tender loving story -endearing throughout, but especially in its finale.Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"This isn't quite in my Top 4 Heyer's, but it's a very near squeeze-out. Even if Pen and Sir Richard weren't a most entertaining couple, the hilariously incomprehensible speeches of Jimmy Yarde would themselves be sufficient to earn this a place of honor in anyone's bookshelf!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"The meeting between Penelope Creed and Richard Wyndham is quite memorable! They are well developed, amazing characters that go on an adventure together while Penelope is dressed as a boy. There is intrigue, a murder mystery, romance, great sub-plots, and I must admit that Richard Wyndham is my favorite Heyer hero. However, I never quite understood the connection between Penelope and Richard. She is quite young (17) than Wyndham (29) and a very immature heroine. He and Sophia Stanton-Lacy from \\"The Grand Sophy\\" would have been a better couple!Either way, a great read, and love that Wyndham has a cravat tying technique named after him!

The characters were well developed and there were some laugh-out-loud scenes throughout the story.

Her cousin's family is in desperate financial straights and they need her money as much as she needs to \\"marry for the sake of the family\\", or so they tell her. So to escape this fate she decides she is going to dress up as a boy and run away to her childhood home, and childhood sweetheart, whom she swore a blood oath with that she would one day marry when they were small children. On the way out the window, dressed in boys clothes, she meets Sir Richard Wyndham who is, as he puts it, \\"viley\\" drunk and he decides to help her run away as he has some running away from an unwanted marriage that he wants to do himself. Throw in some stolen jewelery, highway robbery and a bit of a mysterious who-dun-it and you have a lovely romantic comedy action adventure of a novel.To explain the plot of this twisty novel would be almost impossible. There are several interweaving stories, plot lines and characters that result in several hilarious moments for Pen and Sir Richard as she drags him deeper down the rabbit hole and farther into the English countryside. Stolen jewels, a murder investigation, highway robbery, intrigue, a pursuing aunt, an eloping couple and Pen's secret identity all result in more tangles and trouble for poor Sir Richard who somehow has to make it out of this with his dignity and reputation in tact! It's no wonder the poor man falls in love.I have to say, as naive as Penelope is, her wit, sparkle, nerve and sense of adventure make her a very lovable heroine. I can totally see what Sir Richard sees in her. I have to admit this book really skirted the edge of what was considered proper at the time and the shocking ending was laugh out loud funny and an excellent way to bring a close to a gender adventurous book!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"This is only the second Heyer I've read (and it's much better then Faro's Daughter IMO).Pen was a very delightful heroine, and I felt Heyer did a wonderful job developing the budding romance between Pen and Richard.The plot was engaging and well maintained throughout the book, full of the types of adventures you'd expect to find in a regency (i.e. struggles against marriages of convenience, a bored yet lonely dandy, a girl disguised as a boy). I did have a bit of a problem trying to understand some of the thief \\"cant\\" from the character of Jimmy Yarde, but kudos to Heyer for having it in there - it added to the period feel, although it was fairly incomprehensible to my 21st century American ears! Heyer even managed to flesh out some very minor characters introduced during a coach trip and make them funny and clearly drawn - it was probably my favorite part of the novel, although the last paragraph had me in stitches as well, I must say - read it and find out for yourself why!I will definitely read more Heyers, and hope I can find another with the brightness and engaging characters of The Corinthian. If you're wondering what Heyer to start with, I don't think you can go wrong with this gem!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"I like the first portion of Regency Buck. I can just see Pen on the sheet rope and Sir Richard catching her. This novel could be made into a movie. Just how big was an Accommodation Coach? What were the roads like? Just how did Sir Richard sound when he was haughty?? I guess I'm just unused to haughtiness and iciness of the upper crust. Of course I loved the ending--classic.I regret that I hadn't the opportunity of seeing and listening to her when she was alive (If she granted interviews, which I doubt).I am rebuilding my Heyer library again after many years. The first Heyer novel I read was Regency Buck and I was hooked. My favorite Heyer novels are The Talisman Ring, the Reluctant Widow, False Colors, and Sprig Muslin, and I liked the mystery, The Envious Casca. Miss Heyer was so good at evoking atmosphere and her descriptions, while a little wordy, were vivid. And you HAD to read them or you might miss an important detail pertinent to the plot.What I really want now is to get a map of 1812 London and see just how close together were the places in the London she wrote about. I really wish I could get a sense of the toilettes she described, both male and female. But I loved her heroes and heroines and hated all the villains. It's all delicious."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"THE CORINTHIAN by Georgette Heyer is a fun introduction to the work of the queen of regency romance.

This is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"Georgette Heyer's &quot;The Corinthian&quot; starts off deceptively simply. One of London's foremost Corinthians [fashionable sportsmen], Sir Richard Wyndham, is walking home drunk, and brooding despondently on his forthcoming betrothal. Suddenly, from an upper window, a young stripling drops into his arms. He quickly discovers that the young stripling is a actually girl dressed as a boy who is escaping from her Aunt's house and determined to return to find her childhood sweetheart.Pen Creed, the cross-dressing heroine of the piece can't dissuade Sir Richard from coming along with her and she happily leads him into a labyrinth of problems. From that point Sir Richard is thrown into a series of increasingly twisted, confusing and hilarious events. In between stolen diamond necklaces, suspect looking pick-pocketing coves, an eloping couple and a pursuing Aunt this has to rate as one of Heyer's more complex plots. Numerous stories converge and overlap - and to try to explain it would be a bit like trying to explain the plot of the Marriage of Figaro - impossible.Needless to say Sir Richard's wit and good humour along with Pen's sense of the ridiculous coupled with her solemnly-uttered naievetes makes this one of Heyer's funniest and most enjoyable booksIts an easy read and make be a good introduction to Heyer for first time readers."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"This book has everything for a Heyer devotee: a sprightly handful of a heroine, an amused grey-eyed hero and a colorful and diverse group of supporting characters. Throw in a road trip, a murder over stolen jewels and a mystery and there's a little something for everyone. Miss Penelope Creed is as delightful a heroine as you will find. She meets the jaded Sir Richard &quot;Beau&quot; Wyndham while climbing out of a window. &quot;Cursed with a huge fortune&quot;, she is running away from a proposed marriage to a cousin &quot;with a face like a fish&quot;. The wealthy Sir Richard is in the same boat, having just decided to propose to a well-born but impovershed lady he has been expected to marry for years but whom he doesn't like. Sir Richard decides to escort Miss Creed on her journey to the country home of her childhood sweetheart---in a public coach, no less. You can imagine the travelers they meet! (A woman who smells of onions and a small boy with adenoids among them.) She dresses as a boy to avoid comment, a device used in other Heyer novels, but not with such amusing consequences. Penelope is actually accused of &quot;trifling with the affections of an innocent female&quot; and is almost called out. As it turns out, this &quot;innocent female&quot; is the new, and rather weepy and tiresome, innamorata of her childhood sweetheart. There seems to be nothing poor Miss Creed can do to win back his affections, so she plots their elopement. This is one of several sub-plots, including the theft of Sir Richard's almost-fiance's family jewels. (Of course, the thief was one of the people our heroine befriended on the coach journey.) This theft leads to the murder of Sir Richard's would-be brother-in-law, who is deep in debt and behind the theft. The scoundrel also attemps to blackmail Sir Richard when he discovers &quot;Penn&quot; (&quot;after the great Quaker&quot;) Creed isn't really a boy. With both their families right on their heels, Penelope's friendship with the hired jewel thief, who at one point plants the jewels on her makes for a smartly paced read. Also one of her more complex in terms of plot. The final coming together of the several sub-plots is nice and tight and done as only Heyer could. Heyer's characters are always real people and we come to care for them and take an interest in what happens to them. The slang of the day, including a liberal helping of thieves' cant from a pickpocket in a catskin waistcoat, her usual fine attention to the minutia of fashion and the accurate use of titles is superb. Many other Regncy writers don't understand the correct use of titles or forms of address, one thing that makes Heyer's books superior in quality. Heyer is the first----and she is the best."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"Sir Richard Wyndham is a Man of Fashion, a dandy, but he prefers the term Corinthian, if you please. He is somewhat bored with his life as a trendsetter of the haut ton, and is being forced to seriously consider a somewhat irksome marriage of convenience when he is waylaid by circumstance to aid Miss Penelope Creed, an heiress not yet out in society, on a quest to elope with her childhood sweetheart in an effort of avoid a match with her fish-faced cousin.The plot of the story is light-hearted and fun, full of adventure and misadventure. But it is Heyer's style, much reminiscent of Jane Austen's yet more colorful and engaging, that makes this book truly delightful. It is a must read for her description of a proper dandy alone. There were many places where I could not help but chuckle aloud.I know you will find it more than worth your effort to hunt down and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"This has always been one of my favorite Heyer novels and I am so glad it is finally being reprinted in the US. I first read this book in India of all places and got my own copy in London. If you like witty dialogue, situations and tons and tons of british humor this is a must for you. It seems deceptively simple, Young girl running away disguised as a boy, hitches up with cynical but gorgeous hero .. . In the hands of Georgette Heyer it will have you laughing out loud and absolutely unable to put it down until its done!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"Heyer takes on two of romance's cherished conventions: heiress Penelope Creed dresses as a boy to escape her guardian's matrimonial plots, and the rich but jaded Sir Richard Wyndham falls for the artless charms of a schoolgirl. The result is a charming adventure, but an unsuccessful romance. Richard is too gentlemanly to make advances while Pen is under his protection and Pen spends too much time in the role of a boy to develop as a romantic leading lady. However, the dialogue is delightful and Heyer juggles her plot elements with aplomb, so it's still a fun read. The conversations between Pen and silly little Lydia Daubenay are not to be missed. (The jaded rich man/innocent miss plotline is done with greater success in Arabella, where a more substantial plot allows better character development. For a marvelous girl-in-breeches story, hunt up The Masqueraders.)"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"Georgette Heyer was extremely fond of the lethargic, intelligent, sarcastic male character; it was inevitable that she will make such one into a hero in one of her novels. Both the hero and the heroine are extremely appealing characters; the plot is rather simplistic for a Heyer novel (even for her romance), but the characterization of the hero (see above) and of Penelope more than make up for it. Penelope is indeed one of my favorite Heyer females; she is intelligent, charming and innocent, and is believably appealing for such a character as the hero to be (finally) a woman whom he can fall in love with. A gender switch confusion adds to the fun (though it's not made too much of). Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"Well, to start off, I'll tell you how much I like this book in just a few words: I stayed up until one o'clock reading it.Yep. It's true. I couldn't put it down.Why? Well, for one thing (1), Heyer's characters are so engaging. To be true, Sir Richard seems to be the prototype aristocrat who is bored with life (as well as handsome, good with his \\"fives\\", etc), and getting old enough so his relatives are despairing of his every marrying. But one can forgive him this, and if not, Pen far makes up for it. Her innocence, intelligence, \\"fertile imagination\\", and amusing way of looking at the world, coupled with Sir Richard's dry replies, kept me giggling throughout the whole story. Second, the plot was very interesting. It's the best one I've encountered before (but, having only read three of Heyer's other novels before, I may have yet to come upon an even better one); full of twists and turns. And for you finicky types, rest assured, it's all nicely handled by Richard's dry ingenuity and Pen's outright audacity. Thirdly... well... *a short pause* ... it's just great! I've already listed my main likey-likeys and dislikes, so I'll just exhort anyone reading this review to buy this book, or pull thy rear off the seat and make all haste for the library. Most of them (the libraries) will have at least five or six of Heyer's books, so indulge yourself there and be sure to write a long, boring review on Amazon when you're finished. Tootles!...Yes, I'm actually going. I have much more pressing things to do than sit on my rear for any long amount of time, but I will say this: if you want to know the plot, or at least get a summary, go to someone else's review or actually drag yourself to the nearest bookstore (or the library; your choice). After all, you're supposed to read the book, not the reviews.Later, alligator!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"This book has everything for a Heyer devotee: a sprightly handful of a heroine, an amused grey-eyed hero and a colorful and diverse group of supporting characters.

This book made me go to all 9 libraries in my county looking for more. Thank you whomever decided to bring Georgette Heyer back to print.

It starts with our intrepid, Regency-era hero (who is a Corinthian, a fashionable sportsman) moping about the prospect of marrying someone he doesn't like, stumbling drunkenly homeward, and spying someone sneaking out of a window. He offers to help and quickly realizes it's a girl! Our heroine is, of course, running away from an arranged marriage, and our hero insists on accompanying her so she doesn't get into too much trouble. Cue road trip shenanigans and all kinds of interesting characters! It was lighthearted and fun!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"This is a very engaging book, one of my favourites by Heyer, however, I agree with another reviewer who thought that it ended abruptly. This book could use a few more pages to wrap things up, I hate to say it but it was quite negligent of Heyer and her editors to publish this as it is - it has no real ending, we are left to pen it ourselves to tie up the many loose strings. Despite this, I very much enjoyed this book and I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"(Originally published as _Beau Wyndham_, 1941.) Though she has since had many copiers, Heyer was the inventor of the \\"Regency romance\\" and over a long career she rang all the changes on the theme. Some of her novels set in England in the very early 19th century were sweetly romantic, some were coming-of-age mini-epics, some were even more or less serious explorations of the lack of freedom, to say nothing of life options, facing a young woman of good breeding in those days. This one, though, is a flat-out romp, the sort of thing that would have made a terrific Hollywood script back in the 1930s.Sir Richard \\"Beau\\" Wyndham is a dandy (they preferred the term \\"Corinthian\\"), a very wealthy man, facing his thirtieth birthday, and he's also the last of his line. To preserve the family name, his rather bullying older sister is insisting he get himself married. In fact, their late father had arranged a match years before with Melissa Brandon, who is now a young woman with the personality of an iceberg and the pride of an ancient name. Since he has no other preferences, Richard should make an offer there, and immediately. Everyone knows he hasn't a romantic bone in him, and it will be only a marriage of convenience with no effect on his other interests, so what's stopping him? Moreover, Melissa's father and brothers are unsuccessful gamblers and the Brandons are nearly broke, so Sir Richard's own deep pockets will be very welcome. He knows his sister is right, that he'll have to face the music, and the prospect leads him to get thoroughly plastered one night. And while making his way unsteadily home in the wee hours, he chances upon what appears to be a boy escaping from a bedroom window via a too-short knotted sheet, whom he catches when the kid lets go -- and then discovers it's really a seventeen-year-old girl wearing her cousin's clothing. Her situation is not unlike his own: She's an orphaned heiress whose guardian aunt is trying to bully her into marrying her own son, for the sake of her money. But Penelope Creed -- known as \\"Pen\\" -- made a pact of eventual marriage with Piers, her best friend back when she was twelve and she's determined to run away to her family home near Bristol, find Piers, and marry him instead. Richard, not thinking very clearly, insists she can't travel all that way alone -- boy's clothes or not -- and insists on accompanying her. And that's only the beginning! Pen, an engaging tomboy, is innocent and nave, but she's not stupid or slow and she certainly doesn't lack nerve or courage. On their journey by stage (a leveling experience that horrifies Sir Richard), they become involved with a thief who, it turns out, has acquired possession of the extremely valuable Brandon Necklace. One of Melissa's brothers is involved. So are the Bow Street Runners. So is Piers, whose interests have shifted somewhat since his adolescent agreement with Pen so many years before.Heyer's leading men are sometimes unpleasantly sarcastic brutes, but not the highly sympathetic Sir Richard. And Pen is the sort of solemnly well-meaning heroine one would have no trouble wanting to take care of. It's a complicated plot (with multiple elopements) but Heyer never loses control of the action or the actors. My advice is to sit back and enjoy, and try not to laugh too loudly."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"Georgette Heyer is wonderful. Her stories are rich with witty dialogue and a picture of the Regency Period. This is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"'The Corinthian' was the first Georgette Heyer book I read - I picked up a 1966 edition and, boy, am I glad I did - and it still remains my favorite. Sir Richard Wyndham, about to make a marriage proposal to a woman he doesn't love due to family pressures, comes across Penelope Creed (Pen, if you will) dropping out of the second-floor window of her aunt's house, and life is never the same for this very proper, fashionable gentleman. Pen is so delightfully cheerful and innocent, and we can see Sir Richard, despite his proper and stern manners, falling for her. Witty and charming with quite a few funny moments, 'The Corinthian' is just delightful, and Pen and Sir Richard remain my favorite Heyer couple."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"I have dozens of old editions of Georgette Heyer's marvelous novels. I was surprised when I retrieved my copy of \\"The Corinthian\\" from the bottom of the pile because I didn't recall the story. As I re-read it, some bits came back to me but mostly it was like discovering a new treasure of her wit and humour. Sometimes I would go over the same dialog two or three times because it is so enjoyable. Since my original copy is full of printing errors, I searched on Amazon and was delighted to learn this and many of her other novels are back in print. I ordered my new edition which I will not allow to slip my memory in future."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"I generally like all of Heyer's historical novels, and this one is particularly delightful, filled with interesting characters, much humor and an appropriate level of miscommunication to drive along the plot.

As with all her books, the conclusion is too abrupt and you definitely wish there was more."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"The product description gives the story summary and there are quite a few reviews already so I will just add a short note about this since it is one of my favorite GH books and, possibly, the funniest.The girl in disguise as boy has been done many times and -- considering the hero already knows since he has helped the heroine with her disguise and is accompanying her so she can visit her childhood friend --- I almost wonder myself at what has made a story this simple so very charming."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"One of my favorite Regency books.

The title character in this novel is also a dandy, always dapper, with coiffed hair, snuff box always at hand, and a well honed ennui. In Georgette Heyer's story, Sir Richard Wyndham is all that and comfortably wealthy too. Facing a long anticipated engagement, he meets and embarks on an impromptu adventure with a precocious teenager.Corinthian is wonderfully witty. There is much to laugh about plus mystery and intrigue in this romantic comedy. It reminded me a great deal of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, and would make for an entertaining stage play or movie of its own. The unlikely couple at the center of the story changes little from beginning to end, but they are endearing and easily championed. The secondary characters and myriad twists and turns had me laughing out loud and eagerly reading through to the end.Corinthian is a thoroughly enjoyable read that would appeal to fans of screwball romantic comedy."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"Georgette Heyer stories are always fun to read The books are full of funny characters and the dialogue is quick and witty. The language used is apropos to the period and I love learning about a London and England which is way in the past. The Corinthian has the usual cast of heroes, but also has a mystery and some rather nasty villains to flavour the story. The heroines are not ladies who need to be rescued but are nearly always well able to take care of themselves which is usually what sparks the problem between them and the hero."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (The Uniform Edition, Volume 13)","review":"I adore Regency Romance novels when they are well written.

Sir Richard decides to accompany her on her expedition, and they have a series of adventures that somewhat strains credulity. Although it is easy to see what each sees in the other, there is not actually any romantic zing; rather, there is a great deal of charm and humor.

I also do not usually like books written by committee (in this case a team of two sisters).I picked up 'Thicker Than Water' on the basis of a recommendation I read on one of Amazon's lists. I am glad I did. Parrish's books, with the exception of the first, are published as paper back originals. If ever an author deserved hard cover treatment, this one does.I am also wondering about the lack of professional reviews of the Parrish books on the Amazon site. I wonder why this author is not getting the attention she (they) truly deserve.The series has a mixed race protagonist, Louis Kincaid, who, like the best of the fictional detectives, is conflicted about almost everything in his life. The books are set in the 1980s before DNA and widespread use of computer technology. Smart move.'Thicker Than Water' is rich in character development and sense of time and place. It is as well plotted as anything currently on the mystery best seller lists.In this book, the horrific 20 year old rape and murder of a beautiful young girl may be the key to solving a present day homicide. The man convicted of that murder, and recently released after serving his time, is the prime suspect in the current slaying.Kincaid believes that the thoroughly unlikeable Jack Cade, the man convicted of the rape and murder, may in fact, be innocent. He forms a shaky alliance with Susan Outlaw, Cade's court appointed attorney.This book is filled with fully developed characters. Even the bit players have been created with great care. The childhood friend of the murdered girl is one of the most touching characters in the book.I think the Kincaid series has great potential.Buy these books.Read them.Recommend them to your friends.Talk them up to your local booksellers.Kincaid deserves hardcovers and a publicity team working on his behalf."},{"Title":"Thicker Than Water","review":"P.J. Parrish has written another novel that glues you to every page. Once again, we get Louis Kincaid at his best. The story was intriguing and moved at an excellent pace. I don't recall reading a novel that had so many twist, which is one of the main reasons it holds your attention. Louis does an excellent job again and I think PI suits him well. I just love how his mind works and he puts all the puzzle pieces together. He may have come to the wrong conclusions at times, but he never stops seeking answers. I love that about him. Very sad when you learn Kitty's story, such an innocent. I really admired Louis' dogged determination to see justice done and allow her to rest in peace.

It appears the two crimes are related---but Cade may have been set up for both of them.Suspects abound---with twists that seem to absolve everyone you suspectAs the odds against Louis Kincaid&#65533;s quest mount he shows more determination in seeking the truth.Wonderful pacing holds you to the final chapter before you realize whodunit.Louis Kincaid continues to grow as a character, the supporting cast is robust and the Florida setting is appropriately steamy."},{"Title":"Thicker Than Water","review":"This is the first of Parrish's books I've read, but I've already ordered two more.First off, I loved her protagonist, Louis Kincaid. He's damaged, which makes him interesting, but he's also possesses a deep streak of morality, which makes him heroic. On top of that, the plot is well done and nicely layered. Then there's the Florida atmosphere, which is great. Being a Florida girl myself, I can't tell you how many authors get this wrong. But Parrish does a great job. As I said, I'm ready for the next one.Patricia Lewin, Author of BLIND RUN, OUT OF REACH, & OUT OF TIME"},{"Title":"Thicker Than Water","review":"Two decades ago Jack Cade was convicted of raping and murdering fifteen-year-old Kitty Jagger as his pick axe was the murder weapon and her bloody panties with his blood type were found on in his truck. Rather than go to trial and risk the Florida electric chair, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to twenty years in the state pen. He served his sentence and is released from prison.A few days after gaining his freedom, the police arrest Jack for the murder of his defense attorney Spencer Duvall. Ronnie Cade hires unlicensed private investigator Louis Kincaid to find evidence to clear his father. After gaining access to all the evidence, Louis is convince that Jack Cade did not do the current homicide or kill Kitty Jagger. He embarks upon a quest to find Kitty's killer, one that if he's successful he believes will clear Jack on both murder charges. When Louis is able to put all the pieces of the puzzle together, he vows to see that justice occurs though it means breaking the laws he was once swore to uphold.THICKER THAN WATER is a fast-paced crime thriller that starts out at hyperspeed and never eases off the throttle. The protagonist is an honorable person who believes that justice needs assistance because the law is not always right which is one of the reasons he no longer wears a badge. There are plenty of suspects for both crimes including Jack, but it isn't until the last chapter that the real killer is revealed. P.J. Parrish's novels will appeal to readers who like James Patterson and Michael Connelly.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Thicker Than Water","review":"I loved this book -- Louis is my hero and I like the fact that the books take place before DNA fingerprinting - it makes it so much more of a mystery than just sending in a sample of DNA to the lab.

Great read."},{"Title":"Thicker Than Water","review":"THICKER THAN WATER is a good private eye yarn with an interesting plot. Louis Kincaid, a former policeman turned private eye having finished a case is looking around for work when a young man comes to him for help in proving his father, Jack Cade, is innocent of a recent murder. The murder victim was the lawyer who his father feels sold him out twenty years ago. The only ones in town, including the sheriff and police, who don't think Jack Cade is guilty are his son and the public defender on his case. Kincaid investigates everything that comes his way on the case as well as the twenty year old murder and clashes with the lawyer as he digs at uncovering the truth about both murders. The characters are well drawn and seem real enough to sweat in the humid Florida setting. No one ever said you have to like the hero's client in a private eye case and in this one, you certainly don't. Kincaid's determination and the things he uncovers on both crimes keep you turning the pages right up to the emotional final scene in the cemetery.

The ideas are everywhere, and Project Beta lays out how some government players had a large role in actively encouraging the development of the UFO culture through disinformation campaigns intended to both keep prying eyes away from their real secret projects, and to identify the prying eyes as well. At the heart of the story is Paul Bennewitz, whose life and mental stability were intentionally destroyed as a victim of these operations.Richard Doty, one of the key officials feeding disinformation to Bennewitz actually served as a consultant for The X-Files, from 1994 to 1996 and he even wrote the screenplay for an episode- \\"The Blessing Way\\" and was an extra on two other episodes- \\"Anasazi\\" and \\"Paper Clip\\"Much of this disinformation is still drawing support by those who want to believe and don't attempt to dig further than initial researches which confirm what they want to believe- in actuality, this is the true strategy behind successful disinformation- leading someone to something that appears true on an initial glance, creating an impassioned true believer.To be clear, Bishop is not a \\"debunker\\" and does believe in UFOs. However, he is part of a growing group of researchers who do not believe in the \\"extra-terrestrial hypothesis\\" as an explanation, and instead believes there is something else unknown which produces this phenomena. He does not discount the possibility entirely, but the evidence seems to point to other directions and he even points out that the air force has witnessed legitimate UFO sightings they cannot explain, which are distinctly separate from the kinds of disinfo stories intentionally \\"leaked\\" to the public.Although this idea is growing, it is not new and has been written about by others, including John Keel, Jacques Vallee, and even Carl Jung."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"This is the carefully researched and well written case of Paul Bennewitz, whom the government drove out of his mind by feeding him false information that led him to believe Earth was being invaded by space beings, but the military was ignoring it.A good book for UFO observers to read."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"Project Beta is a book about Paul Bennewitz, a brilliant physicist who during the 1980s became the victim of a disinformation campaign.At the end of the 1970s Bennewitz, who lived and worked next to Kirtland Air Force Base outside of Albuquerque, started picking up strange radio signals and messages that he eventually concluded were extraterrestrial in origin. Around the same time he began capturing odd lights in the sky over the base, both on camera and video, and it didn't take long for him to convince himself that extraterrestrials were abducting people in the area, that they had built underground bases, and also entered into different alliances with not-so friendly representatives of the American government and military. In 1981 Bennewitz finished a report on his findings, which he chose to call Project Beta. This report was sent out in large quantities, not only to various ufologists but also to President Reagan (who didn't show much interest in the matter, though).But things weren't quite the way Bennewitz thought they were. Much of what he had filmed, taken pictures of, and listened in to was actually top-secret military experiments, and in an attempt to divert his attention from sensitive subjects the ones in charge on the base simply decided to exploit his gullibility by providing him with bogus stories. UFOs, extraterrestrials, alien abductions, and much more were simply very effective tools to divert his attention from the truth, and agents and representatives from the military faked an interest in his extraterrestrial theories and provided him with false ideas in order to be able to keep him under surveillance and point him away from the classified truth.Does it sound complicated? Well, it is. The book is said to be a true story, but most of the time if feels more like a traditional thriller, albeit a sometimes very entertaining one. It's also very tragic, but Bishop writes with a sense of humor and this accompanied by the high level of skepticism makes the book quite entertaining to read. Especially the sections where Bennewitz and ufologist Leo Sprinkle interviews an alleged abductee in a car covered in aluminum foil, which is supposed to prevent any extraterrestrial tracking signals. Man, those sections were funny indeed."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"The title says it all: \\"The Creation of a Modern UFO Myth\\". For decades a debate has raged over the existence of aliens and if they do exist, why haven't they made themselves known in a more, how to say this judiciously, public manner? I've had a lifelong fascination with UFOs (what boy did not?) Only lately have I realized that support among other fields, i.e. biology is almost non-existent (the sheer number of accidents required to bring about intelligent life on our planet is astounding). I've become convinced that intelligence is extremely rare and perhaps unique in our galaxy. Scientific American stated that a civilization traveling at only 1/10 c could populate the galaxy in less than ten million years - a dot on the scale of galactic time. The real question is, why haven't they? (Occam's Razor)Paul Bennewitz was a respected physicist, businessman, family man and citizen who literally went crazy over the subject of UFOs. The author suggests that a large part of his thinking was directed by the government in an effort to conceal super secret weapons at Sandia Labs. The disinformation campaign continued for years complete with \\"faked\\" government reports, wiretaps, secret agents, various mysterious agencies and infiltrators who may or may not be double or triple agents, etc. It's hard to decide which is nuttier - government employees creating elaborate schemes designed to convince a group of yahoos that little green men were real, aliens with unbelievable technology worried about our military, testing super-secret weapons where citizens can see or the continued belief in UFOs despite a lack of verifiable evidence. The book is not only a report on this man but a brief history of the UFO \\"Movement\\" and it is a social movement in its quasi-religious tenets, its appeal to those who seek simple answers for complex solutions and apostles & holy writ.I'll go along with the idea that advanced weapons design goes on in secret. Yet where are they when we need them most? Why not send one of the balls of light into the Sunni Triangle & state that it is Allah's angel? Better, why not use the objects that turn on a dime, flight up or out or into the stratosphere to explode buried land mines? The author semi-suggests that UFOs show up at various military bases and laboratories without asking the question - why? How can our study of EMP or anti-gravity theory possible affect them? Indeed, the overall mood at the end is one of great sadness - for Bennewitz, his family, the other players involved in the scam and last but not least, the true believers."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"Unfortunately, Greg Bishop's book has already been misinterpreted. It has been claimed in other reviews here and indeed elsewhere that the book alleges that the entire UFO story is one that has been made up by various US intelligence agencies. This is quite simply not true and not only does the book state this clearly but quotes the chief protaganist, Richard Doty as saying that he accepted there were real ETs, real UFOs, and that we have been visited. Please read the book carefully.And what you will read, if you do, is a masterful treatise on exactly how the US intelligence agencies have historically used the UFO phenomena for their own advantage in order to plant false information in the minds of those they want to target. And why would they do this? To lead them away from black budget activities that they would rather people didn't look at.It does mean though that as a result of the activities of AFOSI, some of the tennets of modern ufology are false. It is extremely unlikely for example that there ever was an underground base at Dulce and that means no firefight and no large jars of embryonic humans etc.. The book also strongly suggests that cattle mutilations and the way they were carried out are comfortably within the scope of human ability.This isn't a novel, it's a factual account of historical events with the main character already passed on at the time of writing and given these circumstances and the background this all falls into, Greg has done a marvelous job in bringing the personalities to light. Bennewitz is portrayed as brilliant, nay a genius, and yet at the same time deeply flawed by naivete. Bill Moore comes over as much a victim as anyone else and even Richard Doty is portrayed as having some humanity. What may indeed surprise some folk is that Greg does not paint the intelligence agencies as disgustingly evil. He demonstrates how they did their job and what their motivations were. There is an underlying level of respect shown towards them. In the end, it came down to one man's life against the potential loss of a great many other lives and while no normal people like to play god, in this case the choice was clear.There are unintended lighter moments in the book and these can be found in the spying activities of Doty and his colleagues. A picture is painted of Bennewitz stepping out of his front door to go somewhere while almost simultaneously the spooks are stepping in through the back. It comes over as some neo British stage farce and all that appeared to be missing was Brian Rix dropping his trousers. Furthermore, Kirtland AFB seemed at the time to be like a three ringed circus with \\"dozens\\" of different intelligence agencies stationed at the base, all carrying out their own black projects with no one knowing what the other was doing.This is a masterful account that needed to be written and the UFO community has nothing to fear from it. It will take one hell of a book to be published this year that betters this from a Ufological perspective."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"The Excluded Middle editor, radio host, author and lecturer Greg Bishop has provided the field of UFO research with what is without doubt one if its major, published contributions. The subject matter of Project Beta is an unusual one; and were it not for the fact that the story is meticulously detailed, referenced and researched, the reader might be forgiven for thinking that they had stumbled upon a high-tech, X-Files-meets-Robert Ludlum-style thriller. But Project Beta tells a very real story - and one that is as harrowing as it is informative.In essence, the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction book relates the story of physicist Paul Bennewitz, who after stumbling upon Air Force and National Security Agency secrets that he believes are connected to the activities of sinister extraterrestrials and UFOs, is bombarded by the murky world of officialdom with a mass of disinformation, faked stories and outright lies in order to both divert him from his research and lead to his mental and psychological disintegration.While anyone and everyone with an interest in UFOs should read Greg's book, it is unlikely to please some - particularly the I-want-to-believe crowd that foam at the mouth whenever the words \\"underground base,\\" \\"cattle mutilations,\\" and \\"alien abductions\\" surface. As Greg shows, many of the cornerstones upon which today's ufological lore are built, had their origins in the fertile minds of military intelligence and the behind-the-scenes spook-brigade.The UFO truth might not be \\"out there\\" after all - it may all be one big con behind which a veritable plethora of classified, military projects have been hidden.Hopefully, Project Beta will open the floodgates that lead to questions being asked at a higher, official level about the Bennewitz affair, and those who manipulated the man to the point of collapse will be made to answer for their actions."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"I wanted to like this book but in the end found it unsatisfying. The topic - military disinformation - is interesting and worthy enough but the book fails to live up to its potential in several respects.First, the author himself cannot always distinguish between information and disinformation about UFOs, a subject with which he seems only moderately conversant. He signals his confusion from the very start, when he cites a bogus claim by (evidently) CIA historian Gerald K. Haines. In 1997, Haines claimed that the CIA used UFO reports as cover for spy planes such as the U-2, and that the Air Force knowingly went along with this deception. Always ready to accept CIA material, the \`New York Times' ingested the story - hook, line, and sinker. And thus another bogus claim became historical fact.There are many problems with the claim. First, the CIA is never a credible source about its own history. After all, it is in business to deceive. Second, spy plane flights were too few in number to account for many UFO reports and they were carried out in areas far from public view. Third, the black U-2 and A-12 \\"Oxcart\\" flew at very high altitudes and were difficult to detect both visually and (in the case of the A-12) on radar. Fourth, UFO reports of the era bear little if any resemblance to the flight characteristics of high-altitude spy planes. But most fatally, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Robert Friend, head of the Air Force's Project Blue Book from 1958 to 1963, later said there is absolutely no truth to the CIA's claims. Not only was Haines wrong about an agreement between the CIA and Air Force but Friend said he never received a single UFO report that he thought could be attributed to a spy plane. Oops!Although Bishop is occasionally taken in by such tall tales, he is normally more skeptical. His book would have been far more useful if he had used footnotes to indicate the sources of his (mis)information. Any book that aims to distinguish between lies and truth should at least make clear its sources.Project Beta is ostensibly the story of Paul Bennewitz, a loyal American fed a steady diet of intellectual rusty nails and broken glass by the U.S. intelligence community until he went slowly mad. But it has even more to do with the adventures of Bill Moore, the UFO investigator turned intelligence asset, who vainly hoped to penetrate the secrecy that has surrounded UFOs since the 1940s. Bishop has pulled together some entertaining accounts of life in this wilderness of mirrors. The author jumps back and forth through time and often wanders off on distracting tangents but eventually manages to come back to the main topic.Perhaps most disappointing is the author's lack of moral outrage at the picture he paints. He seems to accept that the institutionalized deception that has spread throughout American society was an unavoidable cost of defeating the Evil Soviet Empire. To fight a dragon we had to become a dragon ourselves. Thus, the sacrifice of Bennewitz, a loyal American who only sought to help his country, was readily justifiable on \\"national security\\" grounds. Bishop evinces little concern about the contempt with which military officials now regard both American citizens and their elected officials. Nor does he seem to appreciate the corrosive effect military deception has had upon a society that hopes to remain a democratic republic.It seems just as likely that the U.S. military has used secrecy and deception to protect itself from public scrutiny and accountability, rather than to defend the nation. The darkest secret within the many layers of deception is that many of the weapons programs that are helping to bankrupt our nation don't work as advertised and were unnecessary in the first place."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"As a former Board Member of the Fair Witness Project (Pg. 49) I can tell you that this is an insightful look into UFOs and the U.S. Government.

It is certainly something that the conspiracy buffs will love. It says that Paul Bennewitz, an electrical physicist living in Albuquerque observed strange lights and detected radio messages from the nearby Kirkland Air Force Base. OK so far.It then says that the Government then planned and executed a deliberate disinformation program to Mr. Bennewitz. The Government program was intended to make him believe that these were extraterrestrial visitors. In fact, the book claims that the whole idea of UFO's came from the Government's furtile imagination. Further, from this start the whole UFO community got its basic set of beliefs defined for them by the Government.One point I definitely don't believe, the author says that pictures taken of a complex of buildings are made to disappear when developed. That one just doesn't ring.In spite of this problem, anyone interested in UFO's should find this book very interesting."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"In 1978 Paul Bennewitz, an electrical physicist in New Mexico, began monitoring the radio transmissions of the nearby Sandia Labs, convinced the strange lights hovering over the labs were evidence of an extraterrestrial alien invasion. His letter-writing campaign to the media and even the President to alert them resulted in an alliance between Air Force investigators and Bill Moore, author of the first Roswell incident book to keep tabs on him. The mystery eventually drove Bennewitz to a mental institution and the alliance prompted the spread of misinformation on the topic which began in 1989 and continues to this day. Project Beta is informative, engaging reading from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"It's difficult to reach any profound conclusion about the volume of events discussed in PROJECT BETA: THE STORY OF PAUL BENNEWITZ, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND THE CREATION OF A MODERN UFO MYTH; much like the title alone, the information presented isn't necesssarily additive to any other result but \\"don't believe what you were just told.\\"Of course, this fact goes hand-in-hand with the book's subject: Bennewitz, an inventor and businessman, discovers possibly 'irrefutable' scientific evidence that something 'alien' is taking place involving the DOD's Sandia Labs. Monitored and decoded radio transmissions give the appearance that the Earth is being considered ripe for invasion by an unseen alien force. Rather than find his efforts stymied by the military, Bennewitz finds himself a sort of confidante by a plethora of insiders, all whom poke and prod the man to continue his work in possibly fradulent avenues. For the next decade, he finds himself pushed to his psychological limit, believing that he has somehow been placed in a clandestine race to save mankind partnered with Air Force investigators unwilling to do anything about it.Of course, the principle problem with constructing an account about disinformation is that the author is showing you his cards at the poker table. Greg Bishop knows that the reader will understand the nature of disinformation as he's stripped the theory naked as part of the story he's telling. However, what he doesn't do very well is 'reconstruct' these events to any ultimate conclusion, despite Bennewitz's obvious mental abuse. Few of the details Bishop discusses can be substantiated because of the massive disinformation campaign, and any reasonably intelligent person can probably reach the midpoint of PROJECT BETA and have the revelation, \\"How am I to know for certain that I'm not the one being misinformed here?\\"Still, author Bishop manages to craft a novel that is equal parts intriguing, frustrating, and confusing. The reader cares for Bennewitz -- despite some reservations about the man's stability -- and any reader would genuinely hope that some of these players who confess to be 'good friends' with the man would break their patterns of deceit long enough to help the inventor keep his fragile sanity. Bishop appears to justify their continued abuse of Bennewitz by routinely underscoring how much these men and women cared about the kindly inventor, but that becomes an increasingly difficult 'reality' to accept given Bennewitz's eventual destination."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"PROJECT BETA by Gregory Bishop illuminates our darkest hour in UFOlogy with a spotlight so bright that you can almost read this page-turner in the dark.With a devoted wife and two sons, Paul Bennewitz, then a fiftysomething electrical physicist and accomplished aerobatics pilot, had everything to live for. The company he founded, Thunder Scientific Labs, manufactured specialized instrumentation for high-profile clientele like NASA and the United States Air Force. He even played guitar.Then Bennewitz noticed the UFOs. From the deck of his home perched high in the Four Hills neighborhood of Albuquerque, New Mexico, he photographed and filmed mysterious nocturnal lights cavorting over nearby hush-hush military installations. Soon after, ultrasensitive radio receivers of his own design tracked the luminous phantoms and recorded the covert signals -- modulated pulsed transmissions, loud and clear -- of the UFOs. Clues became proof and Bennewitz became terrified. At times his own worst enemy, the prodigious inventor and electronics wizard went public and contacted newspapers, TV stations, congressmen, UFO researchers and organizations, and even President Ronald Reagan.Certain unelected and non-accountable powers (National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and Air Force Office of Special Investigation) decided to discredit and \\"neutralize\\" Bennewitz for keeps.Enter William Leonard Moore, primary instigator and once fierce proponent of such trivialities as the so-called Philadelphia Experiment, MJ-12, and the alleged military retrieval of a crashed \\"flying disc\\" near Roswell, New Mexico. These three \\"mysteries\\" have most unfortunately drained precious time, money and manpower from far more legitimate and rewarding avenues of investigation and research into current unknown and unexplained phenomena and events.By Moore's own admission, representatives of those previously identified unelected and non-accountable powers offered him a Faustian bargain. If he would watch various civilian UFO organizations and researchers in general and Paul Bennewitz in particular as the government disinformation game played itself out in earnest, they would let him in on classified UFO material.Readers must make up their own minds regarding the actions and intentions of the key players in this stranger-than-fiction nightmare about one man's ruin at the hands of a government bent on concealing the truth.

Goerman)"},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"Greg Bishop's book is a straightforward journalistic tome about the process of disinformation that the government purportedly utilizes against the UFO community. While it's interesting to see the process, the title leads us to believe that we'll learn more about Paul Bennewitz, the man who either discovered or created the Dulce Base (depending on your point of view).Instead, we spend most of our time with the two men most responsible for deceiving the poor, paranoid Bennewitz-- Air Force Intelligence agent Richard Doty and UFO researcher Bill Moore. While these tales are interesting, Bishop does raise the spectre of doubt as to what happened throughout the book. Perhaps Doty wasn't in the loop. Maybe Moore was also being fed disinformation. The events of the case are largely presented without judgment, and not much analysis.The result of this is a story that leaves as many loose ends as tied threads. At the end of the day, there's not enough evidence to the contrary to dismiss the concept of an operation at Dulce (far-fetched as the idea is), and there's not enough for anyone to say that there's definitely nothing going on.By not taking a position, Bishop maintains his journalistic credibility. However, the lack of analysis also makes this an often frustrating read. To his credit, he does include Bennewitz's entire report on what he termed \\"Project Beta\\" as an appendix.If you're interested in espionage techniques, you'll find this book mesmerizing. If you're trying to get to the actual bottom of the Dulce Myth, you'll be sadly disappointed.And that's as fair as I can be."},{"Title":"Project Beta: The Story of Paul Bennewitz, National Security, and the Creation of a Modern UFO Myth","review":"This book was poorly written with absolutely no factual evidence to back up anything in the story.

While the text is standard and safe biographical fare, visually the book is very nice. Overall, it is a satisfying introduction to the life of a true rebel and eccentric and I think it is a good starter bio for new Dean fans. For myself, the only real revelation was Jimmy's relationship with Fairmount High teacher, Bette McPherson,which, in the realm of revelatory, it still wasn't anything earth shattering. The closing chapter is probably the most significant in its insistence on the equal importance of Indiana, New York, and Hollywood experiences in Dean's life. Holley doesn't elevate one phase of Dean's career above the others here, but points out the significant influences of each in the broad picture of Jimmy's life. In his later work, James Dean: The Biography, Holley titles an opening chapter, A James Dean Primer. This large format Tribute book could be the Primer to 'The Primer' in that it tastefully sets the stage for his brilliant, in depth 1995 work on Dean. If one is just starting out in the world of James Dean research and fandom, I recommend this one,among others,since Holley deftly avoids over analyzing the subject here. One doesn't get bogged down in pop culture history, intellectualizing or mythologizing as in the case of Dalton's American Icon and The Mutant King.Also, and pertaining to the visual, the paper quality is very nice in the 'Tribute' book; kind of a greyish, glossy finish that's really taseful for this format.

Perhaps the similarities are more than mere coincidence."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"The world's best message is ineffective if the person on the receiving end does not understand or relate to it.It is a harsh standard. It is a message communicators ignore at their own peril. You can be brilliant, creative, even right, but your message will fall flat unless it touches the hearer's prism of experience, beliefs, preconceptions and prejudices.In Words that Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear, Frank Luntz offers insights into finding and using the right words to achieve your goals. The key to communication is to place yourself in the listener's situation and understand his or her deepest thoughts and beliefs. What the listener perceives constitutes the listener's reality.Based on his experience as a political and corporate pollster he recommends 11 rules for effective communication:1. Use small words.2. Use short sentences.3. Credibility is as important as philosophy.4. Consistency matters.5. Novelty: offer something new.6. Sound and texture matter.7. Speak aspirationally.8. Visualize.9. Ask a question.10. Provide context and explain relevance.11. Visual imagery matters.Luntz does not stop there. In addition to an insightful discussion complete with illustrations from his professional experience of the 11 rules, he adds critical elaboration:1. Never assume knowledge or awareness.2. Get the order right.3. Gender can obstruct understanding.4. It's about the children.5. How you define determines how you are received.If communicating is important to you, and who does not need to, then time spent reading Frank Luntz's book will be well spent. We are all subject to the power of language. Words spell the difference between success and failure. The right words grant you an edge. The author says it all in his subtitle, \\"It's not what you say--it's what people hear.\\""},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Well, there is certainly something to be said about a book which has generated so many negative comments and \\"reviews,\\" particularly by those who admit they have not even read \\"Words That Work.\\" In this review I am not going to discuss the specific contents of the book since that is available elsewhere. I want to focus on some of the criticisms instead.Frank Luntz, the author of this recent contribution to linguistic empowerment, and who just happens to be one of the more successful contemporary masters of the art of using words to persuade, has evidently touched a sensitive nerve in the brains of those who think that there is something \\"wrong\\" or \\"evil\\" about the grand old skill of rhetoric. Rhetoric, you say? OK, I realize that most of those educated within our institutions of \\"higher\\" learning during the past four decades or so may be suffering from an intellectual disorder called \\"classical deficiency syndrome\\" (or CDS), so please allow me to elaborate.Rhetoric is art turned to the practical purpose of persuading or impressing. It is, in a way, the art of making speeches that count. Learning rhetoric was prized in the ancient Greek democracies as a means to success in public life. Aristotle, that grand master of realistic philosophical thought, inventor of systematic logic, and father of modern empirical science, even wrote a book called \\"Rhetoric\\" which contains a fairly systematic discussion of the forms of rhetorical argument. The study of rhetoric was valued by many philosophical schools of the past, and especially by the Stoic philosophers who made it a branch of logic. It was a proper study for philosophers and an absolute necessary for anyone contemplating a career in public life. Those, for instance, who have read the speeches of the great Roman orator Cicero (anyone out there?) will understand and appreciate what's just been said.The major point of Luntz's book is that \\"It's not what you say, it's what people hear,\\" and he provides an extensive argument supporting the proposition that, indeed, \\"words matter\\" or, at least, the words one chooses to use are as important as the concept or assertion one is attempting to present. His main point could be considered almost a \\"truism,\\" a trivial sidebar, if it were not for the fact that it is so commonly ignored. He certainly provides ample illustrations in his text to justify his insistence on the importance of his major point, \\"It's not what you say, it's what people hear.\\" And \\"what people hear\\" is at bottom what will persuade them, which is the whole point of the matter. Select your words carefully, utilizing those terms which are most likely to convince your audience to accept your ideas or buy your product or whatever.Subversion, you say? Manipulation, you charge? Powermongering, you accuse? Please, spare me those ridiculous complaints. Luntz is promoting \\"persuasion\\" in his book, that is, intellectually \\"moving\\" a person by words and argument in order to convince or induce a belief. Nowhere in his text does he promote any activity that could be remotely considered unethical, deceptive, or disempowering. He is simply saying that some words are better than other words when one is trying to present one's case in a public venue. Big deal! Anyone trained in the classic art of \\"eristics\\" knows that the words one uses are every bit as important as facial expression, hand gestures, voice pitch, and so on. (\\"Eristics\\"? Oh, sorry about that. For those with CDS, \\"eristics\\" is the \\"art of disputation or debate,\\" something every young educated Greek and Roman male student learned.)Is Luntz biased, as some critics accuse? Of course he is. I am, too. So is everyone! A \\"bias\\" is simply a point of view, a particular stance one takes in regard to anything under consideration. A \\"bias\\" and a \\"prejudice\\" are not the same thing, contrary to what some people think. If you don't have a \\"bias\\" you simply don't have a point of view and most likely are not very interesting for purposes of a discussion. There is no one more boring than a \\"neutral-thinking\\" individual who has no \\"considered\\" opinion about anything. Note that I'm not talking \\"mere\\" opinion here, but an \\"examined\\" or \\"thought-out\\" opinion. And the words through which or by which we express our opinions, especially when we want to persuade or convince someone of the efficacy of our opinions, are significant. In other words, they matter!Now, it is well known that Luntz is a Republican pollster and tends to work that side of the aisle politically. This is no secret; he is quite open about this; he is not hiding anything. The specific details, however, of his political or social or economic thinking are unknown to me and not important as far as his book is concerned. Although I realize many political extremists (whether left or right) are loathe to accept it, the messenger is not the same as the message. The rules of logic, the principles of rhetoric, and the strategies of eristics are not \\"owned\\" by any political group. It matters not one whit if a book about symbolic logic or mathematical theory, for instance, is written by a left-winger or a right-winger as long as the material within it conforms to truth, consistency, and the generally accepted principles of the discipline.\\"Words That Work\\" is, in my \\"considered\\" opinion, a valuable modern contribution to the whole subject of rhetoric (in its classical sense) and I would recommend it as a primer in \\"persuasion\\" to anyone involved in politics, social activism, business, or any other activity requiring public speaking or policy-formation. And for those who may suppose that I am a subversive right-winger offering support to a fellow-traveler, let me assure you I am not a neo-conservative, a member of the Republican Party, or a member of the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy.\\"You may be assured of one thing, however: before I criticize a book or its author, I read the book first and get to know something about its author and then only for purposes of determining the author's particular \\"bias.\\" But it is always the book I review and not the author. After all, even the devil can quote Scripture."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"This is a how it is done book on persuasion, largely political and some business. Luntz is clearly very clever and effective at his craft, which he reveals openly. It is grotesquely fascinating and at times horrific to see how well the spin doctors can craft their art of deflection and persuasion, depending upon the need.Luntz has taken a lot of slams in other reviews on Amazon. Mostly, it seems about his politics and his craft of deception, which is sort of beside the point given this is a how-to-do book. Luntz's examples of word choices are at times just better words (that's honest) but also do cross the line into non-truths, if not lies. Therefore, this book is great information for folks looking to learn how to better craft messages and also for those learning to recognize lies or propaganda. Luntz exposes just how gullible we really are to concepts and words that resonate in our minds. Herein may lie the best use of the book - a reminder of how vulnerbale we are to smooth talking and distortions, especially if we don't really want to make much effort to see through the veil.As a sometimes media and communications professional it was a very helpful book. As Luntz points out, the effectiveness of words changes as they age, either out of culture or through over use. Over time, his examples of powerful words will ebb. Also, for the professionals out there this book is good reminder that maybe it is easy to start slipping down the slope if we don't keep a vigilant eye on ourselves.Luntz makes a few references to Tony Schwart, the \\"father of modern advertising.\\" If you are interested in the subjects of communication and have not read Tony's two books -- do.I hope this is helpful."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I make my living with words. So most of what I read here I already knew. Having said that, it was a good refresher course. The book deals mostly with words in politics. But it also discusses slogans and words used in business.Is the book about manipulating? Sure it is. But, fact is, any time you use words to sell an idea or a product, you're manipulating --- or at least trying to do so. A better word would be \\"persuasion.\\"As the author says, \\"It's not what you say that matters. It's what people hear.\\" And that's true. It never fails to amaze me how easily people misread what they're told or what they hear or read. Why? People don't really listen. People are thinking their private thoughts. They are thinking what they'll say next. They're not listening to you. So they're hearing sound bites.The communicator who uses small words and short sentences and the right words will be able to get these folks to take the action they want them to take.If you communicate to convince others, you should read this book. It's not the best written book I've read. It's not the best book on this topic. It's not a great book. And there are errors. Errors in wording and errors in fact.For example, the author says that people do not buy things from long gone decades. They prefer items of today. Well, that's not really true. There is a large market in fountain pens from the twenties, thirties and into the sixties. I know. I collect them. The market for Parker 51 pens from the forties is keen. So I don't buy that statement.But the book is a decent read. It will help anyone who needs words and needs to persuade people."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"\\"Words that Work\\" is in many ways a fine entree of prime rib with a side of undercooked brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts make you turn up your nose despite the delightful prime rib right there on the plate, and so you reject the whole plate. \\"Words that Work\\" contains highly unique insight into the art of language and how to best use it and it is certain to be helpful for anyone who wishes to be a better communicator. However, you have to be able to view that helpful insight separate from its political connections, or you won't be able to appreciate it.What this book is is a presentation of solid, basic, easily to follow rules for how to put your words in the best light. It is a continuous reinforcement of the ruling principle of the book: It's not what you say, it's what people hear. As a professional speaker and a teacher, I have applied several of the basic ideas from it already with positive results. Luntz has gone through painstaking work to learn the pulse of American thought and found ways to tap into that pulse. This book is highly recommended for anyone who communicates with people on a daily basis (And who doesn't?).It's also intriguing work into how politicians and businesses learn how you think and work rigorously to influence that thought. Much time, money, and effort has gone into developing the techniques Luntz brings to light.Luntz insists from the introduction that this book is entirely nonpartisan, and as far as the techniques he recommends, he's right. But Luntz himself is not nonpartisan, which is made more annoying by the fact that he tries to insist he is. But through the book he cites almost universally only the cases where the Republicans did it right and the Democrats did it wrong. If this were a political book that would be abominable. But it's not, it's a communication manual. Still, if your opinions are diametrically opposed to Luntz's, you may find it agitating to read this book (I found it agitating myself and I'm right of center).I think it is the agitated liberals who want to call these techniques \\"manipulative\\" or \\"dishonest\\". They're not, and they're hardly exclusive to Republicans. It wasn't Republicans who coined the phrase \\"risky tax scheme\\".If you are capable of any degree of objectivity and can learn from people who you think are wrong, this book is well worth a read. You can leave the brussels sprouts and just eat the prime rib."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"This book is a must read in order to acheive success during the first quarter of the 21st century, and perhaps longer. Although heavily slanted towards the political arena, it works equally well throughout the rest of society.When enrolled in college some time ago, the freshman english course required a book on language usage by Hayakawa. Lutz's \\"Words that work\\" supplants that definitive text of years gone by.The focus of the book is its theme \\"It's not what you say, but what people hear\\". Consequently, language constructs, key words, and careful seletion of critical words are an absolute necessity to communciate effectively.The book revolves around ten tules of successful communication. They are:1). Simplicity - use small words.2). Brevity - use short sentences.3). Credibility is as important as philosophy.4). COnsistency matters.5). Novelty - offer something new.6). Sound and texture matter.7). Speak aspirationally8). Visualize.9). Ask a Question.10). Provide context and explain relevance.The goal of all this is RESULTS (Not Process).This book then illustrates the application of these rules in every-day terms.Much of what the book tells us is intuitively obvious in the working world. As a geological consultant, I find clients don't have a lot of spare time on their hands. They want deliverables and up-dates in concise, precise words that are unambiguous. By providing that, I gained a lot of repeat business.What the book did not include was how to meld Lutz's theme with a major tool of today's business communication: PowerPoint presentations. In today's busy digital world, they are essential. In my own consulting work, the client wants deliverables electronically, not in written reports. Application of Lutz's principles with a logical outline is the key to effectively communicating results. By keeping words focused and using visuals, PowerPoint presentations can effective. It is a requirement of the digital age.To summarize, if you wish to be effective with your choice of words, be focused, brief, use short sentences, and adopt all of the above principles. Try it and you will like it."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Dr. Frank Luntz has become an American icon. Businesses use his research to define their products and corporate culture. The political Right uses his ideas and words to better position its agenda and the political Left derides him as a Svengali who manipulates the masses.Yet, crack the binding on this book and you get the true Frank Luntz as he opens up the pollster/focus group world to the uninitiated. Chapter 4 titled \\"How \`Words That Work' Are Created\\" provides a candid peak into the inner-workings of an effective focus group. For instance, a good focus group intentionally does not represent a diverse cross-section of the population. The idea is to get a homogeneous group together to distill important information and attitudes.By listening to people, Dr. Luntz arrives at the \\"words that work\\" and not by forcing certain words on people. Dr. Luntz advocates more communication and direct simple communication as a way to garner support for a proposal or idea.Some of the best information comes from footnotes, case studies, appendices and the Addendum. Stories of being pulled into Speaker Gingrich's office to defend the use of certain language, actual memos produced by Dr. Luntz showing just how he does deliver his messages, and the business and political case studies in Chapters 7 & 8, liven the discussion of the \\"Words that Work.\\"Applying the lessons of this book would lead to clearer and more focused communication in both business and politics.If both sides learned to use \\"Words That Work\\" perhaps we could focus solely on the merits of each argument."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"This is one of those \\"Ah Ha!!!\\" books.

John Kerry and former Mayor Rudy Giuliani--making it the only book this year likely to win praise from two men who might square off against each other for the White House in 2008.

Merely writing this off as how to manipulate with words is silly. Even if that was the case, this is Frank Luntz, without him the Contract with America would've been very different, the Death Tax would've remained the Estate Tax, and many other Republican causes would've never made the splash that they have. Ignoring what he has to say because of his politics is not just silly its moronic. I forced myself to read this book slowly, to study what Luntz was saying, and I've been applying it to my working life. Much of what he says is about clear communication. Some of it is about choosing the right word to get the message across. Is that part manipulative? Yes. Luntz is a salesman who uses words as his sales tools. Manipulation is the norm. \\"How do we spin this\\" has been uttered in almost every job I've ever held (and I'm not in sales). This is a book written by a master on linguistic manipulation. It should be required reading for everyone -- especially the left."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Bottom Line: A useful guide to effective communication.What You Will Learn: The book has many instructive examples on how to craft your views in a way which is most likely to get people to agree with you. In a nutshell, Dr. Luntz is preaching positive, uplifting, inclusive language. It's interesting to see how political extremes make so much hay with harsh negative language, but Luntz is point is that if you want to get the mass of people on your side you need to adjust your pitch.Parting Shot: An enjoyable book, especially for those that are political junkies."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"There is nothing in this book with which I would disagree. However, that doesn't mean that it doesn't have it's problems. All of the other reviewers have pointed out many of it's fine assets. It would be helpful to someone just starting out in writing. But I was disappointed! From its title, not what you say, but what people hear, I was expecting it to explore that specific concept. The difference between the transmission of words and their reception. If it does, its buried in there somewhere. I was very excited by a book that had some fresh insight into language. My biggest gripe: now that someone has put a book out there that supposedly covers the subject, others will be disinclined to do so. A more honest, but not great title would be: Tips on 21st century writing. Parting shot: it does take forever to make rather simple and obvious point, which would be okay if it was about the subject which the title suggests."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Luntz re-packages material that's been around for a long time. There are no revelations in this book.I thought of Lincoln as I read this book.

Luntz is no Lincoln."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Read this book right away.That was clear - wasn't it? Words That Work is an important book for anyone who relies on language to earn their living, as I do. As a speaker, writer (my latest book isBe Unreasonable), marketer and business accelerator, the specific language I use makes all the difference as to whether or not my message has impact. Often, the right words determine if I'm going to convince my audience, sell the deal, and win my case.The Ten Rules for Effective Language and the Twenty-One Words and Phrases for the Twenty-first Century are standout chapters. It would be worthwhile to read the book for those alone. While the Ten Rules are not unique to this book, they are freshly and clearly presented in a way that makes for an ideal checklist. And you could use the Twenty-One phrases as a guidebook to construct your next press release.This is a real-world tool, filled with powerful examples of language choice for you to adapt to your won communications. It's also pretty entertaining, with great nuggets of American social and political history. Plus, there's a fun section on myths about language and people, that while not one bit surprising is a great example of shaping the context with false assertions, and then knocking them down to advance your own arguments.The most important message may be this: consistency matters - so repeat, repeat early, and repeat often. And while you're at it - communicate continuously. The one with the most message in the marketplace wins, every time.Read this book, right away.

He is a positivist and this shows in his numerous examples throughout the book in a neutral, objective presentation and in interviews, \\"I don't want to be a part of negativity--I don't want to be a part of tearing things down.\\" Indeed, there is very little belittling or tearing down from Luntz and people from all political perspectives will find this book fascinating and entertaining.Much of Luntz's current work is for corporations and he tries to integrate this perspective in the book, but his real successes have been in politics and those are the stories that will be remembered. Luntz was integral in the formation of the \\"Contract With America\\" that the Republicans put forth in 1995 when they took control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. It was a piece that required the perfect balance of words that work in order to succeed and it did.Mixed in to Luntz's stories about politics and hob-nobbing with Hollywood is a bit of psychology and a bit of philosophy and the entire book is a good look at language and understanding how to communicate effectively. Particularly interesting were the comparisons in popularity of groups of words. For example, Luntz explains that most people think government spends too much on \\"Welfare,\\" but not enough, \\"assistance to the poor.\\" To some, it's the same thing, but worded differently, people react to the concept differently based on their preconceived notions.Some will see the author's efforts as sneaky or dubious because, they would argue, he gives a pretty facade to an ugly thing. But what people should come to realize is that very few people, including politicians, are out there trying to hurt everyone. People, in general, are good, and their opposition would tend to agree with them if they only understood what they were trying to accomplish. Luntz helps get ideas across and that could be the most positive thing one can do."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"this is a very interesting book.

Since I love words and reading, I thought his book might be for me. The book is out of my league. He evaluates many words now in use by political and business figures. He offers many additional words and phrases they will be finding effective in this new century.The book is for political and business leaders, and only minimally for a lay person or man in the street. Also, for the leaders in America, the book is not a self-help book, anymore than a book about brain surgery can be a self-help book. You need an expert. Dr. Frank I. Luntz and his firm are highly skilled communication consultants. The book introduces you to their work.\\"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear\\" explains in detail the work he does, along with his firm, and has done successfully for many years for American presidential and gubernatorial candidates, for members of Congress, and for CEOs of many Fortune 500 companies.Whether you are running for office or running a company, your survival depends upon knowing the best way to carry your message -- to the electorate, to your staff and employees, or to your potential customers.You quite surely have in mind the ideas you want to get across. You might even have considered some wording. Dr. Luntz emphasizes that your task is only partly done. You must know not only what you say, you must also know what people will hear, which can be a big difference.You think you have come up with the words. The words seem simple enough. But how are you supposed to know the reaction people will have to what you say? Where do you get that information? Perplexing, isn't it?Ahead of time, how can you judge people's reactions? How can you know what will move them to vote for you or to buy your products or services? America's current social make-up and climate make such judgments extremely challenging.Scientific tools are available to help -- large-scale surveys and polls, focus groups, individual dial-response groups, interviews. Dr. Luntz pulls no punches. He knows what he's talking about. He has had many years of experience nationally, throughout most of the fifty states, and in many foreign countries.Here is Dr. Luntz's good summary: \\"This book is about the art and science of words that work. Examining the strategic and tactical use of language in politics, business, and everyday life, it shows how you can achieve better results by narrowing the gap between what you intend to convey and what you're audiences actually interpret.\\"\\"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear\\" may be only the beginning for you.

They collectively demonstrate why the right is laughing at, not with, lefties like these.Notice how two comment that they \\"just heard the author speak on NPR,\\" that bastian of unbiased, fair and balanced journalism. Note that, by their own admission, they HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK. Rather, they were so revolted that Fresh Air would dare feature a conservative that some \\"felt violently ill.\\" Apparently not too ill, however, to treat Amazon's reviews like a lefty blog and do their best to keep drive away potential readers.One of these intellects tellingly remarked, \\"I would buy this book only to burn it.\\" Typical lefties. All for free speach, but only as long as they endorse what you are saying. Otherwise they're a bunch of book burners.What's sad is that these Yahoos are precisely the folks who should read Luntz' book. They won't, because, to these folks Luntz is merely a spin doctor extraordinairre. Yet the left virtually invented semantic infiltration; obviously they just don't like being out-gamed.But Luntz' book isn't about ideology. It's about how words impact perception and shape ideology. That's important, regardless of your ideology, and Luntz does a great job revealing how words are analyzed and syntax selected at a very high level.You should expect that your movie reviewers have watched the movies they review. You should demand that your book reviewers actually read the books they review. Ignore these posters (actually, im-posters), not because of their ideology, but because their political rants are merely that. Don't bother them with the facts.

We cannot change reality but we can use words that that cause our message to be communicated and perceived closer to factual reality than to fiction. In other words if you want to get an effective message across it is not the words that people hear it is how they perceive them.For example who would want to drill for oil in a pristine national wildlife area, with beautiful mountains, cascading streams, flowers and bucolic fields. This is how the environmentalists portray the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge complete with pictures showing this. Unfortunately these idyllic pictures are taken hundreds of miles away from the actual proposed drilling site.If pictures were shown of the real proposed drilling site to the public we would describe it as a barren frozen wasteland, highly inhospitable, and someplace nobody would want to visit in their right mind, think extreme cold, ice, kind of like Antarctica.So if perception should match reality and putting ideology aside, which words would show a more honest representation of the area?The answer is self-evident and this is what Mr. Luntz is arguing for. Surprisingly many people construe him as being politically motivated, not realizing that he sells his services to both sides of the aisle. I think what people misunderstand is that his services are infinitely more useful to the Republicans than to the Democrats due to their political messages. How can environmentalist groups get you to side with them on ANWR if they represent it truthfully? Again the answer is self-evident.Now that I have brought up politics, it is interesting to read this book side by side George Lakoff'sDon't Think of an Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate--The Essential Guide for Progressivesthe way he approaches the issues is startling. While Luntz is about using words that most closely fit with reality, Lakoff is about changing perception to match party ideology. Lakoff argues that in order to swing voters to the democratic goals, such as environmentalism you must use words that change their perceptions.Beautiful mountains, cascading streams, flowers and bucolic fields.It probably does not need to be said, but changing a person's perception with half-truths by using words to fit an ideology is a form of propaganda and unfitting of any major political party.I highly recommend this book, read it alongside Lakoff's to show the glaring difference in the truthfulness of each parties message. In the end what turns most people off a particular message is when they have found out they have been lied to. In this case Luntz wins hands down."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I don't know whether to give this book 5 stars or 1 star.I'd urge all Democratic office-holders and would be office-holders to read the book and take in its lessons, and then read everything else Luntz has written. Our George Lakoff is not as important for Democrats as Luntz is.I'd urge everyone who wants to know when and how to decode polit-speech to read the book too.So far, 5 stars.Why 1 star? Luntz claims that his counsel is about making the best case, not manipulation. I wonder if he really believes that.Here's a quote:From a polling perspective, \\"personalizing\\" Social Security has a 17 percent advantage over \\"privatizing\\" it. Fifty-one percent of Americans believe \\"personalizing\\" the program is a good idea, while only 34 percent believe \\"privatizing\\" it is. Using the term \\"personalizing\\" conveys to voters that you're on their side, fighting to help them get control of their retirement security.What he is saying is that calling privatizing personalizing actually changes it. It does not, it manipulates people to react differently to the idea. Call a cow a rose and it is still a cow.I don't like whores, people who try to sell fake love (no offense, ladies of the day or evening: I am talking figuratively, I am talking about Frank Luntz). But it is worse if you try to convince me you are not a whore when you are one."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"The audio started out great with the voice I'm used to - Frank Luntz. Calm, reassuring, logical. Easy to listen to. Then, it was bait and switch with a voice that I just could not listen to. It sounded put-on and stuffy which was the opposite of what I was trying to picture with the book. To me, it sounded like Elmer Fudd sucking on helium. I suppose everyone else on the planet would love this voice but I could not stand it, so returned the CDs for the book which is simply excellent. The book is a FIVE, for sure.The CDs were based on the old version of the book. They had much less information than that book which has less than the new book."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Have just had time to pick it up again, today as a matter of fact, but am looking forward to getting into it. What is said in the introduction makes me want to read further. So far I like it; it's clear, to the point, has good examples and I'm interested in finding out the answers to the teasers he mentioned: how to talk your way out of a ticket; how to get on the plane when the door is closed; how to get a table in a restaurant. Sounds interesting.At this point, I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Mr. Luntz sites brevity as an effective communication skill, yet he goes on and on and on with his examples and repeats himself throughout the book.He uses the book as a vehicle to promote his Republican platforms, which is boring and annoying.He is a little impressed with himself and is not afraid to share that with the reader. An especially distasteful example of this is his self-serving introduction about performing for Democrats and celebrities at Ariana Huffington's home.He tries to imitate Steven Levitt's style of writing but he's just not that interesting or cool."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Great little CD / Book and full of things that can help increase your vocabulary and help you in the world and not just the work place...I highly recommend this for all people."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Disappointing.

But read it with care.He says credibility is important yet he lies on every page and argues in favor of lying, as long as you can get away with it. His subtitle is \\"... it's what people hear.\\" Now I suppose he would claim that the phrase \\"death tax\\" is only a name and cannot be a lie, Yet when people hear \\"death tax\\" they surely hear \\"tax one's heirs must pay\\" and, indeed, the purpose of the phrase is to get them to think exactly that!In the section named \\"credibility is as important as philosophy\\" he repeats the lie about Gore inventing the internet with neither reference nor apology. There is no doubt that Luntz is a clever young man and is handy with words. He would have made a great insurance salesman. I am sorry that he did not settle for that."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"There are many layers to this book and after a first read it can be used as a reference guide of sorts for effective communication for corporations and political types.

The footnotes are often hilarious and could be a book by themselves given all the political scuttlebutt included.Too often we get caught up in what we believe we are communicating, rather than what the other party is hearing.

Or, perhaps if you'd like to be beaten over the head with the history of successful ad campaigns and are fascinated by trivial knowledge about TV jingles.

Perhaps George Orwell read a similar book before he wrote the famous ending to his work \\"1984.\\" Luntz advocates using words that are appealing to the audience. When you read how they were applied in political campaigns you can see how we end up with the contentious Congress that we have today. If you buy it, get a cheap used copy."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I almost didn't read this book after reading the Publishers Weekly review. After all, who wants to read a political tract? I finally decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. As I got further and further in I was very surprised to find that Luntz has written a balanced look at language and message delivery.He gives solid examples from his work, which is where the Republican subject matter comes in, but he also lays out criticism of fellow party members. He praises both Republican and Democrat politicians, using specific examples to demonstrate why they were effective in making their points and inspiring their audience.If the book is weighted toward the Right side of the spectrum, it's only by a 60/40 ratio. The one area that I found rigid was his defense of drug companies. But again, it's not his opinions that take center stage. It's the knowledge he passes on about crafting your message, whatever it is.I can only think that those reviewers who condemned the book on political grounds made up their mind before opening the book. This is clearly a book on communication. There's no Right Wing brainwashing to be found.As to the content, even if you lean to the Left the book is full of solid, usable information. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to know how to deliver a clear message, especially en masse (like corporate memos, press quotes, writing policy, advertising, PR, etc). It's an excellent book on communicating clearly when it's vital that you do so. You learn how, and why, what you say may not be what is heard. And that's why many politicians and companies have seen good intentions turn into their worst nightmare.It's too bad that Publishers Weekly assigned someone with knee-jerk political views to write this book's review. Usually they're a good gauge. Would they assign Rush Limbaugh to review James Carville's book on running a political campaign? That's a rhetorical question."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"This is probably a book for politicians but it can be used by anyone who is a communicator. I'm a writer, and checked the book out of the library and finally bought it. The book contains common sense and insight into how people think today.

I recommend this book, especially to ministers, teachers and writers."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"It's not what you say, it's what they hear - it's an insightful perspective, and Frank Luntz have done a great job of illustrating his point through numerous in examples in 'Words that Work'. Not surprisingly, a lot of people interpret 'rhetoric', and the entire process of positioning a concept as manipulative, but let's face it, all of us have our biases and because of that, the choice of words matters.Frank Luntz offers some great examples of how language affects our interpretation and reactions. Likewise, he also offers some good advice on 'words that work' - imagine, efficient, etc. My only complaint is the lack of generalization of the concepts beyond the political (left) examples from Frank's own experience.

If you focus your language to your audience you will have much more success and broader impact.I loved the way he presented his examples using corporate slogans and political speeches, it illustrated each point very well.He also talks at length about being a republican, and I'm a democrat, but he remembered his listener and presented his position based on facts, not on personal biases.I can't wait for the sequel to hear what he has to say about Obama and McCain and their languaging. It will be fun!!!"},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"The one word that came to mind as I tried to cull some knowledge from this work is 'puffery'.

His 10-rule, 10-word system proves the power of language.Disturbingly accurate examples show the impact and importance of language. What gets wired in us and why? What moves us emotionally? What makes us spend? What connects us? Words are ripples.Lutz reveals how we get so caught up in words that we fail to communicate. Consider leaders who speak in alphabet soup and spoil our language and understanding.Like fine embroidery, words follow design; and design is seen differently by everyone with eyes.Using case studies as examples, Luntz makes points about how passage of time affects words, how disordered words can cause dissension and how new words shade new meanings.Most of all, he states, what we say is who we are.

The book contains excellent stories about how changing the words we use can re-frame an entire conversation, and he also provides practical tips on how to use the right words to make your point clearly and effectively.Dr. Luntz also provides the \\"10 rules of successful communication:\\"1. Simplicity: Use small words. Avoid words that might force someone to reach for the dictionary, because most Americans won't.2. Brevity: Use short sentences. Be brief as possible. Never us a sentence when a phrase will do.3. Credibility Is as Important as Philosophy. People have to believe it to buy it. If your words lack sincerity or if they contradict accepted facts, circumstances or perceptions, they will lack impact.4. Consistency Matters. Repetition. Repetition. Repetition.5. Novelty: Offer something new. Words that work often involve a new definition of an old idea.6. Sound and Texture Matter. A string of words that have the same first letter, the same sound or the same syllabic cadence is more memorable than a random collection of sounds.7. Speak Aspirationally. The key to successful aspirational language is to personalize and humanize the message to trigger an emotional remembrance.8. Visualize. Paint a vivid picture.9. Ask a Question. A statement put in the form of a rhetorical question can have much greater impact than a plain assertion.10. Provide Context and Explain Relevance. You have to give people the \\"why\\" of a message before you tell them the \\"therefore\\" and the \\"so what.\\"Often the book comes from the advertising or political perspective, but there are great insights for all of us who have to communication, and persuade, and inspire.

I was really hoping to hear about words that work effectively in particular settings - the art of persuading or dissuading. No such luck here. I learned nothing new. For the clout Luntz has in the Republican Party he never took his audience behind the scenes or offered any strategies.I don't know who Luntz's target audience was. It appeared to reach out broadly to marketing and political majors but not toward people looking to use the gift of gab to influence. The lack of a defined target audience made this a very general read.Most of the political stories weren't very interesting. Luntz avoided giving many suggestions as to how he would have handled mishaps in his political discussions. It was captivating in the rare occurrences when he did. For example, the way he'd have handled the John Kerry, Swift Boat, situation was interesting but those details, opinions and insight were lacking throughout.The advertising/marketing stories are common place by now and things I already read in other books, magazines, newspapers, internet, or TV years ago.I think I or anyone else could have written this book.

Hey, Dr. Luntz you don't think I hear your Republican-Speak in your words? And, clearly, you violate your own Rule No. 3 (or No. 4 as you sometimes refer to it mistakenly in other parts of the book): Credibility. Your credibility was so lacking by the time I got to Chapter 10, I gave up on you before I could finish. From the very beginning, you needed some hard-love friends to advise you on marketing. First of all, the cover and the title give the appearance of this being more of a children's book. Secondly, are you a medical doctor? I think not, and for you to use the Dr. title simply tells me you are way too self absorbed. I no doubt believe you have probably made a fortune in your misleading ways, but so, too, did Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling. Really, Contract On America had much more lasting impression than Contract With America. Do you really not understand that? And do you not really understand that most Americans really understand that the 'Clear Skies Initiative, Energy Policy Act and No Child Left Behind' are simply part of the con of what is now being considered the worst administration of the century?

The irony is that he bases all his Orwellian newspeak on carefully skewed polls. Where's the \\"objectivity\\" in that? The key is in the subtitle of this book.

What you will find, instead, is something based on reality.One of the things that bothers me about \\"non-fiction\\" titles these days is most authors assume the book is their pulpit for pushing their personal (and usually irrational) political views. Even if those views have nothing whatsoever to do with the topic of the book, and even if their \\"supportive arguments\\" defy logic, they feel compelled to slip that stuff in. I've pointed out examples of this in some of my other reviews, and it is more the rule than the exception.When I came across this book, authored by a figure who works primarily in the political arena, my nonsense detector went on red alert. And it turned out to be a false alarm.Drawing on a wide base of facts and correctly applying logic, Dr. Luntz has produced a valuable work of nonfiction. The book sticks to the subject it promises to cover, and covers it well. Dr. Luntz also avoids engaging in pop psychology, which was another welcome relief. Instead, he presents his findings, provides intelligent explanations, and illustrates points with specific (and often well-known) examples.The book spends most of its time looking at why some messages get mangled and others don't. It provides general practices to help you clearly communicate your intended message. This information is timeless; it will be as valid a century from now as it is today. The book also contains some information that will eventually be outdated but is useful today. For example, Chapter 12 discusses twenty-one words and phrases that work. They work in the present time, based on present perceptions and current events.Some reviewers of this book deride Dr. Luntz as a \\"spin doctor.\\" Their use of that emotionally-charged term is classic manipulation--exactly what they accuse Dr. Luntz of. Their accusation is both false and irrelevant. This book isn't about spinning. It's about how to communicate clearly and not undermine your own message.Some reviewers of this book deride Dr. Luntz as a \\"right wing partisan.\\" As he has worked for leading Democrats, this accusation is, like the other one, without merit.A note about labelsThe \\"left\\" or \\"right\\" labels are normally misapplied. Ted Kennedy, for example, is allegedly a liberal. The truth is that he's a statist who misuses liberal ideas when they suit his statist agenda; he is not a person who serves liberal ideals. On the sliding scale between government control and personal freedom, his pointer is all the way at the bottom (government control).For most of America, neither the left nor the right offers much that they agree with. The practice of framing every political problem as left vs. right issue misses the reality that the real clash is between statism and personal freedom. Dr. Luntz didn't touch on this in his book, which is OK because--contrary to what some reviewers have said--it's not a political book. But since they put that on the table, let's take a moment to look at facts rather than emotionally-laden, misapplied labels.Government has grown with the speed and malignancy of cancer. In the USA, the federal government is now 185 times larger than it was 100 years ago. The geographic area of the USA is not 185 times larger than it was in 1907, when it had 46 states instead of today's 50. Nor is the USA population of 300 million 185 times more than its 1907 population of 87 million. Why, when in the private sector, advancements in productivity allow one person to do the job of tens or hundreds, does the federal government need hundreds of people to do the job of one?To see stupidity incarnate, look only to government. The flavor of stupidity, left or right, doesn't really matter. The question of whether an anchor chained to your left leg will drag you to ocean floor faster than one chained to your right leg is rather silly, when you think about it. And so are people who use left vs. right labels while ignoring statism--a classic \\"elephant in the living room\\" situation if there ever was one.Consequently, these silly critics of Dr. Luntz have, with their own words, discredited themselves. They could have avoided this self-defeating behavior by using the insights provided in Chapter 9.Some book detailsThe first chapter, as you might expect, lays out the ground rules. I have found this practice to be fairly consistent in \\"How To\\" books--the first chapter summarizes what you need to know. Then, the subsequent chapters expand on that to give you the understanding. Some authors will devote one chapter per point, with the first chapter serving essentially as a hefty outline of the book. Other authors will use the first chapter as a 'basis of understanding\\" so that the rest of the book makes sense, and they'll keep referring back to this or that principle. This second method is more or less the one Dr. Luntz chose.While the first chapter gives you a thumbnail strategy for effective communication, the second chapter reveals the other side of the coin: mistakes not to make. The next two chapters take this same front/back of the coin approach. We read about old words that have new meanings, then we read about how new words (that work) are created.The next two chapters repeat this approach. First, Dr. Luntz talks about how to \\"be the message\\" (choosing the words that reflect your identity) and then he addresses how people remember that message.In Chapters 7 and 8, we see this front/back approach once more. First, we read corporate case studies and then political case studies. Chapter 9 takes an interesting look at myths and realities regarding language and people, with both opinion and fact presented. The next chapter discusses Dr. Luntz' views on what people really care about and then he provides a chapter on personal language for personal scenarios.Overall, I found this to be a logical presentation on an important and useful topic. As many experts have noted, there's a huge problem with personal communication. It's especially bad in the USA and even worse in Canada. Yes, there are good communicators in both countries. But generally, people have adopted shrillness and histrionics in place of articulation. I've read several experts' theories on why this is so. I've also read several good books on how to communicate without the shrillness and histrionics. Dr. Luntz' books is one of those. Dr. Stephen R. Covey is perhaps the most noted author of such books.A theme that Dr. Luntz brings to the forefront and then refers to repeatedly, is stated in his subtitle. \\"It's not what you say, it's what people hear.\\"An example of how this theme works is this. Suppose you have a problem with another person. If you start out by inflicting some insult on that person, your message is likely to consist only of the insult. The rest of it is lost. But if you take the approach that you share a common problem and a solution can benefit both of you, then the other person hears what you're saying about the content. That's not spin. That's treating people with respect. And this is what Dr. Luntz' book is really about.Why you need this bookIf you want to read a book that is helpful, informative, and interesting, then you should pick up a copy of Words That Work. Take the time to think through the concepts being presented, examine the corporate and political case studies, and review your own daily communication patterns. You'll be glad you did.If you've been reading and applying Stephen R. Covey's principles, especially \\"seek first to understand,\\" you will find this book a valuable addition to your collection. If you've never read any books in this genre, Words That Work is just as good as any to start with."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I had never heard of Dr. Luntz prior to reading this book. And I admit, I was initially hesitant about buying it because in leafing through it, it did seem to come with a political bias, one I don't share with the author. There are also occassional \\"pat-myself-on-the-back\\" moments that bugged me a little.Still, for anyone who writes, anyone who wants to communicate a persuasive message, be it political or commerical, this book offers some great information.Much of it is information already known to many copywriters, particularly direct marketing writers. In fact, if this book has tweaked your interest in the craft of persuasive writing, let me suggest you look into any of a number of books by Robert \\"Bob\\" Bly on the subject of copywriting and marketing, as well as \\"Breakthrough Advertising,\\" by Eugene Scwhartz, \\"Ogilvy on Advertising,\\" by David Oglivy and a whole host of others you'll find by searching the word \\"copywriting\\" in Amazon.But, back to the book...As noted, particularly in the occasional screed review you'll find here by those who dislike the author, the author has done a considerable amount of work for the Republican party. Even if you happen to be a Democrat (which I am), or are left leaning, Dr. Luntz knows his stuff.His opening chapter, \\"The Ten Rules of Effective Language,\\" is dead on and worth the price of the book. Reading it, I'd swear I was reading a work by a top copywriter or marketing executive explaining how language can be used to influence people. I think this chapter is so good, that I plan to re-read it several times, and also suggest in severla blogs I write that others do the same.Oddly, I found one of the final chapters, \\"Twenty-one Words and Phrases for the Twenty-first Century,\\" to be a little less compelling. I don't know if a few of his choices will necessarily stand the \\"test of time,\\" as he believes, but the majority are powerful words and phrases that I'm sure will be used throughout my lifetime, although admittedly at best that might only get them to the mid-century mark. I think perhaps he should have cut his list down a little more before finalizing this chapter.I enjoyed his chapters on case studies, but wish he would have expanded upon them more. Then again, the average reader probably isn't interested in a \\"blow-by-blow\\" recounting of the case studies, as I am.And Dr. Luntz does drive home the point of the subtitle-- \\"It's not what you say, it's what people hear.\\" Who among us hasn't said something and then had it completely misinterpreted by others?On the issue of whether or not the book has a political bent, I think Dr. Luntz does strive to avoid showing a bias, but the fact that much of his work has been done on behalf of conservatives and Republicans does make it appear that his politics are definitely right-leaning. Even so, any real or alleged political bias in the book should be overlooked, the information you'll find in reading this is too valuable to let political viewpoints stand in the way of reading it.Besides, Dr. Luntz has occassionally advised Democrats and liberals, it's just most of his notable work has been on the Republican side of the aisle. Does this make him a mercenary? I'd say not. Despite the fact that his political views probably are more Republican than Democrat, Dr. Luntz isn't a Karl Rove type out to shape American into his vision of what it should be. When you get right down to it, he's just a guy making a buck for a talent he has that is in short supply.I hate to use a cliched phrase like \\"an important work,\\" but this is an important work on the power and influence of language and words. Anyone with an interest in politics or marketing needs to read it and take its lessons to heart."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Luntz is the Republican wordster behind substituting \\"Death tax\\" for \\"Estate tax,\\" thereby obscuring the enormously lopsided benefit behind proposals to repeal the estate tax that only impacts those with quite large estates. Another Luntz \\"contribution\\" is \\"strengthening Social Security\\" as a label for President Bush's proposal to nearly dismantle it.Realistically, however, if Luntz didn't do it, someone else probably would, so his \\"Words that Work\\" at least offers everyone the same thought processes. In addition, he has helped Democrats from time to time, including Harold Ford's Democratic Convention keynote address.Luntz's basic premise is that Lincoln-Douglas type debates/arguments no longer work (if they ever did) - a logic that doesn't say much for the American public, but one has to work with reality. (Luntz, however, is no \\"dummy\\" - he has a PhD from Oxford, and lots and lots of experience.) \\"It's not what you say, it's what people hear\\" is his operative principle, implemented through ten rules.1)Simplicity - use small words. 2)Brevity - use short sentences. 3)Credibility is as important as philosophy - don't over-reach, break promises (Bush I's \\"Read my lips, . . .\\"), or flip-flop (Kerry). 4)Consistency matters - keep repeating the same message (and don't run off with different messages of the day). 5)Novelty - offer something new. 6)Sound and texture matter. 7)Speak aspirationally, present the \\"you\\" that you will be when you use the product (elect the candidate). 8)Visualize - paint a vivid picture. 9)Ask a question - eg. \\"Are you better off today than four years ago,?\\" or \\"Where do you want to go today,?\\" or What would you do if you were in my shoes?\\" when (complaining). 10)Provide context and relevance - credibility has to be established first; relevance may require market research to determine what drives the decision-makers, and may first require citizen education. Luntz also points out that males and females respond differently to eg. sports metaphors, negativity, logic, etc., and women greatly prefer a listener vs. one with all the correct answers (hence, Hillary Clinton's \\"listening tour\\" at the beginning of her run for the Senate).Research-based suggested words include \\"imagine,\\" \\"hassle-free,\\" \\"lifestyle,\\" \\"accountability,\\" \\"results\\" and the \\"can-do spirit,\\" \\"innovation,\\" \\"renew, revitalize, rejuvenate, restore, rekindle, reinvent,\\" \\"efficient\\" and \\"efficiency,\\" \\"the right to . . .,\\" \\"patient-centered,\\" \\"investment,\\" \\"casual elegance,\\" \\"independent,\\" \\"peace of mind,\\" \\"certified,\\" \\"All-American,\\" \\"prosperity, \\"spirituality,\\" \\"financial security,\\" \\"principles,\\" \\"opportunity\\"(more than \\"fairness\\" or \\"ownership\\"), \\"community,\\" \\"convenience,\\" \\"value from government,\\" \\"respect,\\" \\"the future,\\" \\"Main Street, not Wall Street,\\" \\"getting value from government,\\" and \\"balanced approach.\\"Finally, Luntz gives a rough overview of focus groups vs. speed-dial groups, why he greatly prefers the latter, and some of the pitfalls of the former."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I have a theory about people who rate products with one star--they are basically clueless whiners. So, when I read the one star reviews of Luntz's book, my first thought was that these were just some pedantic elites with sunburns on the inside of their nostrils. I'm going to have to change my theory because they were right.Most of the main ideas are fairly common knowledge. I thought Luntz would get into more of the psychology of his work, but he drones on with example after example after example. Frank, we got the point after the first example.Click on the Table of Contents, read that, and you will save yourself a few bucks."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"While the author may have a rather queer take on how to apply american language and use it to influence the public, I relish his concentration on the value of language. In addition, too many Americans are focused on what he says rather than HOW he says it. After 6 years of government which lacks any apparent command of our language, I welcome the idea that we should all (especially our leadership) should have a greater command English - at the very least, American English, but more hopefully, a second or third laguage, in addition.It thrills me to hear such a debate on NPR with T.G. and have that extra insight to this topic because ....I have been associated with far too many Americans/Brits/Aussies who have such a dismal command of English (let alone any other language) that I wonder where my/our tax money is going and what my countrymen&women; are doing when they should be learning how to simply communicate. Clear language can take many forms, from pure journalism to propaganda but it is in itself, one of the most immediate and refreshing indicators of modern society.This author simply explains how we react to the language that we hear and explores how we can try to be more clear when we speak or write - regardless of an individual's political views or intentions, language is the base, the foundation of how WE ALL think and live and relate to each other.If not for language, you wouldn't be opposed to the author, and I would have no idea that we hold opposing views - on anything. Language is able to be perverted and manipulated but that doesn't mean that the listener has to be. If one also has a command of the tool, one can also distill it to its core.This will be the next book on my shelf whether I like it or not."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Frank Luntz is a neocon (Google PNAC to find out more) wordsmith for the Republican Party, who offers us, the American people, a look at ourselves. And it ain't pretty. Luntz says that a catchy phrase is more important than principles. He writes that well done propaganda, euphemisms, and telling people what they want to hear are the words that work on us. We don't even know, much less truly care about the fundamental issues and difference between products, people and politicians. Luntz says that most Americans are not well educated, they don't read much, and they don't even know where the candidates stand on most issues. As ugly as it is, he's probably right. He has spent most of his professional career interviewing people, conducting focus meetings and so on, and if anyone knows the American people, it would be him. For me, this was an eye opener that explains why, when I tried to have a rational discussion on politics, it often degenerated to an exchange of propaganda slogans. He's a big fan of George Orwell, and is a master manipulator such as found in the Orwellian \\"Big Brother\\". I would recommend everyone read this, and also the parts of Mein Kampf, (Hitler) which also deal with propaganda, as well as some Russian history. It also helps to explain many previously inexplicable things, such as the effectiveness of \\"If the glove doesn't fit, you can't convict.\\" This was a perfect example of the Luntz technique at work. Irrelevant to the OJ trial, it was very catchy and effectively blocked out a freight train full of other more relevant evidence. Johnny Cochran and Luntz are both masters of manipulation, and Luntz explains how and why this stuff works. So my recommendation is this: Put on a pair of rubber gloves, take some anti-nausea pills, and give it a read."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I am a skilled writer of advocacy articles and I hoped that this book would provide perspectives and insights to improve those skills. Failing that, I hoped to find something that I could recommend - in whole or in part - to those I mentor. This book failed miserably in both regards. The negative review by Publisher's Weekly (under Editorial Reviews above) is much too kind.The advice on how to select words that have the desired impact falls short of what I routinely get when colleagues give me quick informal comments on what I have written (and vice versa) and far short of what is provided by in-house technical editors.Much of this book is spent cataloging \\"golden oldies\\" - a collection of some of the most famous and effective advertising slogans. However, he provides only a simple recounting of these slogans and negligible explanation or insight into how they came about. I found the writing to be rambling and uninteresting. \\"Younger readers\\" (under 40) may have problems relating to many of these examples because too many are from before their time. Paradoxically, the author warns about this very problem in the middle of this enumeration.The author's background as a pollster is highlighted in the blurbs for the book, with the implication that it had a major role in the book. WRONG. You will read a few minor, irrelevant comments meant to be entertaining. Nothing new if you have participated in a couple of focus groups, or even if you have seen a TV episode that had a focus group as part of the plot (For those who equate credibility with being on Fox, see \\"Grift of the Magi\\", episode 9 of season 11 of \\"The Simpsons\\"). Snide asides aside, the coverage really is that slight.To understand how completely the author has refused to adapt his presentation to the more general audience, ask yourself about your reaction to the advice to use the term \\"electronic surveillance\\" instead of \\"eavesdropping\\" or \\"wiretapping\\". (1) Is which of these terms to use ever an issue for you? (2) Am I so old and set in my ways that I am still using the latter terms even though they were superseded -- on technical and other grounds -- more than two decades ago? Do I need advice to use \\"automobile\\" instead of \\"horse-less carriage\\"?As the book wore on, the author increasingly undercut his credibility. For example, he encourages using the word \\"solution\\" to describe commercial products (page 227). This advice would have been useful a decade or two ago, but \\"solution\\" is now so overused that is part of the standard boilerplate in a marketing/sales presentation. The current reaction to this word is \\"Can we skip past this cr*p and get to the real content?\\".In the author's advice about talking your way out of a traffic ticket or onto an airplane, my focus would have been on understanding the mindset and motivation of the audience (the police office or gate attendant), with the exact examples as a tease. The author gets it backwards: The mindset was presented as explanatory background. With the highly predictable negative reaction from readers, this is yet another nail in the coffin for the credibility of the author's expertise.In discussing the myth that Americans are well-educated (page 184), his standard for a proper college education is one that is centered on reading the classics in their original Greek and Latin (although it is unclear whether this is his bias or the bias of his typical client). This raised serious doubts about his current expertise - It is not uncommon for the head of a consulting company to become so focused on the clients (contacts and sales) that he adopts their biases and self-deceptions, losing touch with his firm's expertise.The author spends a full chapter discussing the recall of California Governor Grey Davis, but that account bears no resemblance to what I observed. I have absolutely no recollection of any of the slogans and phrases that he claims won the election. And it is in direct conflict with the reasons given by the many Democrats (a near majority) who voted to remove Davis. Additionally, if the author was correct about the power of the given phrasings of the issues, Tom McClintock (a far-right ideologue and the favored candidate of the party) would now be governor, not Schwarzenegger.Throughout the book, I had a gnawing impression that the author was overly full of himself. This culminated when he would have the reader believe that he was responsible for John McCain's use of the phrase \\"straight talk\\" (in 2000). He states \\"But John McCain was not the first person to use the phrase 'Straight Talk.' When I was a student ... in 1983, I wrote a newspaper column ... called 'Straight Talk.' ...\\" If the author is oblivious to the long history of this phrase in politics and everyday life, it is unwise to give any credence to his (very limited) discussion of other political slogans and phrases.His political philosophy is so intrusive that it undermined much of what he says. As evidenced by other reviews here, the reader projects the deception / manipulation espoused in the examples onto the author. Why would a pollster pick so many examples involving issues where he is on the other side from the majority of the American people (and hence the likely audience)? Why not pick neutral, everyday examples where the likely audience would see the author in a positive light? Why not focus on examples where the author's contribution was bringing clarity (reducing confusion) to an issue?The book is a failure judging it by its own 11 rules for effective communication.- \\"Speak aspirationally\\" (7) - The political examples are heavily skewed toward manipulation and deception, not the effective communication of what one believes. So unless the target audience of this book is people who aspire to be better liars ...- \\"Consistency matters\\" (4) - This book is advertised as addressing effective communication but because of the skewed selection of examples, much of the audience sees it as being about manipulation and rejects it (the book fails the \\"authenticity\\" test). It is illuminating that many of the book's defenders have failed to grasp this key concept - they aren't able to recognize that various negative reviews are complaints about such violations.- \\"Provide context and explain relevance\\" (10) - sorely lacking (see above).- \\"Sound and texture matter\\" (6) - I cannot remember one instance where I thought \\"nicely phrased\\" but I do remember plenty of passages where I thought the opposite.- \\"Novelty\\" (5)- Although the rules themselves are very old, there is plenty of room for novelty by updating examples and perspectives. But this book made me, and many other reviewers, long for the previous works.- \\"Credibility is as important as philosophy\\" (3) - The author is so focused on his politics (philosophy) that he uses examples that detract (and distract) from his points, rather than reinforcing them.- \\"Visualize\\" (8), \\"Visual imagery matters\\" (11), \\"Ask a question\\" (9) - If these techniques were used in this book (as opposed to being explained), they were so ineffective that I don't remember them.- Of the two remaining (\\"Small words\\", \\"Short sentences\\"), I wasn't paying close enough attention to judge.Summary: If you are over 50, with no experience in politics or persuasive writing, have not watched political coverage on TV (where these phrases have been much covered over the years), and are considering becoming a Republican political operative, you may want to borrow this book from your public library.To the critics of this review (inevitable, based upon what occurred with other reviews here):1. A topic area being important does NOT translate into a particular book written on that topic as being important, good, or even worth reading.2. An author having expertise on a topic canNOT be equated to his having - or being able to - write a good book on the topic.3. That a consulting firm is highly paid canNOT be equated to its having expertise on the topic. A significant portion of the consulting industry sells reputation, not expertise - they are hired to recommend what the client has already decided to do (hence terms like \\"CYA consultants\\")."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Having heard an interview on NPR with Dr. Luntz, I was intrigued by the idea of a wordsmith using the schemas that envelope language to produce an expected and desired outcome from readers or listeners.I will outline a few of discussions that piqued my interest:* About half-way through the book, the chapter on Corporate Case Studies did a reasonable job of explaining why the understanding of one word or phrase produced a more positive effect than another.* The discussion about developing the language for the \\"Contract with America\\" was very interesting.* A quote from Ronald Reagan's farewell address to America illuminated how closely meanings may be tied to history, and therefore, how a lack of history skews the way in which information is perceived and processed.* Near the end of the book, Luntz's chapter about the 21 words and phrases for the 21st century was an interesting linguistic study of how meanings are derived from common words.Unfortunately, I felt that much of the first third of the book was aimed directly at the marketing aspects of language. I suppose I should have anticipated this in a book titled Words that Work. However, I was hoping for a more in-depth linguistic discussion and discovery about how and why words work as they do. The discussion about the words \\"gambling\\" vs. \\"gaming\\" was quite successful, but there wasn't enough of this level of comparison.Luntz's political biases were apparent in his discussion of the Republican platform of \\"Healthy Forest\\" vs. the Democratic environmental argument for leaving forest detritus in tact, which may increase the risk of forest fire but also increases the natural diversity of plant life and soil conditions necessary for a healthy forest. While \\"healthy forest\\" is certainly a linguistically positive phrase, the reality of the practices proposed by this campaign are anything but healthy for forests.I wonder what words Luntz might use to tackle this more complicated scenario of forest diversity.Luntz's championing of the term \\"retirement security\\" demonstrates his belief that the majority of the voting public is happily involved with managing their IRA's, 401(k)'s, and private pension plans. But this very debate is centered around the protection of the admittedly 25% of Americans who do not have such luxury and must rely solely on the traditional social security pensions that are now in danger. A more interesting presentation of \\"words that work\\" might have involved repairing the \\"words that don't work\\" for Democrats into words that would work to achieve the goal of protecting 25% of America's less fortunates.It be interesting to see how Luntz might explain how Exxon Mobile has recovered from the disaster of the Valdez spill to become one of the most outrageously profitable companies in the country.Overall, the book has moments of entertaining prose and provocative ideas. It is well organized and easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"An interesting and informative read. The author makes his living by putting a positive spin on words and phrases that influence public opinion. He and his market research company have largely served the national Republican leadership and other corporate clients.He gives examples of words that work and those that don't. However, his concern is strictly with winning with words, and not about the consequences of putting in power those who may or may not be concerned with the common good or the public interest. This fact makes it imperative for voters to search for alternative and independent sources of information, and not rely on mainstream media to get the \\"facts\\".George Lakoff's \\"Don't Think of an Elephant\\" should also be read to put this author's work in a larger political context."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Progressives should learn to use the techniques that Luntz describes in this book.

The blurb claims that this text \\"raises the curtain on the craft of effective language.\\" Yet this is not a book about effective language; rather it is about manipulation. It's not about getting your message across; it's about getting people to agree to a message that has been tailored to elicit that agreement, whatever its real content might turn out to be.If I'm wrong about this, then the author is by no means in control of his own message.

Mr Luntz has loaded this tome with lots of pointless trivia. There is a table of jargon along with their meanings. Did you know that \\"bling\\" means bright , flashy jewelry? Or how about this brilliant insight,\\"What's particularly striking about the new language is that it is coming not from the older elites of society who live in wealthy suburban neighborhoods but from the hip-hop youth culture found in America's urban areas.\\" You will not be sharing these insights at your wealthy suburban tea parties or with your hip-hop, bling encrusted pals either."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"For those of us who regularly practice sound hermeneutics (science and art of interpretation)for sound homiletics (good speaking or preaching), this book is a good resource for improved public communication. While Luntz experiences are impressive he seems to lack a personal understanding of true leadership (it's not self serving) --failing to realize the ultimate determinant for long-term buy-in (credibility vs. gradiloquence). He also seems to slight the importance of relentlessly understanding the morphology of words ---especially in a 2.0 culture. It's all about context --not just audience adaptation --but the skilled practice of cultural exegesis. The principles of linguistics in this book are timeless and will retain value, but I fear that the bulk of this material will be outdated in just 3-5 years. Luntz is also a bit wordy (pun intended) -it could have been well written with half the words if his audience was better researched."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Frank Luntz is a master at communication without stooping to manipulation. Clearly an excellent tool for any communicator."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Aside from the personal anecdotes, there is little in this book that is original or frankly (no pun), all that helpful.For example, most of the points he includes in his chapter \\"Ten Rules of Effective Language,\\" are far more effectively (and wittily) presented in the old standby Strunk and White and like writing manuals.Most of the rest of this stuff can be picked up in your average self-help book or a marketing manual.And yes, I've heard Luntz on radio and seen him on TV. He comes across every bit as disingenuously as he does in writing."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I'm about half way through this book - there's no way I can finish it. I feel like perhaps I should continue reading so I can know more about how I'm being manipulated, but he's crossing a line here. He basically tells his readers it's ok to tell people what they want (or need) to hear even though that may not fully communicate your true intent. When you use words to get people's attention and connect at an emotional level, but also dilute your true intent, how is this not lying? The author is essentially teaching people how to better lie and manipulate. We expect this in advertising and marketing, but when did it become ok for people to obfuscate to the point of lying in our business communications? If you want an example of a company that used these tactics well (both internally and externally) look no further than ENRON. This is exactly what the people at the very top did to get get all their employees and investors to believe and support them.While this book does have information on how to communicate more effectively, the author is unabashed in his recommendation that people manipulate each other with language. He is also preaching a political position a fair amount of the time. I suppose I can't blame the guy for writing this book - he's clearly very good at what he does. I'm disappointed that some so willingly embrace this as an acceptable way to communicate."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"The purpose of language is to communicate. Communication is made up of ideas. If you are communicating your ideas and you care so little about them and or have so shallow an understanding of them that you do not care to use language that has the best chance of pressing your ideas successfully do not bother reading this book.I find it amusing that the very people who hate this book and its ideas the most are no doubt rabid evolutionist who believe in Darwin's survival of the fittest. For humanity ideas are the tooth and claw of evolution. These people will fall to the wayside in the evolution of ideas because they are afraid to use the tools provided them to guarantee their philosophies win the day. Thank goodness the left is not intelligent enough to take advantage of the great intellects and superior minds they are all convinced they posses.I am laughing as I write this simply because the liberal left is so ridiculous. Thank goodness they are not intelligent enough to see the truth of what Luntz is trying to tell them. Their response is predictably emotional. I am sure they will be weeping all the way to the Darwinian graveyard as more conservative philosophies tear them figuratively to pieces.Politics sure would be more interesting if the opposition was more competent. Of course I am not a Republican so..."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Absolutely enjoyable, legible, funny, insightful. I am a student of communication, and this book is a must read!!!!Dr. Luntz KNOWS what he is talking about!!!"},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"If you have seen Frank Luntz doing his dial-focus-groups on the TV, you understand that he is brilliant at understanding how things are said matters to people. This book has been very successful because it delivers very good information on how the broad population hears (and reads) the words used by politicians and businesses to deliver their message.Part of the problem in understanding what Luntz is talking about is that most of us think we know the average Joe because we think of everyone we know and think that is a good sample. It never is. Everyone we know put together is too narrow a sample because each of us only knows a certain range of people that are more like ourselves than they are wildly different. And wildly different exists in vast numbers. It takes some skill and research to understand what that broad range of people hear when certain phrases and words are used.That is the topic of this book: what works when you are talking to everyone. It isn't about crafting deceptive messages or how to trick people into believing something you don't mean. Luntz is clear that insincere messages break down very quickly under the scrutiny of the public eye. However, you can couch the same message in different ways and some will clearly work better than others.One of the many great stories he tells in the book is about a presentation he did for the United States Senate. He showed a film of the same exact speech delivered by four different senators. It turns out that the dial response went up consistently when certain phrases were used regardless of the polish or lack of polish used in delivering the words. It is a very impressive story and message.This is a very interesting book and can help everyone understand not only how to put messages together that will appeal to the general public, but how to better understand your audience when speaking to a part of the populace. And for those of us on the receiving end of those messages, it will help us better understand what these guys and gals are trying to do in their messages. We will be better able to see behind the curtain in Oz.Excellent!"},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"This book was actually in the business section of the book store, which will surprise many if all they know about it is the political persuasion of the author. However, there is just as much here for the business and marketing type as a political enthusiast. For those who write shrill but predictable comments that never get past the politics, you really are missing the boat. I held my nose while putting up with Carville and Begalia's politics in their book (Buck up, suck up, and come back when you foul up), but they still taught me a thing or two and I'm glad I bought it. This book is along the same lines, but specifically geared towards the words themselves instead of political techniques.The one part of the book which made me roll my eyes and groan was the block \\"keeping up with the language\\" on p.70. I will never NEVER refer to a used car a \\"pre-owned vehicle.\\" Seriously, cut the [...] already - I don't care if it makes me old fashioned, but this term is so intellectually dishonest. \\"Hey, Bob - wanna buy my pre-owned pickup truck?\\" Nobody will ever do that but car dealers, and nobody trusts them anyway.There are other PC terms put into the \\"Is Now\\" column of the chart. It's a source of frustration - reasonable people don't get to vote on this ever-changing list, Instead people like the author and others in the media and marketing business promote the lunacy till we believe it. \\"Undocumented immigrants\\" instead of \\"illegal aliens\\" is another example. So, what next? I used to be a drug dealer but now I'm an undocumented pharmacist???Also, in other parts of the planet not infested by the left wing language police, some terms like stewardess are not epithets, but perfectly acceptable. The author disappointingly didn't make note of the PC baggage we Americans tend to bring with us to non-American audiences. For example, you can't go to Europe and refer to black people living there as African Americans without looking like a complete idiot. Even if you did adjust the term and call them African Europeans, well first, they don't refer to themselves as such, and second, that term would include Europeans of Moroccan descent. It could get confusing trying to be PC in front of a crowd where the standards are different.Keep in mind that Words that Work might have to be modified for use outside the continent.Overall though, very recommended."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I find the negative reviews of this book astounding. Frank Luntz is teaching all of us how to use our words in order to command respect, and get attention. Why is this book considered pandering to \\"the right\\"? You do not have to register as a Republican to gain insight into the techniques Mr. Luntz teaches. However, this is typical of the far left, who attack, and try to silence anyone who speaks from the right. I find the lack of tolerance for free speech ironic. Why not just read the book, take the information Mr. Luntz provides to improve your communications ability, and stop with the defamation of character. It is tiring, and the review pages of Amazon should be used to review books, and not do character asasinations.I found this book interesting, informative and a great tool."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I bought this out of curiosity. I have seen Frank Luntz dozens of times on TV, especially after a debate, where he has his own polling group which he uses to rate the debate and how the candidates did based on their responses to questions asked and their interactions with other candidates.Frank Luntz is able to draw incredible results based on what people say. That's because, as he tells us repeatedly in this book, \\"It's not what you say, but what people hear.\\"I think the most beneficial aspect of the book is the chapter on The Ten Rules of Effective Language. It encourage things like simplicity and using small words, even short sentences for that matter. This makes a lot of sense. We have all sat through things that were not understandable. Our vocabulary can hardly impress anyone if they have no idea of what we are talking about. Additionally, he shows us the impact of reinforcing our words with something visual or imagery that can play on one's imagination.He tells us about words we like to hear and those we don't--those that have a favorable impact and those that don't. There are phrases also which have negative consequences with the hearer like \\"drilling for oil\\" where \\"energy exploration\\" evokes a much more positive response. Something like \\"estate tax\\" can be a hot button, where saying \\"death tax\\" can be more effective.Luntz tends to be very repetitive, using many of the same examples over and over and bringing up the same point in multiple chapters. I found that ineffective. I will give him the benefit of the doubt, though. Possibly he is using the same technique he stresses about using the same words or phrases over and over; making sure that our audience gets the point and knows what we're all about.I do not think this book is for everyone. Unless a person spends a great deal of time in front of the public and being recorded, I don't think this book is an essential read. Nonetheless, Luntz can help each of us to communicate more effectively. This can only help in our day to day dealings with others like with family members, at home, at work, with our friends, etc. If nothing else he can make us aware of things that matter and things that don't when we are talking, especially when we want to make a point."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Frank Luntz is a communication strategist for corporate and political clients. Although he's done a lot of work for Republicans (including the Contract with America) this is not a book about political ideology. It's about persuasive communication in political campaigns, product marketing, and labor disputes.Words that work do not happen by chance. Luntz uses market research techniques (polls, focus groups, dial sessions) to test how audiences respond.Examples of words that work are:Public safety (instead of fighting crime)Exploring for energy (instead of drilling for oil)Gaming (instead of gambling)Numerous insights are shared. For example: Americans are neither well educated nor do they know the substance behind the issues. Therefore image matters more than policy, and complex messages usually fail.Ten rules for effective communication are explained in the first chapter: simplicity, brevity, credibility, consistency, novelty, sound, aspiration, visualization, questioning, and context."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"This is an absolutely FANTASTIC book on communication in politics, media, and advertising. It gave me a more acute awareness of the subtle manipulations of the messages we are incessantly bombarded with and explains why AND how politicians and news reports choose their words cautiously in order to engender a specific and favorable feeling within the audience. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to \\"news junkies\\" and those interested in mass communication and/or politics."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"The author resents accusations that his language hides and distorts meaning. \\"I do not believe there is something dishonorable about presenting a passionately held proposition in the most favorable light, while avoiding the self-sabotage of clumsy phrasing and dubious delivery.\\" He then outlines his ten rules for effective language (Simplicity, Brevity, Credibility, Consistency, Novelty, Sound, Aspiration, Visualization, Asking Questions and Context / Relevance) and spends the rest of the book illustrating their use. Frank Luntz's book makes a good case that these rules are effective.Several topics are worth reading closely. Luntz describes the \\"dial session\\" focus group methods he has devised to elicit and test snippets of effective language. He lays out the linguistic techniques he used to make the Republican \\"Contract with America\\" so appealing to voters. Chapter 9 debunks language-related myths the author's research has uncovered. These myths include that Americans are well educated, read a lot, and are generally happy. The truth corresponding to each myth has implications for choosing effective political and advertising language.Frank Luntz's in-your-face style comes through in his stories--particularly the ones that end with him being thrown out of yet another client meeting. For readers who may be uncomfortable with this style, I'll suggest a brief test. The political and business arenas that contribute the bulk of his examples are far from most readers' experience. But Chapter 11, \\"Personal Language for Personal Scenarios,\\" is different. It recommends the best language for apologizing, requesting a raise, avoiding a traffic ticket, and other everyday situations. This ten-page chapter is a quick read. You can easily finish it while sitting in one of those comfortable chairs at Borders. If you find value in this chapter, consider reading the rest of the book. If it puts you off, leave the book there on the floor next to the chair.Readers troubled by Luntz's conservative perspective may want to counterbalance with George Lakoff's book (Moral Politics : How Liberals and Conservatives Think) on the different metaphors that underlie conservative and progressive thinking. (\\"Progressive\\" is Lakoff's own Luntzian rehabilitation of the word \\"liberal.\\") Like Luntz, Lakoff uses examples and principles from his professional experience and political beliefs. Both authors are worth reading for what they say about effective use of language. We can learn from them whether we agree with their politics or not."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I had very high hopes for this book, thinking that it would provide clear examples of how to be more effective in personal and business communication - for example, explaining that \\"you need to\\" are the three least effective words in the English Language (vs. the power of \\"will you please?\\"). Or, perhaps the impact of using the word \\"because\\" to get things done. But, alas, this book is more oriented toward politicians, and when it covers the corporate world, it is more targeted at marketing communications (slogans, taglines, advertising). There is one section about personal communication, but I found it relatively shallow.That being said, there are a couple of excellent chapters and the book is an interesting read, especially if you are interested in politics (as Dr. Luntz was a primary author of the \\"Contract With America\\" that swept the Republicans into Congress in 1994). And the author shows he has learned his own lessons with the excellent subtitle: \\"It's not what you say, it's what people hear\\". On the other hand, the tone can be somewhat self-serving at times.Recommended for people in marketing, politics, and those interested in language (although there are probably better choices for that group)."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"This book's readability says a lot about the power of author Frank Luntz's advice on communicating. The text flows, usually matching actions with concepts. For instance, Luntz repeats how important it is to repeat your message. He uses simple language to illustrate the importance of simple language, and so on. What's more, the book is entertaining. Luntz has been involved in major media campaigns with key American products and politicians, and his story about demonstrating an important principle to the Senate is hypnotic. The caveat is that such stories sometimes seem boastful and end up being off-putting when they are clearly meant to be engaging. That grain of salt aside, we recommend this extremely useful book to those who want to improve their communication skills. The book is directed toward Americans, though it debunks myths about them for the entertainment and edification of everyone else. Some of the book's principles are familiar, but so deeply fundamental that they are worth repeating - which is actually Luntz's fourth rule of effective language use. Say it right, and then say it again."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Like Roger Ailes book You are the Message years ago this Republican writes about communication in about as non-partisan way as he could. Luntz is a good communicator. Every key idea is repeated enough for the fast and sometimes uncareful reader to still get all the main points. His chapter on words that work in personal life was not very strong. But if you are like most of the readers of this book you buy it because of the public discourse and its weaknesses for personal words that work will be only a minor distraction."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"This is a phenomenal book.

He's at his weakest when he is over-inflating his role in political history (he takes credit for much of what has gone right for Republicans from 1994 on, and even, oddly, for naming McCain's \\"Straight Talk Express\\" bus). Such overreaches detract from the overall strength of his argument, that word selection is highly important to persuasion. He also tends to use too many examples, and his writing is not as structured logically as one would like for easy reading. BUT, having said that, it's still an interesting book that teaches you how to wordsmith at a very high level. His discussions of changing demographics in America clearly have validity and data backing their conclusions. It's well worth a read if you are politically-minded or marketing-minded."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"Frank Luntz provides insight in to why we shouldn't use certain words that we are accustomed to using and offers word choices that convey the same message but help it to be better received."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I am 3/4 through this book, and I have written all over it, dog-nosed pages, and added a notepad of notes to it.A great book that really helps you refine your ability to message a candidate or product.I am buying several copies for friends."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I must confess that I had never heard of Dr. Frank Luntz until I sat through his presentation at a large conference. In a word, he was excellent, even electric, as he roamed through the large audience, speaking without notes, and engaging each person along the way. His message was clear - focus more on the message you need your audience to hear - and how you can be understood, and less on oratorio, lofty rhetoric and messages that can be easily missed or misunderstood.Good message. Luntz is clearly someone who follows his own advice. And, if his subliminal message to the attendees was, \\"If you are enjoying this, buy my book ...\\", he clearly succeeded with me - I ordered it during the conference.Here is a bit of criticism. Hearing Luntz talking about identifying the appropriate words that work is more enjoyable than reading about it. But, it's not that his writing style is bad - it's just that he is so strong verbally that I think I held him to a higher standard. Actually, he imbeds humor, questions and \\"conversations\\" with the reader that make the pages flow. And, a lot of good old common sense too. Had I not seen him in action, I would not have made this observation.I know there is some question between the difference between words that communicate vs. words that manipulate. There is a definite fine line here, particularly within the political arena, of which much of this book is devoted. Still, one earlier reviewer ascribed this to the more broadly defined \\"words that persuade,\\" and I think this is fair.Beyond all the stories, case studies and personal experiences involving products and products (the majority of the book), however, there is a primer in communication skill development for the reader. He tells readers which words work within their daily lives, be they needed to avoid a speeding ticket, negotiate with a spouse, or make the big presentation to the boss (followed by a forward looking request for a raise). In other words, I found that Luntz' book was much more than \\"words that work,\\" it was about helping perceptive readers to become \\"people that work [more effectively, productively, successfully].\\"Let me end by asking interested readers how they might approach their next big presentation. After reading this book, they are far more likely to begin with, \\"Imagine a working environment in which everyone spoke so simply, so clearly, so credibly, so consistently, so aspirationally,\\" that everyone knew what they were supposed to do, and why and when ...\\"Much more powerful.This book reflects the popular culture.

As a right leaning Democrat, I expected Words... to be the typical, \\"club'em in the head until they agree, diatribe;\\" surprisingly, it wasn't. The general theme of the book borrows from the old adage, \\"It's not what you say, but how you say it.\\" A genuine word coach; albeit, a bit wordy, Dr. Frank Luntz teaches both politicians and corporate execs to consider the listener when crafting a message. The Ten Rules: 1. Simplicity 2. Brevity 3. Credibility etc... all have merit. And the case studies dealing with product & media slogans like State Farms, \\"Like a good neighbor,\\" or FOX NEWS, \\"Fair and Balanced,\\" were intriguing enough to focus the way in which one listens to product or political message. Unfortunately, the groups that seek to practice what Dr. Luntz preaches seem to do so at our despair; naturally, this infuriates the left. And because Americans increasingly have less time to properly investigate issues, it's easy to understand why members of the audience see this work as catering to the right. In the end though, this book proves itself as a genuine effort (except Chap #11).

Throughout this 324 page tome, Luntz instructs his readers in the most effective ways to communicate their ideas. While mostly solid, Luntz's advice has a simplistic tone which will annoy most readers. For example, the early chapters could have been done as bullets with less filler, and would have held this reader's attention better. Another improvement would have been to make the book less partisan or at least more politically balanced.The best parts of the book are the case studies in chapters 7 and 8, and the memos at the end of the book. Earlier chapters have good material, but they are marred by wordiness and redundancy. The remaining chapters could have easily been condensed and can be skimmed without missing anything important. The least interesting and effective chapter of the book is chapter 11, a chapter on how to manipulate people in personal situations. Luntz's suggestions of spinning your language to get out of a ticket, or board a place whose doors have been closed, comes across as just short of lying, and are disappointing at the least.Overall, because of the important things covered in approximately one third of the book, I'd give this book a 3.5 but I must round up, so I rate it a 4."},{"Title":"Words That Work: It's Not What You Say, It's What People Hear","review":"I had a terrible time listening to this ebook, as I found the voice most annoying.A certain amount of horn-blowing is expected from an author, especially one whose main field is advertising, but the amount of self-promotion in this book was really unacceptable, particularly in light of the minimal number of insights actually in the book.There are (unintentionally) humorous bits, though.

Her descriptions of New Orleans, homes and even the shops are so vivid one can truly live in each moment along with Mary MacAlistair, the lively character the story evolves around. Her life takes so many twist and turns it's amazing to realize that it all happens in the space of a year. From the age of sixteen to seventeen she's experienced more then most would over the space of a lifetime. She jaunts through the adversity in her life with a very uplifting attitude until she briefly determines it's a dog-eat-dog world she resides in.

She combines her talent for fiction writing and the history of one of the nation's most mysterious cities to entertain. Imagine being a 16-year-old girl without a family and only a small box filled with various family heirlooms as a link to the past. After graduating from a convent school, and learning of her father's death, Mary MacAlister sets out to learn about her family and heritage. Her quest for knowledge leads her to New Orleans where she meets an array of characters ranging from a madam to a plantation owner to a Voodoo queen. Her adventures and troubles start on her journey down the Mississippi. She encounters illness, trickery and loneliness. But there are good times too. Mary becomes part of a family, independent and a heroine to many. And of course there is romance. Mary learns that sometimes a man's intentions are not all that innocent and love is not all that easy. Mary MacAlister's story is not the only great thing about this book. Ripley researched the history of New Orleans and its people to be able to honestly depict the city. At the end of the book she places a disclaimer about one inaccuracy. Ripley's portrayal of New Orleans, the people and the history is superior to any other.

Just little details like that shows that Alexandra Ripley did alot of research for this story. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"New Orleans Legacy","review":"I first read this book years and years ago in the span of one day. I couldn't put it down! And as soon as I finished, I flipped right back to the front and started over. Since then, I've read New Orleans Legacy at least a dozen times. Ripley's history is exquisite. I was so moved that I read everything else of hers I could find. I highly recommend this book as well as Charleston, On Leaving Charleston, and The Time Returns."},{"Title":"New Orleans Legacy","review":"Ripley does a superb in re-creating the mood in this historical love story and tragedy. The main character never loses the innocence she started with. Nothing came easy to her, yet she had everything.

It's long, but I was so interested that I read it in about a week (while I took college courses as well). The main character, Mary, is a true heroine, she's not this silly love-starved, look-for-a-husband-type that's usually found in historical romance/fiction novels. You know it was a good book when a month later you think to yourself &quot;now, who was it that...&quot; and you realize it was a character from a book. Discriptions of N'arlings are great, too. Compleate with banquettes, coffee, and banyaes (sp?). Now I can understand why Ripley was chosen to write the sequal to &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot; If you like epic type historical romances, you'll like this book!"},{"Title":"New Orleans Legacy","review":"Mary MacAllistair has been convent educated, and on her sixteenth birthday she receives the gift of a family legacy - a casket containing family treasures handed down from one Mary (or Marie) to the next. At the same time, Mary is stunned by the news of her father's death, along with the big surprise that her *mother* is really her step-mother and wants nothing to do with Mary - she's on her own in the world. Mary finds a New Orleans address in the casket, and she's off all by herself to hunt down the family she's never known. I won't go into details, but it doesn't take long for our innocent heroine to get duped and then befriended by the nicest woman ever (you just know what plans she has for Mary, don't you?).Once she's *safely* in New Orleans, she escapes one evil baddie only to fall into the hands of another who recognizes the casket and gets Mary shunted off to a remote plantation. Not a bad life, but her little misstep with the evil Mrs. Jackson comes back to haunt her and she's kicked out of her reasonably cushy digs, forced to work for a living *gasp*. Mary perseveres, since she's got the dressmaking skills to outdo the highest priced modiste in town.Will Mary find her true love Valmont Saint-Brevin? Convince him she wasn't one of Mrs. Jackson's \\"girls\\"? Find her true family? Die at the hands of the ebil voodoo queen?This was a fairly good read, but it isn't without its faults. Mary is just a wee bit annoying, not quite in full blown pity party mode, but there were times she needed a good smack in the head. While this book only covers about a one-year period, it does contain a lot of historical details of New Orleans, and that might be a deal-breaker for some, YMMV. I did enjoy a lot of the historical bits, loved learning about Micaela Almonester Pontalba (a new to me factoid), but even for this history geek it started wearing thin at the end.One final cautionary note, and that is towards readers who will look at this stepback and pick the book up expected a romance with steamy kisses and passion on every page. You aren't going to get that, and you are going to wait a long, long time for any payola. And a pretty quick payola at that."},{"Title":"New Orleans Legacy","review":"It kept my interest from start to finish.

With the constant moves, difficulties of raising a family abroad, assumption of an 'at-home' spouse, limited decision making ability, two years of McDonalds-like consular work, poor remuneration and terrible morale I could not seriously consider the Foreign Service as a career. Besides the above complaints, this volume also lists inter-agency rivalry and miscommunication, incompetent political appointees, the lack of options for FSOs to move between the FS and the private sector, and limited clout on the Hill as major problems. All of which leave the reader with the impression that the State Dept is more akin to a poorly-managed Soviet enterprise than a dynamic, innovative American organization."},{"Title":"Goblin Market","review":"Goblin Market, a verse fairy tale that was first published in 1862, is a rather fascinating piece of masterful poetry. It tells a wonderfully sensuous tale that has inspired a myriad of interpretations. I've spent more time reading about Goblin Market than I did actually reading it - savoring it, rather, for it really calls for a much more personal treatment than a mere reading. This pre-Raphaelite work harbors latent eroticism that echoes with both renunciation and desire. Thus, some term it a work of repressed Victorian eroticism and grin knowingly (and leeringly) as they recount the fact that Goblin Market was quite a popular children's fairy tale in its day. Christine Rossetti was herself a recluse along the lines of Emily Dickinson, allowing her heart to sing freely even as she kept herself separated from any possible objects of her latent desires.In the poem, one sister gives in to the temptation of the forbidden fruit offered by the dark goblins forever lurking in the twilight to seduce their victims to a first taste of their exotic wares. The desire to obtain more of the passion fruit overtakes her young life, yet the goblins appear to her no more; as a result, she begins to waste away near to death. At this point, her sister, who sensibly avoided temptation, willingly seeks to bargain with the goblins, only to have them force their juicy wares upon her. The fruity residue is enough, however, to revive her sister. The act of salvation is obviously the juiciest part of the story on a number of levels - such a sensual act between sisters, with lines such as \\"Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices\\" and \\"Eat me, drink me, love me,\\" cries out for interpretation of all kinds - and those quick to criticize the hypocritical prudishness of Victorian society have a veritable field day with it.Some say this is not a poem for children's ears? Balderdash. Like any masterful work of poetry, Goblin Market can be read and interpreted on many levels. Children will delight in its lyrical rhyming patterns, its allusions to wee goblins hawking the most delicious of fruits, and interpret the salvation of the tempted sister in comparatively innocent terms. I say leave the interpretations to the adults. And what interpretations there are of this lengthy poem. Some see in it a recreation of the genesis story, a story of sacrifice and redemption, a tale of lesbian yearning, a declaration of the power of sisterhood, a commentary on women as commodities in market society, evidence of sexual molestation by Rossetti's father, etc. There's no limit to the interpretations put forth about what is, on the surface, an engaging fairy tale set to verse.This is a fascinating work of lyrical poetry that can be read fairly quickly yet will sustain your interest through multiple readings, all sorts of fascinating research into analysis and interpretation, and just plain wonderment. As sensual as it is beautiful, Goblin Market is probably one of the most fascinating and insightful products of Victorian literature."},{"Title":"Goblin Market","review":"The Goblin Market is a masterfully crafted example of Pre-Raphaelite fantasy fiction written in the form of a poem. It was definitely not written for children -- modern parents should use their own judgement as to its suitability for a modern child. I think it is very unlikely that any Victorian mother read this aloud to a young child as a bedtime story (cautionary or otherwise). Victorian readers undoubtedly understood the nuances of the Rossetti's poetry far better that the average reader today would."},{"Title":"Goblin Market","review":"I wonder if the good folk at the end of the 19th century when this poem was originally published were just too obtuse to understand the gist of Rossetti's work; if so, we have an innocent artifact that has evolved into something erotic because of our twentieth century sensibilities (we have dirtier minds than our compatriots from the past).Don't let the word &quot;erotica&quot; scare you away. This is not a blatantly sexual work in its language; it is not a &quot;dirty&quot; book. Just understand that despite what anyone else says or writes, this is about as unambiguously EROTIC as you can get. With phrasing like &quot;Eat me, drink me, love me; Laura, make much of me; For your sake I have braved the glen; And had to do with goblin merchant men.&quot;Since the original work is now in the public domain, if you want to read the full text online just do a search using most standard search engines with the terms &quot;Christina Rossetti Goblin Market&quot; and you should turn up a number of links to the actual poems, go read it, and decide for yourself about it.This makes a wonderful gift for people you are very close too. However, it is also a very personal poem, and if given inappropriately could actually scare someone away!"},{"Title":"Goblin Market","review":"Noted Italian/English poetess of the 1800's Christina Rossetti's imagination catching poetry has stood the test of time, being still loved and studied today. Because of its title, Goblin Market sometimes gets put into a juvenile category, but this is a poem for mature readers. This moral tale depicts the epic struggle between bad and good. The goblin's onslaught on virtue immediately engages the reader's inner ear and heart. This poem is really gripping reading. Goblin Market is often considered Christina Rossetti's best poem. This re-issue, replete with noted illustrator Arthor Rackham's beautifully eerie drawings, is a book worth owning."},{"Title":"Goblin Market","review":"Victorian mothers actually read this work to their daughters as a cautionary tale of the evils of the world and the risks of forsaking sisterhood for association with the &quot;coarser&quot; gender. It seems amazing today that the imagery and symbolism, most explicit in the author's mind and to modern readers, must have been invisible to the conscious Victorian mind. This work is remarkable for its literary sublimation of seething, repressed sexuality."},{"Title":"Goblin Market","review":"A children tale for adults. It's a light and thoughtful reading. The story of two sisters and lewd goblin men. Innocence, temptation and emotions all together. This inspiring story has wonderful work of Dante Gabriel Rossetti."},{"Title":"Goblin Market","review":"I really like fantasy books and this was really good. I love Arthur Rackham's artwork and add that to Christina Rossetti's poetry, you can't lose. Also since this is from Dover Publications that is a plus. The hardback edition is more than I normally like to spend for books, but classics like this are well worth the extra money because you'll keep it forever."},{"Title":"Goblin Market","review":"This tale is not about sexuality but about redemption and the need to help others. Read deep into the story to find the meaning that Rossetti intended."},{"Title":"Goblin Market","review":"this piece called &quot;goblin market&quot; was recomended to me this year by my lovely boyfriend whom was 8 years older than me. since i am youthful and still sexually repressed, he encouraged me to read the story of the two sisters. the story has a lot to say about a human's mind when it comes to love and sex. a powerful, addictive piece of literature! its worth its price!"},{"Title":"Heart of the Home: A Vegetarian Cookbook for People Who Want to Make a Change But Don't Know Where to Start.","review":"I've never been a big fan of the Moosewood series. This is probably a stupid reason, but I think I'm biased against Ms. Katzen's books because of a single recipe: miso soup. In one of her books, she published the most absurd recipe for Misoshiru that I have ever seen--taking one of the world's simplest, most sophisticated dishes, and turning it into a complex and garish production that completely misses the point of Japanese cuisine. So Molly gets a thumbs-down from me on the basis of a single recipe, and I'm probably not being at all fair. Ah, but I digress...Ann Jackson's books are for vegetarians as well, but they're quite different from most cookbooks you've probably seen. For one thing, they're, ahem... fairly casually written. It's not at all unusual to get the feeling when you're cooking one of her recipes, that you're being instructed by someone who's terribly busy and not really paying attention to what you're doing. Me: \\"Say, Ann--how am I supposed to chop these rutabagas? Should they be diced, or minced?\\" Ann Jackson (without even looking): \\"They look great to me--you're doing a great job.\\" You run across these moments in Ms. Jackson's books where you'll be asked to add butter to a dish--but if you don't happen to have any butter on hand, it's OK substitute sweet potatoes or creamed corn. I'm exaggerating, of course, but just barely. When preparing Ms. Jackson's recipes, I've become accustomed to doing my shopping, getting halfway through a recipe, and then realizing that I didn't pick up one of the ingredients because she didn't bother to list it--until the very end of the recipe. Is this incredibly annoying? Well, yes, at first. But the thing is, I haven't made a single dish from her cookbooks that didn't turn out great. And a few of her recipes are among our family's essential, once-a-week favorites (her mushroom and corn stew, served with biscuits, is simply not to be missed). Until you've tried her grilled carrot \\"hot dogs\\", you really haven't had all-American cuisine. Ms. Jackson's cavalier attitude toward details--while leading to some \\"interesting\\" moments in the kitchen--doesn't seem to harm the recipes one little bit.I've grown to love this cookbook, and have purchased copies for many, many of my vegetarian and non-vegetarian friends. It's probably my favorite vegetarian cookbook, and high on my list of all-time favorites--right alongside classics like Julie Sahni's \\"Classic Indian Cooking\\" and Shizuo Tsuji's \\"Japanese Cooking - A Simple Art\\"--books that inspire and educate as well as giving you specific examples of the cuisine.This is not a cookbook for people who are afraid of food, and it's certainly not a cookbook for people who demand precise measurements and dependably repeatable recipes. This is a cookbook for people who love food and who love cooks and who know that the dish will always turn out fine. Just make it taste good, and it'll be great."},{"Title":"Heart of the Home: A Vegetarian Cookbook for People Who Want to Make a Change But Don't Know Where to Start.","review":"&quot;The moon was in Scorpio, and I was three sheets to the wind_&quot; Thus begins the recipe for &quot;Enchilada Sauce,&quot; just across the page from &quot;White Woman's Bar-Be-Que Sauce.&quot;Both irreverent and down-to-earth; open at any page and you'll know &quot;Heart of the Home&quot; isn't like any cookbook you've seen before. This is vegetarian cooking, down-home country style, and this is literature.&quot;If you have Cancer in your astrological chart, you will love making gravy, stir to your heart's content.&quot; Reassuring those who haven't ever picked up a pot before, nudging old hands to take chances they've never taken, this is a book for anyone wanting to connect or reconnect with the essential experience of cooking for others. Beyond that, it's a walk into one woman's extraordinary collection of warm moments and memories of special encounters, mostly in the kitchen.Meet my old friend Ann Jackson. Truly a unique and original talent, when I first knew her she was the cook for a warehouse full of vegetarian men and women running one of the biggest natural foods operations in the West. I was the produce manager. Every morning Ann would come around the corner of that big walk-in cooler looking to see what was fresh and good and it was like the start of another day's adventure.There's a whole cast of characters here, and every recipe is delivered with definite personality. Patsy, Senter, Dorita, Lindsey, Licorice, Tommy Merritt and a roving cast of truckers, girlfriends, pets, produce dealers and crazy Italians wander the range of food and adventure, covering the ground from &quot;Prem Nagar Pea Soup&quot; &amp; &quot;Solidarity Borscht&quot; to &quot;Milwaukee Street Squash&quot; &amp; &quot;Nostromo Noodles.&quot; One of my favorites is &quot;Mama's Dark Secret,&quot; and if Ann didn't invent &quot;Chicken Fried Tofu,&quot; she sure perfected the form toward true immortality.&quot;What good is it how healthy something is if it doesn't taste good?&quot; Healthy and good food that doesn't weigh you down and doesn't bore you either. I remember Ann used to call it &quot;meat and potatoes vegetarian cooking.&quot; This is cooking for an American palette, without the usual American reliance on cheese and meat and processed additives. One of the author's goals is to encourage us to escape our dependence on cow, but she is never dogmatic, and most of the recipes can go either way. &quot;_If you don't want to use soy milk, fine, use milk, use cream for all I care (they're your thighs), just get in there and do it!&quot; Her other objective is to introduce us to a whole range of possibilities for vegetarian staples like tofu, tempeh, miso, seaweeds, grains, rice and noodles, while proving that we don't have to leave behind such traditional fare as Potato Salad (the best I've tasted), Corn Fritters, Chocolate Cream Pie, Hushpuppies and Baked Beans.Ann and her husband own and manage 'Time After Time,' a very successful 2nd hand clothes store in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They live amidst a fantastic collection of folk art and memorabilia (from which the 50s illustrations that adorn &quot;Heart of the Home&quot; are taken). The kitchen is clearly near the heart of their home, and with this cookbook we're all invited to sit around the kitchen table to share a few good stories and a lot of good eating."},{"Title":"Heart of the Home: A Vegetarian Cookbook for People Who Want to Make a Change But Don't Know Where to Start.","review":"I am vegan and bought this for a friend who is from the south and thought she'd get a kick out of trying some dairy free/meat free southern recipes considering the rave reviews it got.

Until Mala wrote this book, there was little available for the phenomenologist to read in the use of art in therapy. As a therapist myself, and a phenomenologist, it is refreshing to read about the phenomenological use of Art in Therapy.There is a wealth of Art Therapy literature using psychalalytic theory, and there is a small amount of work by brief and narrative therapists on the use of Art in Therapy. While there are a few journal articles, and a few chapters in books on the phenomenological use of Art in Therapy, Mala's book is the only one that I know of where a whole book is dedicated to Phenomenology.As a therapist and researcher, I have found the second chapter very useful. In this chapter, Mala gives a clear description of a four step sequence that a therapist can take a client through. One begins with &quot;pre art play&quot;, then shifts to &quot;the process of art work&quot;, to &quot;phenomenological intuiting&quot;, then the &quot;what do you see? procedure&quot;. It is my experience, that these steps usually lead the client to a deeper sense of self understanding and also a sense of resolution. What emerges on the page can be unexpected, often providing a unique insight into the client's problem. In this process, unexpected solutions also emerge.I have found Mala's process to be a very powerful theraputic tool, particularily when clients have sensitive concerns that they may have difficulty verbalising. For example, some clients, who have been abused as children, can be very reluctant to verbally describe their experiences. These clients are more comforetable drawing their experiences. They may also feel safer with the drawing process because it allows them to externalise the matter of concern. What they promised not to talk about, can sometimes be drawn."},{"Title":"Squiggly Wiggly's Surprise: a Finger Puppet Learns About Colors","review":"Squiggly Wiggly's Surprise by Arnold Shapiro is an interactive book in which the child uses a finger puppet caterpillar to learn about colors. Each page features a hole in the page that the finger puppet comes through to allow Squiggly Wiggly to experience something different on each page. From leaves to flowers, Squiggly Wiggly travels through the seasons and ends up making himself a cocoon in which he becomes a beautiful butterfly. This book teaches colors so that the child will be able to learn them by Squiggly Wiggly sitting on and eating green leaves, sitting on and smelling a red rose, yellow daisy, purple pansy, talking to a blue bird, and admiring the orange orange. The child becomes entranced by the finger puppet and, at the same time, learns what colors to associate with certain things by Squiggly Wiggly's contact with these flowers, fruits, leaves, and animals. The book also teaches a child about the life cycle of a caterpillar through the pictures and the finger puppet's involvement in these pictures. When Squiggly appears in the snow, he becomes very cold, and because it is winter the cold signals hibernation. In the next picture, Squiggly spins a brown sack around himself, after which he is shown inside the black sack, and he grows tired and falls asleep. The next picture shows Squiggly waking up as a butterfly. Using color and these particular pictures enables a child to learn about the stages that a caterpillar goes through before he becomes a beautiful butterfly. I feel that both techniques used to teach color and pictures showing a caterpillar's development process, are both highly effective in teaching child readers. The interactive portion of this book also appeals to children because they can participate in the book as they read it."},{"Title":"Squiggly Wiggly's Surprise: a Finger Puppet Learns About Colors","review":"One of our family photos shows me sitting on the couch with our first child sitting on my lap at her first birthday party.

I loved interacting with the puppet, who helped tell the story of a how a caterpillar became a beautiful butterfly. My mom always tells the story of when we went to the state fair when I was 2 years old. I saw a train-type ride that was the shape of a caterpillar and went around a small track. I had to get on! I yelled \\"SQUIGGLY WIGGLY\\" and refused to get off the ride. The operator thought it was so funny that he let me ride squiggly wiggly all afternoon. I LOVED THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Squiggly Wiggly's Surprise: a Finger Puppet Learns About Colors","review":"ISBN 0843106328 - Printed and bound in Singapore (boo hiss to California based publisher Price/Stern/Sloan for offshoring those jobs). Age range not stated. Excellent news for those of you who, like me, have a thing for gimmicks in kids' books - this one has a built in finger puppet!Squiggly Wiggly is a fuzzy caterpillar who loves colors. He wanders about the garden, talking to others and enjoying the beautiful colors, but feeling a little jealous, too. He notices the yellow daisies, the orange orange, and a blue bird, among other colors. These colors make him sad about his own drab color. When it turns cold, Squiggly builds himself a brown cocoon and hides inside. Eventually, he feels crowded inside the cocoon and emerges to discover, much to his surprise, that he is now the most colorful thing in the garden.This is not a board book. It is a hardcover, with thin cardboard pages. This small difference matters because the finger puppet of Squiggly is attached to a hole in the back cover and pokes through holes in every page. The reader is supposed to manipulate Squiggly (according to directions on each page). This is a little difficult when you're trying to turn the pages and, because they're just thin cardboard, they tear a little more easily than board pages would. In my copies, Squiggly keeps getting torn by this, too. Children's fingers, since they're smaller, may get in the way of page-turning a little less than an adult's.This is an awesome book to engage young children and teach them colors. The colors are in bold on every page, so they're pretty hard to miss. Author Arnold Shapiro's text is fairly simple, making this a good book for a beginning reader, and the illustrations by Charles Murphy are nice without overwhelming or distracting from the text. Kids will love Squiggly and learn at the same time, and not just colors. How a caterpillar becomes a butterfly is snuck into their reading, too!- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"With my knives I know I'm good","review":"So ...I take it home and immediately go to Amazon.com to see if &quot;Julian Rathbone&quot; has ever done anything else, or might be instead a clever psuedonym employed by Graham &quot;Robert Markham&quot; Greene or another.

I'll paste what the page says, but I take from it that Symonds not only explores but probably glorifies Michelangelo's alleged homosexuality.I don't care about Michelangelo's sex life. I do care whether a biographer presents an *objective* account of his subject's life.\\"John Addington Symonds (5 October 1840 - 19 April 1893) was an English poet and literary critic. Although he married and had a family, he was an early advocate of male love (homosexuality), which he believed could include pederastic as well as egalitarian relationships. He referred to it as l'amour de l'impossible (love of the impossible). A cultural historian, he was known for his work on the Renaissance, as well as numerous biographies about writers and artists. He also wrote much poetry inspired by his homosexual affairs.\\""},{"Title":"The Children's Book of Faith","review":"This beautiful, gently written and illustrated book will certainly appeal to all ages.

I really love this book."},{"Title":"The Children's Book of Faith","review":"This is a wonderful anthology for all Christians. It keeps to the basics that we all agree on and includes prayers, poems, Bible stories, stories of Catholic and of Protestant heroes of the Christian faith and stories which encourage the development of morals. There are delightfully drawn pictures on every page. While preschoolers and kindergartners will enjoy some of these stories, others may take until children are in 6th grade before they understand the world enough to fully get all that can be gotten of stories they may enjoy with a simpler understanding at an earlier age. As you can tell from other reader reviews, even adults will find it an enjoyable and challenging book. I think that if you get it early enough, that it will be a book that children will grow into and love throughout the years.According to the book jacket, the editor, \\"William Bennett served as secretary of education and chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities under President Reagan and as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Bush. ... and co-chairs the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.\\" I think that indicates his motivation for writing this book and deciding what he would include in it. As he states in his introduction, \\"In a world that often seems full of woe, faith produces an astounding amount of good. It is the rock on which so many virtues are founded: honesty, courage, generosity, hard work, responsibility, and self-control. It is a call to kindness, decency, forgiveness, and love. Faith keeps us from drifting by anchoring sour sense of right and wrong. It lifts each person outside himself and offers a larger sense of purpose as we journey through life.... In these pages, we find examples of people who draw strength from above, trusting in God to help them in the large and small tasks of life. We witness them living in readiness to answer God's call and standing steadfast in their devotion to him. By reading and talking about faith, parents help children learn that God loves them, that he cares about what they do, that he has created them for goodness. ... I hope ... this book aids parents in that task and speaks to children as creatures of God who are beginning a spiritual journey.\\"The chapters in this book include:Daniel in the Lion's DenWhat God Hath PromisedWhere Love Is, God IsThe Captain's DaughterIn the Uttermost Parts of the SeaThe Legend of Saint ChristopherMorning PrayersThe Healing of the ParalyticThe Call of SamuelThe Boy and the AngelThe Little Lost LambThe Twenty-third PsalmThe Selfish GiantBabushkaPrayers of ThanksBen Franklin's ReminderAdvice from Thomas JeffersonThe Story of \\"Amazing Grace\\"\\"Amazing Grace\\" (the song)The Angel of the BattlefieldA Light to Guide UsThe Boy Who Brought Light Into a World of DarknessSaint Martin's CloakMake Me an Instrument of Your PeaceMiriam and the Floating BasketHe Will HearThe SeedThe Story of HanukkahWhy the Chimes RangMy GiftLoving JesusThe Lord's PrayerBedtime PrayersSaint Augustine's Walk by the Sea"},{"Title":"The Children's Book of Faith","review":"I found this book just incredible.

Worst of all without giving honor to the Creator of Truth, we lose our perspective of what Truth is. Only Truth can lead us to kindness, wholeness, and inner peace.

I was pleasantly surprised. The author spends a great deal of time impressing upon the reader that control charts are potentially useless when processes don't behave like textbook examples. So, there is a data analysis approach taken with time spent on dealing with issues of nonormality and autocorrelation and time patterns. This is pretty different and not found in other SPC books that I have run across.The time-series analysis is on the elementary level, e.g., using OLS regression to fit an AR(1). The book doesn't go deep into ARIMA models.There is an interesting discussion on p charts and c charts. Basically, the author is dealing with the issue of overdispersion though he does not say the term. This is not to my knowledge covered in other SPC books but it is clearly an issue in reality.The chapter on CUSUMs is particularly done well and is quite comprehensive.If there is one negative point, the book is a bit too wordy to my liking. I think he could have shorten up his prose a bit. But, for folks that are leary of statistics, the extra text might help get the point across.Most folks will recognize Montgomery's Intro. to Stat. Quality Control as the main player in the field. Given its longer history, I don't think that will change but Alwan's book is definitely an add-on to any decent SPC collection of reference books."},{"Title":"Statistical Process Analysis","review":"This book is great!

The USS Essex travels to the South sea's to raid the distant whaling grounds of England during the war of 1812. The book covers the situation leading to the decision, the trip around the horn, the dealings with the various governments there and the natives and its eventual end in battle.The best parts of the tale are the dealing with south sea natives, they tell an unknown story about diplomacy and force in an unfamilar culture some of who's lessions are useful today.The story suffers from the decision to cut off the story after the final battle not giving more conclusion of the characters in play except for the ESSEX itself.For those unfamilar with the tale it will be a good read, for all other the account is passable."},{"Title":"Beowulf: Gear of War","review":"As mentioned in my review of Hinds' Beowulf, Book 1: With Grimmest Gripe, I am quite impressed with his re-interpretation of the Beowulf poem. It translates Beowulf into a new medium, as effective in its own right as the more recent translations by Seamus Heaney and R.M. Liuzza. Of course, some might consider that statement a stretch, as Hinds transforms the Beowulf poem into the more visual medium of comic books, but an examination of his work suggest that such a statement is not greatly exaggerated.As with his first book of the series, Hinds makes uses of vivid colors and lines to convey the vigorous battle--this time between Beowulf and Grendel's mother. Like his first, the poetic translation by Gummere and the visuals are wedded to together form a new translation. Never do the illustrations take a back seat to the Gummere translation. Instead, the illustrations do much to convey the themes and motifs that are embedded in the Beowulf poem. For instance, there is much debate over whether there are Christian elements in the poem, how much, and where. Hinds introduces this debate with wit and subtletly when he has Beowulf emerge from the underwater cave of Grendel's mother. Without giving away the details, Beowulf' successful return to the surface is depicted in such a way that references Christianity.If one has any qualms with Hinds' reinterpretation, it might be in his decision to focus on the primary narrative of Beowulf. He eliminates the richness of digressions and beots that the poem has in Old English. Of course, this is appropriate for his genre but one wishes he had pushed the boundaries a bit further. If anyone could do that, it would be Hinds, whose aesthetic sense demonstrates a true investment with the poem.Again, I find this to be truly compelling, especially for those familiar with Beowulf."},{"Title":"Chiquita's Cocoon: Una guia para la mujer latina para lograr autoridad, amor, (cont'd) (Spanish Edition)","review":"CHIQUITA'S COCOON OFFERS...the Latina (and other women trapped in similar cocoons) something she has never had before --awareness-- and a chance to grow.

But that's my major caveat with this text: it's essentially 1.5 ideas (the 1/2 being graphic mapping) repeated for 173 pages. It's a great idea, but it becomes overkill after a few chapters. Further, the focus on student contributions from AP kids is rather disenchanting--the work presented is actually too excellent; it doesn't represent what the product would really be were their assignments tested in the average high school English class. Unfortunately, the authors don't offer suggestions for what it would take for non-AP students to reach the level of thought the honors kids display; often times they don't even provide instructions for how they got those advanced placement kids to the level they're at.Worth looking at, but I'm not sure it's worth the $30+ people want for it."},{"Title":"Violence in Lincoln County, 1869-1881, a New Mexico Item","review":"Business disputes and partisan politics were the biggest factors leading to the so-called Lincoln County War during the 1870s. Greedy mercantilists who had many of the citizens of Lincoln County, NM, in debt to them and a cadre of politicians in Santa Fe behind them got into a land dispute with cattle kings mainly from the panhandle of Texas who began using the Pecos Valley as a place to stock their cattle, using the preemption laws to acquire land rights. Factions developed behind the small ranchers and mercantilists (lead by the likes of Lawrence G. Murphy, James J. Dolan, and James H. Riley) on one side and cattle barons (most notably John Chisum, John Turnstall, and Alexander A. McSween) on the other. Partisan politics in Santa Fe and in the law enforcement agencies prevented violence from erupting and then from being quelled. Soon cattle were being stolen, power was being threatened, rights were being violated, and finally men began to be shot and killed. Billy the Kid figured into the \\"war\\" in this last capacity, and it wasn't until his death in 1881 that Governor Lew Wallace (author of the novel BEN HUR) declared peace in the county.William Keleher's account of all this is a good one, though superseded now by more recent studies. He cites often contemporary newspaper reports and stories of the leading events, and gives detailed biographical \\"profiles\\" of all the principal actors in this drama. Lincoln County, a huge expanse of land at the time (much pared down today), had a reputation for violence before, during, and even after the \\"war\\" was fought. Billy the Kid emerged as the biggest legendary figure, though in reality he was a minor player. Keleher's book is packed with information and first-hand reports and is a prime source for anyone interested in exploring this period in Western history."},{"Title":"Waterworks: Inventing Bath Style","review":"Waterworks is one of the best bath books I have ever seen from a teaching standpoint.

For the Ford entry in the University Press of Mississippi's Conversations with Filmmakers series, editor Gerald Peary has collected a slew of interviews, from a 1920 profile in the Cleveland News to a 1973 postmortem by Walter Wagner. Peary's introduction sets the stage for what's to come in an anecdote, all too typical, about a 1970 attempt by Joseph McBride to talk to a director he idolized and would later profile in several books. \\"Ford, almost immediately testy, pushed his interviewer off-stride by a seating at his deaf ear, forcing McBride to sacrifice momentum repeating questions.\\" Ford's responses to queries about specific films were perverse and dismissive: Seven Women was \\"just a job of work\\"; The Searchers \\"a good picture.\\" As for the interviews themselves, they're mostly dodgy efforts, battles-of-wills that Ford could easily win by pretending deafness, repeating a rehearsed anecdote, or simply ending the interview early. The poetry in Ford's nature came out in his work, not in his life, if these interviews are any indication. Even in the 1920 article, he discusses mostly the production circumstances of his recent film Marked Man. It may be more than simply because of the Cleveland News' word-count policy that this article runs a scant two pages, despite the author's daylong visit with Ford. Later interviews further this strange portrait of a man who insisted on calling himself, both ironically and as protective camouflage, a \\"peasant.\\" Ford is most comfortable recounting anecdotes about the films and actors. While it's useful to have all these interviews in one place, Ford's evasiveness may frustrate the casual reader."},{"Title":"Aprenda ingls fcil y rpido","review":"_Aprenda Ingles Facil y Rapido_ is a very good learning tool for Spanish-speakers.

I bought this one first, and after struggling with it for weeks, had to go out and buy a different one.Why? One word - indentation. Or lack thereof. While the Federal Aviation Regulations are in outline format (sometimes up to seven or eight levels deep), this publisher has opted to use ONLY TWO levels of indentation. Why? I can only think that this made the book take up less pages, and cost them less to produce. Too bad, because it makes it almost IMPOSSIBLE to distinguish between text deep in at Level 6 and heading text at Level 2.At first, I blamed myself for not understanding the material. Finally, I wised up and put the blame where it belonged, in the layout of this book. I looked around and bought the FAR/AIM 2003 from Gleim Publications. Clear, easy to read indentation, and even great use of bolding. Why didn't other publishers figure that out?"},{"Title":"Aim/far 2003","review":"Of course it's not the greatest read of all time, but hey, it was written by aviators. 5 stars for being a the most critical publication for a pilot to have and know before going flying."},{"Title":"Peoples of the World","review":"I loved this book. It was very informative and covered many different cultures, but I sensed some racists beliefs. A couple comments about some of tribes seemed like they were written by a... \\"civilized\\" person. They were little and unobtrusive enough to ignore but I feel the author could have worded the sentences differently.Also, the Native American section seemed rushed and went into very little detail. It treated the Indians like they were all the same though with little differences. I feel they should have been covered seperately because the Indians in each region differ noticeably. The way some of the sentences are worded makes it sound like a fact that only applies to one tribe applies to all. There is also no mention of past troubles (like the \\"Trail of Tears\\" or many relocations) or recent accomplishments (like opening colleges or casinos).The pictures were beautiful, and are never tiring. I love looking through them time after time. The captions are relevant and informative. They explain the picture and give a little background."},{"Title":"Peoples of the World","review":"Wonderful bookI gave this to my student for a Christmas present.

The imagery and characterization stay with you - they echo down the years.I found my old copy last month when cleaning out some old boxes; I set it aside, and read it this week. The book surpassed my memory of the book.Like life, there are unresolved loose ends and this is a good thing."},{"Title":"Local Anaesthetic","review":"Eberhard Starusch has a number of problems. His teeth hurt. His dentist quotes Seneca constantly. One of his students is trying to come up with a dramatic protest of the Vietnam war. He has invented (or has he?) a number of events surrounding a mythical (or is he?) Field Marshal General who happens to be the uncle of Starusch's ex-fiancee, whom Starusch-- or someone else-- may or may not have murdered with a bicycle chain.Such is the platform from which Local Anesthetic takes its course. Throughout this novel, I was reminded almost constantly of Alain Robbe-Grillet's style in The Erasers and The Voyeur. Worthy of imitation, certainly, as those are two of Europe's finest contributions to twentieth-century literature. but hard to imitate. And, were Grass not a consummate novelist, this would have come off even worse than it did.One gets the feeling that, unlike Robbe-Grillet, Grass actually wanted the reader to be able to figure out what in the world was really happening in this odd, nightmarish world of late-sixties East Germany. But the only thing that reader can truly be sure of is the way that Scherbaum, the protesting student, is going to react to things. And Scherbaum's predictability, which would be a weakness in most novels, instead anchors the reader to some semblance of reality as the possibly-mythical Sieglinde Krings and her uncle weave in and out of the arguments the schoolteacher (Starusch) has with the dentist (who is never named), the arguments Scherbaum has with his sometime-girlfriend Vero, the debates Starusch has with his friend Irmgard Siefert, the wargames Sieglinde and the General conduct in a huge sandbox... you get the idea.Grass manages (almost) to carry this novel off with his trademark combination of wit, silliness, and political invective against both sides of the utterly stupid post-WW2 and pre-wall-falling German government. But there seem to be too many places where things wander off and are never really picked up again. Too many loose threads are left undone at the end of this novel, and there isn't the kind of evidence one would need to wrap it all up oneself.I'd recommend this particular Grass novel only to completists; for those who want to see an excellent example of this style of writing, check out the aforementioned novels by Alain Robbe-Grillet (the Grove Press editions) and be utterly blown away."},{"Title":"Local Anaesthetic","review":"what can I tell ya..one great book..I read too far afield before this one..different kind of book..yes..more complexed..but this one is a litle tiny book compering to too far afield...Local is more then anything It will truly crack u up kind of book..at the same time..hey..Grass makes u think of any other current writer as being a schmuk at leat in his writing history and analyzing branch..some less then 300 pages..this book is a straight kick in the stomach...leave u breathless and thinking...whats was that little lady's number?Nadine Gordimer...Who cares...Long Live Grass !"},{"Title":"Control of Uncertain Systems: A Linear Programming Approach","review":"I think that the other reviews posted here do not give a fair evaluation of the book. (These reviews are also so similar that one wonders why the second reviewer felt it necessary to post...) It is true that the L1 method has not received as much attention as other robust control techniques, such as the H-infinity theory, but it is a viable alternative, and has been used to design real-life controllers, such as those for high-purity distillation columns. One of the merits of this approach, as J. Ball noted in his review of this book for SIAM Review (Vol.41, No.4) is that it is easier to incorporate time-domain constraints (e.g., overshoot, settling time, maximum deviation from desired tracking) than in some other robust control approaches. Other features of controller performance can be analyzed as well, because the design approach is amenable to detailed analysis. This book is not meant to be a treatise on linear programming or on functional analysis, and shouldn't be criticized on those grounds. Contrary to the statements of the earlier reviewers, the material of this book should be of some interest to researchers: there are open problems in this area that are discussed in an article by Bamieh and Dahleh in the book &quot;Open Problems in Mathematical Systems and Control Theory&quot; (Springer, 1999), and articles on the relationship of infinite-dimensional convex analysis with this area have been recently published in IEEE Trans. Auto. Control. Potential readers should compare this book with the later &quot;Computational methods for controller design&quot; (Springer, 1998) by Elia and Dahleh, which covers some of the same topics."},{"Title":"Control of Uncertain Systems: A Linear Programming Approach","review":"This book is primarily about one approach to the control of plants with uncertainties: The L1 (ell one) theory. Unfortunately it is not a very useful book: there is probably not one real life plant that carriers a controller designed by this method. This is not surprising since the L1 objective is of little interest in general.The book is essentially a watered down version of a few topics in infinite dimensional optimization and functional analysis. The L1 theory is simply an application of the Hahn Banach theorem to an idealized formulation of the control problem. The problem is then reduced to an infinite dimensional linear program, which, with truncation is reduced to a finite dimensional one. The objective function, however, is not very useful. One can simply use the constraints to obtain a feasible solution to the LP, but the resulting design is difficult to comprehend, and it is difficult to specify margins with this method.So for the control engineer, the book is not very useful. For the mathematicians, it gives little insight into control issues, and talks only of known mathematics."},{"Title":"Control of Uncertain Systems: A Linear Programming Approach","review":"With the exception of one chapter, this book is about a narrow and unproven approach to control system design: The L1 theory. There is almost surely no real life plant that carries a controller based on this design. Additionally, the authors present a mathematical treatment of an engineering subject, but the treatment fails to give the experienced control engineer any insight.From the point of view of mathematical control theory, the book is simply a watered down version of a few topics in infinite dimensional optimization and functional analysis. It is based on an application of the Hahn Banach theorem to a formulation of the control problem. It also contains a lot of mathematical facts, but it does not tie them well to control theory. So the mathematician will get little insight into the subject of control.Here we have a book that is neither useful to the engineer, nor to the mathematician."},{"Title":"AudelHVAC Fundamentals: Volume 3: Air Conditioning, Heat Pumps and Distribution Systems (Audel Technical Trades Series)","review":"Not a very good book. The author James E. Brumbaugh must be recycling his information from the 1st edition. This book is very old school. The pictures are in black and white and seem to be recycled pictures from HVAC theory back in 1960's era.I would not recommend purchasing this book. I hope the author's next edition will be in color with more \\"new school\\" information such as a \\"Puron\\" refridgerant techology, modern day HVAC servicing procedures such as \\"EPA Section 608\\" information, and more up to date pictures - take pictures of new housing and commercial construction, factory workers putting units together, and a technician working on a actual unit. James E. Brumbaugh is very \\"old school\\"."},{"Title":"AudelHVAC Fundamentals: Volume 3: Air Conditioning, Heat Pumps and Distribution Systems (Audel Technical Trades Series)","review":"I note the two earlier reviews saying this book is very old school, somewhat dated, and the figures are all black and white, lacks information on newer technology, such as Puro, etc.For a homeowner with very little previous knowledge who wanted to get a leg up on the area, though, this book was fine as a first read. Also note that the book isn't that expensive, especially if you're buying newer books, or more engineering level books, you can pay $100 or more for those.So for me the book was all right. I needed a basic intro and this fit the bill. Also, the chapter on gas burners and heaters is the most extensive, which is what I have, at over 80 pages. The other chapters on oil, electric, hydronic, etc., are shorter, but gas is the most common and important these days.I also don't mind the black and white illustrations. I worked in the publishing industry for 7 years, and too often color is misused just for aesthetic effect in educational books and doesn't add to the clarity of the presentation. In that case, I would prefer to have a much cheaper black and white book since the cost of color illustrations is several times that of black and white.I found Brumbaugh's writing style clear and concise. Technical books can be monotonous and boring, but a good technical writer can minimize that problem, and Brumbaugh is more than competent at presenting the topic.At just under 700 pages including the index, it's a lot of information for a reasonable price. Overall, a pretty good value, and after reading this book, I feel comfortable going on to the more technical, more up to date volumes on the subject."},{"Title":"AudelHVAC Fundamentals: Volume 3: Air Conditioning, Heat Pumps and Distribution Systems (Audel Technical Trades Series)","review":"The controls section of this book needs to be updated, but 90% of the book is still relevant.

He helps to clarify the confusion that some ordained women have felt after spending years in school training for ministry and then finding that congregations are hesitant to call us as pastors or downright against the idea. Chaves shows how much of the impetus for ordaining women came from outside of the church itself and originated in the surrounding culture that was moving, however slowly at times, toward equity for women. The book is well thought through and ably presented. I highly recommend it to any persons interested in the current state of leadership in the church in North America."},{"Title":"Animorphs Boxset #09: Books 33-36","review":"This is a great collection of Animorph books. . . . especially # 33 (The Illusion).

Now I am NOT a fan of the American Constitution for other reasons, but the Constitution was voted to be the law of the land on certain understandings of how power was to be shared, etc. i.e. power was granted to the federal government on certain conditions so to speak.This follows into the twisitng of the original design by an activist judiciary over the last century. Where there used to be very tough standards as to what exactly a 'case or controversy' was that was capable of being resolved in Court, now the Courts, following their own decisions, have invented so many rights and entitlements, and laws thereon, that the citizens of the States can not control their own destiny through the legislature. As Federal Judges are appointed, this unelected 'legislature' is now more powerful than the elected legislature. This is in direct opposition to the original design of the laws of this country and represents a 'stabbing in the back' if you will of the 'We The People' who have been increasingly usurped of our ability to pass legislation through our elected officials.Now the book exlores many areas of this conflict, but the constant theme comes forth, that the activit judiciary has stripped the citizens of the USA of much power that was formely in their hands. Both against true democary, and against the very ratification committees whose delegates ratified the Constituion.This is a reference work and is EXHAUSTIVELY footnoted and contains many links to Law Review Articles and Primary Source Documentation from the Constitutional Period and the Civil War Period.

This book is a powerful affirmation of the deep importance of women in the soul life of a small town, a country, a nation, and the world. Together, the 16 women Dr. Groce interviewed embody a spectrum of the soul qualities we can call all admire, ponder upon, and work to make our own. Also includes an explanation of Dr. Groce's Personality Spectrum technique for bringing the appropriate soul quality into any situation, soul qualities such as compassion, truthfulness, joy, kindness, and so on.

Granted, the scenes aren't that graphic - but you can bet to only have to wait about two or three pages until you see the almighty Sakuya pounding his girlfriend to sheer oblivion. Now, who's Sakuya you might ask? He's a rock star, main male charater in this series, and the reason why the book otherwise recieves so many stars. You see, Sakuya appeals to younger, female readers. He's strong, muscular, popular, violent and totes the amazing ability to beat the stuffing out of every other guy who so much as glances the main female character(whose name I've forgotten.)He's dashing, flirtatious and for whatever the freaking reason, is totally loyal and in love with what's her face. You see, Sakuya is the human equilvalent to an oversized guard dog who just happens to look (and screw) very well. As far as The Story goes, it within itself is FAR from a emotional rollercoaster - but rather an onslaught of buff pretty boys all trying to steal the main female character from Sakuya, or trying to steal Sakuya from the main female character. SO, if your into long hair, bare chested anime pretty boys chasing after some somewhat unappealing girl,(With lots of SEX after about every three or four pages) I'd go for this book.

About 6 months ago my husband got me into anime starting with Vandread, Witch Hunter Robin and Inuyasha to name a few. One day I wandered into the manga section of Borders and asked a teenage girl who was sitting there reading to recommend some titles. I left with Fushigi Yugi and Tuxedo Gin. Now my queues with Netflix and Blockbuster have only anime titles and I own about 15 series of manga. I also go to Borders at least 3 times a week to sit in the cafe, drink tea and read manga. I can read one volume in about 45 minutes, so I can't afford to buy all I read. I end up buying what I like. I am on disability from teaching. Anime and manga allow to escape my reality. Oh, I'm 39 years old.I hesitated to read Sensual Phrase at first. I had seen it reccommended in the back of other books, I had looked at a few volumes on the shelf and at first thought \\"Oh, how Mary Sue\\" and \\"I'm too old for this\\". Finally I read volume 1, EH, it was okay and finally hooked me with the video shoot at the very end. On to Volume 2, I had time to kill so why not. By Volume 3 I had gone back to the shelves, reshelved the other titles I had pulled and grabbed all the Sensual Phrase volumes. Next, call hubby and tell him I will be late coming home. I sat there reading every volume out which was up to 14. I got lucky and 15 was published a few days later. AAGGHH, now the wait for 16 then 17. I thought 17 was the end, even the column in the back says so, but Amazon shows a volume 18 coming out in the winter. I'll take all I can get.After that I found myself rereading Sensual Phrase at the store and finally when they had a sale I bought them all. I've read the series at least 5 times. I find new things each time I read. The second time I slowed down to savor the pictures and yes drool (in my head) over the sex scenes.Why does a middle aged woman (though I don't look it)read a manga series aimed at teens? It's the Mary Sue factor I mentioned earlier. I want to be Aine. I want to be cared for, protected and have frequent hot sex with with a drop dead gorgeous guy (although I think Yuki is even better looking, I love long hair). I agree with the reviewer who said they were glad Aine is not stunningly beautiful because she is a stand-in for me. Is my marriage terrible? No. Do I not love my husband? No, I love him more now than I did when we married 16 years ago. But I like to escape to a fantasy world for a while where life is constantly exciting and things turn out all right every time. Make no mistake, this is as much fantasy as Middle Earth. I'm sure even sexy Japanese rock stars don't lead this kind of life!Yes, Sakuya and Aine (or some other 2 people) have sex every 10 pages or so. It's not quite as often as one reviewer stated. Yes, Aine is constantly in danger and in need of rescuing. Don't we all want to be rescued from some part of our lives every once in a while?I like the sex. I like the sexy drawings of luscious hunks on almost every page. I love the outrageous outfits Sakuya and sometimes the others wear. See Volume 7 for an interesting treat in this area. I'm drawn into their angst. I love the backstories. (More Yuki, More Yuki!!!) I want to be Aine for a while. For an hour or two or three my own life, which because of my disability sucks, fades away.I wish this series and manga in general had been around when I was in high school. There were no teen books then, you went straight into adult books. Actually Kaikan Phrase (the Japanese title) was not even around in Japan when I was in high school ;)For those who object to the sex, read something else, but let those of us who don't read what we want, no censorship please. For those of you who think it is unrealistic....DUH that's what it is supposed to be. If I want reality I have my own life OR there is this rather large section in both bookstores and libraries called NON-FICTION. I am not looking to be enlightened or educated. I am looking to be entertained and to have a great fantasy. Of course Aine or somebody has to get into trouble every volume. I don't think I could stomach 17 volumes of just sex and rock concerts. When I taught writing I told my students the first thing you have to come up with was a problem to make the story interesting. Maya Shinjo has to come up with 17+ problems.I really hope they bring the anime series to DVD here in the US. It's not a retelling of the book, it focuses more on the band. But at least my Sensual Phrase habit could go on a little longer.If you want steamy, sexy escapism, buy the first 3-4 volumes (or go read them in the store, buy a cup of coffee for your rent) and see if you are hooked. As I said earlier Volume 1 might not be enough to grab you. It's no different from many of the titles in the Romance section, it just has drawings and takes more volumes, unfortunately.This is smut for women with pictures and I LOVE IT. Writing this review has made me want to go back and read the series again.

The two lovers fell into each other's arms one night and tried their best to keep the torrid affair private.Now, in a press conference that surprises everyone, Sakuya publicly declares his love for the petite towhead songstress. But Aine, much to Sakuya's chagrin, is far from happy.Although she loves him madly, Aine is worried about her future with the intense and reedy superstar.

The world of rock'n'roll is no place for children and Aine is afraid that a spawn of Lucifer will cool the heat that Sakuya feels for her."},{"Title":"Sensual Phrase, Vol. 11","review":"I love this whole series of Kaikan/Sensual Phrase books. I first got into it when I was in High School and I read volume 6 from my friend during our free period. I totally fell for how graphic and appealing it was. It's like no other manga Ive ever read. Now I'm getting the series to have at home. I read it over and over again. Though it is explicit and graphic, it has a great story line and it always keeps you guessing! You feel a little naughty reading it, but there's so much more to it than the moans and sighs of Aine.

If you're going to give it a bad rating, at least give a good enough reason not just \\"buff males stealing aine, hot females stealing sakuya\\" because again, this is shoujo not shoujen and it's pointless smut. Like almost every other shoujos. I love this series because it is a fun read. It's not so graphic, but it does show some kind of nudity. Mature minds or age level!

Viola does a pretty good job at showing what is often wrong with the &quot;Institutional Church.&quot; He shows the truth behind the Lord's supper very well, that the scriptures liken it to a love feast, not eating a themble portion of wine and bread. He also shows the truth behind the priesthood of all believers very well, exhorting all to get involved, and not simply be passive receivers.This book has very little to do with meeting in homes, and having church there. While he does show that Christians in the bible did pratice this, he does not ignore the fact of larger assemblies that were dominated largely by a small number of people in the scriptures as well. My complaint however with why he chooses &quot;house church&quot; for regular meetings over your typical church building is that Viola (as well as many home-churchers) seems to think the house church &quot;fosters&quot; (an often used word) an environment of openness, where as the typical church building discourages such. That these environments have significant influence on how believers interact with eachother.This is simply wrong. The place where we meet is not to influence us in such a way. Our freedom to move in the Spirit, and fellowship with one another is not determined by environment, rather, it is found in Christ alone. Unless Christ has given us freedom, then we will not find it in the institutional church, nor the house church. As Moses said, God is a dwelling place; so let us know that whatever tent we might find ourself in, God is our true place of dwelling.Another major objection I have with this book is that Viola teaches that the scriptures heavily establish the principle that a local assembly does nothing about a matter without full consensus of the entire body. He uses the council of Jerusalem in Acts 15 as his primary justification. Such a view is unscriptural, and not practical. He seems to look past the obvious time that Paul and Barnabas could not agree with eachother over who to take with them on one of their missions. Did Paul and Baranabas simply wait until they all agreed before they seperated? Hardly.Had Paul not moved on without Barnabas, the world would have quite a few less Christians. Or what would've happened if there was a disagreement on what to do about the prophesied famine, and the support of other churches? Folks would have starved. You cannot simply wait for everybody to agree before doing anything, because there will often be those who resist the leading of the Spirit.New believers and backslidden believers will often be the most resistant. Don't understand me wrong though, we should seek and pray that all are with one accord concerning any matter, for we are one Body. However, some members of the Body will sometimes not function as Christ would have them. It is times such as these though, when the elders must assert their authority and declare the work of God move forward as in accordance to the Holy Spirit. Viola doesn't see the elders having such &quot;authority,&quot; though it is clear in the Bible the elders must be ones who &quot;manage&quot; their own homes well. Why? If they cannot manage their own home, how can they manage the church? Viola doesn't see elders as really having any authority, just simply a more &quot;respected&quot; opinion in matters due to their maturity.However, this is where I feel Viola's book is really lacking. He wants you to buy his other book &quot;Who is your covering?&quot; to find out more about authority.Finally, Viola encourages folks to leave the institutional church. Though, he doesn't give much reason as to why. He clearly states that christians should not divide fellowship over &quot;non-essentials&quot; (Which is unbiblical; also he defines these essentials as the divinity of Christ, and His blood atonement.) So, why leave the institutional church? You will find brothers and sisters in all denominations, will you not? They will all believe these doctrines, will they not? So, Viola is looking to divide over what he defines as non-essentials.An interesting read, and has some truly great gems in it. However, a lot of the ideas he puts forth are lacking any biblical foundation. He also seems to leave one hanging on a few issues, ones that if he addressed, would've made my review of this book at least have 3 stars."},{"Title":"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament Church - Audio CD","review":"This book is for those who are desperate for change in the way they experience corporate life in the church of Jesus Christ.

It seems to unravel all of those tangled up messes that the Institutional Church seems to weave. All of his books set the captive free through his straight forward truth. Although he is straight forward, he does not attack anyone per so. He only attacks the system and justifiably so.

This book is full of mindset shattering comparisons of staus quo Christianity with the life and vitality of the first century. Viola paints a Christ-centered picture of the church in an easy-to-read format with an annotated bibliography. I consider it a must-read for all who desire to be released from the shackles of human tradition and return to the simplicity of God's heart concerning His ekklesia."},{"Title":"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament Church - Audio CD","review":"Frank Viola's book \\"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament Church\\" is 203 pages long and is divided into 11 chapters, an introduction, and an appendix. It focuses on re-examining the New Testament in order to re-think the form and function of the church which, not surprisingly, is very different than the modern Western-style building-centered, pastor-run, and spectator-type church that most people are familiar with.There are several strengths to the work. First, Viola is an experienced and itinerant church planter and author who has for many years sought to practically implement his findings of what church life and mission should look like from the New Testament records. Second, the author deals with a plethora of issue and questions from a biblical point of view, such as leadership, the church meeting, the Lord's Supper, following apostolic tradition, where churches should meet, the eternal purpose of God for the church, etc. Virtually every page is brimming with Scriptures! Third, there is an excellent chapter near the end of the book that addresses \\"trends\\" common with the church such as cell groups, mega churches, and charismatic renewal and why each of these, while useful, are not enough - they are simply reforms of the current church system, but what we really need is a revolution, a total makeover, of the church system itself!A couple of drawbacks should be pointed out. Those not used to blunt talk and those not willing to be challenged about their concept of \\"church\\", may find themselves annoyed and overwhelmed by the tone of this book. If you are able to look past the \\"straight talk\\" and focus on the content, you will be well served by the book's at times startling message. I wish there was an in-depth discussion of things like evangelism, serving the poor, large group meetings, networks of house churches, signs and wonders, etc, as important aspects of the early church, although comments here and there have been made on these matters.Overall, this is a challenging and biblical analysis of what the church should really be. It can serve as a good foundation for a new house church or house church network. Excellent job, Frank Viola!The reader should be aware that Viola published in 2008 a new expanded version called \\"Reimagining Church\\" (published by David C. Cook Publishers). It includes most of the material from his two prior books called \\"Rethinking the Wineskin\\" and \\"Who's Your Covering?\\" Readers are recommended to get this new book as well.RAD ZDERO, author of LETTERS TO THE HOUSE CHURCH MOVEMENT and THE GLOBAL HOUSE CHURCH MOVEMENT"},{"Title":"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament Church - Audio CD","review":"Very intresting, eye opening concepts in this book help to explain some of the disconnect I have been feeling in \\"church\\".

In James 5:14 the sick are told to call on the Elders for prayer. Not a Pastor or Priest.Note also that most of the Pauline epistles are addressed to communities.The author made a good point about the Lord's Supper's origin.

I am in agreement with most of what Frank says, but I had a hard time getting through this book -- to me it just seemed to ramble and wander a lot. Now, I *did* read Pagan Christianity first, and it is a first-rate book -- maybe that is why I was disappointed in this one, as it is actually the first volume of the trilogy."},{"Title":"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament Church - Audio CD","review":"Viola spends the pages of this book setting the foundation for the House Church Movement. Searching the scriptures, he lays out the case for a new beginning, or better said, a return to the first century church.Topics include: the role of the home, fellowship, church as family, leadership, and the nature of the body of Christ. Rethinking the Wineskin, in some cases, is a trumpeting call of what is wrong with the modern church.Like Gene Edward's book on the same topic, this book will not tell you how to start a home church. Rather it will persuade you, if you need it, of all the good reasons to start one."},{"Title":"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament Church - Audio CD","review":"I think Frank may be borrowing heavily from a truly groundbreaking work calledThe Normal Christian Church Lifeby Watchman Nee. He also references two other books by Mr. Nee -The Body of Christ, 10 packandThe Glorious Church. Unlike Frank, Mr. Nee is known to be very humble, not self promoting, and he actually died after about 20 years in a prison in China which he had the option of leaving before the Communists took over.As King Solomon said, there is nothing new under the sun, including in Christianity. The Bible includes everything, we just need to really get into the revelation of everything that is in it and live it in our daily life. So, what is groundbreaking aboutThe Normal Christian Church Lifefor me is how the recovery of truths in the Bible it contains are unveiled and presented for living a normal Christian life."},{"Title":"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament Church - Audio CD","review":"After experiencing salvation late in life (48), spending five years in an evangelical church, and studying the demographics of modern-day Christianity, I began asking the following question: &quot;If the church is truly the Body of Christ, why is the world changing the church more than the church is changing the world?&quot; I left the institutional church in search of an answer to that question.After studying the history of the church for two years, I found the answer in this book by Frank Viola. The answer is that so much of what we understand to be the church, today, has little or nothing to do with what Christ gave His Life to create."},{"Title":"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament Church - Audio CD","review":"I recently purchased this book by Frank Viola (who also was the 1987 World Series MVP but not the same person as this writer). The book explores the house church movement from a biblical (and somewhat historical) viewpoint.I found that I agreed with much of what Viola stated. I am a &quot;paid clergy&quot; in that I'm a full-time youth pastor nevertheless, I found that I agreed with Viola that the church is not a business but is the BODY of Christ. God works through the entire body and not only through &quot;professional&quot; Christians. All Christians are called to share their faith (Mark 16:15) and bear fruit (John 15:8). This book will teach you how house churches effectively reach unbelievers with the gospel.If you believe in today's modern system of &quot;church&quot; and you are a lazy Christian who thinks we should pay someone to do all the work of the ministry (Eph. 4:11-16) than you will not like this book. This book will make you mad and will attack those who are complacent in their ministries."},{"Title":"Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the New Testament Church - Audio CD","review":"Frank Viola has done an amazing job in researching not only Scripture but history to demonstrate life in the early Church. I highly recommend his other two books:1. Who is your Covering?2. Pagan ChristianityHis books confirmed what I have always suspected about what is wrong in the modern church.

How do we serve as priests in the local assembly? How are believers to understand their individual functionings in a meeting of saints? If you are concerned with giving the Lord what HE wants, and want to honestly consider what HIS plan for the gathering of a church is, then read this book, laying aside all traditional notions. Get out your Bible and write down all your questions, then pray and read this book! Many often say it is impossible to find a *perfect* church, but this book is definitely foundation laying as to what it means to be involved in a *functioning* church. For some it will be the confirmation of convictions that were understood and obvious but somehow often neglected - for others it will be a disturbing proposition - and for others it will be a cleansing blow. But none who read will walk away unaffected.

Frank balances fresh biblical exegesis with a broad range of scholarship and church history.OK, so why did I only give it four stars? Well, I think it could use an edit, reincorporating some of the style of the earlier printing of this book. Also--and this might be more my \\"fault\\" than the author's--I feel a growing need to address matters of justice and solidarity with the poor with regards to the communion of saints being Christ's hands and feet in the world. I say supplement this with Steve Chalke's \\"Lost Message of Jesus\\" or Shane Claiborne's \\"The Irresistible Revolution,\\" and you're getting pretty comprehensive.My bottom line: read \\"Rethinking\\" for what it is, not what it isn't.

But this author not only entertains with a fast moving story, she also manages to leave me with some food for thought.I find her work a lot like the Glady Taber journals. And the characters remind me of Aunt Bee and Andy and on the old Andy Griffin show. This is a warm, relaxing read, remiscent of a gentler time. I hope she continues on with Dorsetville. It's like ready about old friends."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"This is a good read, but for those who have read the Mitford books it will seem like a blatant rip-off. There are just too many similarities...the small town, the coffee shop, the village carmudgeon, the romance between the senior citizens, finding the lost family members, etc.etc. Personally, I found these \\"plagiarisms\\" irritating and they definitely detracted from my enjoyment of the story.In addition, and more importantly, she misrepresents Catholic doctrine and Catholic rituals several times. For example, the words used in the rite of Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) are not as she represented them. And although to non-Catholics that may seem like nit-picking, orthodox Catholics would see this as a very important point. Without the use of the proper words the sacrament is not valid. For practicing, orthodox Catholics, some of her mistakes are jarring, to say the least. She gets the Hail Mary wrong, for pete's sake!All in all, a pleasant read, but should be read with the knowledge that it is just a \\"Catholic-lite\\" version of the Mitford books, and not completely accurate in its portrayal of Catholicism, at that."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"the woman needs an editor who knows basic English grammar and punctuation.

It is so down to earth I felt like I was among the people in the story. It is an excellent read, not only for its story content but the inspiration it sends. Highly recommended reading!"},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"Katherine Valentine sets her first novel in a tiny New England town -- one that seems even smaller than Silver City and certainly more homogeneous. St. Cecilia's church fills a critical role in the lives of many townspeople, even those who aren't Catholic. They face problems ranging from life-threatening (beloved husband Bob Peterson needs a bone marrow transplant to live) to semi-comic (teenager Matthew Metcalf has been suspended from high school after hacking the teacher evaluation files).Father James Flaherty must announce the Archbishop's decision to close St. Cecilia's on Easter Sunday: the building needs expensive repairs and attendance is dwindling. Flaherty will be transferred, the eighty-two-year-old former pastor will be placed in a far-away nursing, and parishioners will be swallowed up by the five thousand members of a nearby congregation.The book's title, as well as the delightful primitive-art style cover, give away the ending. We know that the church will be saved or else the loss will be turned to triumph. We know everyone will have a happy ending.Still Valentine masterfully provides suspense on every page with the one question remaining: How will we achieve a happy ending while maintaining a twentieth century credibility? While the ending does require a couple of coincidences -- plausible, but not likely -- the author's ability to pull together the diverse strands of the story is the real miracle. It's a feel-good story that made me wish Bing Crosby could play the leading role.In an endnote, Valentine suggests the story was inspired by her own near-death experience and was written to create a miracle in her own life. Therefore, it's understandable that portions of the book (easily skipped by the uninterested reader) offer a hard sell on the Catholic religion that will remind older readers of The Silver Chalice or the final pages of Brideshead Revisited. A few pages, such as Father Flaherty's deathbed discussion, could have been omitted.Still, this well-written book offers escape entertainment as well as a message that will be welcomed by many who want to go back to the basics. At times I felt as if I had walked into a Norman Rockwell painting, but the lively style and sympathetic characters keep the pages turning. This book will find a place on many Christmas gift lists -- but I'd choose the recipient with care."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"St. Cecilia's Catholic Church has been a wonderful house of God for many many years, serving it's parishoners in good faith. But the building is in much disrepair, and funds are becoming less all the time as many of the people are older and can't contribute as they once did. The archbishop has ordered the church to close definitely after Easterservice. Father James, the priest of the church can hardly bear this thought and cannot see this happening. He knows there must be something he can do to stop this unnfortunate end, and through prayer and action tries to formulate a plan before it is too late. They are already into Lent, so there is not much time left.Lori Peterson's husband Bob is desparately ill with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. Time is getting short for Bob to find a donor, but with courage, faith, and many prayers, he receives a transplant which is successful. This is a real blessing as Bob wants to be there for his wife and 6-year-old daughter Sara.Harriet Bedford has lived with sadness her whole life through when after losing one of her granddaughters, and daughter-in-law to a tragic accident, her son disowns her for believing in God. Peter was angry and bitter after losing his wife and first daughter, and could never trust God again. It goes on this way, until ironically when Father James is called to visit his best friends wedding, and discovers that Allison, Harriet's long lost grandchild is the bride. Peter has a massive heart attack before the wedding takes place, and is going to die for certain. At his bedside, Father James is there bringing him to God and faith that he will see heaven after he dies.Through much prayer, and hope, St. Cecilia's might come to be saved. Especially when a holographic image of Mother Mary is shining up on the church, and suddenly there are mobs of people to witness it. The church begins to fill with people, and Father James prays that this is the miracle they have needed to help support and save the church. The image was made up by Matthew Metcalf though, who actually stole the equipment to set off this beautiful image from the college. And when he is discovered by the town Sheriff Bromley, he will have many questions to answer to, even though Matt had good intentions.Father James knows that God has a hand in everything, and is thrilled beyond words at what takes place just before Easter Sunday, when it was to be the church's last Sunday ever."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"Finally, a contemporary writer combines a thoroughly delightful Catholic imagination with endearing characters whose small town predicament could be from today's headlines. If this is the first of a series, then readers like me will be waiting eagerly for the next installment. What is missing from this novel is what I find offensive in so many others; Valentine's gift of scene setting is as real as her spirituality- both are a treasure to read. You will find yourself laughing, crying, in suspense and in gratitude both for the miracle and for the novelist."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"This fabulous book will have you laughing and crying. Sometimes at the very same time. You won't want it to end. The best read I've had in years."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"I bought this book for a friend, since I had already read it and did not want to part with my copy. It is out of print, but so good that I wanted to share it. I'll probably give my copy away anyway, as soon as I find another place it will do some good. The characters and setting seemed so real, and the situations so familiar to a traditional Catholic such as myself, but would be inspirational to any Christian. The story is really hard to put down, and is a real uplift. It features many memorable characters in difficult situations, always carried along by strong faith, I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"A fun and hope filled story to remind us God has a plan. Maybe not the way we think it should be, but a wonderful plan none-the-less."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"Okay, maybe it doesn't deserve a 1 star, maybe a two, but only for effort. The author is trying so hard but falls so short of being an interesting book. An avid reader of Jan Karon's 'At Home in Mitford' series, I had high hopes for this book. But it is so heavy handed with the religion that it is very uninteresting, and this from a very religious fellow. The writing isn't fluid but stilted and weak. I kept trying to like it but just couldn't."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"I love 'learning' in this easy way. This book is so full of spirituality - but in an enjoyable, not-in-your-face way - that I ended up dog-earring many pages to read over and soak it in. It's all about faith, and love, and how much God loves us. I love that. I will buy all of this author's books."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"I picked up this book on vacation with no expectations. I really enjoyed it and passed it on to a friend. It was so nice to read a positive book with a Catholic theme. My friend enjoyed it as well. I highly recommend this book and I am excited to read the others in this series."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"I am at a loss for words. This book is one in a million. It has been compared to Mitford, and that would be accurate! I recommend this book to everyone. Your faith will strengthen and be reaffirmed over and over. This book reminds us, that we are NOT on our time, but the Lord's. Don't hesitate to pick this read up and add it to your library!"},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer that this book is much, much better than the Mitford series. The characters come alive on the pages of this wonderful story of faith and hope in a small New England town. The miracles that happen to several of the parishoners are an added bonus and crackle with spiritual electricity. The author's afterward relating events from her own life blew me away. If you're in need of a little hope or just a boost to a flagging faith, then this book is for you. I plan to buy copies for both of my daughters to read."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"If you are a fan of The Mitford Series, I think you will also enjoy A Miracle For St. Cecilia's. Set in a quaint, charming, New England town, you will meet an endearing set of characters, both parishoners at St. Cecilia's, as well as the towns folk of Dorsetville. Leading the parishoners of St. Cecilia's is Father James, who learns that St. Cecilia's doors will be closed due to lack of funds. Heart-broken, Father James is distressed at what will happen to his St. Cecilia's family, who rely on the church and their friendships there, to get through life's struggles.Katherine Valentine is a gifted writer, though her style is simple, it is wonderfully easy to read, and creates a true warmth and feeling of comfort. Even though it did seem a lot like the Mitford series, it was still creative in the story lines, entertaining and insightful. For those with Christian roots, it provides some strong messages of faith &amp; hope."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"This was such a wonderful book. Do not listen to those who accuse the author of copying the Mitford series. I enjoyed the Jan Karon series but I LOVE this one. You will not be disappointed. The uplifting message of faith and hope filled my spirit."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"As a fiction lover and fan of inspirational books such as the Mitford series, I was overjoyed when I heard about the publication of A Miracle for St. Cecilia's. Why? Because in today's world, there is always a need for books emphasizing the theme of Hope - hope in times of despair when it seems that the odds are stacked so staggeringly against us. Katherine Valentine manages to spread the good news that there is good cause to believe in Hope, and she manages to tell a great story while sharing this good news.Set in the charming but declining mill town of Dorsetville, A Miracle for St. Cecilia's unites a cast of characters who, while engaged in their own personal struggles, come together to fight for a cause close to their hearts. Their beloved Catholic church, the focal point of their spiritual lives and social structure, and a source of financial and emotional support for their decaying community, is about to close. The book brings together an unlikely band of heroes: a dad with a deadly disease, a troubled young computer genious, three aging retirees (one of whom is Jewish, but a good friend to the church), a retired hunting dog, an elderly Irish priest, and the Pastor of St. Cecilia's who has great intentions but just can't seem to pull his parish out of the red ink.The story moves along nicely and pulls the reader in quickly. I fell in love with the people of Dorsetville and found myself thinking about the many communities across our country who find themselvs facing these same troubling circumstances in their own places of worship.As a Catholic, I appreciated this book for its attention to doctrinal and liturgical detail. I feel, however, that its message has broader appeal and that it will touch the hearts and souls of many. Katherine Valentine has created a wonderful book here and I look forward to reading the next in what I hope will be a series of books related to these charming characters. Treat yourself to this book, and buy it for a special friend!"},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"If you like the Mitford series, you should like this. Lots of characters with personality, some of which I can see in my own parish. I liked the message of hope and faith.

It deals with the clergy and religious as real people with faults and individual personalities who love God and their neighbor. It is refreshing to have a good Catholic everyday story. You finish the book wanting to move to a town as warm and friendly as Dorsetville where people truly care about each other."},{"Title":"A Miracle for St. Cecilia's","review":"A book that is worthwhile reading and you don't have to worry about the language. Can hold your interest and make you think of your own spirituality at the same time. I thorouoghly enjoyed this novel of suspense and togetherness.

It traces the development of Chinese mystical thought and practice from the earliest mystical and philosophical writings up through the Tang dynasty. In addition to its appeal to the scholarly community, anyone who has read and enjoyed some of the works of Chinese mysticism will find that this book provides a background in which to better understand what they have already read as well as exposing them to works they are not yet familiar with. All in all an excellent read."},{"Title":"The life of Pasteur","review":"In the first half of the 19th Century if a surgical implement was dropped on the floor during a procedure, it was simply picked up and used again. It was this fatal carelessness that Louis Pasteur fought against during his lifelong studies of the dangers of contamination and the acceptance of sterilization. In his \\"The Life of Pasteur\\", Ren&eacute; Vallery-Radot (who was Pasteur's son-in-law), following the scientific struggle against diseases which made Pasteur a household name, wrote an excellent biography, translated by Mrs Devonshire, a French savante who in her youth married an Englishman. Pasteur's was not an easy struggle. The rejection of the theory of spontaneous generation and the advancement of vaccination, not to mention his experiments on animals, were vigorously debated, and the antagonism Pasteur received was not from the lay world only, but from the professional world also. Medical doctors resented what they considered the interference from a \\"mere chemist\\". His great achievements included the saving of the silkworm crop, essential to French economy, and the protection of cattle against the scourge of charbon (anthrax). On a lighter level he sought to make French beer as delicious as German beer, and you have to admire his persistence if not his patriotism. (The word \\"pasteurization\\" was first used for beer, not milk.) Only slowly, over decades, were Pasteur's theories accepted, but he never saw this as a personal triumph. Pasteur, according to his biographer, always thought of his successes as for la gloire, the esteem of France. (Incidently, though Pasteur lived through two-thirds of the 19th Century, this book does not offer an overall historical view. The Franco-Prussian War is naturally discussed in detail because it affected Pasteur's life so deeply, but the American Civil War is never mentioned.) As for survival itself, the speculation of life in that era is made obvious: the chance of surviving an amputation or the giving of birth was about 50-50, and of Pasteur's five children only two lived to adulthood. Pasteur himself at the age of forty-six suffered a stroke which nearly killed him, but of course all those hours of research were sedentary, and I don't get the impression he was taking long walks in the Bois. Probably the most famous period in Pasteur's life was his fight against rabies, which is here called hydrophobia, and his treatment of the nine-year old boy Joseph Meister. Pasteur was taking a gamble, because if Master Meister had died, Pasteur could have gone to prison. As it happened, his research and applications saved hundreds of lives; and by the time the Pasteur Institute had opened in 1888 he had become a national treasure. Actually,the fact is that at his death in 1895 he was considered not so much a hero as a saviour. Pasteur's professional courage and his personal merit, so well reflected in this biography, were summed up by his friend Dr Roux when he observed that one could admire Pasteur's works intellectually but that one had to be close to him in order to recognize \\"la bont&eacute; de son coeur\\"."},{"Title":"Aim for a job in automotive service (Aim high vocational series)","review":"The book was from 1979 and all the info is out dates.

Certainly not for the layman though. Most of the chapters are filled with equation after equation however those with advanced math and a good math program will have lots of fun. This book is the real deal! Read it all and you just might fry your brain! It would get five stars if it was better organized. The best use of this book is for quick reference if you have a specific idea or question about the topics contained and don't or can't get to the internet.

I have been interested in computer animation, but found myself spending most of my time learning new computer programs rather than making animation. Then I would discover that the program I was trying to learn was difficult and not so useful for what I was trying to do.Finally I have been saved! This book is exactly what I have been waiting for. Steve Subotnick has cut through the unwieldy morass of information to get down to the basics. His book is easy to hold, clearly and simply written, with pleasant, easy to look at drawings of equipment and procedures by Tim Miller, and some exquisite color pages of animaion stills from animators around the world.This book takes you all the way through the processes of making an animated work and finishing it to a CD or Video which can be viewed by others. Steve saves you a lot of time by suggesting a limited amount of basic hardware and software which is flexible enough to do different types of animation, and inexpensive enough for many independent animators and schools to afford.The book is inspirational for students and teachers in that Steve has listed outstanding films and videos, considered works of art by the international animation community. The book includes a CD with samples from these films and the end results of the simple exercises in the book. He starts each chapter with a brief quote from different animators.The book is very enabling. Steve discusses how he and others get ideas and techniques. He encourages originality and creativity. He recommends that you &quot;be yourself&quot; in your animation work. I am using the book myself now and would recommend it to teachers, schools and everyone age 13 and up who is interested in learning to make animation on the computer."},{"Title":"Animation in the Home Digital Studio: Creation to Distribution (Focal Press Visual Effects and Animation)","review":"What I noticed immediately, then continued to admire throughout my reading of this book is that this little yellow book is very, very well written. I am impressed. I will use this book to teach my Animation I students, who will benefit from the history of independent animators the book provides, as well as the unbelievably detailed descriptions of the projects this animator completed. Subotnick fully describes what a digital animation studio (at home, or in the classroom) is comprised of, and describes the hardware and software tools animators may need. The book left me without questions! The CD-ROM is creative and of professional quality, and the animation clips on it show a good variety of work. This book was a welcome surprise, and an essential addition to my animation skills library!"},{"Title":"Animation in the Home Digital Studio: Creation to Distribution (Focal Press Visual Effects and Animation)","review":"As an independent film maker making the switch from 16mm to digital, this book has been indispensable. Not only does it show how to set up your studio, but also gives you estimates of the cost to step into this brave new world.And what I found truly inspirational was the CD included with the QT movies of other independent animators. Seeing other people's work has always been the best motivation for doing my own. Thank you for putting this together to save us from time wasted trying to figure this out on our own."},{"Title":"Animation in the Home Digital Studio: Creation to Distribution (Focal Press Visual Effects and Animation)","review":"This is a reader-friendly book for everyone who's ever wanted to try digital animation but who has been shy of the hi-tech world. Written from the point of view of a very empathetic instructor at Harvard and some of his students, a couple of hours reading this book will have you quickly up and running relatively inexpensive animation software programs. The emphasis is clearly on easy to manage technical solutions that encourage the reader to explore the kind of creative imagination that will produce original well-animated works. And to top it off, the book offers a wonderfully researched set of resources to help the beginning animator take all the steps necessary to stream the work on the web and to prepare and send the work to animation festivals. This is the kind of book that should be required reading in every animation department and it'll be at the top of the list for my Dartmouth students."},{"Title":"Animation in the Home Digital Studio: Creation to Distribution (Focal Press Visual Effects and Animation)","review":"This book is truly global in its scope, in both its material and in the lessons it offers. The CD included shows a great variety of styles of animation that mainstream commercial animation neglects. It includes biographies of artists along with some samples of their work.The book is very user friendly, and offers step-by-step explanations of how to animate and distribute your own film. It includes links and sources of information that are otherwise difficult to obtain, giving the reader the inside scoop on the animation field. I found the resources section of the book particularly helpful.As an artist working in the animation field, I would recommend this book to any student or veteran of animation, to open their minds to new creative possibilities. This book provides a guide for making animation that anyone with a computer and enough ambition can use to fulfill their dreams of becoming an animator!"},{"Title":"Animation in the Home Digital Studio: Creation to Distribution (Focal Press Visual Effects and Animation)","review":"I loved this book.

Growing up in the home of a Christian minister, I've spent my whole life hearing and reading about dreams in the Bible. Many times I've wondered about my own dreams. I'd like to be able to interpret them and/or find someone who can do it. And to be honest, I would love to have the \\"gift\\" of dream interpretation.This book is written by a Jungian analyst and Episcopal priest and I learned a lot about dreams through reading it. It is written from a basically Christian viewpoint - that God spoke through dreams. And, Sanford asserts, He still does. Sanford draws heavily on Jungian views on dream interpretation.In his introduction he does a careful definition of these terms:1. Ego - the conscious part of our personality.2. Unconscious - all those parts of our personality which we do not know. He prefers this term to SUBconscious, as he states that the unconscious can be as much above the ego as below it.3. Psyche - the entire personality, including the ego and the unconscious.4. Psychic - the inner energy or activity of the psyche.He does not refer to these in a spiritualist sense.He divides the book into two parts, neither of which has a specific name. He deals with the nature and structure of dreams and how they relate to the Christian life. He gives many examples of dreams in the book, and by the time you finish, you will understand dreams much better than before.I appreciate his emphasizing that you can't put dream interpretation into a box - each person's situation has to be considered as unique.I still cannot interpret my dreams. But I've learned to appreciate them even more, and who knows? Maybe some day either I will get the insight to interpret them or find someone who can."},{"Title":"Dreams: God's Forgotten Language","review":"During the course of reading this book, it gave me a sense of the power that I never realized existed. I learned to use my dreams for God to talk to communicate with me about so many areas of my life that I seemed to avoid and fear. In addition, in my dreams, it was there that I learned to face my fears and reall see the shadows of who I really am as my TRUE self. If you are ready to learn about the person that you are TRULY, then READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Dreams: God's Forgotten Language","review":"Dreams is a very good read. I found it concise and informative. I like Sanford's style and tone -- instructive and direct. His simple and direct explanations of Jungian pyschology are excellent -- all wheat, no chaff. Sanford does an excellent job of relating biblical quotes and stories to dream pyschology. Very practical and immediately useful for my own dream analysis."},{"Title":"Dreams: God's Forgotten Language","review":"As a society we are quick to look inward to analyze our dreams when in actuality we should look outward. The premise behind this book is excellent. The material, however, is a tad dry and tough to get through. If you can finish this book, you will feel truly enlightened to yourself and God's voice within you."},{"Title":"Dreams: God's Forgotten Language","review":"I loved this book. Reading it made me want to speak with this man to pick his brain, so I am sad that he passed away in 2005... not that I would have ever met him, but I like the fact that reading his book made me want to :)I was looking for a different perspective on the fascinating subject of dreams- as opposed to the typical and impersonal symbol dictionaries, which are interesting, but mostly useless as dreams are unique to each individual.This was written by a thoughtful, spiritual man who does not preach or condescend and so it seems that he was a Christian is the truest sense of the word :) This book moved me deeply and I would recommend it to anyone interested in studying dreams. Mercifully, John Sanford is no blind Bible-thumper."},{"Title":"Dreams: God's Forgotten Language","review":"One of my favorite books I have been assigned for a class (though we only used the dreams section)- and probably one of the few that I actually picked up to read again after graduation."},{"Title":"Dreams: God's Forgotten Language","review":"I read the book years ago and it has become one I have referred to many.

I highly recommend it for those interested in dream work."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Screenwriting","review":"I read this before reading Syd Field, Christopher Vogler, and the others. This book is almost intimidating in its detail, but for a self-teaching writer I recommend it above the others because:1. MORE DETAILED STRUCTURE. Frensham breaks down the structure of a script into smaller, tighter detail than simply having three acts, or three plot points. Once you know the material, cliche cliche, you can play with it, but it's revealing to see how the whole thing hangs together.2. MORE KINDS OF STRUCTURE. Having broken movie structure down by scene and climaxes, Frensham then proceeds to break it down by sequences. Additional analytical tools give you more ways to think about a movie and therefore more ways to diagnose the illnesses of your own writing.3. EXERCISES. Frensham explains a concept and then gives you homework. Go watch movies A, B, C and D and identify X, Y and Z about them. Great practice, and once you've done it with the films you know, it becomes very easy to do it with new films.4. ALL ABOUT WRITING. Frensham wastes very little time on trying to tell you how to second guess the reader, the producer or the market or whining about pet peeves or sharpening his ax for bloodshed. There is some information about marketing, but mostly this book is what it declares itself to be in its title -- a tool for teaching yourself to write.Bon appetit."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Screenwriting","review":"There's a deliciously sweet irony here in that this humble (teach yourself series) little gem of a book is, in my opinion, better organized and more comprehensive and inspiring than other big-name books (including those written by screenwriting titans Robert Mckee and Syd Field) I've read on scriptwriting. It's an intelligent, no-nonsense, nuts and bolts instruction manual that is sprinkled with humor, insight, and inspirational comments, suggestions, and encouragement.

Basically, it covers the same ground as the others but narrows it down to basic, comprehensive to-the-point terms and guidelines. Not to say that it is brief or fast-paced. It is very helpful in the sense that it covers most areas extensively with many added points and examples. I found that next to none of the other books went over the actual screenplay layout and overall structure. There was barely anything about the camera or scene direction. They were more about visual thinking, developing your own style and being competitive in the modern industry. This book explains all of that and also encourages you to explore alternative source material.I recommend this book to all beginners. It will inspire and motivate you and possibly provide you with the sort of answers you start out with. Start with this one, it is definitely shelf-worthy and good to just pick up and read a particular section if you're unsure about something. The most important thing to do in the end is write! Don't just talk about it, do it!"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Screenwriting","review":"I've read other books about screenwriting but I was always somewhat disappointed with them. I realized why after I read &quot;Teach Yourself Screenwriting.&quot; It's the only book I've seen on the subject that is really complete and comprehensive. All others have too many shortcomings. What I loved most was the way the book provides a detailed analysis of the structure of a good screenplay, clearly outlining the three act structure, the make up of scenes, the use of inciting incidents and turning points, etc. It gives specific examples of all of these elements from great scripts like &quot;Witness.&quot; The only criticism I have is that it is a little vague about subtext and dialogue. Instead of abstract descripions of these elements I would like to see examples. For example, the author could have given several examples of good dialogue side-by-side with examples of bad dialogue, etc. But overall I found the book to be very well-written and extremely helpful. I utilized it extensively while I was writing my first screenplay which is now going through the Screenwriters' Workshop on Francis Ford Coppola's American Zoetrope site and is getting good reviews. I certainly give credit for this to what I learned from this book."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Screenwriting","review":"I've been trying to get my hands on any and every screenwriting book I can find. I have the desire and ideas but I want to make sure I'm following the rules, and Mr. Frensham does a very good job explaining them. There are plenty of exercises to keep you busy for a long time before writing one word of screenplay. The underlying theme of the book is: THERE ARE NO SHORTCUTS! This book could easily take the place of one of the intensive week long writing classes being offered these days. The areas covered are Layout, Originating Your Ideas, Developing the Ideas, Creating Characters, Character Growth, Sequences and Scenes, Emotions, Rewrites, Assembling Portfolios, Copyrighting, Agents, Your Writing Career, The Industry, and finally an excellent Appendix of addresses for various screenwriting related topics. Out of the 22 chapters included, the shortest one at two pages is entitled THE ACTUAL WRITING, and if you read this book you will realize the actual writing of the screenplay is the least amount of work. A very, very, good book and it fits in my pocket."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Screenwriting","review":"Mr Frensham knows all the tricks and knows all the pitfalls. Read this book and you will have everything you need to know at a fraction of the price. No need to go to expensive script gurus and listen to their high powered sales talk. No need to read all the others on how to do the thing. Read this and then just write, and write well. The message of this book is that nothing succeeds better than having something to say and the hutzpah to make sure the right people get to see it. It is a simple lesson and sums up about everything anyone else has to say on the subject. Mr Frensham is also a little crazy and it is worth reading this just to see how a career in scriptwriting can affect one's psyche. Mr Frensham should be given a lecture tour and paid large sums of money because he is the only person who really understands the sheer idiocy of the system and at the same time has no personal axe to grind. He can also be funny"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Screenwriting","review":"In this book Frensham assumes that every novice writer is out to make millions from Hollywood. Hollywood scripts have become a formula. A formula that is often very effective but none the less a formula. However this is a great book for new writers who need to learn the rules before they start breaking them.Most importantly Frensham takes us through a step by step writing process from the generation of ideas through to editing the script. This is an important skill for new writers who are reluctant to do any prewriting.Buy &quot;Teach Yourself Screenwriting&quot; and learn about character motivation, the 3 act structure, sequences and the 8 basic stories.

Very useful"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Screenwriting","review":"\\"Teach Yourself Screenwriting\\" is a compendium of all things screenwriting. Really. This book takes two pages to fully explain what other books would use a chapter for, and considering its topic, that's incredible.The author subscribes to the three-act structure theory of storytelling, one to which I also subscribe. However, later in the book--and this goes to show just how in-depth this book is--the author covers other theories of structure in a chapter titled \\"Structural Variations\\", like \`The Hero's Journey' approach and multi-plotting.I think the secret to \\"Teach Yourself...\\" is the use of a lavish amount of diagrams, flow-charts, and tables all of which are dense with information. Every few pages, the author invites the reader to apply what they have learned in small boxed-off sections, such as this one in the \`Enhancing Emotion' chapter:In Four Weddings And A Funeral, examine the way the David character (Charles's deaf and mute brother) is handled--he has a critical role in the final wedding; we first see him only in passing, standing in the background at the first wedding reception. We next encounter him outside the cinema, and only then do we realize just who he is--and we are already one third into the film. Why was this held back for so long?Now watch Road To Perdition and note the recurring use of Michael Jr's illustrated book of The Lone RangerI don't know if I would be comfortable suggesting this as the only book on screenwriting for a novice (Story: Substance, Structure, Style and The Principles of Screenwritingis an incredible resource) but it brilliantly summarizes many if not all of the concepts of screenwriting.The only negative I can summon up (and I had to struggle for this one) is with the physical book itself: when I read, I like to mark certain important pages with post-it notes. Considering just how dense this book is, that's quite a number of post-it notes. I discovered with some disappointment that post-its pull up the ink when removed.I would go so far as to say this book must be in every screenwriter's library.

Although I cannot say it is boring, I cannot say it is easy and fun for reading either.I don't think you should read it as your first book.

Some of them were Irish Catholics, some probably Scots Catholics who immigrated with the McDonalds, and they eventually became Ulster Presbyterians. But within the Presbyterian communities of the late 1700's, early 1800's were a lot of Irish surnames. How did this happen?This book unmasks the truth behind both &quot;Protestant&quot; and Nationalist propagandized histories. Many of Elliott's conclusions are born out by my own family research.If you want to read propaganda, then you can find plenty of it out there, but if you want to look beyond received history and into a past that is very different from what is commonly held, then this is the book for you.It is probably not the first book to buy if you are new to the history of Ulster and /or Northern Ireland because it assumes you know the basics or received version of history and it is a response to it."},{"Title":"The Catholics of Ulster: A History","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone who purports to have an opinion on the causes and the solution to the Ulster conflict. The book is very much a revisionist history: Prof. Elliott's main thesis is that Ulster Catholics were not persecuted as severely as their mythology would indicate. She also shows how the actions of the Catholic Church over the past 150 years have had a negative influence on how Catholics perceive themselves. The two great strengths of the book are that it tells a coherent, though complex, story and that this story is substantiated by copious endnotes citing the sources. However, the book is not entirely objective. Furthermore, the subtle biases will be difficult to spot by anyone not already familiar with Ulster. Having been born there, I'm fairly well acquainted with Ulster history and politics. Three examples:1) Some historical incidents of persecution are not mentioned at all, or are simply de-emphasized e.g. the savagery of the Cromwellian forces after the siege of Drogheda (1649). Thus supporting the thesis that Catholic grievances are exaggerated.2) On p. 225 Prof. Elliott says that \`...Catholics felt that they could expect little from the law. At least that is what the United Irish propaganda machine now told them...' suggesting that Catholics were being misled by those elements who favored revolt against England. But on p. 224 she states that juries consistently favored Protestant vigilantes over Catholics, so evidently this part of the Ulster Catholic myth was not without foundation.3) One of the most notorious incidents of brutality perpetrated by Catholics during the Troubles, the barbaric murder of two British soldiers by a Catholic mob, is illustrated by a large photograph. Thus, (over) emphasizing the author's contention that Ulster Catholics are not simply victims. On the other hand, the depredations of the infamous Shankill Butchers, who were Protestant and viciously murdered 19 people, are not mentioned at all.Despite its shortcomings, this book is an invaluable addition to the literature on Ulster and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Catholics of Ulster: A History","review":"Marianne Elliot compiles an unique and thorough history of Catholocism in Ireland's most troubled province of Ulster. The information contained in this book is invaluable for anyone attempting to trace the roots of the current troubles in Northern Ireland, or with any serious interest in the history of this troubled island.

It gives a short biography for every player and his stats"},{"Title":"The Death of Christian Britain (Christianity and Society in the Modern World)","review":"The author Callum Brown is an oral historian based at the university of Strathclyde. The overall thesis of the book is that contrary to the prevailing secularisation paradigm rooting British religious decline in the enlightenment Britain remain Christian until relatively recently; it was the post-1960s era that spelled the death of Christian Britain and the advent of vigorous secularisation. Consequently there is an emphasis on working-class religion and its mass popularity/propogation (ie. evangelicalism). By Christian Britain therefore, Brown does not mean the religious affiliations or otherwise of the statute makers and policy formers but primarily that of the working classes. Consequently Brown offers a vigorous analysis of both religious and secular media to highlight the prevalence of evangelical moral assumptions in forming the parameters of \`respectability' for population at large. An important analysis is his two chapters on gender roles in Britain's religious life showing that Britain's women sustained the moral (Christian) worldview of evangelical/Victorian Britain more than its men. Consequently the realignment of women's sensibilities in post-1960s Britain has spelled the death of Christian Britain.Overall this book should prove interesting for all those interested in the secularisation of Britain, Church history, the history of interaction of gender and religion/society and those interested in the history of evangelicalism. Read in Conjunction with Shaw and Kreider (Eds) Culture and the Nonconformist tradition this is a useful book.However, whilst I understand the need why the book basically comprises of three-quarters pre-amble before one reaches the actual point (ie the 1960s and secularisation) which at times did grate. Also, it would have been interesting to see a wider ecclesiastical survey than the evangelicalism offered. For instance, to have seen a discussion on the more radical movements such as Quakerism and Pentecostalism (although this would, admittedly only have been a early 1900s phenomena) with their more overtly egalitarian emphasis. This said, however, The Death of Christian Britain is an interesting book that usefully counterbalances the prevailing assumptions of the securalisation paradigm as applied to the British context."},{"Title":"The Death of Christian Britain (Christianity and Society in the Modern World)","review":"It happened in 1963. That's when Christianity in Britain died. Till I read this book I had wrongly thought in terms of a slow erosion of faith. In the late 19th C the unholy trinity of Darwin, Freud, and Marx had injected enough poison into European thought to kill the roots of traditional Christian faith even in Britain, the land of the Puritans and Wesley, and this was speeded up by liberal theology eager to bring religion in line with modern thinking. So by the outbreak of the First World War, the greenery was still visible, but the roots were weak. The first war, followed by the great crash, fascism, another war, and the holocaust then shouted from the rooftops, what the roots had long suggested: Christianity was dead. And so we move into the post Christian era. Brown shows this scheme of things to be wrong. Focusing on the period from 1800 to 1950 both the statistics and more importantly the print media - novels, magazines, tracts - he proves that Christianity was absolutely the dominating cultural force in Britain, and in contrast to the idea of an erosion of faith after the second war, church attendance actually rose in the 1950's, what he calls between 1945 - 1958, a \`return to piety'. So what happened in 1963? The Hull librarian poet Larkin has part of the answer:Sex was invented in 1963, between the Chatterley trial and the Beatles' first LP.But it's a little bit more complicated than more sex and people turning their backs on traditional Christian morality. That has been happening furtively since the beginning of time. What was different in 1963 was the reaction of women. Brown shows that in the Christian culture women had played a crucial role of being the ones who tamed men and brought them into the church. In novels and magazines the women were always the domestic saints, the men the potential prodigals. In the 1960's women were no longer ready to be the guardians of the Christian home, and this rejection of \`pious femininity destroyed the evangelical narrative'. Traditional magazines that used the old story of steadfast women taming men failed to sell, new ones like \`Jackie' giving women an independent agenda did. With this rejection came a massive exodus from the church...and so, along with the better known forces of secularisation at work, it was the daughters of Eve who ate the Apple label, and let Christianity die. It's a stimulating thesis and well worth reading - but I don't think the author gives enough credit to the impact that two world wars between two \`Christian' nations had on everyone's psyche. It wasn't just women swapping church for the Beatles. It was also a deep distress that somehow Christianity hadn't worked which the children picked up from their parents. The tragic irony is of course that in fact Christianity, even the lukewarm Anglican fare of the 1930's had worked. It had inspired a generation to combat Nazism. This makes the liberal fascist revolt of the 1960's an even worse betrayal."},{"Title":"Crossing Waters, Crossing Worlds: The African Diaspora in Indian Country","review":"I selected this as a required text for our Native Americans and African Americans: Impact of Early American Racial Polices on Contemprary Native American and African American Blended Racial Identities course.Students readily engage in the readings to prepare for their criticla thinking class discussions (culture vs. race)from this text and other assigned readings."},{"Title":"The Enticement of the Forbidden","review":"This is one of the most important books on the subject of personal integrity and maintaining purity in a marriage or an individual life that I have seen in recent years.

It explains the \\"third force\\" of our social-economic system: philanthropy, and its pivotal role in insuring the successful functioning of free-enterprise in the economic sphere and democracy in the political sphere.The balance struck between capitalism and democracy is what matters, she says. And that balance is struck by acts of generosity.\\"Generosity is capitalism's open and pragmatic acknowledgement that, since democracy's freedoms enhance capitalism's economic powers, then democracy deserves assets from capitalism that contribute to its strength.\\" P. 23. \\"Capitalism needs democracy's value to remain defensible in society. Conversely, democracy needs capitalism's wealth creation for pursuing justice and opportunity for all.\\" (p. 21)Gaudiani makes the point that philanthropy (including volunteerism and giving) has been a critical component to the success of the American culture. It was particularly strong in the earlier part of the 20th century: during the \\"Progressive Era.\\" Since 1970, however, the philanthropic urge has dissipated in relative terms. Because the distribution of wealth continues to get more skewed, and with the conservative trend in today's politics and zeitgeist fostering further disparities between rich and poor and the dismantling of social services such as universal health and social security, the need for philanthropy is never before greater.But the need isn't simply for more dollars to be given. The crisis is in understanding generosity and how it is part of human happiness. A correct understanding of self interest is needed, she says.We are at a crossroads and a crisis in our sense of philanthropy and generosity, according to Gaudiani. And, with the incredible rise in millionaire families, the next 30 years will see a class of people who face the choice: keep it all for myself and my children, or give some to insure that the society and culture in which I live will continue to thrive and be great.It is the American tradition of generosity, according to Gaudiani, and not religion, empathy, or social pressure, that is the most likely cultural force that will sustain the philanthropic spirit. P.168.Gaudiani speaks in terms of universal human values and wisdom (generosity is a value shared by all world cultures), and forcefully shows with example after example how this force operated in US history. Thus, her book is a great example of interpretive speaking for concrete social action. Her words invoke a cultural shift, and disclose a new world of possibility, while showing us that it can be based on beliefs we already hold, and actions that we already do. She does not introduce new metaphysical premises, but merely reframes, reconfigures, and adds emphasis to what is already within our capacity.The strength of the book is its organic vision of philanthropy as necessary to fulfill democracy in a free enterprise economy; its comprehensive overview of the main areas of social capital (human, physical, and intellectual capital) and the scores of historical examples of how generosity and philanthropy made important investments in social capital; and its pragmatic program, with specific targets for philanthropy (e.g. increased home ownership by the poor) and plethora of possible mechanisms to achieve these targets (e.g. microlending, ROSCAs, matching donation banks, among others).The questions that went unanswered by Gaudiani's book, for me, are in the realm of psychology and personal, emotional intelligence. Gaudiani speaks to the need for finding that \\"correct understanding of self interest\\" where giving, generosity, and concern for the collective is part of one's personal happiness. She references Enlightenment philosophy about living the good and honorable life, and the new direction in 'behavioral economics'. But she is light on detailing the emotional and psychological dimensions of generosity and altruism. How do I embody a generous outlook and make it work in my life? What does my motivation feel like when I pursue my self interest as incorporating the greater good? What do my interpersonal relationships look like? How do I balance my ego's need for recognition and my concern for others? How do I get from co-dependence to interdependence? How do I transcend my fears of not having enough money or not being good enough so that I am compassionate and know a sense of interconnectedness?Gaudiani's case is compelling from an objective, systems point of view. And I agree, from this standpoint, with her provocative point: America is rich because it is generous (not vice versa). But from the subjective, personal, 'human interior' point of view, I still wonder how I can be generous and successful. From a personal standpoint, it seems, I can't be generous until I am rich. Perhaps the psychological aspects are for another book.Gaudiani points to the world's culture wisdom traditions as providing the possibilities for restoring generosity as a prominent value in society. Generosity is truly a universal human value. All cultural traditions esteem it highly. The very concept of human being in the Chinese tradition incorporates benevolence. The Hindu concept of Ahimsa includes sharing one's prosperity with others. The Islamic tradition discourages interest and debt-based financial cooperatives in favor of equity sharing arrangements.Gaudiani suggests that the cultural diversity of the US - with all the wisdom traditions represented here - is a huge untapped asset for bringing forth new understandings of generosity in our culture. This multidimensional value, that interpenetrates all domains of life, can be re-energized in our culture, she suggests, by encouraging the different ethnic traditions to bring it out.To me this is an area where citizen discussion groups and workshops could play a big role. These programs would have individuals come together to share their experiences and emotions around the realities of making a living, taking care of oneself, and taking care of others. This is a big complex thing for people to work on, and it is better done within groups, not by individually reading a book. If a companion book is to be written to Gaudiani's important current book, it would be a guidebook for discussion groups to unpack these many personal, life history, and cultural aspects around self interest, the pursuit of happiness, and cultural renewal."},{"Title":"The Greater Good: How Philanthropy Drives the American Economy and Can Save Capitalism","review":"Any leader, executive, or member of our world society can learn and immediately benefit from this book. Dr. Gaudiani is one of the most exceptional and worthy leaders of our time. Her words of wisdom in this book exemplify the essence of her daily leadership practices. Just as the best leaders of our time have displayed, she is optimistic about human behavior and motivation. Critics' opinions expressed only underscore her importance and our need for her as a leader. Ironically, these opinions bring to light the necessity for a civil society and the &quot;Greater Good.&quot; Where there is resistance, there is dissatisfaction with the current state in a social system, and Gaudiani is the ideal leader to provide the vision and first steps to bring us to a more democratic, unified, and satisfied state. Read this book with an understanding that you are learning from an exceptional, understanding, compassionate, highly emotionally intelligent, extremely knowledgable, cultured, worldly leader."},{"Title":"The Greater Good: How Philanthropy Drives the American Economy and Can Save Capitalism","review":"\\"Most people think that Americans are generous because we are rich. The truth is that we are rich...because we are generous...&quot; So writes Claire Gaudiani. Why should Christians read this book? We don't want to save &quot;Capitalism,&quot; do we? Perhaps not, but we know we'd miss it, if it was destroyed. Yes, the Christian community ought to find time to read this wonderful book on the history of American Philanthropy and how it has, in the past, played a vital role in helping to maintain the uniqueness of the American experiment. More importantly, Gaudiani explains the perils of our current &quot;giving habits,&quot; the cultural reasons for the trend, and solutions to restore the spirit of philanthropy. She writes, &quot;As more of us are better able every year to satisfy our wants and needs, we are not sharing a larger percentage of our income and wealth. We are retaining it in savings or spending it on ourselves and our families. Yet some segments of the population...are experiencing reductions in their well-being, notably children.&quot; Christians for the most part should appreciate America's history of philanthropy, for much of it stems from either the Judeo-Christian worldview or simply from a genuine Christian faith that seeks to &quot;give away what God has given to make other people's lives better.&quot; The Christian community should also find a welcome friend in her words: &quot;Philanthropy has, in the past, been quicker than government to imagine, test, and implement innovative methods for solving social problems.&quot; Of all people and social groups, the Christian community should read this book, if for anything to learn to appreciate the history of Philanthropy. Giving and developing strategies for philanthropic adventures are more than mere altruism. After reading Gaudiani's book, I find that philanthropy of any kind (American or Christian charity) is the human experience where self-interest and compassion are not in conflict. It is in the best interest of Americans (dare I say Christians) to ensure that everyone has access to the American Dream--the dream of upward mobility. In the humble opinion of this reviewer, more Christian communities and churches should design their own philanthropic adventures and meet the social needs that are knocking on their church doors."},{"Title":"The Greater Good: How Philanthropy Drives the American Economy and Can Save Capitalism","review":"With a hopeful view on the first decades of the twenty-first century, Claire Gaudiani presents in her book the stage on which a bold philanthropy and a democratic capitalism could act to sustain the nation's economic prosperity, by further advancing the cause that philanthropy could save American capitalism from its unfolding negative directions. She links her argument to rights that have forged the American culture from the founders' ideals to generations of immigrants' hopes: the opportunity for upward mobility, and the pursuit of happiness.In essence, Gaudiani's aim is to build a compelling case about the role of philanthropy in the U.S. economy. Several factors concur to justify her mission: 1) the brand of U.S. capitalism that demands lower taxes, hence reduces resources for supporting the \\"social health\\" (153) of the nation; 2) the poorer 20% sector of the population that remains at a poverty level and could \\"become angriest\\" (150); 3) a kind of philanthropy that \\"enables people to build wealth, not dependency\\" (151). In many ways the author reaffirms the last point throughout the entire book, capturing early its relevance, as she states in the introduction \\"philanthropy is an investment in our democracy and our economy\\" (10).Ultimately, Gaudiani appeals to the reader to see how an engaging and bold philanthropy would be the fitting strategy and the force for successfully promoting change in the directions of American capitalism, as well as for saving it, by moving it toward a more efficient and socially responsible democratic capitalism."},{"Title":"The Greater Good: How Philanthropy Drives the American Economy and Can Save Capitalism","review":"I felt compelled to write this review because of the poor content by some of the other contributors -- one who didnt event read the book and the other ranting a personal attack with no focus on the book itself.As a teacher, Colleen Kyle should know better than anyone else to actually read books before judging them. She might find herself actually learning something from the research of others. This is not a history book, and it doesnt claim to be one. Its encouraging people to re-think philanthropy and the long term impact generosity can have by showing how we have all benefitted from private giving already.Mr. Chuck Jones needs to spend more time actually giving something back to society and little less time complaining about those who choose to take the personal and professional risks required to be a leader.I would encourage people to read Gaudiani's book, to learn about how generosity affects society, and then think about what they can do in their local community to improve the lives of the less fortunate."},{"Title":"The Greater Good: How Philanthropy Drives the American Economy and Can Save Capitalism","review":"The Philanthropic Revolution started thousands of years ago in the fields of Eygpt when people then new that we need to &quot;care&quot; for each other.

Excuse me? It was a federal law using federal monies for the greater good of the nation. Everyone paid for it.As a former fundraiser, I know (as does Ms. Gaudiani) that motivations for philanthropy are rarely entirely altruistic: ego and self interest are huge motivators, as is the current tax system which provokes wealthy individuals to make donations to institutions of their choosing. Politicians going back to Alexander Hamilton have understood this. I applaud the largesse of the American people, but an argument that, among other flaws, compares our rate of giving with Breat Britain's, a country whose inhabitants pay higher taxes for the greater good of all citizens, seems specious.I advise those considering purchasing this book to get their American history from more reliable sources."},{"Title":"Tails","review":"The author knows how to keep the audience intrigued and wanting more throughout the book.

'Fysche' has merely combined text messaging slang with 'netspeak'.

Fysche creates a genuinely unique and innovative literary style, which transports the reader into a totally original, brashly-told story that will have you laughing out loud on one page, and pondering some seriously deep observations on another.This is a book about a free spirit written as only a truly free spirit could, forsaking the \\"rules and regulations\\" of writing, and embarking on a totally new literary path. With such a paucity of originality and creativity in today's literary scene, other authors would be well advised to learn from Fysche's example.Fysche may not be a household name yet, but the odds are that students of literature will be reading and studying Fysche's books long after the bulk of today's uninspired \\"best seller\\" novels are long forgotten."},{"Title":"Tails","review":"Fysche has stretched the limits of the english language in &quot;Tails.&quot; The oft criticized, rarely understood Fysche delivers a stark autobiographical journey in this book.

Should anyone actually find Fysche \\"new and refreshing\\", I suggest they read any number of books geared towards the preteen/teen set, most notably works by Francesca Lia Block.

The dialogue and characters lacked excitement. However, the static setting did showcase an interesting plot. Despite the lackluster personalities and conversations, I was drawn to the conflict Ibsen presented: the state of confusedness Nora slipped into in considering whether it was right to listen to the blatantly biased society she lived in, which revolved around men or to follow her own natural instincts. She had forged with good intentions, but the reality of her action caught up with her. In Nora's world, a world driven by her husband's needs, desires, and commands, she believes she is helping him by taking out a loan. The laws, accusation, judgings are all man made, preventing her from ever getting away with her well-meant deeds. I was thoroughly impressed by Ibsen's underlying themes, especially in his time of reservedness and anti-feminism. He accurately depicted the lifestyle of so many women in his time: as mere playthings, objects of desire, moved about in a cookie-cutter dollhouse by manipulative husbands. A Doll's House can be regarded not only as an accurate portrayal of life for women but also as a social commentary on the wrongs of it."},{"Title":"Henrik Ibsen's a Doll's House & Hedda Gabler (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"I have aleardy read it more than 6 times ,and Im still feeling that I would like to read it again.Because it makes you release how Ibsen had extraordenary sensetivly.And it learns you how to deal with your wife."},{"Title":"Friday the 13th (Friday the Thirteenth)","review":"Because there were Few Detals about the Plot of this Book or even what kind of Book this is Someone needs to Point out just what this BOOK ISFirst of All THIS IS A 1981 CHILDREN'S BOOK about a little boy who thinks he is having Bad luck because it is Friday the 13thIT HAS NOTHING TO WITH THE FRIDAY 13TH HORROR MOVIES OF THE SAME NAME WHAT SO EVERI am Posting this so there will be No more Confuseion with the Novelization of the Horror Movie Friday the 13th by Simon Hawke."},{"Title":"A copybook for Japanese ink-painting: Edited by Reiko Chiba","review":"the size is comfortable and portablei've already found a few designs i'd like to copyi plan to use them in making cards for birthdays and christmas"},{"Title":"Christmas,","review":"Many years ago I purchased this book in its original version - written and illustrated by Dick Bruna with the English Verse by Eve Merriam.

Whether your interest is in spirituality, medicine, bodywork, healing, cultural anthropology, psychology, or science, you'll want to read this book. It goes beyond the paradigms that exist in the world today to a new understanding that shines light on all arenas of life. Speaking from his own spiritual experiences as well as from his background in the sciences, the author talks about how reality itself is constructed, and what it means to be fully human and functioning on all levels of our being. He writes in a simple way that is understandable to everyone. He offers his knowledge - and some questions left untouched for the reader to ponder - in short, winding stories and personal anecdotes. These are interspersed with clear graphics and light-hearted cartoons. Dr. Mamas writes in a voice that is personable, down to earth, rational, and honest. The sections on quantum physics never become intellectually inaccessible or dry, and the segments relating his subjective mystical experiences never become glamorized, ludicrous, or flighty. I felt I could spend a lifetime sifting through the layers of knowledge in this book, and have fun doing it.

Infrequently we get an idea of Dr De Bono - almost in a state of anxiety about getting on a plane, ignoring said biographer as he first appears at De Bono's gate. These, while interesting, are overpowered by an almost overzealous need to praise everything that De Bono has done.We read that De Bono churns out another book mid flight: no criticism, no effort to understand if this new book adds much to what has gone before. Rather, we are left with the uneasy feeling that Dudgeon is in awe of his subject, afraid to wonder if any book written in several hours can really be an addition to what has gone before.Although I happen to enjoy most of De Bono's work I couldn't help but feel that this book is something that De Bono would be proud of: &quot;Simplicity&quot; is one every page. Nothing is examined beyond the most cursory of thought. It's the only biography that I know of so, if you're desperate, grab a copy. Otherwise - spend your time elsewhere."},{"Title":"Murder in Shakespeare's England","review":"Murder in Shakespeare's England is not quite what you might expect. For one thing it is not really set in the England of Shakespeare but in that of the Stewart kings, the era of the Great Fire of London, of the later plague years, of war with the Dutch, and of Pepys' Diary. As lurid and suggestive as the title is, the book is actually a well researched study of the social mores and expectations of the average person of 17th Century England.As the author, Professor Vanessa McMahon, suggests these are individuals not always given a voice in other sources. They tend to be people whose lives are difficult to access in the general way of things. Many were probably only marginally literate, most held no distinctive political or social posts in society. The author cleverly manages to create at least a shadowy image of life for these men and women by looking at the documentation of inquests and of murder trials where the depositions of average people shed light on the life of their time.To a great extent, the book merely verifies the picture presented in general texts on the period. Legal documents are very terse, and in many cases the deponents are not really given the voice the author suggests, because significant redaction was done by the clerks responsible for presenting the data. Also the records tend to be incomplete, so outcomes are not always recorded. Much of the profile of contemporary people the author presents is therefore stilted. Women, children, servants and the elderly are characterized as subject to routine household violence by males who are expected to be violent by virtue of their \\"nature.\\"To some extent this is true even among the world's cultures and social classes today, but to make a broad generalization from the few responsible for the violence and the victimization to all people would be as unrealistic as denying that such events occur at all. In the instance of Murder in Shakespeare's England, the nature of the data source would be expected to skew the profile in the former direction. The author does point this out in the text, but I felt that the picture was still a grim one. My observation of cultures where women, for instance, are viewed as oppressed by westerners-as in the Middle East-suggests that the dynamics of the culture are such that it is not always experienced from within in quite the way that outsiders suppose. This would be true of life in the 17th Century as well. That is not to say that a modern person plunked down in the 17th Century wouldn't experience major cultural shock. In fact they would. Experience and expectations form a major portion of our sense of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong.\\" Technology and living conditions also play a part.The author makes the maximum use of every scrap of data she has mined from the records at her disposal, and the bibliography and notes reflect this. So does the text, which tends to repeat some facts and conclusions in several places, giving the reader a feeling of deja vu. I have the distinct feeling that this is a dissertation presented as the author's first offering to the \\"publish or perish\\" gods. If so, it's not bad. She captures the imagination by painting a picture of the life and times of the 17th Century that is replete with interesting characters: feisty neighbors, pathetic and helpless social outcasts, irritable servants, difficult wives, soldiers away from home and family, etc. The setting has the novelty of the past, with the familiarity of a culture that is distantly ancestral to our own. It's well worth reading.FOR THOSE WRITING PAPERS: in history, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and criminal justice. Is it valid to use this type of data to construct a picture of society? What effect does the source of data have on the conclusions? Is there any way to provide a contrasting image? History can give us the facts about what happened in a given situation, but interpretation of those facts draws upon the cultural expectations and experiences of the writer; how might an anthropologist or a sociologist look at the same data set that this author did and interpret it differently? If you were to look at life in the 1950's suburbs or rural areas, do you think you could find similar expectations and behaviors as those the author identifies as characteristic of 17th Century people? What types of social pressures existed on people that might produce similar behaviors? The author discusses some of the ways in which the courts were unequal in their handling of cases from one person to the next. How has the criminal justice system changed over time with respect to dealing with gender, racial, ethnic, economic, and other parameters?"},{"Title":"Murder in Shakespeare's England","review":"\\"Murder in Shakespeare's England\\" is well-researched study of crime in seventeenth century England and how it was both perceived and punished. Although the title and cover art suggest otherwise, the book is not a collection of gruesome murder stories and bloody punishments. Professor Vanessa McMahon focuses instead on the role that the English public played in the justice system, from apprehension of a criminal to evidence collection to trial testimony to final judgement.McMahon's research unearthed some illuminating information about the courts system of that period. I always assumed that the seventeenth century English law was harsh and vindictive, with trials being a mere prelude to a slow death at the stake or gibbet. Unfair cultural expectations did creep into statute: if a woman killed her abusive husband, she was automatically guilty of petty treason and subject to execution. (Men, on the other hand, had the option of pleading self-defence when they killed, as violence was considered to be part of the male psyche and justifiable in certain circumstances.) But Professor McMahon demonstrates that juries weren't typically ruthless and unfair in their verdicts: it wasn't unusual for them to acquit rather than subject a sympathetic defendant to a horrible death. They did react harshly to criminals that fitted popular stereotypes, such as the evil Papist foreigner or wicked female poisoner, but on the whole they showed more common sense and leniency than I had presumed.Readers seeking an anthology of old English murder stories might be put off by the cultural and sociological analyses that dominate the book. What has to be understood is that this is not a true crime work per se. Professor McMahon's aim in writing \\"Murder in Shakespeare's England\\" was not titillation, but enlightenment. Viewed from that perspective, she has succeeded admirably."},{"Title":"The Highwayman (Irish Eyes)","review":"I thought this was a fantastic read! The hero did not conform to the sterotype so often found in romance novels - he was feeling without being wimpy and strong without being heartless. The dialogue was intelligent - so often books written about Ireland or with Irish characters write the dialogue in the most unbelievable fashion - playing on all the stereotypes about the Irish. This is another thing that I liked about the book - it was historically accurate and avoided so many sterotypes people make about the Irish. I read many romance novels and am aware of many of the conventions that appear in every romance novel (i.e. there's always a happy ending), but I think that this novel has a certain freshness about it that I found very enjoyable.Finally, I'd like to address the criticism that the book asks the reader to believe the heroine recognizes the hero even when no one else does. This overlooks one of the central conventions of the romance novel - in this medium, lovers always have a special connection, so it didn't surprise me at all that she recognized him. Further, I think the reason that Elizabeth is able to recognize Neville is because she is new to the community and has not been subjected to the preconceived idea that he is incapcitated, etc.I think that people who enjoy a good romance will find this a supremely satisfying read!"},{"Title":"The Highwayman (Irish Eyes)","review":"I have been following this author through several romances, and for my taste, she is one of the strongest writers in the genre.

As their story unfolds, we see the face that Neville shows to the world, while Elizabeth slowly discovers the man he truly is. The growing tension between the couple, well after they have taken their marriage vows, allows the reader to savor the passion that must come once the two lovers finally believe in each other.*It's a great read.

In a card game with Lord Wentworth, Neville wins the Kilmara estate, but must marry his opponent's daughter Elizabeth, to whom the land is entailed, to gain the land.Lady Elizabeth travels from her home in Ireland to meet her new betrothed Neville in Ireland. Nasty highwaymen attack her coach, but Gentleman Niall rescues her from the vile thugs. Elizabeth finds herself attracted to her savior, but knows she must marry her intended Lord Neville. When she meets her fianc&eacute;, Elizabeth realizes he is Gentleman Niall, who does not trust his new spouse as his enemies have hired a bounty hunter who believes Elizabeth can identify Gentleman Niall. To his chagrin, Neville wants his wife who loves him with all her heart.The lead characters and the support cast feel genuine and the fast-paced story line is loaded with action. However, the attraction between Neville and Elizabeth takes a long time to start and even longer to connect, leaving the audience to wonder if the novel is historical fiction with a touch of romance instead of historical romantic suspense. Still, the tale is well written for those historical fans that enjoy a strong plot with the romance serving as a secondary vehicle.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Highwayman (Irish Eyes)","review":"This is a good story set in Ireland in 1718. Kelleher does a good job of developing intriguing characters and paints vivid pictures of the conditions in Ireland at a time when the Irish suffered under English landlords who cared little for them.One Irish earl, Neville, Earl of Clonmore, decides to do something for his people, so he becomes a \\"Robin Hood,\\" a highwayman, \\"Gentleman Niall.\\" Realizing he needs the Kilmara estate owned by Sir Oliver Wentworth to accomplish his night deeds, he gambles with Sir Oliver and wins the prize only to learn it is the dower property of Sir Oliver's daughter, Lady Elizabeth. As a result, Neville has gained more than Kilmara--he has gained a wife, an English noblewoman. When he meets Elizabeth, he is enthralled with the innocent beauty but he knows his other life and his scars from the past he wears on his face will keep them from any kind of real marriage so he vows to stay away from her.A few nits that should have been caught: (1) Elizabeth is the daughter of a baronet, addressed as \\"Sir\\" like a knight but his daughter would be addressed as \\"Miss\\" not \\"Lady.\\" (2) When he is wounded, he is too weak to lift her out of the bath but he could lift her down from a horse...what? (3) Rory O'Connell is killed on page 138 but is then seen taking place in a rescue attempt on page 248.

He is now faced with the dilemma of maintaining his distance from an all too attractive and knowing wife while attempting to commit one last daring deed as Gentleman Niall. Anne Kelleher has a delightful writing style that combines plenty of description with straightforward narrative. The plot of the story, however, leaves something to be desired as far as originality is concerned. Also, she asks the reader to suspendbelief on a critical turning point in the story. Lady Elizabeth recognizes her masked husband after one brief encounter with Gentleman Niall when the people of the community have failed to make the connection for a number of years.

This adventure takes place immediately after the events that the Doctor and Steven had experienced during the Daleks' Master Plan, as the TARDIS materializes in late 16th century France, a time of great religious strife as tensions continue to mount between the Catholics and the Protestants. This adventure is chocked filled with all sorts of intrigue, conspiracy, political and religious machinations and manipulations, moments of intense drama, this adventure truly captured the period and to a certain extent did an admirable job in fleshing out the details behind this particular moment in history.in an unusual move, the one who is pretty much thrust into the spotlight in Peter Purves, who portrays Steven Taylor. For the Doctor leaves his company to meet with a legendary apothecary named Charles Preslin. Steven later befriends several of the Hugenots, including a young servant girl named Anne Chaplet, and embroiled in a plot to massacre all the French Protestants. To make matters worse, one of the people involved in the horrific plot is the Abbot of Amboise who bears an uncanny resemblance to the Doctor. Since neither the Doctor nor the Abbot are seen together at the same time, it increases and deepens the mystery as to whether the Abbot is the Doctor in disguise or if the Abbot is simply the Doctor's physical double.William Hartnell did an extraordinary job as the Abbot, showing a calm, almost cold demeanor, with a very confident air of authority and restrained maliciousness, quite different to his portrayel of the Doctor.Peter Purves became the star of this piece, and proved himself to be quite able to carry this adventure without being second fiddle to William Hartnell. his lack of understanding of the historical situations occurring around him, allow us the chance to experience these events as Steven perceives them, from a very fresh perspective. his anger towards the Doctor near the end for allowing Anne to possibly die in the ensuing chaos is definitely worth noting, for he is in his right to be angry and upset, but only because he lacks a certain level of understanding the Doctor's reasons. And the brief monologue given by the Doctor in the TARDIS console room when he is left alone for a few moments, is so moving as we get a real glimpse of the Doctor's vulnerable emotional side, and an understanding of his loneliness.excellent acting, excellent story."},{"Title":"The Massacre (Doctor Who)","review":"I'm reviewing this work based on its technical merit rather than its content. As a fan of Doctor Who, having this piece of missing history is worth it, regardless of whether it is poor or not. The problem with this production is that the narrations, provided by Peter Perves (sp?) are short and rather nondescriptive. In listening, you are sometimes left a little confused as to who is who in the story. Some more detailed explainations are in order here."},{"Title":"The Massacre (Doctor Who)","review":"The historical story \\"The Massacre\\" (or sometimes mistakenly referred to as \\"The Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve\\") is a true classic in every sense of the word. Markedly different from the submitted version of John Lucarotti's story, this version sees Steven Taylor, the Doctor's sometimes impatient, but always heroic astronaut companion, as the star of the show. And Peter Purves shines through indeed. Proving he was a worthy companion.From the moment he is left on his own in Paris, while the Doctor goes off to indulge his scientific curiosity, Steven gets caught up in the intrigue between the Huguenots (the French Protestants) and the Catholic Queen Mother. Fortunately for us (the viewer/listener), Steven hasn't a clue about the history of the world in 1572, which moves the story along very well as we learn through his eyes how the Hugeunots are treated by the then current regime.In this version Steven catches a glimpse of the Abbot of Amboise, who looks amazingliy like the Doctor himself. The Abbot is played, of course, by William Hartnell as, I can only assume, to give the lead actor something to do in this adventure as the companion takes centre stage. The part of the Abbot is limited at best. And, Hartnell's performance suggests a boredom by the actor.Despite this, we are treated to an incredibly in-depth depiction of the events of the time, where the guest cast, as well as our would-be star Steven Taylor, only serve, as was meant by these early historicals, to entice the viewer/listener to go back to the history books and study closer this period of French History. Wonderful stuff! And, Peter Purves shines through, keeping this adventure interesting from start to finish. Whether you are listening to these CDs or reading John Lucarotti's very different novelization, you'll still be entertained. Wonderful stuff, and definitely the (often overlooked) shining star of Doctor Who's Third Season."},{"Title":"The Massacre (Doctor Who)","review":"The BBC, in the days before home video, decided that some of its programs were no longer required in its archives. In a somewhat unsystematic purging, many classics were consigned to the flames, including several Doctor Who stories. Fortunately, some fans of the series had made their own audio recordings, and these (following a thorough re-mastering by the BBC) are being released.'The Massacre' is one of these releases. This story is a historical, set in Paris in 1572. The entire tone of the story is dark, with doom hanging over the proceedings as the story moves towards the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day.The Doctor and his companion, Steven Taylor, are separated in the first episode and Steven becomes the main character in the story. This is fairly unusual as, since, apart from the first few stories, it is the Doctor and not his companions who are firmly placed on centre stage. This situation leads to a twist: another character, the Abbot of Amboise, looks exactly like the Doctor. Steven is believes he is the Doctor in disguise, but the people around Steven regard his as a villain. Who is correct?This makes 'The Massacre' an odd choice to release on CD. The first appearance of the Abbot is a non-vocal one, so unlike the television watchers at the time of its release, we only know this thanks to the linking narration (provided by Peter Purves, who plays Steven). Given the very different approach that William Hartnell takes for the Doctor and the Abbot, the lack of visuals to emphasise this detracts from the story.For people not used to Doctor Who's early historical stories, this one is perhaps a little grim. However, as a story showing the power of events and their capacity to crush whoever gets in their way, it is excellent. This is a story where the Doctor is not the superhuman that some later stories portray him as."},{"Title":"The Massacre (Doctor Who)","review":"This amazing story was written around the time when television in the UK was basically radio with pictures. This is now why the story works so well as an audio. This was my first BBC Radio Collection cd and the surprise shock of the Abbot of Amboise looking exactly like the Doctor isn't missed. The author, John Lucarotti was upset that this element was added to his story and rewritten while he was on holiday, which makes one wonder how such a superb story could be any better."},{"Title":"Dark Side of the Street","review":"In Dark Side of the Street, British Intelligence generously allows Scotland Yard to utilize the services of one of its most able agents, Paul Chavasse.

Translated by Robert Aitken, Philip Whalen, et al. 356 pp. San Francisco: North Point Press, 1985 and reprinted.Eihei Dogen (1200-1253), who was an exceptionally gifted child, was born into an aristocratic household in Kyoto. The death of his mother when he was eight years old so impressed upon him the central Buddhist truth of impermanency, that he forsook his aristocratic privileges when he was thirteen and went to Mt. Hiei to study to become a Buddhist monk.But since no-one in Japan could satisfactorily answer his questions - not surprising when you consider that he was the greatest genius Japan has ever produced - he went off to China in 1223 in search of a Master. There he studied under the Soto Ch'an (Zen) Master Ju-ching (1163-1228), attained enlightenment, and returned to Japan to become the founder Japanese Soto Zen.Zen first became known to the West largely through the writings of D. T. Suzuki, who was a follower of the 'Sudden Enlightenment' or direct koan-using Rinzai Zen. Soto Zen, in contrast, is a gentler method which places greater reliance on Zazen or deep meditation, and is the method that has gained the largest number of adherents in Japan.To discover just how profound Dogen was, you will have to turn to his magnum opus, the 'Shobogenzo' or 'Treasury of the True Dharma Eye.' This has been translated, in whole or in part, a number of times, but an edition I can heartily recommend is the present book.Besides twenty texts from the 'Shobogenzo,' this 356-page book includes four additional texts and a selection of Dogen's poems. It also contains a fine Introduction on Dogen's Life and Teachings, four Appendices, full Notes, an incredibly full and detailed bilingual Glossary of a kind you will not find elsewhere, a Selected Bibliography, and some interesting illustrations.Dogen's Japanese is an excruciatingly difficult Japanese, so much so that some think it should be called 'Dogen-ese' and not Japanese. Think 'Finnegans Wake' and you'll get an inkling of the problems involved in translating him. The language and thought of the 'Shobogenzo' come from such a height that there can be no such thing as a definitive interpretation, and hence no such thing as a definitive translation.'Moon in a Dewdrop' is the result of a collaborative effort by a team of highly competent American Zenists, some of them very well known. It has always seemed, in my humble opinion, that, considering the difficulties, they did a very fine job. To give you a taste, here are a few lines from the 'Genjo Koan' as translated by Robert Aitken and Kazuaki Tanahashi:&quot;The buddha way is, basically, leaping clear of the many and the one; thus there are birth and death, delusion and realization, sentient beings and buddhas. / Yet in attachment blossoms fall, and in aversion weeds spread&quot; (page 69).Prepared and sensitive readers will be bowled over by 'Moon in a Dewdrop.' Dogen leaves most other thinkers behind in the dust. But if you've never read any Dogen before, it might perhaps be better to start with Reiho Masunaga's 'A Primer of Soto Zen.' This is a translation of Dogen's 'Shobogenzo Zuimonki,' a short book of brief talks and instructions for Zen beginners and lay followers. In the 'Zuimonki' you can ramble at leisure the plains and foothills of Dogen's mind before attempting the mountains."},{"Title":"Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen","review":"Dogen may very well be the most important master in all of Zen history, next to Shakyamuni of course. This particular book is a translation of portions derived from Dogen's masterwork, Shobogenzo. I would suggest purchasing with this \\"Enlightenment Unfolds: The essential teachings of Zen Master Dogen\\" by the same author, it's somewhat like a follow-up. Also beneficial readings come from many of the works out there from the late modern master Taizan Maezumi. This book offers clear translations of some of the most central aspects of Dogen's fascinating style of Zen (still one of the predominant schools to have survived to date). One of the previous reviewers mentioned this book's wonderful glossary of terms, to which I must agree; It's at once extensive and dense. If you are looking for a really accurate (as well as fairly easy to read) book on Dogen Zenji aside from the entire Shobogenzo itself, don't look any further. Your needs are all met right here.

He was one of those rare beings who combine the contemplative's insight into reality with the poet's gift of words.His immense masterwork, the \\"True Dharma-Eye Treasury,\\" covers all aspects of Buddhist practice from rarefied metaphysics to behaviour at mealtimes: all dualities are comprehended in Enlightenment, leaving no distinction between the mundane and the sublime.I have four books of excerpts, but this is my favourite: the poetic and metaphysical chapters predominate over practical and instructional ones. Literary Japanese, supple, intricate and elliptical, was wildly different from modern English, but the translators have done wonders in achieving clear and (fairly) natural versions, though word-choices sometimes puzzle. A good balance has also been struck between a surfeit of footnotes and too many baffling allusions.This is a book to read, re-read and grow into, depth after depth. It expresses as much of the beauty, mystery and profundity of Zen (and existence itself,) as can be expressed in words... and then a little more. Even when I'm reading a passage I can't make head or tail of, I feel my body go cold, as when reading great poetry.

The language is beautiful but in some places suffered an inescapable temporality. For example the word, &quot;actualize&quot; was forced in place of more harmonious terms like, &quot;realize&quot;, &quot;awaken&quot;, &quot;manifest&quot;, etc. A phrase from the New Age, &quot;resonate with&quot; was again, forced, making the work instantly dated.The overall effect was that the translation became stuck in time and place: in San Francisco, the Human Potential Movement, 1980. This makes it much like some of the Victorian translations of Buddhist literature and gave it a faint, cloying after aroma of added agenda.This may be a problem inherent in art and literature by committee. The editors are to be thanked for making some of Dogen's most poetic writings available to the non-Oriental languages reader. The sincere student of Dogen should obtain other translations and compare them with this one.

This can be understood by the presentation of the first section being \\"Practical Instructions\\" and the first writing being \\"Zazen-Gi\\" or Rules for Zazen. Sitting with \\"moon in a dewdrop\\" is like sitting with Dogen himself, at every turn Dogen is pointing to reality and inviting us to fully enter it and taste it for ourselves. The text is a practical manual to be used in conjunction with Zazen, Dogen wrote for all those, who truly wish to taste the essence of Buddhism and reality.The writing is five star.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to any one who is interested in Zen and a greater depth of reality."},{"Title":"Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen","review":"This is one book to read. If there are better translations,that's good, too, but, for me, this was quite an eye-opener.Dogenis THE philospher to bring up whenever you hear all this &quot;Western-centric&quot;... thrown at you from conservative scholars and Christian theocrats. A contemporary of Aquinas, Dogen anticipated and surpassed Shoepenauer, Hegel, and other 19th century philosphers.Even if this translation is marred in places (and frankly, if you can read Japanese, ANY translation will be marred), the poetry and imagery of the original comes through. A voice from 800 years ago speaks, and comes to you. And you begin to see the man in the dew on the morning grass, in the meal you cook, and going to the bathroom."},{"Title":"Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen","review":"Great book which contains a big collection of Dogen's wisdom. In order to understand it without much difficulties, I would suggest that the reader will start by learning about Mahayana Buddhism in general, and then start to investigate Dogen texts. Because the wisdom of Zen Buddhism is often written in Chinese or Japanese, this book is very handy for the westerner user,especially because the translation is brilliant.As a student of Japanese language for the last 6 years, I know how hard it is to translate the 12-13th century Japanese into nowadays English, so it has really impressed me. A sure pleasure."},{"Title":"Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen","review":"i'm conflicted. either i do not like dogens teachings, or i do not understand them. to put things in perspective i have read and studied the oldest known buddhist scriptures, tibetan book of the dead, lots of works by chan and zen masters, and so on, and i've understood them all. however dogen i find to be so vague and ethereal that it's next to useless for me. now perhaps it's just way over my head? i really can't say. all i can do is give my opinion.i can say i enjoy his poetry though.the book gets four stars because it is what it says it is: a collection of dogens writings. very good ones at that. my opinion of dogens teachings would be one star, but that's not fair to the book as i'm not rating him as the author, i'm rating a translation of an ancient work. the same as one wouldn't give the bhagavad gita a one star review because the story didn't grip them, one would only rate it one star if the translation or format were poor. these are books already accepted as ancient treasures, we don't need to rate them as works, only editions and translations.it lost one star for being kind of annoying. there are asterisks next to words that are in the glossary or other appendices of the book. sounds good, but there are these asterisks next to like every tenth word, so it's distracting and you feel like you're missing something every time you don't go and look for what it's leading you to. it's over notated basically which can be good if the book is very easy to navigate, but this one is not. for example an asterisk next to a word like \\"links\\" will lead you to the glossary where you look up \\"links\\" and it will say \\"see dependent origination\\" so you go there and it says \\"see causation\\" and finally under \\"causation\\" you find the information. as opposed to books that have numbered notes that correspond directly with a notes section, this book has that too, but many more asterisks than notes."},{"Title":"Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen","review":"Like other great ancient Zen masters, D&#333;gen elucidates in an obscuring way. One reason is the subject matter itself; the core concept of Zen Buddhism, \\"non-duality\\", is so unfamiliar with the modern and Western mindset that many will find it truly incompatible with our cultural and metaphysical intuition. Another reason is the many new visions and revisions D&#333;gen brought about to Buddhism. One of his major proposals is that enlightenment and practice are one; this is starkly different from his contemporaries' beliefs, and even some earlier teachings. Another of D&#333;gen's beliefs is that Buddhist scriptures express true teachings of the Buddha, contrary to the widely held doctrine in Chinese Ch'an that \\"true teachings lie outside the scriptures\\".It seems paradoxical that, revolutionary as he is, D&#333;gen nonetheless strictly abides by the teachings of \\"Buddha ancestors\\". Throughout the book, D&#333;gen criticizes and laments the absurdity of contemporary thoughts, and praises and advocates the value of ancient teachings. Considering this, it may be implied that perhaps D&#333;gen's writing was not extremely original and critical; it is just a commentarial expansion of the teachings he received. But this is not so, as it is crucial to the transmission of the undefiled Buddha Way, as he knows.For example, D&#333;gen writes: \\"To be enlightened by all things is to be free from attachment to the body and mind of one's self and of others.\\" This suggests that one should be free from attachment even to enlightenment in order to experience the Buddha way. But if immersing oneself in something is attachment, then immersing in practice-enlightenment is attachment to it. How can we not attach to something we are attached to? At first this poses a serious logical question. It seems that D&#333;gen totally misses the point by being self-contradictory. But D&#333;gen wants us to know that it is us who miss the point. \\"The illogical stories...are only illogical for you, not for [the enlightened].\\" Indeed, to penetrate the Way we have to think in \\"the logic of enlightenment\\", that is, in a non-dualistic way. \\"How do you think not-thinking? Nonthinking.\\" When you practice, neither attach to it nor not-attach to it. Just non-attach to it. Just let the Dharma turn your body and let your body turn the Dharma. Thereby, you enter the realm of the Buddha.Not only does D&#333;gen's writing possess a unique logic, it also focuses and expands in great detail on things that ordinary people would plainly ignore. For example, he quotes in \\"Uji\\": \\"For the time being stand on top of the highest peak; ... for the time being the earth and sky.\\" The phrase \\"the time being\\", to us lay people, means no more than a colloquial indicator of time. However, by expounding just that phrase, D&#333;gen has deconstructed and reconstructed the meaning of language and Zen. What he wants to emphasize here is that \\"time itself is being, and all being is time\\". By equating time with existence, moment with eternity, past with present, he reminds us that the fundamental point is to realize the world is inherently non-dualistic, and to act in a way to accord with it. This idea is again present in \\"Mountains and Waters Sutra\\": \\"'A stone woman gives birth to a child at night' means that the moment when a barren woman gives birth to a child is called 'night'.\\" We normally would be much more curious on why a barren woman could give birth than when; but D&#333;gen, by emphasizing this happened at \\"night\\", simply says that everything is possible in the realm of non-duality, and the moment is all that matters.D&#333;gen's numerous insights on enlightenment are truly engaging, but their audience is mainly monks seeking the Way; for us, it is often his more approachable pieces that appeal better. In \\"Instruction for the Tenzo\\", we are told about the life of a chef in a Zen monastery; besides just cooking meals, a Tenzo assumes much more responsibility as a Buddhist. D&#333;gen writes in great detail on what a Tenzo should do when preparing and serving the meal. \\"When you boil rice, know that the water is your own life;\\" \\"Do not arouse disdainful mind when you prepare a broth of wild grasses; do not arouse joyful mind when you prepare a fine cream soup.\\" This kind of utmost sincerity toward food is what the modern society severely lacks. In a world where food production has become an industrialized process and fast food has become a culture, D&#333;gen's words of wisdom constantly resounds like a ringing bell.D&#333;gen's treatises reflect an immensely rich spiritual world of a true Zen master. Contemplating on such subjects as time, Buddha Way, and Enlightenment with philosophical depth and poetic imagery, D&#333;gen embraces, elaborates, and enhances a tradition that to today remains its freshness and vitality. As one reader comments, \\"this book is worth reading for a lifetime.\\" Through D&#333;gen's eyes, we see our world differently every time, just the way it is.Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen"},{"Title":"Cooking For Young Homemakers: An Edition of Encyclopedic Cookbook","review":"I received it in a very timely fashion, however the book appeared to have been stored un-protected from dust and dampness.

Dr. Andrews was one of our most important influences of the last century and one of the models for Indiana Jones. Oh - the book is dedicated to his dog, Wolf. The book is intended for Young Adults, but can be enjoyed by any age. From the DJ: This is fiction based on actual experience, for Dr. Andrews spent ten years exploring Central Asia for the American Museum of Natural History and was famous for his many discoveries. Like Dr. Andrews, Jack Benton (the hero of this book), hoped to reconstruct the past history of the great plateau and took along a geologist, a paleontologist, an archaeologist, and a topographer - though Jack's most important helper was Wolf, the valiant Alsatian shepherd dog who guarded them all from danger. From beginning to end, the trip was full of excitement: a sudden antelope stampede, an attack by snakes, discoveries of dinosaur fossils, and a wealth of other scientific material, skirmishes with hostile natives, and only one real battle. And they stumbled upon a strange limestone vault - perhaps the grave of Genghis Khan himself."},{"Title":"Two Wheels To Adventure 1ST Edition","review":"Danny Liska's book is one of the greatest adventure riding books written.

Some of the stuff he claimed was a little far fetched (fish that swim up your pee hole - proven urban myth) but, for the most part it was very well documented. Actually, that was the only thing I didn't belive/ Danny was there to witness the rise and fall of governments, and give the Yanqui's perspective! A large portion of the book was about his crossing the darien gap, which was done without the bike, but probably one of the most engaging sections of the book."},{"Title":"Darling Jenny","review":"This was a sweet, innocent romance novel, almost old-fashioned...a little like the heroine, Jenny. She leaves her job, broken-hearted, and goes to stay with her sister (in order to lick her wounds), only to find herself falling in love with her sister's boss, Logan Taylor. He's a handsome, successful, rogish type of man. The kind who has all the girls in the district falling for him. Despite this, he's extremely likable as a character. He has a good sense of humour, if at times a bit mocking, and he has a lot of patience when dealing with \\"trying\\" Jenny. He does lose his temper every now and again, but I think that's out of frustration with Jenny. She could be a bit trying sometimes, because she was a bit naive and tended to jump to the wrong conclusions. She's drawn to Logan, but fights her attraction, because of her past bad experience, but also because of her belief that Logan is romantically involved with her sister. This is further complicated by the fact that her sister is a vulnerable widow with two, adorable little children, and as if that's not enough, she's beautiful! And yet all the characters in this story are very likable. There's no sex in this book, but in my experience that just means the story will be good. Too many sex scenes usually means a weak story. Thankfully that is not the case here. Janet Dailey, as usual, does not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Darling Jenny","review":"Not hot and steamy in the least, it's a wonderfully romantic book that kept me tuned in until the last page. The heroine was a bit too b*tchy most of the time but she was still likable enough. It's understandable she was to have a chip on her shoulder, but the motivation for this could have been more dramatic. Having one man be that way isn't the end of the world, except to her apparently. How she treated Logan much of the time was fun to read but not entirely easy to emphasize with.I really loved the 'hero' of the book, from this dominating attitude, to his temper, to his tenderness. As an older Presents, there's no sex, but you'll just have to let the imagination kick in. I'm grateful Dailey didn't spend paragraphs throughout the story focusing on the sheer, unrealistic beauty of everyone. (A pet peeve).Editing must not have been done well, as I found at least 8 spelling errors and it did irritate me there was little separation when the story shifted. As an example, she would be talking about having lunch with Brad, then the next paragraph would turn out being the next day. No line separating it, no symbol, nada. It grew confusing.A very feel-good story that isn't mushy and the characters aren't eye-roll inducing.

I will forever love Uncle Remus and his tales. I even had the dolls from the movie. When they had the recent election I didn't see the candidates in black and white like most did, I saw them as two political men with two sets of ideas. That speaks volumes of how I was raised & how I have begun to become almost color blind in modern times. I feel we are all different & the same. People need to just get of the prejudice already! This movie actually doesn't cause prejudice that comes from within & how the person is raised. I just wish people would keep that in mind.Also wanted to point out that the characters make me think of southern back-wood hillbilles or rednecks & that would be insulting to them more than to the black man.

It's frankly gory in spots, and raunchy, and none of the male characters would make it into my bed let alone my heart but nonetheless it's one of the best written series ever done in the genre IMHO, and yes, in my 40's now, I still have my original copies and I read them once in a while. Even as kid I didn't like the hero much. But I liked her very much and wished we could have a lot more of her story sans him.Sirena was a prototype character for books like this, only unlike most of the bodice ripper heroines she had half a brain, a lot of guts and real heart. Her only flaw? She loved that triple timing jerk of a Dutchman despite herself. Yeah, a lot of women get abused in this book. But that is the whole point of her crusade/masquerade. To avenge her sister and what happened to her. Without all that violence towards women we wouldn't have a story and it's a good story even if the characters aren't written to modern tastes. Sirena has actually been copied many, many times in the genre, but I still think Fern Micheals did it best.It's a raw series, and there are some things as a modern woman that I don't like about this series, but for all that I'm fond of the Captive series and I do still think they're a pretty good read even now 35 years later. Actually though to be fair there's no more violence in these books than there is in half the latest romance/thrillers that are on the shelves these days. I mean think about it. They still make bodice rippers. They just don't get called that anymore.How many secret agent/detective couples are out there in print right now running after some serial killer, yet falling in love and steaming up every other page in the middle of what amounts to a gruesome murder mystery? How many paranormal/normal couples are out in the bayou doing the same while hunting down rogue werewolves intent upon killing everything in sight?You think this series is violent? You think Sirena is a bit dim when it comes to her choice of monster, um man?

Plus as one reviewer stated, there was alot of violence to the women.Sierna fought Regan at every turn, even though she was suppose to be in love with him. He in turn slept with anything that moved and kept a mistress, which he slept with on his wedding night. Plus, he flaunted it in front of his wife.I disliked Sierna as she was so cold and dramatic. Even after Regan sailed for months to find her, she still didnt think he loved her.The ending was frustrating as you had no idea if anything really worked out between them.I have started the second book and it opens with Regan is someone elases bed and Sierna at home, still pushing him away.Fern Michaels is a very talented writer and I hate to give a bad review, but this book really was depressing.I will see what the second in the series holds."},{"Title":"Captive Passions","review":"The Captive books are really outstanding &amp; you will read them right after one another, not wanting to put them down.

It went from bad to horrible and yet I hoped somewhere there would be a turning point for the better. I never found it. I loathe Reagan. He and his promiscuous self slept with anything that had two legs. He is so superficial. Anything with a face and some breasts gets him riled up even his vile mistress Gretchen. How can you justify the leading man sleeping with someone else on his wedding night? He's a pathetic character. Yet he has the audacity to throw in Sirena's face the fact that she has lunches over the Spaniards house. Maybe it was just me, but I definitely missed where Sirena fell in love with him. What is there to love? On top of all that, the abuse of women was just horrible to watch. Beware. I should have looked at the earlier comments before i read this book. It was a waste of time."},{"Title":"Captive Passions","review":"I just finished this book, and am rather amazed that I managed to finish it. I don't believe I've done a book review before, and I probably wouldn't be reviewing this one if I didn't want to be sure I wouldn't pick it up ever again. The hero, Regan, is absolutely unlikeable. The heroine, Sirena, is not that much better but I would have liked her if she had been paired with a better man. As it is, she loses personality points for inexplicably falling for a drunken, philandering, abusive jerk. I enjoy historical romances, but what I don't like is when I really can't see that much of a difference between the bad guy and the good guy! I need to see why the heroine falls in love with the hero... so it would be kind of nice if he had at least a couple redeeming qualities. Even if it weren't for the nasty cast of characters, the flow of the book is somehow... \\"off\\" at times. There were several pages where I had to flip back to the previous page because I felt like something was missing, like paragraphs were out of order or an entire page was ripped out. In all honesty, those were probably the points where Sirena was realizing she was in love with Regan, because I just couldn't understand it. I'm sorry to be this negative, but I really did find myself frowning through much of the book. I kept reading just because I thought there had to be a point where Regan would become an admirable man, but it never happened."},{"Title":"Captive Passions","review":"I love romance novels. I have probably read over 200, yet this was one of the most horrible books I have ever read. Sirena and her sister get brutally raped.

Futher more the story gets worse when Sirena's husband continues having \\"affairs\\" with some other women.A disgusting book, but if you want to read about rape, abuse, and the degredation of women this book is right up your alley."},{"Title":"Captive Passions","review":"I've worn out two copies of this book since the 1970s. I am NOT a fan of books that feature rape and sexual abuse, but in THIS book, the heroine doesn't just take it (or, even worse, fall in love with her rapist!)

Substantial introductory material, historical clarity and Chandra Rajan's attentive translation make this collection of Kalidasa's poetry and one of his plays a great read.The greatest strength of this book is its thoroughness. Roughly one half of the pages comprise the introduction, the glossary of Sanskrit terms, and the meticulous footnotes to the texts translated. Rajan is careful in her historiography of Kalidasa, who is a problematic figure in that it is impossible to date him with any great degree of accuracy (Rajan points out that scholars have placed him anywhere from 100 BC to 500 AD; she herself comes down on the earlier side, making the playwright/poet a rough contemporary of, say, Plautus and Terence).This care is also evident in the lengthy Sanskrit glossary to terms left untranslated in the texts themselves. At first, this tendency is frustrating; when you're cruising through a play or poem, you don't want to be skipping to the book's end to see what's being said. But it also helps to preserve the integrity of the original. Rajan points out polyvalences in the Sanskrit that would have been simply whitewashed in typical English translation. And, miraculously, by the end of the poem/play, you've internalized the Sanskrit meanings and don't NEED the glossary anymore.As for the poems and plays themselves, they're a revelation. The translation feels a bit antique--like reading Milton, say, or even Shakespeare--but this is perfectly suited to Kalidasa's position in literature. The epic sweep of \\"The Cloud Messenger\\" is matched only by the sophistication of the famous play, \\"The Recognition of Sakuntala,\\" which places Kalidasa alongside Shakespeare, in my mind. While Plautus and Terence were scripting the comic format that, borrowed from Menander, would evolve into the worst of today's sit-coms, Kalidasa was writing comedy with such dark corners that it provokes as much thought as laughter. If the seeming cheesiness of some of the lovey-dovey parts annoys today's reader, it must be admitted that it helps to accentuate the frustration of the darker parts. The ending is happy, yes, as the King eventually realizes his mistake, comes out of his oblivion and takes his intended, Sakuntala, back; but before we reach that point, there are three or four acts replete with suffering and rejection, of an intensity that Western comedy would not countenance for over a thousand years.This collection of Kalidasa makes for satisfying reading, whether you're into slogging through the weighty introductory materials for the full picture, or just interested in experiencing some of the best of Indian--or world, for that matter--poetry and drama."},{"Title":"The Loom of Time: A Selection of His Plays and Poems (Penguin Classics)","review":"I greatly enjoyed these works. The vivid immediacy of the description of the seasons intertwined with the experiences of lovers in Rtusamhara, the profound sorrow of separation and the ephemeral cloud-imagery in Meghaduta, the joy of discovery, the pain of loss, and the elation of reunion in Abhijnanashakuntala ... all these works left a lasting emotional and aesthetic impact. For me, one of the joys of Indian literature (and this work is no different) is the way in which there are no lines of demarcation between humanity, nature, and divinity; each sphere seamlessly co-exists with the others.In my experience, poetry suffers more than prose in translation, and unfortunately I believe this to be the case here. Despite the best efforts of the translator (whose thorough introduction and copious notes and appendices were much appreciated), I got the sense that a few layers of meaning and beauty are unfortunately \\"lost in translation\\" due to the separation in time, language, and culture from the average modern reader. Overall, however, I found Kalidasa to be quite interesting and engaging even in translation. I would also encourage the general reader to put aside any comparisons to Shakespeare (it seems impossible to encounter Kalidasa without running across the phrase \\"Shakespeare of Sanskrit literature\\"). Not because Kalidasa lacks in quality, but because the comparison does not do justice to the unique talents of each very different writer. Judge Kalidasa on his own merits, and you will be sure not to be disappointed by these sublimely beautiful works."},{"Title":"The Loom of Time: A Selection of His Plays and Poems (Penguin Classics)","review":"The great Indian poet and dramatist Kalidasa was a genius on the order of Goethe and Shakespeare. We know little about him, other than that he wrote magnificent verse during the Golden Age of Indian culture, a time that saw the production of the Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita, and the Hindu Puranas. Kalidasa drew from this extravagant tradition to produce dazzling and imaginative poems and plays alive with the vitality of Hindu religious insight.His work has been rendered into English by Chandra Rajan, who has distinguished herself not only by rendering his Sanskrit into lyrical, flowing English, but also in compiling and editing this volume. The copious end notes and references are most helpful, but her penetrating and brilliant analysis of his work in the book's long introduction is simply invaluable. She is a keen and perceptive reader.The principle work in this volume is Kalidasa's \\"Abhijnanashakuntalam,\\" or \\"The Recognition of Shakuntala,\\" which is a play of a very high order. Drawing from the Mahabharata and the Vedas as Shakespeare drew from Geoffrey of Monmouth and Plutarch, Kalidasa presents an enchanting tale of love and its vitality, imbued throughout with reflections on art, imagination, God, and life that are both subtle and profound.The works collected in this volume are so beautiful, so engaging, and so insightful, I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Loom of Time: A Selection of His Plays and Poems (Penguin Classics)","review":"I cannot give an opinion about the quality of the translation but it allowed me anyway to feel the sensibility of the poet.

The author has done a good job weaving together Edith's story based on letters Edith wrote and recollections of the nurses working with her. Starting with Edith's childhood, she highlights details that shaped her character, follows her way through her pioneering work with the Nursing Service in Belgium, and describes her fateful decision to stay in Belgium when World War I starts and to help the Allied soldiers. Through it all, a consistent pattern shines - her will to help others, trumping even personal safety.Throughout the book, Edith's faith and strength of character shine. As the author herself admits, Edith was not an open person yet by the end of the book, one feels a steady admiration for her, having witnessed her struggles to start a nursing system in Belgium (when nursing was viewed as a lower class job, and hospitals distrusted) to her determination to tell the truth during interrogation even when it would cost her life.An inspiring read and reminder that trials can strengthen us, and bring out nobler ideals."},{"Title":"The SSCP Prep Guide: Mastering the Seven Key Areas of System Security","review":"This book looks like the first one written by the authors with little care and feed put in.The contents are organized by the ISC2 domain structure.

They provide multiple definitions of subject matter in different locations. Finally they ask questions in the quiz where there is no corresponding guide in the main body at all (e.g. Information Classification).The book was also edited fairly poorly.

This is the only book that one will need in order to be prepared for the SSCP exam, as long as one has solid IT security knowledge and work experience and only need to \\"brush up\\" on IT security topics that are covered in the exam. If you DO NOT have this prerequisite IT security knowledge and work experience, then I candidly recommend that one uses this book AND other resources (such as other SSCP prep guides, \\"prep courses\\", etc.) to adequately prepare for the SSCP exam.This book definitely is the best SSCP prep guide for the money. It is very well written and the co-authors of this book clearly demonstrate that they are very knowledgeable about the technical aspects of IT Security that are covered in the SSCP exam. This book is very well organized and the chapters are arranged by the 7 core bodies of knowledge (CBK's) that are covered in the SSCP exam, making it easy to prepare for it by CBK and to understand ahead of time exactly what materials will be covered.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who's interested in understanding how to implement distributed applications or replication strategies."},{"Title":"Building Secure and Reliable Network Applications","review":"This is by far most useless book among the books about Network.

If you are looking to try a career in the medical field, this book is a must have."},{"Title":"The Master Bladesmith: Advanced Studies In Steel","review":"The second of three knifemaking books by Jim Hrisoulas. The first book &quot;The Complete Bladesmith&quot;, is excellent for the beginner to intermediate forger. This second book is more in-depth, and written for those that need knowledge in the field that will not be found elsewhere. The book is for the intermediate student, to the advanced master of the blade. Again, Jim gives his expertise and knowledge openly to the practitioner, who wants to make knifemaking a serious part of life. For those interested in the production of swords, this book that has something to offer you. This volume covers all aspects of the bladesmithing trade, including the varied techniques and details which can forge, what would otherwise be a plain knife, into a working piece of art. Secrets, tips, tools, and techniques, are spelled out with the help of clear diagrams and explanations. Helpful compound tables, plus formulas for the manufacturing of flux, quenching, and etching mediums, are all included in this comrehensive volume. Jim also introduces the techniques for the creation of damascus steel in this volume. Those interested in the manufacture of damascus steel will also find a source of study, in Jims latest book, &quot;The Pattern-Welded Blade&quot;, which is strictly for the advanced forger that desires to create damascus and mosaic patterens, and who has worked through Jims first two books. The books by Jim Hrisoulas are the best written in the field, and a most welcome addition to the forging knifemaker. Nels Nelson"},{"Title":"The Master Bladesmith: Advanced Studies In Steel","review":"This book is a great sequel to The Complete Bladesmith, one of the best works I've read on the subject. It is well written and full of sound, practical information for the experienced bladesmith, including everything from laying out your shop (e.g., lighting, ventilation, tools) to building and using a forge to make battle-worthy blades and works of anachronistic art. Contents include essential information about steels and alloys, compounds and formulas, and weights and measures that you need to successfully complete projects, along with advanced forging techniques, power hammer applications, grinding, heat treating, tempering, hilts, metal and wood finishing, leatherworking and scabbard making, damascus steel (pattern-welding), sword making, spear making, and ax making. There are also excellent chapter on Japanese nonferrous alloys. Mr. Hrisoulas's blade crafting skills are first rate and his writing talents readily convey his knowledge and experience in a way that you can immediately apply to your own work. Very well done.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"},{"Title":"The Master Bladesmith: Advanced Studies In Steel","review":"Excellent book, Jim Hrisoulas tells you how to do things PROPERLY, not half @$$ed.

I seriously doubt you will be able to chop M1 tanks in half with any of these baldes, but you will be able to understand and appreciate the appea, value and worth of the weapons which have generated the hyped stories you sometimes hear."},{"Title":"The Master Bladesmith: Advanced Studies In Steel","review":"I purchased this text as a gift for my son. It was highly recommended by other reviewers and even though it was a bit pricey, it was well worth every penney. One reviewer did not like the black and white photos, designs, and drawings, but as an instructional text that contains a vast amount of Indepth detail regarding the process of working with steel at an advanced level, the lack of color photography made perfect sense. This is a beautifully designed text but it is not an artsy text persay. My son has spent several hours studying the text and has said he learns something new every time he reviews chapters that he has already read. I would highly recommend this text to anyone interested in the art of working with steel and learning all the finer points.

Benson","review":"A reader serious about his/her love of the ghost story may have already encountered such greats as M.R. James, Algernon Blackwood, or the wonderful Oliver Onions. You should immediately add E. F. Benson to your list of &quot;absolute musts&quot; to read and collect. His ghost stories, collected in a handsome volume published by Carroll &amp; Graf, are wonderfully readable. In fact, there are more frights per page then in most modern horror stories. I will not single any story out, because one and all is worth your time and energy. I am confident that you will find many, many hours of entertainment and chills here. This is book that I was proud to buy and proud to share with my friends. You will not go wrong here! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"E.F. Benson, perhaps best known for his amusing 'Mapp & Lucia' comedy-of-manners stories also wrote a respectable body of ghost stories which are gathered together in this excellent omnibus anthology. All make for quality reading as examples of the English supernatural genre but a few stand out as darkly-luminous masterpieces, unforgettable in their haunting hold upon the reader and written with real verve. 'The Room In The Tower' is an undeniably chilling narrative of vampirism featuring a truly terrifying female revenant - the words spoken recurrently by Mrs Stone to the protaganist: &quot;Jack will show you to your room: i have given you the room in the tower&quot; are enough to instil a frisson of pervasive dread every time one reads this story. 'The Sanctuary' is a delectably macabre tale of damned souls and secret diabolism at an English country house complete with a hidden Satanic chapel for nocturnal celebrations of Le Messe Noir. 'The Man Who Went Too Far' unfolds by awful degrees the seductive but injudicious immersion of an artist in the deeps of nature mysticism which can only culminate in the most hideous revelation of truth and the sign of the cloven hoof - it is marvellously written, exquisite prose and descriptive passages and has a most beguiling undercurrent. 'The Cat' likewise is utterly engrossing and 'Mrs Amworth' stands as a unusual classsic of the vampire tale. But these are just a few of the delights this packed volume offers to the curious reader, there are many other marvellous tales to cause one to look over one's shoulder as the clock strikes twelve and a sighing midnight wind scrapes the twigs of an overhanging bough against the window. Quintessentially English, wrought with a delicious lightness of touch and a hint of a stylish insouciance but nevertheless conveying a genuinely disturbing charge of the uncanny these tales will be read again and again. E.F.Benson's contribution to the field of supernatural terror is of a very high standard. This anthology is well-worth obtaining."},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"E.F. Besnson, the son of an Archibishop of Canterbury, is a master of the ghost story. This collection contains stories of troubled spirits, both good and evil; s&eacute;ances; vampires; the occult; curses; ancient gods; etc. All of them show off his remarkable talent for creating an eerie atmosphere and realistic characters, as well as his knowledge of the spirit world, especially with the last entry &quot;The Recent 'Witch-Burning' at Clonmel,&quot; an article he wrote for a magazine which describes primitive exorcism practices.One thing I most enjoyed about his stories is that even though the subject matter can become tiresome, Benson interjects enough new twists and types of spirits and other creature to make them feel new and unique. With &quot;Caterpillars,&quot; for example, involving an empty bedroom in which someone passed away from cancer, Besnon creates a materialization of the disease in such a creepingly disgusting way that you are repulsed and entranced at the same time. Fortunately, all the stories are classics that are sure to enthrall any ready and to keep them up until the early hours, wanting to read just one more story."},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"I had read E.F. Benson's \\"The Horror Horn\\" to start with (a collection of 13 of his best ghost stories), after seeing that it was considered one of the Top 100 Horror Books of all time in Newman & Jones' excellent overview volume. Each of those 13 stories was so good that I just had to have more, and so picked up this collection of every single one of Benson's spooky tales, 54 in all. This collection certainly did not disappoint; I loved every single one of these ghost stories, and was riveted for the full 640-page length of this generous book.The tales in this volume are extremely varied. Most deal with ghosts of the conventional kind: the spirits of the deceased with grudges against the living or unfinished business here on the material plane. Unlike the ghosts of Oliver Onions--another great English supernatural writer of the early 20th century, whose ghosts can often be seen more as the mental aberrations of the protagonist--the ghosts of E.F. Benson are decidedly and objectively REAL. There's no question that these occult manifestations are really happening, and not just in the mind of the main character. This--for me, anyway--makes for a more chilling experience. Other tales in this volume deal with vampires, cancer-inducing caterpillars, devil worship, elementals, ghostly slugs, witches and seances. The fact that a character is sympathetic is no guarantee of his or her survival in these Benson stories; anyone is capable of being offed! Indeed, in \\"The Face,\\" one of the scarier stories of the bunch, a kindly woman, a mother of two and a good wife, meets a pretty horrible end for no particular reason. Benson never married, and may have been something of a misogynist; the women in his stories, anyway, are usually given a rough time, or are presented as rather repellent creatures. Take the levitating lead character in \\"Mrs. Amworth,\\" a nice English biddy who just happens to be a blood-sucking vampire; or the bloated and horrible husband killer of \\"The Corner House\\"; or the female, yetilike creature of \\"The Horror Horn\\"; or the sadistic Sybil Rorke of \\"Inscrutable Decrees\\"; or Bertha Acres of \\"The Outcast,\\" a woman so vile that the very earth spits out her coffin. Then there are the dueling witches of \\"The Wishing-Well\\" and the vampire witch of \\"The Room in the Tower.\\" Yes, Mr. Benson surely didn't have too much use for the ladies. However, in the bulk of these stories, the main characters are single, unattached, scholarly, middle-aged men--like Benson himself--who go on long summer holidays to Cornwall, Norfolk or Sussex, rent homes and get involved with all sorts of ghostly mishegas. (Modern-day readers will no doubt feel twinges of envy at the extended summer vacations that all these characters seem able to take!) Of course, space doesn't permit me to rave about each of the wonderful 54 tales in this volume, but I would like to single out for special mention a few of my favorites. \\"Pirates,\\" for example, is an incredibly beautifully written tale of a man who is haunted by the spirits of his youth when he revisits his old home. \\"Mr. Tilly's Seance\\" is a very unique story, in that it is a seance tale told from the point of view of the spirit. I've never read another one like it. \\"The Man Who Went Too Far\\" tells of a man who gets just a wee bit too close to Mother Nature; fans of Algernon Blackwood should especially like this one. \\"And the Dead Spake--\\" deals with a scientist who invents a device that enables him to play the brain cells of a corpse like a phonograph! It's a story that H. G. Wells himself might have written. And then there's \\"How Fear Departed From the Long Gallery,\\" Benson's favorite tale of the bunch, and one of mine, too. In this one, a house is haunted by the spirits of three-year-old twins; just to see these ghostly children spells sickness and death for the viewer. It is a lovely story, actually, well told and suspenseful. But then again, all the tales herein are well told and suspenseful, and elegantly written. Benson certainly deserves his place in that pantheon of great English supernaturalists that includes M.R. James, Sheridan LeFanu, Oliver Onions and Algernon Blackwood. Read this book, and you'll see that he was indeed one of the greats."},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"e.f.benson could twist and turn the ghost story as nobody else. his stories are the most original and inventive you can find. as montague rhodes james he had great descriptions and wrote very well. however, efb was more macabre in the way he let the story build, not to mention: end. investing in the plot, creating unease by keeping the treath's strength and how it would work unclear, his stories are truly horrible. in some stories you must realize there may not really be a &quot;point&quot;(mysterious strangers or treaths not being revealed) or a straight-forward climax (like &quot;and the dead spake&quot;). efb had his reasons, and the reason is this: if you are treathened by the supernatural: do you think it will explain to you why it may harm you. efb's starting point is somewhere in someone's LIFE, and how the treath enters this. would that really always be that straightforward. but don't misunderstand, it is easy to get into the stories and get your own ideas about what's going on. its not obscure, just some uneasy unclearity at times (which is enjoyable). there are some horror stories here too, more along the pulpish line. great collection. some are too traditional for my taste (though not to people who like lefanu, nesbit and that crowd) but there are some truly morbid tales carried out extremely well, like The face. this is a great collection for us who like the morbid, AND for people liking the old victorian ghost story, having enough stories and excellence to satisfy both parties"},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"I personally find it difficult to reconcile the fear of ghosts with the technology of the twentieth century. Perhaps technology makes us feel too secure, too powerful, too material to fear the supernatural. The mechanical seems to have replaced the spiritual in our lives, and when I read the second story in this anthology, about a ghostly car, I was surprised that I went on to enjoy the anthology as much as I did.Benson has a way of bringing out the dramatic, as in &quot;The Room in the Tower,&quot; or unmentionable horror, as in &quot;How Fear Departed from the Long Gallery&quot; or &quot;Caterpillars,&quot; or fear of what powers the mind can unleash, as in &quot;The Man who Went Too Far,&quot; or just humor, as in &quot;Mr. Tilly's Seance.&quot; That's quite a range of experiences to be evoked, and I was able to eke out a good half-year's enjoyment from this voluminous collection.I have only two complaints about these stories, and they are common to quite a bit of weird tales produced between the 1890's and the 1930's: a prediliction towards unnecessary explanation of the supernatural at the end, and an obsession with spiritualism (or mesmerism, or psychics, or ESP, etc.). The rationalism of the day no doubt demanded the former, but the latter unbearably dates literature that fawns over spiritualism. Very few writers can use it as a plot device without it appearing to be a very rotten crutch, and Benson is not one of those writers. Much like radiation in the 50's and biotechnology in the 90's, it's the deus ex machina and all the worse when debunked.In any case, I was happy to take the good with the bad and look forward to reading this anthology again."},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"A number of reviewers of this book have compared Benson's ghost stories to Montague Rhodes James - justifiably, since they were probably the two greatest Victorian authors of supernatural short stories after Sheridan LeFanu and Algernon Blackwood. But there are also differences, some subtle and some less so. For instance, James's stories, drawing heavily from his own experience, frequently have a whiff of the ecclesiastical or academic about them, while Benson's tend to center on a middle-class, often somewhat smug Englishman going about his daily routine with no greater concerns than what to have for dinner and what seaside resort to spend the summer in. James's supernatural creatures are almost always malignant and frequently solid, as in \\"Canon Alberic's Scrapbook\\" or \\"Mr. Poynter's Diary\\", while Benson's, while they can be heard, felt and occasionally smelt, tend to be more traditionally misty and sometimes more anguished than malevolent. As the useful introduction by Richard Dalby points out, the trademarks of Benson's stories (overbearing fathers, malice-filled women, men whose closest friendships seem to be with other men and for whom love of the opposite sex has disastrous consequences) tell us a great deal about him as a person, whereas about all one gets about James from his stories is that he had a great love of ancient manuscripts, was religious and was a profound scholar.Another difference is that while James occasionally shows a bit of dry irony, Benson more clearly has a sense of humor. As other reviewers mentioned, he frequently inserts psychic interludes dealing with mediums, seances, and somewhat exasperated spirits, but he also points out that the mediums and seances depend on fraudulent tricks (especially in \\"Mr. Tilly's Seance,\\" where the disembodied spirit itself gets irritated at the medium's chicanery). His attitude seems to be that mediums and spiritualists are less to blame than those who swallow their bait - if you want to believe that Aunt Martha has nothing better to do with her afterlife than answer your impertinent questions, he seems to say, don't ask me for sympathy! In stories like \\"Spinach,\\" he betrays a clear affection for the likable young sibling mediums, even if they are clearly at least partly frauds. And in one of the book's most hair-raising stories, \\"How Fear Departed from the Long Gallery,\\" centering on an ancient murder that will make any parent's skin crawl, he argues that the attitude of the other-worldly apparition may depend on how you approach it, not the other way around.Having said that, the one thing James and Benson have in common that separates them from lesser hack writers is that in both cases, the persons who tell the story are likely to be pottering along in their daily lives, totally oblivious to signs of trouble, when something sudden and terrible comes out of the darkness and either almost overwhelms them and carries them off, or actually does so, never more terribly than in \\"The Face.\\" For those whose acquaintance with Benson may be restricted to \\"Mrs. Amworth\\" and \\"The Man Who Went Too Far,\\" both frequently reprinted in anthologies, this book will open up a whole new, and somewhat frightening, world."},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"I have been soaking up horror anthologies like a sponge for well over two years now. I would have thought I would tire of them, but I just can't get enough of the atmosphere and the gloom these types of tales relate.My current favorite is this dense book compiling the supernatural tales of E.F. Benson. At the moment I am only about of a third of the way through. Perhaps I should wait until I finish, but judging by the variety of stories here, I feel safe to say that I highly recommend this hefty volume.Many may find some of these tales a little dated, for science may have disspelled a few of the subjects covered. But for the most part these are timeless tales, rich in description, drenched in dark moods and never failing to surprise with the seemingly endless ways Benson appears to construct a solid ghost story cleverly and elegantly."},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"I'm not given to superlatives, but I find it hard to express anything to say about this book where superlatives or comarisons to the greatest writers of this genre without seeming trite. There ARE a few contemporary authors of the Victorian-Edwardian Era, which the Benson Brothers bridged, who have a story or even several better than many in this collection, but just mentioning these names says more about how great E.F Benson is- I'm talking about J.S Le Fanu, M.R James, Villiers D'Isle Adam and in the modern era, the list is even more impressive: Flannery O'Conner, Thomas Liggoti, Clive Barker, Issac Bashevis Singer and Peter Straub(who has quietly taken over the crown as America's Horror Short Story king with two masterpieces \\"Houses Without Doors\\", \\"Magic Terror\\" and several novellas masquerading as novels). I urge you to read E.F Benson's Book of Ghost Tales, then demand that some publisher do a public serviced and re-publish Benson's two nearly(?)as talented brothers R.H and A.C Benson who, from the few tales I've read in anthologies and old magazines may well be as good or,dare I say it?...even better."},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"Benson was a good friend of classic ghost-story writer M.R. James, and was among those present that Christmas Eve when James read aloud his first ghost stories.Benson didn't have the genius or the highly literate background of James, but he did know how to write a good ghost tale, and he did just that. His stories, as has been mentioned elsewhere, deal largely with a man or two men going on holiday and finding horror instead. Women often get the worst of it in his stories, either being innocent victims or horrifyingly evil antagonists; it doesn't often happen that a woman in one of his stories is a regular person who helps to solve whatever mystery is entangling the characters.One classic in the misogynist vein is \\"The Room in the Tower\\", in which a young man experiences a recurring nightmare of visiting a school friend, whose frightening mother always speaks the same words: \\"Jack will show you to your room; I've given you the room in the tower.\\" Our protagonist knows that he must, at all costs, avoid that room, but he always awakes before the evil inside can overcome him.\\"The Step\\" is one of the finest ghost stories ever written, about a heartless English businessman in Egypt who begins to hear someone following him down the street, at night... and what happens when he confronts his pursuer.For those who, like me, love the ghost stories of the Victorian and Edwardian era, this is a must."},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson","review":"E.F. Benson was a gifted professional who wrote in several different genres. This collection of his ghost stories shows his skill in plotting and setting stories in Edwardian England. The plots are inventive, the settings convey place, time and atmosphere, and the writing is vivid. Benson understood how far he could take his readers, so the stories don't have the same shock value of a more modern writer, but Benson more than makes up for those limitations with his ability to take us to turn of the century country houses, where guests are given a candle at the end of the evening to find their way up winding staircases and down dark hallways to their darkened bedrooms. He writes at the dawn of the automobile age, and his observations about riding in a speeding car down a narrow country lane, or about the impact of rough country roads on inflatable car tires is fascinating.Benson's characters move through genteel Edwardian society. It's a lost world, and it makes for interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F.

Benson","review":"This is a great and varied collection of Horror stories, one of the best I have read. If you enjoy Sheridan Le Fanu, Blackwood, M.R.James or Oliver Onions this will suit your tastes perfectly. However this printed edition is grossly overpriced in the used and new stores.

Benson - Tales of Mystery & the Supernatural\\" (ISBN-10: 1840226854; ISBN-13: 978-1840226850) because it costs only 7,99 dollars and features the same stories as the Carrol And Graf edition in the exact same order save for \\"The Clomnel Witch Burning\\", which is not featured in the Wordsworth Editions version. So, if you want to save a substancial amount of money and don't mind a somewhat ugly cover (the wordsworth editions cover is not very pretty to look at)the I advise you to buy \\"Night Terrors: the Ghost Stories of E.F.

The Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) has both wide-angle and telephoto capabilities and has revolutionized knowledge of Mars since it went into orbit in 1997. As I've browsed those photos, and even visited Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS) website to surf the archive, I've idly wished that someone would put together a book of those photos, along with explanations by planetary scientists.Quite by accident, I stumbled upon Hartmann's Traveler's Guide to Mars recently, a 2003 publication by one of the scientists who's been involved with Mars since Mariner 4 in 1965. At 468 pages in length, with nearly every page containing photographs, this book is a gem. I regard it as the best book on Mars over the last few years (which is saying a lot if you read my reviews last month).Hartmann gives us forty short chapters, each devoted to a single feature or geographic region. Each chapter is between 2 and 10 or so pages in length. Lavish use of photos is the standard, usually a Viking mosaic for context and then a series of MOS or Odyssey Themis photos illustrating unusual geology, the search for water, etc. There are also many examples of the Global Surveyor's other primary instrument, the laser altimeter, which beautifully illustrates relative elevations of the features, and has added immeasurably to our understanding of the landforms studied. Hartmann also makes frequent use of Earth landscape photos that are close analogs to the Martian features he's showcasing. Hartmann's explanations of the features are clear and easy to understand. The writing is at a level that will be easy for novices to comprehend, but will not leave seasoned Marsophiles feeling talked-down-to.Interspersed throughout are 15 sidebars, &quot;My Martian Chronicles,&quot; in which Hartmann recounts some of his personal experiences as a member of the scientific teams which slowly untangled many of the mysteries he confronts in the text. These serve to make an already superb book even more enjoyable by bringing a very personal touch to the narrative. Hartmann is always careful to specify when he is touting his own pet theories, and when he is speaking of the consensus of the scientific community. He does a great job of illustrating how the scientific process actually works by telling the stories of the many geologists and planetary scientists who have contributed to our understanding of Mars over the years. He also hints where he thinks NASA's priorities ought to be with respect to human exploration of Mars: there are simply some questions which will remain open until there is a geologist with a rock hammer on the scene.This is an excellent book in every way imaginable. First of all, it satisfied a longing I had had for several years. Second, it is written by a top flight scientist who also happens to be a gifted writer and communicator. Third, it is edited and presented in such a well-thought-out manner that it is simply a pleasure to read (and re-read and re-read). The only possible improvement I could suggest would be a second edition (updated of course with new findings) that uses the coffee-table format. When I think of the MOS and MOLA photos used in this book reproduced in large format 11x17 inches, with the accompanying text, I positively salivate with anticipation."},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"This book may very well be the best popular science book I've ever read. The story of what we know about Mars and how it was discovered unfolds in an exciting progression that leaves one convinced that not only has there been a lot of water on Mars in the past, but there is almost certainly still a lot of it underground all over the planet.The story is lavishly illustrated with many amazing high-resolution images from the Mars Global Surveyor and other orbiter missions, along with a dozen or so of the author's own paintings.The book answered all of the nagging quesitons I had about whether or not there's really evidence of water on Mars, and several times a question that formed in my mind (like &quot;ok, maybe it was some fluid other than water like liquid CO2&quot;) was explicitly answered on the next page.This book is a real gem, and if you want quick fun way to pick up the appropriate background for enjoying and understanding the results from the Spirit and Opportunity rover missions then this is it.Sadly The Brittish Beagle 2 lander seems to have followed the Simplified Planetary Local Approach Trajectory that was favored by many previous attempts to land on Mars, but with the success (so far) of Spirit and high hopes for Opportunity landing soon, there will be plenty of exciting new information about Mars available soon, and I can only hope that the author of this book sees fit to give us a second edition in a year or so that summarizes all the new knowlege.But for now, this it *the* book to get up to speed on Mars.G."},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"If I were to take a guided trip to Mars, there are a handful of people that I'd like to choose my guide from - people who have spent their careers trying to understand Mars from the Mariner, Viking and Mars Global Surveyor missions. Bill Hartmann is certainly one of the members of that pool. He cut his geological teeth on the moon with Gerard Kuiper in the early 60's, and made wonderful, major contributions to our understanding of the moon. Then he has been involved in all the major Mars missions since the start. He is an artist as well as a scientist, so he informs this book with the soul of an artist as well as the mind of a scientist.When I first saw the promotional literature for this book, I was struck by the beauty of the images in it. The book itself did not disappoint. It is a paperback, in the format of a field guide, but it is richly illustrated with color and black and white images. The book has two large fold-out maps - one of the best pre-space probe maps showing the Mars that can be seen with a telescope, and a topographic maps from the Mars Global Surveyor mission.Hartmann uses his \\"Traveler's Guide\\" format to take us on a tour of Mars. The organization of the tour is based on the geological history of the Red Planet. So along the way, in addition to seeing the most fascinating places on Mars, we learn their geological context in chronological sequence.Although it would be easy to bury the reader in geological jargon, Hartmann succeeds in making the study of Mars accessible and exciting. It is clear from reading the text that Mars is a world that still harbors many surprises for us. He is not afraid to share his thoughts with the reader - but he is careful to point out where they depart from the main stream. But given Hartmann's track record, one has to give his speculations more weight than most. He also enlivens the book with a thread of his personal journey as a Mars scientist in a series of stories from his career labeled, \\"My Martian Chronicle\\" that are is interwoven with the main text. These help illuminate the human side of the scientist.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"Some of us who saw the lunar landing in 1969 are still wondering why we haven't gotten to Mars yet. Shouldn't that have been next?Well, it still could be, and you can get more information on the possibilities by checking out the Mars Society and Red Colony websites. (I can't post the URLs here but in each case your first guess will be correct.)And if you want more information on the planet Mars itself, this is the book you want.Packed with gorgeous photos from the various Mars missions (and some from Earth for purposes of comparison and inference), this book is a garden of delights for areophiles: the very latest information and theories about the red planet, interspersed with the reminiscences and personal views of the author, astronomer William Hartmann, all in a very high-quality glossy paperback designed for long shelf life -- and, one hopes, for interplanetary travel.If you've ever wondered what gives Syrtis Major its dark color, or even if you've just looked at the night sky once in a while wondering what the heck might be _out there_, you'll find something to engage you in this volume.Have a look. Then let's start getting ready to go."},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"This is book is simply amazing!! I wish I could give it ten stars - off the scale.

Now, I just wish I could find a way to go to Mars in person!"},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars is well written and quite fascinating for anyone with an interest in the planetary geology of Mars.Hartmann breaks down the history of Mars into three geologic eras (Noachian, Hesperain, and Amazonian) based on the amount of cratering on the Martian surface. From there, he explores each one of these regions in detail.From the majestic Mons Olympus volcano and 2500 mile long Valles Marineris Canyon to the probable glacial \\"melting mountains\\" of Promethei Terra and controversial ancient ocean shorelines of Vastitas Borealis , Hartmann provides the reader with a sweeping scope of Martian history, replete with stunning aerial photography and images, that is simply quite amazing. He even discusses the \\"microbial fossil\\" Martian meteorites as well as the notorious \\"Face on Mars\\" in the Cydonia highlands.Take a trip to Mars ... you won't be disappointed"},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"In thruth, I can add little more to the other Amazon reviews other than to say that they are right. William Hartmann's &quot;A Traveler's Guide to Mars : The Mysterious Landscapes of the Red Planet&quot; is a wonderful tour of Earth's most intriguing planetry neighbor, incorporating both a lively history of our evolving knowledge of Mars and also a up-to-date guide to the most fascinating mysteries. What are the sources of the strange gullies and canyons that sometimes stretch hundreds of miles? Why do vast areas of the Martian surface look like gigantic staircases? How much water is there?The photographs from various interplanetary probes are marvelous and the maps eye-opening. The format of the book makes it especially suited for browsing -- dipping in here and there as whim takes the reader -- yet it also merits a more methodical approach to discover what four decades of space exploration has taught us about Mars."},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"Everything I had hoped for....

One of Hartmann's paintings hints at possible Martian fossils.When is this book going to be updated to at least 2010?"},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"This might be the best book about Mars at present. Hartmann tells us all that was known before the Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed on the planet. And he tells us how we know this, by refering to a lot of observations and detailed pictures, explaining how they support some theories and reject others. By describing different parts of the planet, beautifully illustrated by highly interesting pictures, he shows how they tell tales of different eras and events in the planets changing history. We have to wait until the journey of the two rovers has come to and end, and the results of their missions have been thoroughly investigated, before we might have a book that can match this one. In the meantime this is the book that makes it a lot more fun to follow the discoveries of the rovers, and to understand their significance."},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"Here is a great book on various sites on Mars. PHD William Hartmann does a great job of describing the various craters, mountain ranges. volcanoes,polar icecaps , where the water went and the 3 ages of Mars. WE see the heavy bombardment, and that Mars had surface water with a heavier atmosphere billions of years ago.There are great pictures and descriptions throughout the book. The reading is fast paced and the reader does not get bogged down with too technical phrases and ideas. Anyone with an interest in Mars will find this book fascinating.My favorite parts was Olympic Mars the highest volcano on Mars because once I actually saw white clouds over the peak of the volcano with my 20 inch telescope.Of course I did not see the Volcano.Professor Hartmann helped with the Mars Global surveyor mission. We see lots of pictures from this mission and pictures from Viking 1 and 2. The Soviet missions and the later US rover missions are discussed. Also there are great pictures of the Mars Society habitat for training of Mars exploration here on Earth. Also the importance of possible fossilized bacteria inside the Mars meteorite found in Antarctica is shown, as well as the radioactive dating procedures to find the age of various Mars materialMuch of the book describes the various gullies, river formations, and lava flows. We see by crater counting whether the area in question is old old Mars( lots of craters, middle Mars (less craters), or new Mars &lt;100 Million years. We see some lava flows that maybe less than 40 million years old and that Mars may not be totally volcanic dead. Lots of information about tracing where the water went under the surface of Mars and how sometimes that water made it to the surface.Also the loss of atmoshere and later cooling of the planet is discussed.This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in Mars with great desciption of various Mars sites and great pictures too. 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"This is a fun and exciting trek around the Red Planet. I absolutely love the \\"hike\\" format, and this book is probably the next best thing to actually being there on Martian soil.

I didn't have to squint while reading the book, which is a good thing."},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"Have you ever wanted to go beyond the headlines concerning discoveries about Mars and get a thorough overview so that you can put things into perspective? This book is more than a collection of pretty pictures from a far away place. It gives a good introductory account of what we think we know about the planet, and why.William Hartmann has been involved in uncovering knowledge about objects in the Solar system since the time that mankind first developed the ability to go beyond the Earth's atmosphere for an unobstructed view. He is in an authoritative position for attaching meaning to the images, and yet the explanations he gives are very much 'down to Earth', so to speak.Data from space probes (starting with the Mariner series) have literally redrawn the map of the surface of Mars. The time varying dark regions were found to be not seas, or canals, or vegetation, but rather wind blown sand. New names were needed in 1972 to identify actual terrain features. The contrast between old and new can be see by comparing the two foldout maps inside the front cover.Does Mars have a global magnetic field? No. But it used to! Metal particles in rocks older than 3,000,000 years ago are polarized. Particles in younger rocks are not polarized. The core of Mars was likely molten for the first 1,500,00 years and then cooled. Lack of a magnetic field has resulted in more Solar radiation reaching the surface, and may have played a role in carrying away the atmosphere.Is there life on Mars? Was there life on Mars? That's still an open question. It's clear that there is evidence of large quantities of liquid water on the planet in its early years. That at least opens the possibility that Mars harbored life at that time. What we are finding today is that life survives in very hostile environments here on Earth, and microbes survived on a Moon probe visited years later by an Apollo crew, so who can say at this point?Of all the places in the Solar system besides Earth, Mars is the one which has the most resources that would support manned exploration and colonization. There is still water on Mars, although in frozen form. The atmosphere contains CO2, from which oxygen can be extracted for propellant and for breathing. The presence of an atmosphere itself if of interest for aerobraking and radiation shielding. The fact of a day/night cycle very close to 24 hours is conducive to agriculture.Robert Zubrin and others have been advocating for years that travel to Mars is worthwhile and affordable, and NASA now has a congressionally supported presidential mandate to proceed in that direction. The concept that one day a reader of William Hartmann's Traveler's Guide will in fact make the trip is no longer so far fetched.This is a good read for anyone interested in Mars as a destination, or who would just like to know a bit more about that pink speck in the night sky. It also provides food for thought concerning climate change on our own planet. We didn't destroy the atmosphere on Mars, but maybe we can learn how to avoid Mars' fate here on Earth."},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"I cannot believe that there are no reviews on this marvelous book. I chanced upon both the book and the author at the recent Mars Convention in Eugene Oregon. The book has not left my side..... Hartmann picked a most unusual publishing route for his book. The book is part of the Traveler's Guide Series by Workman Press. This represents a great price advantage to the reader. Had one of the more common publishing houses of scientific literature published the book it would have been three times the price.The main theme of the book is the interpretation of the data principally from the current satellites orbiting mars.

The author has divided Mars into areas of interest. He then discussed separately each area. Just like Earth, Mars has many different regions and scenery.Although I am keen on space, somehow this book did little for me. After awhile I found it too much and lost interest in the details of each region. What I would have preferred on Mars is fewer notes and more pictures.The other point is the book is full of interesting pictures unfortunately to appreciate them you need a large size book then this one.Having said that if your interested in Mars geography though you will find this author knows his information, it is current and he explains his points well."},{"Title":"A Traveler's Guide to Mars","review":"This is a really cool book!

If you're looking for the elementary basic geography of mars its generally correct. But when dealing with the more specific details and history of the Martian terrain you find that there are several glaring inaccuracies.Although the author has participated in the Mars Global Surveyor Mission he seems ignorant of what's available in the public domain. The Areas of neglect or should we say avoidance concern volcanism, water and evidence of highly intelligent life.The author seemed to feel that there might have been some volcanic activity on mars within the last 10,000,000 years. Well I hope so, earlier in this decade a NASA image from the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor was made public through the newspapers in which it was displayed and described as an erupting volcanic vent. This image was only a small part of the full image that covers an area some where in the neighborhood of 150 to 400 square miles. At least 50% of area that is shown in this full image is being devastated by volcanic vents and over flowing, crowded calderas that completely cover all that surrounds them with bright glowing lava. (It literally looks like miles of hell!) Re: Global Surveyor image no. M0001750.There is another image with several crashing, misting, waterfalls, waterways and lakes. There is also an excellent image concerning intelligent life that is so fantastic if widely published it would shock the world!I'm sorry, when I know the truth, I just can't get excited enough about this book to give it 5 stars like 14 of you have so far.

Wolfsets forth a revisionist dynamic: the Uterine family and how mothers bond with sons as opposed to the traditional Confucian family values. Wolf claims there is a women's community and a the support system it can provide underlaying the traditional patrilineal values.To make her point, Wolf describes the socialization of female children in the natal family from birth through young womanhood and within the marital family from engagement and marriage to the time they take over the domestic duties of the mothers-in-law. Kingroups and various women's social groups are juxtaposed against village locales. The close relationship between a mother and her sons is compared to the harsher treatment of daughters. Also depicted is entrance into the women's community and the ways the women's community can apply pressure through gossip and loss of face. She also explains non-normative situations: the simpua child, uxorilocal marriages, prostitution. These show examples of women on the outside of the traditional family roles. Adopting a wife for a son as an economic savings and to eliminate stress by training the daughter-in-law, and the difficulties of marrying a brother. Husbands who take their wives family name to provide sons for the lineage, and the stresses of the uxorilocal marriage. Prostitution as a lucrative alternative for some families.Wolf has clearly demonstrated a different dynamic employed by women which overlays the traditional male power structure of the Confucian family, within which women create for themselves a position of security and limited control over their lives and their children's lives and can thus make bearable and even improve family life within the limits of the patriarchal patrilineal society of rural Taiwan."},{"Title":"Women and the Family in Rural Taiwan","review":"A detailed description of Taiwan family life by a leading anthropologist's wife.

She stresses the importance of informal neighborhood groupings of (unrelated) women and dwells extensively on prostitution, especially by adopted daughters (the obssession of Arthur Wolf's life work), and on rivalry between women. In particular, Margery Wolf stresses the rivalry between daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law as leading to the breakup of larger family units into nuclear family households (although in her earlier work she had emphasized the fragility of bonds between brothers that preexisted sister-in-law rivalry as a centripetal force within families ).Wolf considerably underestimated the extent to which women's work outside the house was (and is) important to to the economic well-being of their families and to financing family enterprises. As Diamong complained, \\"there is little feel for how adult women view themselves and their lives, how they interact with the males in their lives, and how completely they accept the male evaluation of them as economically useless and ritually polluting.&quot; Taiwanese scholars have challenged the Western conception of female &quot;pollution&quot; in the work of Wolf, Emily [Martin] Ahern, and others.The specificity of Wolf's _House of Lim_, although it probably depends on unnamed Taiwanese research &quot;assistants&quot; eliciting and translating the data, makes it the most useful of her books."},{"Title":"Hustlers, Heroes & Hooligans: Reporting on the NY Experience","review":"This book Rocks!!!

My husband and daughter are known for their napping together and the sweet picture on the cover made me think this would be the perfect book for them to share together. I bought the book along with 2 other \\"Daddy\\" themed books for her to give her Daddy on Father's Day. When I received the book in the mail, I was sadly disappointed after reading it. The pictures in the book are delightful and adorable. I over looked the story about the diaper change, thinking that is just a normal thing that happens with babies.The 2nd story was cute but had some words that my common, every day working class husband had trouble pronouncing. He asked me why I got a book with such hard words. I have to admit I do not even know how to pronounce \\"souvlaki\\" and I sure don't know what it is? Two other words that were difficult for us were \\"sauerbraten\\" and \\"bourguignonne\\"In the 3rd little story there were even more difficult words to pronounce. My husband asked me what language some of the words were, and I again I have to admit, I have no clue. I Have never in my life read such a difficult story. It made my husband and I both feel stupid TRYING to read it to a 2 year old.In the 4th story, as my husband was reading it outloud to our daughter, I thought it was so sweet as he read the first 4 lines. Then I was shocked by the next 2 lines and I know my husband was too by the look on his face. We would never say something like \\"Of all the babies your the fattest one, You big-leg women are loads of fun\\" to our daughter. NOT in a million years. Luckily the page is white underneath those words because we will be using white-out to cover up those words and leave them out of the story all together. The rest of the story is very sweet.Like I said before, the illustrations are beautiful and parts of the stories are really sweet and endearing but all in all, if I had looked at this book in a book store, I would have never purchased it. My intentions of giving it to my husband for Father's Day was not to embarrass my husband because he could not pronounce several words. I told him there was a CD that came with the book, but after reading it to our daughter, he was not even interested in listening to it.I see lots of positive comments about this book and that also swayed my judgment to purchase this book without first reading it.

I normally don't write reviews because I am so busy, but I was so horrified. I guess ANYTHING can be published.I understand that changing a diaper is part of daily life, but you do not need a father to tell his daughter... \\"the prettiest legs I ever did see belong to a lady who belongs to me. Lift up her legs and take off her diaper, get a damp cloth and carefully wipe her. Up the ankles, swish with the rag. Throw away the diaper in a garbage bag.

I am not being touchy, but there is no humor in that all and it is completely unnecessary and quite frankly perverse. Did a pedophile write this book?With all the sick things happening in this world today with child abuse, you do not need to make changing a diaper into some lovely, intimate thing. Talking about lifting legs, ankles, and a beautiful butt? WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A BABY HERE, not some woman. I'm not thinking perversely. In the world we live in, that is what this sounds like. It's disgusting.And a daughter does not \\"belong\\" to her father, she doesn't \\"belong\\" to anyone.

In fairness, I questioned whether it was me that was perverse, or if the book's content had a sexual undertone with a predatory twist. I have not read any of Keillor's other works, but I understand that he writes for an adult audience (and should continue to do so).Here are some of the more questionable lines:\\"Lift up her legs and take off the diaper,Get a damp cloth and carefully wipe her.\\"Not really a subject for celebration, in my opinion.\\"Bananas\\"\\"My baby, she loves to eat,She climbs into her baby seat.Grabs a spoon and starts to shout,Come on, Daddy, bring it on out!\\"How about an apple, Garrison??\\"Her eyes light up with ecstasy\\"Hmmm, ecstasy? Innocent by definition, but in common usage it is something saved for the bedroom (Not to mention the name of a street drug).\\"Oooh, baby, you're so sweet\\".Oooh, baby? This is repeated four times throughout the book. If someone says this to my daughter, I reach for the nearest shovel.\\"Of all the babies you're the fattest one,You big-leg women are a load of fun\\".No comment necessary... that's just unacceptable.Add to these comments some pictures of sexually confused men, women who look like strippers and references to nuts, meatballs, and bananas, and you tell me that you wouldn't feel sick reading this to innocent little girls."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"Read this book in it's entirety before buying! I work in a childrens specialty store, and we acquired this book. Recently, I watched a daddy pick up this book read the first page to his baby daughter, put the book down and walked out of the store. I immdediatly went over and read the book.First of all Robin Preiss Glasser's illustrations are adorable (as always). As beautiful as the illustrations were, the book was ladden with incestual content. NO father should ever talk about, nor think about his daughter in this way! I would be mortified if my husband thought this was a great book for he and our daughter to share. Garrison Keillor's words can easily be portrayed as pedifilia. It is not a stretch of the imagination to come to this conclusion either-read the first page with an open mind and a critical eye! When you do, consider that not everyone views it in the same innocent manner that it was probably intended.I would also like to add that our store supervisory team (including quality assurance techs, education teachers) have recommended it be removed from the shelves. As of today, it is no longer available at our specialty store. Maybe those naive persons that have no issues with the content of the book are, infact, the ones with underlying unhealthy attachment issues."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"This is the most stupid children's book I've ever read. I am so disappointed. Please see the preview pages before purchasing this product."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I've never seen the word \\"ecstasy\\" used in a children's book before. Call me crazy, but I don't want my daughter asking me what \\"ecstasy\\" is for a loooooong time! Now I'm very open minded but this is just a weird and unfortunate choice of words along with some content others have mentioned. It's a shame since it is beautifully illustrated and would be fun to share. I wouldn't recommend it though."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"My wife picked this up for $2 as an addition to an order and left it out for me to read when I got home. I am shocked that a book like this could ever be printed. I am a father of a 13 year old and one year old. I have endured many an incredible moment with both of my daughters, but never have I thought about them in this light. As the fattest one? With a nice clean but? It as if this author had serious issues that need to be addressed."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I'd say that all of the positive reviews must be friends of the author or didn't really read the words. Anyone that is thinking about buying this book, don't waste your money on this sick book. The content is completely bizarre and deviant as others have quoted. What kind of father says those types of things about his daughter?? There is nothing cute, sweet or adorable about this book. Save your $7 and go have ice cream with your daughter. Since I already bought it, it'll be out with Thursday's trash pickup. I wouldn't even give it to Goodwill, whereas to put this book in someone else's hands!"},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day, his first with our daughter. My heart literally broke as I read the page \\"Won't You Dance With Me?\\". The lines :\\"Of all the babies you're the fattest one, You big-leg women are a load of fun\\" are horrifying. In a time and culture where girls are comparing them selves to images in magazines, where they are falsely made to think they need to be thin to be worthy of love and acceptance- who could possibly want to read these words to a young girl. I am returning this book and will boycot all things Garrison Keillor in the future."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"This book is very sweet and is written by someone who is old enough to remember what life was like before everyone became so freaked-out about every little thing. When you read a line like, \\"Lift up her legs and take off the diaper; Get a damp cloth and carefully wipe her,\\" do you really think there is something perverse about that? What planet are you from?? I am lucky to be the daddy of a 2-year-old girl. Diaper changing is a fact of life. Every day for the last 2 years I have lifted her legs, removed her diaper, and carefully wiped her with a damp cloth. If you walked up to me on the street and told me that I'm a pervert for changing my daughter's diaper, I would punch you in the mouth. Anyone uncomfortable with a line like that is a goofball.Oh, and here is how my dictionary defines the word \\"ECSTASY\\":1. rapturous delight.2. an overpowering emotion or exaltation; a state of sudden, intense feeling.3. the frenzy of poetic inspiration.4. mental transport or rapture from the contemplation of divine things.Ecstasy is a word that is only 'dirty' for those who WANT it to be dirty. If you insist that there is a sexual connotation whenever the word \\"ecstasy\\" is used, you are the weirdo. Like I said before, the author (born in 1942) comes from an era where people used words like \\"banana\\" and \\"nut\\" and \\"meatball\\" and didn't automatically think about sex. Some of these reviewers have watched Austin Powers a few too many times.One more example -\\"Of all the babies you're the fattest one; You big-leg women are a load of fun\\".Today when people hear the word \\"fat\\" they think about morbid obesity, apparently. Baby-fat is cute and healthy and normal. The whole world loves an adorable little chubby baby. I believe that the author uses the phrase \\"you're the fattest one\\" in a loving and proud way, as if saying, \\"you're the cutest one\\". And in that context, the phrase \\"you big-leg women are a load of fun\\" is just a silly thing to say - and far from inappropriate.I would agree with the people who suggest reading this book in a library or bookstore first. Why? One reviewer said that they bought the book and hated it so much that they were going to throw it into the trash rather than donate it to charity. If you're that idiotic, please, please, read the book first, and don't buy it. Don't put it into the garbage and send it to a landfill. Don't stage a Nazi-style book-burning. Just leave it in the store and go back to watching your Austin Powers movies."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I saw Mr. Keillor at a reading of this delightful new book in New York, and he's one of a kind! This book is funny, clever, and truly captures the spirit and depth of feeling that a father can have for his child. The illustrator captured the Upper West Side gorgeously - like Woody Allen makes you see the City with charm. The CD that comes with the book of Mr. Keillor singing these songs will have you singing and dancing along with with the text. I will be buying this book for Father's Day for my Dad and all the other great Dads I know to share with their daughters."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"If you've never watched a father interact with his young daughter, you have missed a delightful treat. There aren't many things as sweet as the love a father has for his daughter as he watches her in day-to-day activities. The love returned from the daughter is almost one of adoration. Such is the sentiment of Garrison Kellor's children's book DADDY'S GIRL. In it, he shares four stories in which a father celebrates moments of quiet time, taking walks, dining, and dancing with his little girl. The joy of fatherhood bounces off the pages and into the reader's heart.Robin Preiss Glasser's illustrations set this book off perfectly, with her depiction of the little girl in various poses of exuberance and the father glowing with pride. I loved it! Adding to the charm of this book is an accompanying CD which includes several of the stories/verses put to music that is catchy, a bit jazzy and fun to listen to and sing along with. DADDY'S GIRL was a fun, delightful, and heart-warming read. I look forward to sharing it with my husband and our daughter -- a definite Daddy's girl!Reviewed by Tee C. Royalof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"When I first saw this book I thought it would be full of \\"sugar and spice\\" sentiment - a perfect companion for quiet daddy-daughter moments before bedtime, etc. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that an altogether different type of feeling was addressed: those times when you think you will positively explode with the joy and excitement of having a little girl that calls you daddy. By itself, this superbly-illustrated book captures the essence of these moments, but, for me, the whole experience is brought to life by singing along with the CD. The one small issue I would have with the product is that there 4 songs in the book and 4 tracks on the CD, but one of the songs in the book isn't on the CD and vice versa - not that this really lessens the enjoyment. Buy this book and put a smile on your face."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I loved this book. My husband and I were blessed by a daughter 10 months ago after being told for years that I could not conceive. She is joyful baby, and is cuddly sweet and like a lot of babies, has rolls all over. She loves music and her daddy dances with her every day. I found absolutely nothing offensive about this book. People are so quick to instill sexual overtones into everything and anything.The first story is about daddy changing the diaper. Get real, people: diaper changes are a fact of life and there's is absolutely nothing wrong with how it is described. I sure wouldn't want my husband to \\"haphazardly\\" wipe our daughter instead of the \\"carefully\\" as the book says. As anyone with a baby girl knows (We also have a 4 year old adopted son that we've had since birth) it's a tricky business to wipe a girl clean after a bowel movement in order not to contaminate her. And what in the world is wrong with a beautiful baby with a \\"nice clean butt\\"? Although it's not a word we frequently use in our household (we prefer the gentler \\"bottom\\") I think it's hilarious and sad that it could be miscontrued.\\"B-a-n-a-n-a-s\\" is the 2nd story and it's about the daughter loving a certain food. I know most babies loves bananas and I can't believe people would think it's a metaphor for a penis. My daughter happens to love spinach. I would describe her eyes lighting up in \\"ecstasy\\" when she sees I have spinach for her...she actually opens her mouth as wide as it will go, throws her hands up in the air and frantically waves them, and wiggles in her seat in pure anticipation. It's cute; not perverted, creepy, or disturbing as some people have said. Bananas are a fun fruit for babies...they love the taste, texture, ease of eating (it's much softer and easier for babies to gum or chew than a lot of other fruits. And my daughter prefers the sweeter, milder taste to peaches, strawberries, or other fruits) And b-a-n-a-n-a-s is a cute word that kids love to spell. (Gee, did anyone tell Gwen Stefani that her song was OBVIOUSLY about her Electra complex with her father???) To the person who suggested Mr. Keillor could have used \\"apples\\"...why? So he could be accused of using it as a metaphor for testicles? What about \\"peaches\\" \\"pears\\" \\"kiwis\\" or practically any other fruit that is round or cylindrical? It's just grasping at straws and trying to make something dirty that is innocent!The last story almost made me tear up. There's not a day that goes by that I don't feel blessed to have our daughter and her daddy is an amazing man. He dances with her, plays music for her, and one day will gladly/sadly dance at her wedding. As I mentioned, our daughter is about as roly-poly as they come and we absolutely love it. She's a BABY. Babies are supossed to be chubby. My daughter has a double chin, \\"thunder thighs\\", and creases in places that don't even have a joint! Luckily, she is a BABY and all that fat helps keep her temperature regulated and provides stored energy for all her increasing crawling/standing/walking. Her big, strong thighs have helped her start standing at 7 months, and practically walking at 10 months. I love her \\"big-legs\\"!! She eats a very healthy diet and is constantly crawling, moving and exploring her world. My husband and I kiss her chubby cheeks, nuzzle her little neck rolls, squish her chubby little thighs. Babies are supposed to be loved and given physical affection. I love her squishy baby fat that is so kissable. Who doesn't see a chubby baby and smile? My son was all legs and arms as a baby (and still is!) but I delighted in kissing and cuddling him as much as I could too. Now he laughs and goes \\"Aw Mom!\\" and sometimes even wipes it off when I kiss him and I know my daughter will eventually do the same.The daddy in this book obviously loves his daughter, and delights in all the everyday moments he gets to spend with her. He knows she will someday get married and most of her affection will go to someone else so he's just enjoying her baby days as a chance to cuddle her while he can. It is a sweet story full of love and caring. Hands-on dads are not always celebrated or talked about and I love that this story shows a dad who spends every moment, from banal (eating breakfast and changing diapers) to the special occasion (dancing with her at a wedding). What girl wouldn't want a doting father that isn't afraid to show his affection and love? My daughter will always have her daddy's heart, no matter what age she is. And I know she is going to grow up more confident and able to love others because her parents aren't afraid to show their love for her.This book isn't for everyone, especially those with narrow minds who prefer to taint affection for children as some sort of predatory action. As a survivor of sexual abuse as a child, I would stop at nothing to ensure my daughter's safety and well-being. However, I also know that kids need love, kisses, hugs, cuddles, and their parents and loved ones to see the world through their eyes. I'm sure the baby girl in the story will have a hard time finding someone to love and marry who measures up to her daddy. That's the way it should be."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I purchased this book for my husband and daughter after leafing through it at the store and seeing \\"Bananas,\\" which seems to describe our little one perfectly! I didn't even notice it was by Garrison Keillor, a master storyteller, until later. It immediately became my husband's favorite book to read to our babe. The poetry is witty, intelligent and true. The negative reviews of this book sicken me, honestly... anyone who finds this book perverted must have some serious underlying issues. I see absolutely nothing wrong with rhyming about a diaper change (\\"beautiful baby with a nice clean butt\\"), a man feeding his daughter bananas, or a line like \\"you big-legged women are a load of fun,\\" which we thought was very cute, on account of the chunky thighs of little ones, ours included. I suppose those who want to be offended will be.This is a wonderful and innocent book about the love and everyday lives of fathers and daughters. Please, do not be put off by a couple of small-minded paranoids."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"This is a very cute book! The sentiment is sweet, the wit is classic Garrison Keillor and the illustrations are wonderful. My 2.5 year old daughter loves to dance to the songs on the accompanying CD. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I absolutely love this book! My hubby and I love Garrison Keillor. Some friends of ours got it for my daughter for Christmas and it is one of our favorite books! I love the pictures, I love the lyrics. I love everything about it. The CD is an added bonus.I actully get a kick about his comments on baby legs and the pictorial reference to his wife's legs. It is great!My daughter loves bananas. They have been her favorite since we first introduced them. She is now two and we are still able to use them as \\"desert.\\" So we love reading that one to her. She laughs and thinks the whole thing is silly.I almost always cry on the last one. Even now it saddens me that she will grow up and leave us for the wide world one day. It also saddens me, because it reminds how very far I live from my daddy and how much I love him.It is a great book. The lyrics are completely child appropriate. (The comments to the contary were hard for me to understand at first. I had to read them several times over before I could even come up with what was wrong with bananas.) I highly recommend it. It is a beautiful representation of how beautiful and special the daddy daughter relationship can be."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"Garrison Keillor, of \\"A Prairie Home Companion\\" radio show fame, has written an incredibly beautiful story, dedicated to his own daughter, that takes place in a very colorful Paris (or another city in France). The \\"daughter\\" in the story is a very young girl who notices and delights in the people and places she encounters on walks through the town with her daddy. Mom is never shown or referred to, just a delightful relationship between father and daughter. I bought this book for my son-in-law as he became a first-time daddy to a new daughter on June 1st (of 2006). The story brought tears to my eyes and he was thrilled to get it. It is a beautiful hard-bound book that would make a great addition to any child's (or parent's) library, and would make any little girl feel very special if her daddy reads it to her."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"Oh how my 27 month old daughter LOVES this book (and so do I). The illustrations are beautiful, the rhyming verse delightful, and the sentiment is just as sweet and wonderful as a daddy's love for his daughter(s).I recently lost my father, and am a Single Mom... this book touches my heart & makes my daughter laugh out loud. Can't beat that in a board book. I just wish Garrison Keillor would create a SERIES of these."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I honestly don't understand the negative comments about this book! It is absolutely charming and really brings out the emotions felt by a daddy for his little girl. I received this last father's day (from my mom) and barely got through it due to the fact I got so choked up reading it (and still do!). And to the person who wrote they were somehow offended by the word \\"ecstasy\\" is a total moron! The word means \\"delight and/or joy\\" you loser! (read a dictionary next time). I think many of these negative comments are from people who are simply emotionally detached! And the person who wants to see this book taken out of schools - Some fanatical religious nut no doubt! Yes there is one strange verse about the girl having fat little legs (or something like that) --- But don't most toddlers? I get the it! It's an endearing reference. The verses are wonderful, the drawings show the joy in both the daddy and the little girl and their delight in being together. Now that my daughter is 18 months old (with brown curly hair I might add) we often read the book together before I go to work. Many of the verses and pictures depict the feelings I have for her and the daily things we do together. When she sees the pictures of the daddy and the girl sleeping she says \\"shoosh....nignt, night\\"; she loves the pictures of the girl eating and points to the food naming many of the items. And just like the story, her favorite is bananas! She wiggles and pretends to dance when we come to the part where the dad is dancing with his daughter. And she hugs and kisses me when we get to the end, as they are doing in the book.Don't believe these morons that are negative over this book! These people are the people who probably would even take their kids to Disneyland because of the \\"oversized mouse\\" that is running around!This is absolutely one of the most charming little books about a dad and his little girl I have ever come across! So there!"},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"In my family, Daddy and his two girls enjoy sharing the book together, then using it as a starter to create their own little songs about Daddy and his girls and the things they enjoy about each other."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I am a fan of Keillor's radio and written work and many colleagues and friends agree with me that he is one of the most astute and wise voices of our generation. GK's wit and brilliance are present in his adult works but his kind, gentle side shines through on \\"Daddy's Girl\\". I purchased this for a dear family friend on the birth of their daughter and they loved it.If anyone reads perversion into the words written in this book, then they have only their twisted mind to blame. The words are charming and evoke the affection and humor that comes with a baby girl. The stories are touching, funny and evoke the folksy genteelness that's a staple of GK's radio programme. If the words are too tough (gasp!), then do what you'd tell a child to do, look them up and sound them out!"},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I looked at this book and saw my niece and the men in her life. Daddy's girl is so full of life and self-confidence. She struts down the street as if she owns it, and it's obvious that she knows the world is a wonderful and safe place because her (often bewildered looking) Daddy is right there for her.The CD, was ok. It's a musical version of the stories (and not in the same order) but changes in the words make it impossible for a kid to use it to read along, and I thought that the books was just great even without it."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"This is an excellent book! As a former teacher & now a Mommy, I love this book. I bought it as a present for my husband on Father's Day from his little girl. Our daughter is 20 months old & has loved it for a few months. The accompanying CD is also terrific. My husband & daughter dance to it every night. I love hearing the giggles & squeals as my own \\"big-legged\\" girl dances with her daddy."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I ordered this book for my daughter to give her daddy on father's day.

Probably available now on CD."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"Being a fan of Garrison Keillor, I was excited to find this book to give my husband for his first Father's Day! There are a few phrases that may sound a bit odd, but that is partly the author's humor, and partly from viewpoint of an older generation. Just a notice to those who read the other reviews and thought the book automatically came with a CD like I thought - the boardbook does NOT come with a CD. I was very disappointed about that - would have loved to hear Garrison sing the songs!"},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I just received this book from my wife and 14-month old daughter for Father's Day. The book is a complete joy. It expresses the love I have for my little girl so very well--and without being cheesy or sappy.From Keillor's writing you can tell that the daughter is clearly the treasure of the father's life, and that he finds every aspect of their relationship fascinating and joyful. From dancing, to eating, to changing diapers, and of course sharing a nap on the couch, the book contains several well-narrated vignettes that feel just like scenes from our own lives.As an added bonus, the book's language is not overly simplified, and contains some challenging words that will make it interesting for my daughter as her own vocabulary expands.I thoroughly recommend this book, and look forward to reading it for years to come. It will be a sad day when my little girl is too old to for it. But luckily that's a few years away yet!"},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"My daughter loves this book. She knows it by heart and loves to have daddy read it at bed time."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"I thought this would be a great book to give to my brother as he became a dad for the first time. However, when I read the book I just didn't feel comfortable giving it to him.A dad and a baby girl's book should be sweet and cuddly, but the image the words produced hit me slightly odd. Why should a dad talk about lifting his baby girl's legs and wiping in between?Perhaps I've been tainted by all of the devient TV out there these days, but it does sound a little Freudian."},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"Seriously? Ditto to all of the 1 star reviews.In fact, this should have a negative star on it to warn others.I am surprised this was published.This is no children's book - there are words in this book that children would not understand nor would parents want to explain at that age (ie ecstacy).There are plenty of other great books out there!"},{"Title":"Daddy's Girl","review":"This book is so sweet. I bought it for my husband for Father's Day and my daughter gets such a kick out of it when he reads it to her. However, the board book does not come with a CD which was very disappointing to me. I will just have to buy the hardcover as well I guess.PSI can't believe the people who are reading into the words of this book with sick minds. Obviously those people do not have kids because if they did they would know how you make up songs for just about everything you do with them. These are nothing but sweet stories of changing a diaper and little fat baby legs, not perversion.
