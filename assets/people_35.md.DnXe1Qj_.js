I love getting caught up with the Bennett family. There's just something about the book...The real reason I'm writing this review is not to dwell on the wonderfulness that is Pride and Prejudice, but to note my slight distraction by the formatting. There were certain spots where lines broke oddly, and strange words that were written in all capital letters. It was often enough to be slightly distracting, but still a good book and a wonderful read (if that sort of thing doesn't bother you too much)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well it's quite simply a classic! I was only 12 when the TV show came on and remember becoming transfixed by it. It propelled me to Austen's books and I haven't looked back since. Simply, a thoroughly good read for anyone who likes a delightful love story and appreciates fine story telling that really gives you a sense of its characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. I've gone over it again and again, and I still love it. A couple parts may be tedious at times (like Mr. Collins...blech), but over all, a really good book. Not to mention, this book is pratically free! Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was a fantastic book. I started the book thinking it would be dull and old fashioned. After the first chapter I couldn't put it down. I am now working my way through all of the Jane Austen books and enjoying every word of it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The story is wonderful. A could not put it down.The only negative is the occasional typos (used \\"-----shire\\" a lot) and used only one letter initial for names in some areas. Annoying but it was free."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A classic tale of the &#34;play hard to get&#34; gets you far! A little hard to read through if your not used to the old english. But never the less a classic tale of the dating game."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read parts of this book to my wife, who, like so many female readers, had previously read it. So much has been already been written about the superb characterization and a decent plot, that I don't feel I can add much to it. I found the dialogue witty and intelligent.Austin demonstrates that timeless problem of how men and women continue to misunderstand each other. The language of civility is a hoot, and descriptions of what is socially appropriate add tensions and obstacles. This is a marvelous read and a worthwhile way to spend some time over the holidays."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There was a time in our 20's and into our 30's that a slight film covered our lives. Metaphorically speaking, of course, we were wandering around in our own world of literary complacency. We never realized this, though much like those Claritin D commercials, all our surroundings became sharper and brighter, due to Jane Austen and her charming novel, Pride and Prejudice. We would ask you, oh kind reader, to cast every last ounce of your sense and sensibility aside and read this book. Just be careful that in hast you don't pick up Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which has a slightly different take on this classic love story.Miss Elizabeth Bennett is the second oldest of five girls raised in a poor(ish) family on the English countryside, outside of London. Smart, funny, passionate, loyal, and a tad bit prideful, she is the literary heroine of our dreams. Enter Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth with a pair of awesome sideburns). Seemingly arrogant, self righteous, and uppity; our Eliza quickly decides what he can do with all his preconceptions. Upon our word, there is hardly a man quite as standoffish and rude as this gentleman... or is there? Don't be too quick to pass judgment.Pride and Prejudice is likeable on so many different levels. Austen does an amazing job of changing rudeness into shyness, fierce animosity into extreme thankfulness, and all around bad guys into good ones...and then changing them back with the snap of her fingers. Pride and Prejudice stands as one of our absolute favorites and we are still anxiously awaiting an invitation to Pemberley Estate so we can check out Darcy's impressive home library."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Unlike many required readings for high school literature classes, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an engaging read. She builds the complexity of this novel with each additional character introduction. As the story progresses, I felt the connection between myself and the Bennet women develop. Though not as dramatic as the early 19th century, the same credentials for an acceptable relationship exist in the modern 21st century. Wealth and social status, as well as appearance were essential to the acceptance of a spouse, to avoid embarrassment to one's family. There remains an element of judgment in relationships today concerning individual etiquette, wealth and physical characteristics. This prejudice extends to peers and family members. In Pride and Prejudice, it contributed to the anxiety in the developing relationships between Jane and Mr. Bingley, as well as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In the opening of the novel, Darcy's pride leads to Elizabeth's prejudice against him. His admiration grows because of her rebuke. This scenario takes place in all aspects of our society. We want what we can't have or that which seems out of our reach. We are never satisfied. Darcy falls victim to these desires as Elizabeth's rebuke transforms his pride into admiration for her.Looking past the intricacy of the English language, I found Pride and Prejudice to be a novel of great complexity, where the lives of all characters are intertwined. From Mr. Collins marrying Charlotte Lucas, to Mr. Darcy finding Lydia for the Bennet's, each character had some effect on all the others. Austen keeps the reader wondering, only putting their minds to ease at the conclusion of the novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a perfect novel.

It is a timeless story about the tangled relationship between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. What I love so much about this book is how relevant these situations still are and how easy it is to relate to all of the characters. I have read other Jane Austin novels, and so far this is by far my favorite. Elizabeth is such a strong female character, and Mr. Darcy is a wonderfully complex and interesting male character. This is definitely one of my \\"comfort books.\\" Whenever I have had an unpleasant day or need to relax, rereading Pride and Prejudice always makes me feel better. Truly, it is on of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this 'Collector's Library' too.

Although ours is no longer a culture of manners, life events and human emotions never change. Superb reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The core character in this novel is Elizabeth, an attractive and intelligent 20 year-old and the second daughter (out of five) of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. . Her mother's main interest is to see her five daughters, all eligible, nicely settled down and married to respectable and rich gentlemen.Elizabeth's personality, very unlike her mother's, unfolds throughout the pages in a crescendo of emotions resulting from various issues connected with the whole family saga and especially to her own contrasting feelings towards a certain young man, Mr. Darcy. Will Elizabeth's passionate and sensible nature, combined with a certain degree of boldness (for those days), make her discover what lies beyond his seemingly unpleasant and unreadable personality?The graceful politeness in the prose is charming, delineating a faithful image of life at the end of the 18th century in England.The intrigues beyond wished-for marriages are very accurately described by Ms. Austen, with a touch of humour \\"hither and thither\\". I could not help myself comparing similar issues with nowadays. Beyond the characterisation and a part from the language, style and general progress, I believe that human nature, as depicted, is the same as it always was and it is not all just about \\"love\\", it is also about people attempting to incorporate into a higher position in society, seeking integration at a greater level. It was also interesting, I thought, to see how relevant (or irrelevant) the \\"worth\\" bestowed on the female gender was back then, compared to the present day in most societies. This, combined with the rapidity with which one fell in love, got engaged and/or was forbidden or denied to marry, could be stimulating subjects for ensuing conversations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15 years old, and I loved it. Even though it took me some time to understand the old english text, the meaning was still there. Just recently (now I am 18) I saw the tv mini series of Pride and Prejudice, and fell in love with it all over again! You can feel Mr. Darcy's anguish as he watches Lizzie from afar, and you squirm in your chair knowing that Lizzie despises Darcy because she thinks that he abhors her. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet make you laugh, and you can just feel the embarrassment that the younger sisters bring to the older ones. This is the most amazing story, and I do not feel that it is in the least an ordinary one. It is a hold-your-breath romance with comedy, intrigue, a little suspense, and coincidence. A beautiful tale of old English life, and an easy to love character - Elizabeth Bennet. This is by far my favorite story of all time.

The vivid range of emotions of all the characters are a pleasure to read they involuntary invoke reponse from the reader"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book Pride And Prejudice is a very good novel; it takes place during the 19th century, when women were inferior to men. The title of the novel Pride And Prejudice has an actual meaning in the story that describes the main characters. This novel has some similarities to today's society in various ways.The meaning of the title describes the personality of Darcy and Elizabeth. Darcy had the personality of being proud, and Elizabeth was very prejudiced. The reason Darcy had that personality was because he was a wealthy man who didn't associate with people who were from a lower social class. He didn't have the confidence to tell Elizabeth that he liked her because of his pride. Elizabeth was really prejudiced because before she met people, she distrusted them. Elizabeth thought Darcy's love for her wasn't real when it actually was true. I think the way that Darcy and Elizabeth were acting was foolish because pride and prejudice are not good things to have. It causes problems among people.In the story the strong one was actually the woman because she did not let him play with her and that attracted Darcy to Elizabeth.. Chapter three appealed to me because that was the beginning of all of the misunderstanding in the novel, which made it interesting for the readers to read. The sparks lit up in that chapter. The pride and prejudice of Darcy and Elizabeth started and kept on getting worse throughout the novel because even though they felt an attraction for each other they had misunderstanding that made them have bad feelings. But like all stories it always has a solution at the end. I liked the misunderstanding because it kept on make me feel a great suspense that made me want to keep on reading to find the answer, especially when Darcy asked Elizabeth to dance and was rejected by her. This part of the chapter was the best part because it life me with questions about what was going to happen later in the story with them, and it also confused me because I didn't think that they were going to end up marrying at the end.I liked this book a lot. It is one of my favorite books right now. The rating that the critics gave this book was a wise decision, five stars, because it was well written and interesting. This book is appropriate for people in the age of 14 and up. If you like to read suspense novels, you will like this novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I found it to be quite difficult to get into at first, proved to be a truely enjoyable reading experience. Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events. I recommend this book to any person with a high attention span interested in reading an uplifting story about the powers of true love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is generally considered a pretty, romantic book - like a swan on a lake. But much like the swan, it's what happening underneath that's important. I have always admired this book for its wit and sharp observations but also for the title. Clever and astute, as usual. But is it Elizabeth who is proud and Darcy who is prejudiced? Or vice versa? Or are they both proud and prejudiced? These questions keep me re-reading this masterpiece at least once a year and I change my mind about the answers every time. This book will give me a lifetime of pleasure."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is probably one of the wittiest and most delightful books I've read in a long time. I recall reading Jane Austen several years ago with Northanger Abbey and I absolutely despised it. But after, adoring the miniseries for Pride and Prejudice, I figured it would do justice to read the book. Pardon my disastrous attempt to sound sophisticated, but it is sometimes amusing to mimic another author's style while reviewing her book. I can hardly wait for Burgess.:PThe book certainly renewed my love for the movie as well as literature of the Victorian era. I've never been a big fan of literature from that time period, despising books like Oliver Twist, Phantom of the Opera, Wuthering Heights and Frankenstein because they dragged on and on with melodrama. Jane Austen varied in the sense that her book was light-hearted and full of comedy and wit.Her characters were lovable. Elizabeth was well-rounded and respectable and if I could have but half her wit in her replies, I would be much indulged. Jane possesses good nature beyond what one would deem natural. Mr.Bingley was good natured as well. And finally, Mr.Darcy who had that air of mystery about him soon grew warm in my heart with his charitable acts. And as the book progressed, I became more and more interested in their well-being and future happiness. However, the most memorable characters would be the secondary characters. Mrs.Bennet was absolutely hilarious. I was equally embarassed as Elizabeth of her mother and her immaturity and lack of understanding. Mr.Bennet on the other hand, with his odd and wry comments provided even more amusement. He has the dryest sense of humour. Lydia is virtually insufferable with her youth and fails to understand any of the pain she has caused her family. Poor Miss Bingley seemed to be such an annoyance to Mr.Darcy with all her attempts to win his attention. And Mr.Collins was a laughable mess. I could not help but love to hate him.Unfortunately, having seen the movie first, I had an irreversible tendency to think of the scenery and the characters in terms of the movie. However, I found it rather pleasurable since this was perhaps the first time I've read a book with a concrete image of the characters and the scenery since I usually ignore such facts and descriptions. The descriptions were never excessive either as they tend to be in Victorian novels. Scenes were never described beyond half a page. Comments were often made on the characters but they never dragged on for pages on end. Usually, at most, they lasted about half a page. As for the emotions of the characters, Jane Austen did not linger on them for long. Enough indications were given to entice the reader, but not excessively as to bore.The dialogue was the most memorable and quotes of Austen popped out everyone. I was disappointed to find that at certain places, Austen merely described the coversation instead of actually carrying it out through dialogue.I find the book is still nevertheless romantic in nature and more redeeming to females as it would be to males. But I suppose all you guys are just missing out! I'm not normally a fan of romance but the book pursues it with such intelligence that I could not help but like it. I'm still a bit unconvined of the actual plausibility of the marriages in the story but they seem so satisfying, you might as well take them to be true. Romance books are nice in the sense that in the end, that undeniable happy ending is always guaranteed to be there to satisfy. And overall, Pride and Prejudice and satisfied me at the end with a warm and happy ending but nevertheless leaving me wanting to know more of the characters. It is book whose charm lies in the style and the characters and could be easily read over and over again. This book definitely will be one of my favourites.My goodness, I am embarassed by my own review. I sound like such a ...!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit that this is a very well written book: the situations, the characters, the idea. I must also admit, though, that for that very fact, I didn't enjoy the book. The book was a comedy of manners on society and people. Most of the people were irritating, and I couldn't get into it. This is not to say that there is a flaw in Austen's writing. She is a most excellent authoress. I was so annoyed by the well-written characters that I couldn't enjoy them."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i love this book!i read it first in 5th grade[though it was hard to understand!] then in 6th, 3 times in 7th and 4-5 times in 8th.i m like obsessed with this book!i also loved the film version, and i watched all the 3 versions.jane austen is indeed a great author. the way she portrays her characters is really creative, and u can just imagine what they look like, their personality, etc. i simply enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book in my sophomore English class. For me, it was a perfect introduction to the Classics. The language is similar to books such as Anna Karenina and the like, but there is an element of humor that even us twentieth century dimwits can relate to. Sometimes subtle, and sometimes not, Jane Austen keeps us on our toes with her eighteenth-century characters that somehow manage to be hip. No matter who you are, you will find yourself rooting for one or another of the characters as they struggle for something ... if not hapiness, then an extremely desirable position in life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This review is for the Recorded Books Classics Library on CD.Austen is Austen, so the quality of her writing and character observation will ultimately elevate any spoken performance of her text. Of the dozen or so books I've listened to in the Recorded Books Classic Library series, though, this is the first where I really felt the reader let me down.Flo Gibson reads fast, notjustbriskbutfast. I understand the desire to keep things moving, especially in a text that has as many descriptive passages as narrative ones, but I also think Austen needs to be savored a bit to be optimally enjoyed. The cadence never quite gets to the point where the reader is talking so fast that you can't understand her, but it does get to the point where you really have to listen intently, which can be hard to do while driving (which is where most people I know listen to books on CD). I found myself rewinding or back skipping the CD several times to say, \\"What was that phrase?\\" Again, not enough to ruin it, but enough to make it a more frustrating experience than a pleasurable one.Acceptable for those familiar with the novel who want to revisit it, but if this is your first time through, do yourself a favor and curl up with the book first. You won't regret it.[For a good contrast or alternative, check out Barbara Caruso's reading of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth in the same series; it is superb.]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found this book to be humorous and light-hearted. It was also satirical about society during the eighteenth century. Historically, the book was accurate and interesting. The book had a variation of themes; comedy, romance, irony, and so on. The style of the book enables you to feel the moods of the main characters. I felt hatred for Mr. Darcy and his stubbornness. Mr. Bennet's attitude about his wife and family was witty. Each character had their own unique characteristic, which showed the differences and faults of society.The situation between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy grows along with their love. The irony of how subtle their love has grown for each other is very entertaining. No one truly believed that Elizabeth loved Mr. Darcy rather she was spiteful towards him. But as the book progresses, she learns about her harsh judgments about him and falls in love for him. Her sister, Jane does not even believe in this love.The book also shows how life sometimes works out for the better when expecting the worst. The complications and different views on marriage show how people do not think a like. Charlotte Lucas, Lizzie's friend, does not believe in marriage for love, rather she thinks marrying comfortably is more than enough. In life, there are ups and downs, along with each human being. She rather learns about them after she is in wedlock, then learning before hand. Although everyone believes that Jane and Mr. Bingly would be married and loved each, conflicts occur. Different people, separating the two, misled Mr. Bingly and Jane. Luckily, the truth is learned and things work out. Lizzie has the most conflicts of them all. She finds a new guy that she likes, but realizes she loves the person who she least expected it from, Mr. Darcy.Overall the book was well written and I enjoyed the letters from others, showing each person's different perspective and styles. The details and descriptions are magnificent and captivating."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"although some may not notice it, this Austen novel is romantically-centered. The subtlety of the liaison between Darcy and Elizabeth and their psychological games leave the reader with the impression that the protagonist is doomed to spinsterhood, while her sisters one by one are exfoliated away by their respective bridegrooms.It's not until towards the conclusion of the story that Austen finally gratifies her desires by ( spoiler! ) bringing Darcy and Eliza together. Romance, courtship, and flirtation perceived as daring back in Austen's pre-Victorian era are so uncouth and perplexing to the modern reader that he/ she might miss out on a truly light-hearted romantic comedy with ludic characters and good-natured humor.This is one of Austen's finest works and I regard her as one of the great writers, female or otherwise."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As embarrassing as it sounds, I must make a confession: I, a male college student, was up till two a.m. on a Saturday finishing this book. In short, the novel is well worth the attention of any personality type, any demographic, any fancy, any interest. It is a marvelous story, written flawlessly, and with such a humorous personality to bind it all together that one might frequently erupt aloud in laughter.The laughter, while abundant and universally entertaining, does not supercede the primary intentions of this novel, signified in the title by &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Prejudice.&quot; And, indeed, in these two arenas, Austin succeeds marvelously in creating a tale that thrusts upon the reader both of these emotions, causing him to experience and be embarrassed by his own possession of these two traits. In that case, Pride and Prejudice is a work of pure genius. Especially with the subject of the Prejudice, the reader becomes so involved in the misconceptions and assumptions between one character and another that he is thrown through the tumultuous emotions that form the characters into more just and honorable characters at the novels conclusion.Having had only Sense and Sensibility as a prior introduction to Jane Austin, I emphatically commit that Pride is the greater, more humorous, more emotionally charged, and more intellectually potent novel. To the very degree which the reader wrongfully dislikes--even abhors--certain characters in the book, makes the conclusions finale--long awaited and anxiously feared to be tragic--the more powerful of a climax. Never before have I read a book that so forcefully charged me to reevaluate my own convictions and prejudice of other people. It is truly a masterwork of reader manipulation, as the characters in the book are pulled ride along side, and both the fictional and non-fictional assumptions are cast aside and replaced with shame and embarrassment.In conclusion, there are so many reasons to read this book that it is impossible to deny. Read it for the laughter, for the story, for the passion, for the irrefutable and welcome reversal that it will no doubt spur in each reader who picks the novel up. There is so much to learn and so much fun to be had with this book, that no one should be deprived of the experience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and because I had watched the Wishbone show and did not believe that the main character could be a dog. The words were a bit difficult but I read it and was really surprised. It starts out a bit slow, but after the middle, it became really interesting and after the book, I felt really good. I actually read the end a couple times again. The characters are really charming, especially Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I guess you could say it was the ultimate miscommunication. It is an adult fairy tale, is what I can describe it as."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"But for this book I have to. I first picked up Austen's P&amp;P when I was in middle school and it failed the 3 chapter test. (You know the test: if you aren't interested in the book by chapter 3 put it down.) I picked it up again a few years later and simply fell in love with the wonderful story.Austen may have written the book over a century ago but the themes that play out within its pages are universal today. Pride, wealth, and station in life are still as important today as they were when Mrs. Bennet was hoping to find husbands for her daughters. In P&amp;P Austen writes about falling in love, how we view it, and how we don't always understand it. Is mutual regard enough for a lasting marriage? What about passion? And does passion or regard equate to love? I reread this book every time I need a reminder that love isn't always fanfares and fireworks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was execellent.

I've always liked Jane Austen's style, and I'm much interested in books during this period. This novel is a perfect example about feminine frivolity and Victorian ways of mind. It's also epidemizes the importance of humbleness.All the characters plainly suggest that the highest standard a woman had in during the early 1800's was being a rich man's wife. Pride and Prejudice narrates a story about a poor man's daughters and their stuggles in &quot;catching&quot; a man of high society.Jane, the beauty, longs for the attention of Mr. Bingley, the owner of Netherfield Park. Through parties, dinners, and occasional ailments, their love blossoms into a possible proposal.Elizabeth, the easygoing, proud daughter, battles the intolerably rude and snobby blueblood, Mr. Darcy. Though they can't stand each others company, this friction grows into love. The only problem is their stubborn pride, each refusing to acknowledge the fact that they've fallen for people whom they regard as the scum of the world.Lydia, the youngest and the rashest, hopes to marry the crooked Mr. Wickham, but Wickham has different ideas.I loved Pride and Prejudice, and I recommend this book to anyone who loves romances."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book!

Love buying used books from Amazon!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am decidedly not a fan of Austen, but my boyfriend specifically asked for this edition for Christmas. It is part of an excellent series of Penguin Classics that are being re-released with superb cover art. Normally cover art bears only a fleeting relation to the actual content of the book, but the covers in this series are all very fitting for their books. The pages are nicely weighty, and the cover art continues on the inside flaps of the cover."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was assigned to me at my University. It was the first English classic book I read while getting my degree. Pride and Prejudice was a part of my English Literature class. At first I didn't want to read it, but a few pages in I really enjoyed it and now have read other books by her.The book made strong my belief that love overcomes everything. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are so well drawn out, slow and with meaning. They are characters you will fall in love with. It's funny how at first they don't like each other but come to appreciate each other"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is my second favorite Jane Austen (Sense and Sensibility is number one) and has as fantastic characters and plot. Both are classics, a must read for anyone who likes a good love story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice. We all know it as a timeless classic and it's difficult to review. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Thus, I'll continue.Lizzy Bennett: She's grown up in a humble and somewhat poor family. The only people she really see's eye to with in her family are her father and her sister. She's stubborn, passionate and proud of her family and life style.Darcy: He's grown up in a rich family and taught that he is the best as far as social interaction. His parents have since died and he is extremely close to his only and younger sister. He's persistent, quiet and sure he is the highest ranking person.So when the two meet, they're not exactly fond of each other. In fact, there's immediately animosity on both ends. They don't really expect to see each other often until Darcy's best friend falls for Elizabeth's sister. Inevitably they are brought together on numerous occasions. And as time goes by his feeling toward her change drastically.I realize that I could never give the story justice. It's classic for a reason. Beautifully written and surprisingly easy to relate to. It is also a great insight for the time period. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen intrigued me just by its mysterious title in which the two seemingly irrelevant words are put together. After I finished the first reading, I was impressed with her witty and sophisticated language that enlivened the characters with distinctive features and the descriptions of landscapes and atmospheres of that certain time period. Moreover, the most remarkable aspect of this novel was the title itself- Pride and Prejudice. The two words do not agree upon a uniform theme but after the reading, I could make multiple links between the plots/themes of the novel and the title. The only aspect I did not really enjoy was how the basic structure of the entire essay was stereotypical and the plots being somewhat hackneyed to the readers who are exposed to a wide range of romance novels.Before I started the novel, I could not really expect in advance what would happen and how the characters would advance. However, as I finished up the novel, my curiosity was fully disentangled. Some readers may interpret the title as Darcy being the proud character and Elizabeth being the prejudiced character. However, from another perspective, one can also interpret the title as that both characters are prejudiced by their first impressions and their social classes and are blinded by their pride, which explains why they both continue to be put in a form of conflict. Either way, the title lets the readers expect something that they have never thought and thus turns the thing around after the reading, which maximizes the dramatic aspects of all.Jane Austen's use of language is certainly highly sophisticated and classy especially when she describes the background scenes or setting of 18th century of England. Without watching movies, I could easily imagine each scene vividly. When she describes Longbourn, a typical country town, or Darcy's estate, it gave me right away an impression of what it was like during that epoch. Also, not only her picturesque and descriptive language, but her actualizations of the atmosphere of that certain era were directly conveyed to me that I once thought I was one of those daughters of Bennet family. She uses lots of details to offer the most explicit mood of realistic lives of an ordinary family in England and she successes regard to that.Austen's characters and perspectives are also some aspects that did captivate me a lot. The protagonists Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy stand out as very distinctive characters but minor charactors such as Jane, Bingley, Collins, Wickham, Lydia, Lady Catherine, and even her parents play tasteful roles that keep the novel stimulating until the end. The setting and background of this novel is something to focus on also because the lives of people in England during 18th-19th century were typical while the novel and plots deviate from such clich&eacute; by Austen making characters unique and distinguished. Elizabeth Bennet is unlike other women who were expected to be obedient and passive; Elizabeth seems vigorous in expressing her opinions, honest, straightforward and intelligent (and problematically she knows it too well). In a scene where Elizabeth confronts Lady Catherine, she does not fall back or cringes due to her lower class, but rather, she stands up defending herself and remain confident in saying what she wants to say to Lady Catherine. Her unique characteristic definitely explains why Darcy is so attracted to her in the first place.Austen integrates basic components of the lives of ordinary people naturally so that the readers today can easily compare their lives to that of old live and easily understand and even sympathize with the characters. She makes several conflicts between different class such as between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine or Ms. Bingley looking down on Jane to demonstrate how class distinction was so conspicuous during that time period. Also, the typical mindsets of women are displayed when Mrs. Bennet is very desperate to let all her five children be married to rich men or when Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte marries to Mr. Collins even without love. It was a prevalent thought back then that love is not the most chief determinant in marriage (This is why Elizabeth-Darcy relationship is more enthralling). The readers today can easily perceive what it was like in England by reading the novel and place themselves in the middle of the setting. Nonetheless, along with this, it was also an intriguing component that Austen used four different couples to demonstrate that diverse situations allowing the readers to compare.Except the fact that the basic structure of the novel was formulaic, I enjoyed the novel and I would like to recommend to those of my age because anyone of my age could easily relate to Elizabeth and be easily impressed by her attractive characteristics and eye-catching development of Elizabeth and Darcy's beautiful relationships."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It wasn't hard to not like, but it is introduced to me by my mom. In fact, it is her favorite translated books and so well known, it connected us to a time where everyone still cared about society decorum. It was more about finding love and still believe domestic live is still good for reason. It made women look good but made the truth more bearable about the constant bickering around home. It explained like Mr. Roger in the Neighborhood about who is coming and going in the social circle, and it made serious strive to explain the role of women in society and politics, but it did not aim to increase their role. It was a cup of tea on the role of gentlemen in their children's education, and it made their role around home more explainable. It made warring segment of the society less popular, but it reflected the sentiment of the times, it made peace more acceptable and finding the person to share life more condoned. It was the voice of the unpopular and the bluestocking type of \\"Jane\\" at the time, who wants their men to stay home and their women to enjoy the social life more. It is nothing but deplorable people who marry unsuitably and this reasoning made it ways to every nook and craning, essentially, it set out to destroy as much of unsuitable marriage as possible. But it did this elegantly, and the main character there, Elizabeth and Darcy, as well as Jane and Bingley as good as married. It does not seek to destroy any more thinking process on the other facets of the ordinary life in unordinary times, but it brought unrealized expectations as well. The thoughts of English ways does not prevail in their society is like reducing the mind to think only of the times they were conquered by the Normans, but it does not however, make the case for the natural ways people will continue to live their life as much as possible. So, at the end, everyone hoorayed at the English marriages and made sure whoever named Eliza will marry Fitzwilliam Darcy in the End, and not anyone forgot about Jane as well.The less known character then all got their satisfaction and knowledge that they all had their share of matrimony of stable life, which in fact, is the well-known intent of Jane Austen in almost every single one of her books. Perhaps all of them, though their maybe one or two which is read by the reviewer or because it is only partially finished. Most like the latter.So, who really cares about the malapropism of the weaker characters or the seldom attuned to reality Eliza, it was actually more fun to read it and not have to over think on who could possibly love the Darcy and Bingley set of the world. It was so well described, and it made the whole Bingley and friends' family the most beloved or the most hated family of all time. It made their social gatherings the crown of the gazette, all to serve and divert the attentions of the war. It also made some of their actions unforgiving at the same time as well, so in as much as the Bennet family created happiness by entertaining their social circles, it made the Bingley family more unimpeachable when the made the match for their son, right when they made the error of crossing over their duties their neighbors for more frivolous things like work and better gain for themselves.Reading through Pride and Prejudice is also a worrisome venture when in fact the reader is often at a loss on how to cope with the idea that Jane Austen herself is at the lower level of the society, without either access to explain their actual lives or scientific tools to deduce on how people like the unforgiving aunt of Darcy. It took witticism and it took the audacity to write based on hearsay, and it made philosophy more acceptable to women, perhaps. Least in my opinion it did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I couldn't find anywhere whether or not this was an abridged or unabridged version.

I guess you get what you pay for, right?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The marriage, property and inheritance laws of the late 18th and early 19th century, by today's standards, can be considered cruelly misogynistic.The Bennett family estate is entailed and, as Mr Bennett's family consists of his wife and five daughters (nary a son in sight), there is a strong likelihood that, when he passes away, the six surviving ladies will be left homeless and with no income or property. Mrs Bennett is deeply concerned with the situation and frantically searches for the expedient solution of the day (marriage to an eligible man of property whose family would provide her daughters with both a home and settlement of a suitable annual stipend for living expenses). On the other hand, Mr Bennett's approach is much more relaxed and he gives the impression that he feels the marriage of his daughters will take care of itself in due course and that all will ultimately turn out for the best.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, told primarily from the point of view of Elizabeth Bennett, the most sensible daughter in a family of ladies whose general attitude seems to be quite vapid and utterly self-centered, is a story driven not so much by plot as by character development combined with a comedic critique of the issues of early 19th century mores among the landed gentry - manners, upbringing, morality, education, marriage, conventions, etiquette, leisure, societal behaviour and so on. It might be compared to a much more modern equivalent in F Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY or on a considerably lighter note, television's famous sitcom SEINFELD. The common factor here ... in a background of purely social commentary, nothing of note really happens. The social commentary IS the story!PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has withstood the onslaught of time and remains to this day (and justifiably so) one of the most popular novels in the entire pantheon of English literature.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words and don't like it when forced to so It's okay.

It applies only to the edition of P&P; with ASIN 'B008476HBM' (Pride and Prejudice) and only on basic Kindle, Paperwhite, and Kindle Touch (these pay attention to language attributes so as to use a 'matching' dictionary).This happens to be the only edition of P&P; enabled for WhisperSync for Voice (with a free audiobook available from Audible) which is why I got this edition and have discovered this issue.Otherwise, the formatting is good, and (so far as I've read) free of typos. The price is right. And of course, the story is great, and everybody should read it.It seems the language attribute for the book is not set to 'English' and so (again only on K/KT/KPW) one gets 'Dictionary Not Found\\" even though an English dictionary is available. On my Kindle Touch, it does a lookup in the Italian dictionary that I happen to have on there (and of course fails to find these English words). Dictionary lookup works fine on my Fire and I'm guessing on Kindle Keyboard and older Kindles, which always use the one and only default dictionary.It is probably possible to edit the language attributes (e.g. with calibre) so that it works correctly.

Lovely to have it on Kindle to reread anytime, anyplace, anywhere!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen was one of the best writers ever. She has written many books and they are all great. She knows how to write and she knows what she's talking about when she writes too. Which is a major plus for her. She can write in different styles. She knows how to write about characters and she can easily make them seem real. When someone writes like that it is so much better because if you feel like the characters are real it's easier for you to really get into the story. It was a little hard to hard to get into at first but once you got into the book you didn't have a choice to read or not because you had already invested most of your time trying to understand the book. I had this problem. I would have liked it better if it was a little bit easier to read, but it was written a long time ago so I really have no room to complain.I thought the book had good context. Elizabeth was a strong and independent female character. She didn't let much pass her and she was mostly on top of things. I really liked the way Jane Austen had made her seem like a well raised, confident, young women who wanted adventure. She made Elizabeth seem real. Like she could really exist back then. I really liked that aspect of her.When she talked about Mr. Darcy you could tell he had so much pride for everything he had and owned. He was almost close to a stuck up snob, but he made him seem more pleasurable than that. You could tell he really did love Elizabeth too. At first she hated him. She wanted nothing to do with him and she got mad every time she saw him, which was conveniently often. Every time Mr. Darcy had tried to help Elizabeth or her family it just turned into a disaster and resulting with her more and more mad at him.I think Elizabeth finally realized how much she loved Mr. Darcy when he saver her little sister, Lydia, and her entire family from total embarrassment. He didn't have to go and save Elizabeth's family but he still did. Just for her. It probably helped that Lydia had run off with the right guy. If she had ran off with some poor guy she just met off the street he probably wouldn't have been able to do much damage control. But no she ran off with Wickham. This was good for their family, I think, because it brought Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy together once again and this time for good. It had to be a plus that he saved her family and made Elizabeth open her eyes to see that Mr. Darcy was the best man for her. Her perfect match. I would guess that after they got married they still fought like crazy, but what couple doesn't?Jane Austen did a wonderful job writing this book. You can tell she was a skilled author and writer. She cared about what she was writing and you could tell that in her books. It was almost as if she was putting a little bit of herself into Pride and Prejudice.Jane Austen wrote other books too, and like this book you can tell she really poured her heart and soul into her book. I will definitely be reading more of her books sooner than later."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely love pride and prejudice.

I certainly don't know what these people were thinking when they decided that they didn't like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". This has certainly surpassed all other novels as my favorite book of all-time. Perhaps some might find Jane Austen's language difficult to understand, but as a 14-year-old, I didn't think that it was that way at all. This book will certainly remain dear to my heart forever, and I can certainly see myself reading it still 30 years from now.Elizabeth is a delightful heroine, and there is nothing quite as satisfying as the humbling of Mr. Darcy.

In this day and age i dont think teenagers or people my age even know what a romance movie or book is without the pg-13 parts in it. I was so elated to read about nothing of that sort. It is in my opinion a timeless love story that will win many peoples hearts over and over for generations to come. Mr.Darcy I thought was a very prideful man at first but the more you learn about him, he becomes a very loveable character and suprising one too. As for Elizabeth Bennet she is by far a outspoken but loveable character as well. I think all the characters you run into in the book are so colorful and i wouldnt have thought that a book written so long ago could have characters like that let alone some humor in it too. I think this book never got dull and that everyone should read it.

And as you can imagine, Mrs. Bennet's main goal is to marry off all of her daughters to wealthy suitors. When word comes that a rich bachelor, Mr. Bingley, is moving into a neighborring manor, the Bennet sisters are beside themselves and Mrs. Bennet's mind is soon set on the pairing of beautiful Jane, the oldest sister, and Bingley after one ball. At said so ball, Mr. Bingely is not alone, accompinied by his sisters and importantly, the very handsome (and very wealthy )but snobbish Mr. Darcy. Darcy later insults Elizabeth, aware she is in his presecene. Now holding a grudge, Elizabeth casts him aside. From then on, event after event seems to throw the two together but the question is: Will their grudges every be able to transform into love?I expected this book to be boring and untolerable but I was forced to shove my own words down my throat after only one chapter. This book is funny with hilarious comments and realistic moments. Everything you could ask for in a book.Recommended- 14 and up. This book can be hard to understand so give or take a couple yearsOverall- This book can be quite confusing to the average American at first considering its sophistacated text, so read it slowly and maybe a second time after awhile.

With three lovely daughters, it is Mrs. Bennet's wish that they get married to successful men, although her husband Mr. Bennet thinks differently. With this we are introduced to Jane Bennet, the eldest of the three Bennet girls. She is the ideal daughter who thinks nothing terrible about anyone and who falls in love at first sight with a business tycoon. Then we have Lydia, who is a foolish girl, similar to her mother. She does no work, and goes around looking at all the troops who pass by their city and flirts with them. There she meets a young officer who she falls in \\"love\\" and elopes with. And last we have Elizabeth Bennet. She is the youngest and the brightest out of all three. She has both sense and beauty, although she is not as beautiful as her eldest sister Jane. Elizabeth is very loving and is especially close to Jane. Although at times she can be loud and rude, Elizabeth is never afraid to speak about what's on her mind. And then Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a very blunt and rude man according to Elizabeth, and the two just can't seem to get along with each other.

And this novel made me an ultimate fan of Jane Austen's writing. Elizabeth and Darcy's characters are carefully and meticulously created.Pride and Prejudice made me buy the entire collection of her works.Highly recommended! :-)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's, Pride and Prejudice, is an intriguing, nerve riveting structure pieced together with utmost meticulousness. Like a metropolitan skyscraper towering over its suburban brothers, Jane Austen's novel prevails as possibly one of the most powerful novels to fall into a reader's hand.The witty heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, prevails as the most interesting and involved character. She mesmerizes the reader with her wit and grace. Although Mary is the dullest of a girl, the remaining cast and her are a most interesting bunch. The third person omnipresent narrative allows the reader to peak at every character; in the process revealing the Mr. Bennet's hilarious sarcasm and views on his wife along with Mr. Wickham's and Mr. Darcy's true positions and personalities, which I could never bring across to you with as gracefully as is done by Jane Austen, so you will just have to read the book.As Austen introduces the players of the marriage game, which proves to be the center around which the plot is set, she presents the two themes that control the novel and are the title of it, pride and prejudice. Victorian society prevailed as the perfect setting to play out the two themes, as it was an era when social and economical status made a person who he/she is. Age, money, family name, and economical differences steer almost every single conversation and decision throughout the novel. They create for a most suspenseful scene; will Darcy, Bingley, Jane, Liz, and the rest of the cast surpass the boundaries set by pride and prejudice, and come together or will they let those boundaries keep them apart. Only one way to find out how sad or happy the ending is; you must read!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When my friends and I were younger, we used to watch 'Wishbone' and every time we saw one we'd say, &quot;I can't wait to read that book&quot;. Well alas, eleven year olds aren't really suited for the books interpreted mostly because of the use of 'big words'. I'll admit, when I first picked this book up, I got a little too lost in the language. The characters seemed tiresome and vacuous. But taking advice from my mother, and the incredible drive of wanting to see Colin Firth in the series, but wanting to read the book first, kept me reading. And as I read farther and farther, I liked the book more and more. The cute story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy really caught my fancy (sorry, still using the language). It's a story that can still resonate today. With all the crappy love series that are in publication today, it's nice to see a story that has a remarkable heroine and a handsome beau who seems stuffy and rude at first, but is found to be remarkably charming and amiable at the end. I really adore this story and I recommend it to anyone looking to get lost in a lovely tale of old."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The lasting appeal of Pride and Prejudice is worth explaining to those who haven't read the book or seen the movies before launching into a review of this British classic. First, there may be no finer book at exploring the topic of how appearances can be deceiving. Those who are physically attractive, employ pleasant manners and flatter us will earn our approval and cause us to feel affectionate towards them. Those who are less attractive to regard, keep to themselves and say insulting things will become people we will think poorly of. To see how misleading those reactions can be in assessing character, compare Abraham Lincoln to Jefferson Davis, the head of the Confederacy. Lincoln was dour, ugly and awkward with people. Jefferson Davis was just the opposite. When it came to character, Lincoln had enough to hold the Union together and is now viewed as one of our greatest presidents. Most people don't remember Jefferson Davis unless reminded.Second, at another level Pride and Prejudice is a delightful romantic comedy that looks at how love develops through a series of painful mischances. Although not as light and funny as Shakespeare's comedies are (A Midsummer Night's Dream comes to mind), Pride and Prejudice will certainly bring a smile to most readers' faces in this regard.Third, Elizabeth Bennet is one of the best heroines ever imagined. Most readers will identify with her and be rooting for her to succeed. You'll almost feel like you've developed a good friend from reading this book.Fourth, Jane Austen is very good at poking fun at the pretensions of those who are self-absorbed or fascinated with social position and money. But it's a loving kind of fun. She realizes that these people are just silly . . . and don't know any better. We can enjoy a good laugh at their expense, but we should still love and support them. It's a good model for dealing with any goofy relatives we have.Fifth, Pride and Prejudice is a benchmark at how far women have come from the days when they often couldn't even inherit property from their fathers. You'll be as outraged as Mrs. Bennet is at these anachronisms . . . but you'll be assuaged to know that the worst of those bad old days are behind us.So, if those reasons to read Pride and Prejudice appeal to you, read on as I briefly describe the story.The Bennets have a challenge: They have five unmarried daughters who cannot inherit Mr. Bennet's entailed estate. With few prospects in the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is always on the hunt. Mr. Bennet views Mrs. Bennet's fascination with this challenge as being something he would like to distance himself from.When an eligible young man moves into the area, Mrs. Bennet's instincts are engaged to the fullest. One of her daughters must marry Mr. Bingley. At the next ball, the pickings seem to improve when Mr. Bingley arrives with a friend, Mr. Darcy. Darcy \\"soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report . . . of his having ten thousand a year.\\" But Mr. Darcy soon turned the fortune hunters off by only dancing with his sisters and refusing to be introduced to any of the other ladies.Bingley finds himself very attracted to Jane Bennet and their relationship develops nicely . . . until he leaves suddenly for London with no plans to return. Jane waits for some news from him or his sisters and finds herself being cut off.In the middle of this, Mr. Collins arrives. Collins will inherit Mr. Bennet's property upon his death. He has just received a position as a clergyman from a powerful and opinionated sponsor, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and she has told him to get married. With four unmarried cousins, Collins decides the Bennet daughters are his best bet. In this way, he can provide a home for them and their mother after he inherits. First being inspired by Jane, he redirects his attention to Elizabeth after perceiving Jane's interest in Bingley and quickly proposes. Elizabeth will have none of it, and Collins soon finds a more enthusiastic prospect in another local family.The younger sisters are finding themselves more than entertained by the dashing officers in a local regiment. Through this connection, Elizabeth becomes acquainted with Wickham who confides in her that Mr. Darcy had treated Wickham with great unfairness after Mr. Darcy's father's death. That's just one more nail in the coffin for the case against Mr. Darcy.But in the background, we get hints that something is shifting. Mr. Darcy goes from finding Elizabeth to be ordinary in appearance to commenting favorably about one small aspect of her face, her mouth. But put the two of them together, and civil words do not follow. They are like oil and water.Jane and Elizabeth eventually make it to London where both hope that Jane will reconnect with Bingley. But no such luck.Just when things seem to be headed in a most bleak direction, a terrible event occurs that shakes everyone like an enormous earthquake. In its aftermath, each character finds herself or himself needed to re-examine their position and perceptions of one another.Will Jane and Bingley connect with one another again? Will Elizabeth find happiness? Will Mrs. Bennet marry her daughters off? You'll just have to read the book to find out. But unlike modern novelists, remember that Jane Austen wasn't against happy endings.Enjoy a great read!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's great achievement (and she preferred \\"achievements\\" to \\"accomplishments,\\" if you speak early 19th Century English) was to produce a novel esteemed by its contemporaries for what they called its \\"probableness.\\" They noted she employed none of the fictional gimmicks of the time--their equivalents of car chases--and set a new standard for psychogical perception. Sir Walter Scott observed that he could \\"do the bow-wow thing\\" but he could not do this. Those who find fault with the centrality of marriage in the work do not recognize the limited possibilities for women at the time. Given the narrow sea-room available to her, Elizabeth did marvelously with the minimum possible surrender of her personal freedom. Really, though, the one who did marvelously was Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is, in my opinion, one of the best books written. Ever. I read this book as assigned reading in highschool, and fell in love with it. I was even accused of stealing my copy, which I didn't do by the way- I bought my own.Anyway, this book is so well written, the characters so well drawn, the plot so well planned, and the dialog so quick that I feel any praise I can give it will fall short of the mark. So suffice it to say that if you have somehow not been exposed to Jane Austen by this point in your life, you should IMMEDIATLY invest in a copy of Pride and Prejudice.For me this book was a gateway to the wonderful world of Jane Austen novels. Most highly recommened after P&P; (by me anyway) would be Northanger Abbey and Sense and Sensability. I found Emma and Persuasion interesting enough, but did not love them quite as well as I did the three others. I have yet to read the rest of Jane Austens works, but I most assuredly plan to do so.Anything written by Jane Austen is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is not for nothing that this book is labelled as a classic. Austen is the greatest writer of this type of fiction and this is her crowning glory.Coming from the world of high society in England of the late 18th Century, Austen lived the life she wrote about. Having refused a compromise proposal of marriage herself, and lived out her life as a spinster, she was only too aware of the realities of the marriage game.Women in this society were marketable product, and both men and women were stratified by their annual income. A titled person or someone from a noble family might improve flagging fortunes by marrying untitled money, but in general money married money and titles married titles.Into this delicate balance Austen throws her heroine - Eliza Bennett. In any \\"proper\\" romance novel it should be the passionless and tame courtship of her older sister Jane to the wealthy Bingley and his bitchy sisters that should form the core of the story.Eliza opens the novel by turning down a proposal from an embarrasing, boring, unhandsome relative who has a modest income as a churchman. To society this would have been a proper match for Eliza and it is unthinkable that she should refuse it.But Austen opts to sell a true fairytale and in doing so established a modus operandi for much modern fiction. Eliza and Darcy begin by getting off on the wrong foot. The remainder of the novel is an Anabasis from the confused territory of mistaken assumptions and impressions to an epiphany of understanding and mutual respect.On either side of this love story are the very proper courtship of Jane and Bingley on one hand, and the dreadful elopement of a younger sister with a complete cad on the other.The prize at the end is not just Darcy, but his wonderful estate of Pemberly, thoroughly described in the novel. The reward for the characters is access to this estate (invitations to balls, summers holidays etc) and the virtuous are awarded open access while those who behaved badly are excluded and sent to parts of England furthest from Pemberly.The beauty of this story lies in the wit of conversation and letter. The cutting comments, the razor sharp assesments of character. The constant referral to income, house size, education and marriage prospects. It is here that Austen really excels, and to appreciate just how funny the novel is requires the attention of the reader to what is being said. Careful attention to the language carries a huge reward and I frequenly found myself collapsing in laughter while reading this book.I am not a fan of romance or of regency fiction, but I am a fan of this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is available for free on the kindle (Pride and Prejudice) or cheaper by other publishers:Pride and Prejudice (Arcturus Paperback Classics)orPride and Prejudice (Oxford World's Classics)orFavorite Jane Austen Novels: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion.It is a great book, but there are other editions that would save you money. I have no idea as to why it is called a 1st edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Sometimes people make assumptions about others without really knowing the person. Almost every character in the book Pride and Prejudice has some type of prejudice towards someone else whether it is money, pride, or jealousy. Elizabeth made the assumption that Mr. Darcy was stuck-up, but he was really just shy and uncomfortable with social events. Elizabeth also thought Mr.Wickham was nice and truthful, but he really was a poor, gambling liar. Mr. Darcy thought that Jane didn't really like Mr. Bingley, but she just doesn't show her feelings very well. Both of Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine were both against the Bennet family because they were \\"lower class.\\" Some of the prejudices faded, and others grew through out the book. This book is full of pride, prejudice, and love. The theme in this book is really not to judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While any book as widely lauded as this one will also find its detractors, especially from among the ranks of students forced to read it, it is worth noting the number of reviewers (count me among them) who cite PRIDE AND PREJUDICE as their favorite work of literature. I love this book and have read it more times than any other work of fiction.For me the greatest pleasure comes from savoring the many colorful characters, not only Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who surpass even Shakespeare's Benedick and Beatrice as the thinking person's ideal romantic match, but also Miss Bingley, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins and all the others. Austen employs the vices and virtues of this cast of characters to great effect -- for comedy, drama, suspense, and especially dramatic irony. Individual scenes that come to mind are Elizabeth's rejection of her first marriage proposal, one of the most memorable comic scenes in English literature, and her rejection of a second offer of marriage, a scene that may very well prompt the reader to shout at the heroine in a futile attempt to intervene.With each re-reading I discover more to understand and love about PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Not only do the individual characters serve as foils to each other, but relationships between characters serve as foils to other relationships. On first reading, I saw how much love and respect there exists between Elizabeth and her father. I saw how similar Mr. Darcy is to Mr. Bennet and understood the perfectness of a match between Darcy and Elizabeth. On subsequent readings I discovered that Miss Bingley, who is so critical and so mocking of the Bennetts' humble position in society, is more like Mrs. Bennett than any other character, and a chapter in which Darcy seems to arrive at this conclusion himself came alive for me, and I now recognize it as a pivotal moment in the story whereas previously it had seemed like a duller chapter to skim over.All of this sounds very dry and intellectual I suppose, but the experience of reading the novel is anything but. What propels the reader through the book is the apprehension that Elizabeth and Darcy have gotten off on the wrong foot, and while at odds are clearly made for each other in every possible respect. This tension makes it a highly enjoyable page-turner. Nor is PRIDE AND PREJUDICE a fluffy romance novel or a \\"chick flick.\\" Given the economic realities of the times, Elizabeth is risking not only spinsterhood but also economic disaster by not seizing on opportunities to marry any man with a decent income or place in society. By refusing to settle, Elizabeth is a very brave character in her own arena, and for that reason we recognize her as a hero, a noble soul who honors responsibilties, stands fearless in the face of snobbery and oppression, laughs at folly (while exhibiting some of her own as well), and aches for true love. Who cannot root for such a character or rejoice at the happy conclusion of her quest?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The \\"BedBook\\" format is so unusual, it should be made more clear to purchasers....I wouldn't have been interested if I had known this."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a classic novel everyone should read.

I sympathize with Elizabeth having to deal with her silly mother and two of her sisters. This novel gives the reader insight about what it was like to be a woman in England at the time. The main focus of each young woman's life is finding a good marriage.

I anticipated a happy ending and she delivered. Thanks"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was a good book and i enjoyed it greatly. I read it to help myself when i take the AP test in the spring for english."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The reason I liked this book so much was the main character, Elizabeth Bennet. Her honesty and spunk are a wonderful combination. In a time where frankness was discouraged, hers grew. I also admire how she matures through the course of the novel. Her 'pride and prejudice' are put in their proper place. Her and her father also contribute much humor to the story. Their sarcastic wit made me laugh. Generally, I enjoyed Austen's sense of humor: there were many funny moments. I also found the story's end heartwarming... perhaps I am just a sap, but you should read it and find out!!! I think this would be one of my favorite books so far; I definately want to read more Jane Austen in the coming months!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have never read another book that kept my attention as constantly as Pride and Prejudice. The novel involves such a vast array of diverse characters all involved in the search for love, whether willingly or unwillingly. Mrs. Bennet's incessant stress of finding a husband for her five daughters is quite a difficult feat. Not only does she want them to have a man for the rest of their lives, but he must be one with much opulence. The need for an attraction between the couple is quite peripheral in the eyes of Mrs. Bennet. However, Elizabeth Bennet, the second-oldest daughter, would rather renounce the popular tradition of marrying solely for wealth. She searches for true love and happiness, and wealth is an added bonus. A very unexpected set of circumstances causes Elizabeth to question Mr. Darcy's love. As their lives continue, Elizabeth reconsiders her initial judgements of Mr. Darcy and other characters. Jane Austen's satirical and ironic comments and situations give the reader great insight into the customs of the early nineteenth century. Austen presents a very tangled web of people and events. The transformation and reactions of the characters from beginning to end is very drastic and presents very sagacious lessons about life. This is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed at anytime. I cannot wait to read it a second time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book Pride and Prejudice was a book about love and its consequences. This book tell us about the life of people on the 19th century in England, how they lived and how they felt. It also shows a true story of love, how sometimes pride can be stronger that the love that people feel, and marry for love and not for social status which happen to woman very often back then. Elizabeth Bennet is the second oldest child on her family. She is a strong, intelligent, and a beautiful, independent girl, she makes good judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudice. The best chapter was the last one when Mr. Darcy goes to Elizabeth's house and they tell each other about their feelings, and Mr. Bingley and Jane got together too. I would give this book five stars because this is a great book of love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In my view,I think Jane Austen is a very successful author and I enjoy reading her book very much.For example,Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility,especially Pride and Prejudice.All are very perfect works but Pride and prejudice has always been the most popular of her books.And this novel is now available in new movie version.I think it must be very exciting.Pride and Prejudice is widely-read and well-loved.The story is about the love between Elizabeth and Darcy and it is really romantic which readers can easily fall into the role and know their feeling.Also,this book is centrally concerned with personnal happiness and Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy-tall,handsome and rich man-is the stuff of wish -fulfilment.If you want to know more about the story,you must read this book&quot;Pride and Prejudcie&quot; as soon as possible.Because it is really a wonderful fiction and a romantic love story.hope you enjoy this nice book.Thank you!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well, I first read Pride and Prejudice while in 10th grade and I fell in love with the book and its characters. I finished it in about 2 days while the rest of my class were reading the required amount each day. Lol, I became very ahead of my class for this book.The book is just so universal. It could happen anywhere, to anyone, at any time. Which is why I related to it, I could see what happened in the book could very likely happen in my time(and I wouldn't mind it happening to me, ;).)Also, I like the strength of Elizabeth's character. She is smart and witty and has a mind of her own. She doesn't allow her mother to pressure her into anything she doesn't want.I highly recommend this book, so go out and read it today,...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of the best writing of Jane Austen's.The title aptly says in a few words what the wholestory was about. Elizabeth is a middle-class female with too much pride, and Mr. Darcy is an upper-class male with too much prejudice - or is it vice versa? It appears that both these characters had a little bit of both...Anyway, the characters were very believable, with feelingsand emotions that were surprisingly accurate.Everyone came out a winner in the end. I particularly likedMr. Darcy's reactions (or actions) to Elizabeth's retorts to his proposal. In all cases, they were both right in their own ways. They just needed to get together enough times to finally say what they had been feeling all along. And they do.In the end, it worked out, and oh, did it make me happy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was probably one of the first novels I read during this time period. The first time I read it, I was amazed by the eloquent but simple writing of Jane Austen. The second time I read it, I was astounded by the way the charactors were portrayed. The third time I read it, I was blown away by the plot, and the rich detials and descriptions that surrounded her story. Since then, every time I read it I am more and more captivated by the certain truthfulness and plain exertion of human nature. The writing is of incredible quality. I would say that this novel is one of the best I have ever read, second only to Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading this book I thought that if the early 19th century had soap operas, they would be a little like this. I thought I was going to be bored but I was quickly proven wrong. The best parts of the book is when Elizabeth is around Mr. Darcy (you'll see why). I found Mrs. Bennett (Elizabeth's mother) to have a sort of comic role(you might agree with me). And the juicy secrets revealed later in the book will have your jaw wide open. By the end of the book you'll fall in love with the charactors and you might be tempted to read it again (I know I did). There is a reason why this is Jane Austen's most widely read and most loved book: It's just entertaining reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The story is a little bit complicated at the beginning because of the many protagonists introduced but in the end it is quite remarkable and gives you some insight into the life of the English landed entry.When you have read this book and and also understood its content, you will agree that it has been worth reading even if it is only for the language used. Since I have really enjoyed it, I would give it top marks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had the audio version of this classic in my car.

As a highschool student, I had to read this in my leisure time, b/c it is a lightweight classic. It has so many great characters. Subtle hints of sarcasm, and the stereotypical attitude of some characters, give the story a comical twinge. However, if you do decide to read this for a class, I personally think the story is most interesting as far as plot and drama goes, and unless the class is bent on feminist views, I found it hard to extract any valued literary elements."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely loved this book!!!! I don't understand how anyone could call it boring. Granted, the people in the books talk a little much and sometimes I'm just like 'Get on with it' but I've sort of learned to skim those parts. This book is a comedy making fun of the English society in the early 1800s. It's making the womens'(woman's?) quest for a good future into a vicious man-hunt and it's hilarious.

I'll be honest, I first discovered this story on &quot;Wishbone.&quot; It was my favorite episode.

Well, for anyone who is considering reading the book, I full-heartily recomend it to you. I previously just finished the book, and Jane Austen did a fabulous job captivating my attention and suspicions whether Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet ever truly get together. The latter is prejudiced against the handsome and &quot;supposively&quot; haughty Mr. Darcy, so until she realizes the truth does her opinion alter. Jane Austen adds humor to the story and created well-balanced characters which arouse much interest with the reader. An exceptionally written and intriguing story which anyone who has never read should."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As much as I would like to, I don't reread books as a rule, even the most favorite, because life is short and there are a billion books to go before we sleep. I do make an exception for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE however. It is a masterpiece, a guiltless entertainment. There are lots of laughs, some melodrama and romance which make it easy to knock back, like chocolate or a good wine. There is, of course, much more to it, which makes it more than an indulgence. Austen gets so much right: she sets up a entire world and explains exactly how it works, what happens when it tips to its own excesses or when its players break its rules. You could pitch a hardball at her window and it would bounce off, shattering nothing, that's how strong and clear it is. She gets romantic love right, as well as all the mistakes everyone makes trying to get it right. She spears bad behavior and holds it up on a stick. She is very witty but never casual. She burns up the page with truth-about her society, family interactions, human nature and the fact that no matter how civilized we become, we as a species are still at square one when it comes to managing the heart. I see that some younger readers don't appreciate the depths this novel or its relevance for contemporary life: maybe it's the way it is being (not) taught, but it could also be that readers have to be ready to appreciate the idea of an insular world that can bear timeless truths, and for younger adolescents, the world as yet has no edges but truth is limited to immediate circumstances."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an enjoyable love story first and foremost but it is also an interesting commentary on the way that society used to look at the institution of mairage along with role of women with in that same society.

The book, and this is meant to be a compilement, is like a good Beatles song...deceptively simple, but rings so true and real, it can't help but tap into something very critical to the human experience.

I fell in love with this book and I have never found another one that quite compares with it's imapact. Maybe I am a hopeless romantic but i believe that things like this could have happened, and might still happen now! I mean you really never can tell. For example, in the beginning the main character meets the person that is to be her husband later in the book, and their intial meeting is not one of desriable happenings. Elizabeth sees Mr. Darcy as a arrogant and rude. He in turn sees her in the beginning as plain, except for her eyes, but he later developes feelings for her which mature throughout the novel. On her side the feelings mature as well...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was an excellent novel because of its distinct feminine superiority. Elizabeth Bennet, being the heroine in the novel, was a great character to whom women can relate. Her clever, independent quallities are what makes Elizabeth such an admirable character. My favorite chapter would be chapter eleven, volume two. This chapter is when Mr. Darcy proposes to Lizzy, and he expresses his feelings to her for the first time. Thisis my favorite chapter because of the way Lizzy refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal. She wasn't intimidated by Mr. Darcy's arrogance and his billowing attitude or his wealth. Not only did she decline his offer of marriage, but she criticized him for all his faults of pride and prejudice. This book is appropriate for ages fifteen and up because of its complex speech. The one literary device that I appreciate was irony. I found it ironic that a prideful, arrogant man would fall in love with an independent, strong willed woman. It was ironic that Elizabeth could see Mr. Darcy's faults of pride and prejudice but not see it in herself. Austen was able to use this irony to create the plot of the story. I enjoyed this novel because of the way it was written, the characters, and the relationship between the characters, especially the relationship between Mr. Dary and Elizabeth. The way that Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth despise each other at the beginning and later realized their true feelings for each other was very romantic. It was an explicit novel that I believe anybody who enjoys reading would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"An abundance of pride and prejudice inflicted on the two main characters, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, is the main obstacle of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen. The actions of the novel revolve around the central characters who undergo tremendous changes to overcome their faults. Mr. Darcy is accused of having such a pride that he could not believe Elizabeth appropriate enough to barely be in his presence. From then on, Elizabeth formed harsh judgments about Mr. Darcy and his personality. Their first impressions of one another clung to them so deeply that establishing a relationship was all the more heartwarming. The actions of the novel, between not only Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, but with the entire Bennet family and other acquaintances, kept me wanting to read on for more. My heart was into each character and I could not wait to find out more about their relations. I felt myself laughing and, at times, talking out loud because of the actions of the novel. I remained in suspense throughout, which made the events more enjoyable. I cannot wait for the opportunity to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; again in my free time. I highly recommend the novel to anyone in search of a plot and a love for characters to read the amazing writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen merits praise even with the high expectations I contained for it. In the first few paragraphs, I was confronted with flighty gossip and lacy trifles that were rather discouraging considering that I had expected something more profound. Yet as the novel progressed, the flowery language had a zing to it that amuses a person as it pokes fun at those with immense wealth in nineteenth century English society and at the traditions that were upheld. The Bennett family holds the attention of the readers in this novel, especially the women, as they deal with society's regulations regarding entailment. The fact that a male heir does not exist in the Bennett family causes Mrs. Bennett to become anxious to marry her five daughters off to men with fortunes. The aspect of the novel that truly provides the reader with contentment resides in the moral development of two of the main characters. The character flaws that exist within Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are discovered, examined, and steadily coached until both can live more fully. I appreciate this fine piece of literature for the magnificent writing syle that Austen utilized and the clever character development that she employed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm ashamed to admit it, but I only picked this up after watching the latest excellent BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's now-ubiquitous 'Pride and Prejudice'.Let me preface this review by saying that this is a novel like no other - it's Little Women with Declaritive Sentences, it's Gone With The Wind without the Overstatement. The story of the five Bennett sisters in their quest to make good marriages is as entertaining as it is relevant, and Austen's acerbic and subtle humour still shine today.Eliza Bennett has a problem. She is the only independant sister in a family of five girls, ruled by a weatherbeaten Father and a hyperactive Mother. She wishes to marry for love, and love alone, but times are hard, and if she does not marry for money, she will be poor, as her father's estate is entailed away to his only nephew, the connsumately hideous Clergyman, Mr. Collins. She meets and falls in immediate Hate with the snobbish, upper-class Mr. Darcy, and through a series of mishaps, revelations and balls, she discovers that he is not the man she first suspected him to be.Austen shows an almost unnatural intelligence with her prose. She is the definitive social commentator, and slips her jokes and judgements into her writing with such subtlety, that you forget she's doing it at all. Unlike Louisa M. Alcott's heavy-handed Christian-Morals littered about 'Little Women', Austen's morals are of a markedly more subtle nature. Truly ahead of her time, and an early feminist, her writing advocates independance for women, and shows clearly the faults and idiosyncrasies of men and silly women - a refreshing change for the period. Even today, her caustic protrayals of Mrs. Bennett, a woman as mercenary in her dealings with marriage as she is socially embarrassing, Lady Catherine DeBourgh, a wealthy, if somewhat inbred, dowager, and Mr. Collins, a greasy and truly venal human being, ring true as vivid and relevant descriptions of how to be an Idiot. The opposite can be said of her central character, Elizabeth Bennett. Clearly a semi-autobiographical heroine, Austen has created in Eliza an independant and intelligent heroine, but tempers this with several character flaws (the most notable being the titular 'Pride') to produce a young woman of believable depth and character.Her plot is long-winded and drawn-out, but, thanks to Austen's wonderful gift for making characters interesting as well as whole, it never once loses pace; instead, it becomes a joy to read. Her Cast Of Thousands each have a distinct part to play in uniting Elizabeth with her true love, and however small that part, Austen ensures they do it with memorable gusto.All in all, I urge everyone to read this novel. However, I think it's best read after seeing the TV adaptations, because while good, they cannot even begin to show the depth and intelligence of this novel. You'll appreciate Austen all the more after 'Pride and Prejudice'."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen is a classic that is well worth reading. The descriptions of the characters and their interactions with one another truly make this book enjoyable and unique.The book centers on the developing relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. They start out disliking one another, but as the story unfolds, they begin to see each other in a different light. Soon, respect for one another develops and eventually a love that is greater than either have ever hoped to experience.The setting for this book is 18th century England, where there is a separation of classes: upper class, middle class, and lower class. Elizabeth Bennet is from a respecatble, middle class family, whereas Fitzwilliam Darcy is from a very notable, upper class family. Mr. Darcy sees any alliance between him or his friend, Mr. Bingley, and the Bennet family, as highly reprehensible in the beginning. Elizabeth's oldest sister, Jane, is in love with Mr. Bingley and believes Mr. Bingley to be in love with her as well. Mr. Darcy does not want his friend having any connection with the Bennet family, so he takes it upon himself to separate his friend from Jane and believes himself to be in the right to do so. This upsets Elizabeth greatly and she refuses to have anything to do with Mr. Darcy, if she can help it. Fate had something else in mind, though, and they kept getting thrown together.The interactions between these two characters were, at times, very humorous. Jane Austen developed them in such a way that I had to keep turning the page to find out what was going to happen next. She definitely did not disappoint my curiosity in wanting to know how everything would eventually turn out for the characters.British Broadcasting Company, in partnership with Arts &amp; Entertainment television, produced the movie, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet. I was so impressed with this movie after watching it on television, that I immediately went out and bought it. It stayed with the book for the most part and really brought Jane Austen's characters to life. It helped me to understand her characters and their situations even more.This is definitely a book I would recommend to most anyone who is looking for a great, romantic classic to read. It is my favorite book of all time and I look forward to reading it many more times throughout my life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Some might feel that Pride and Prejudice is just a feminine romance novel, but to me this book was much more. The words and language in the book were mesmorizing. I believe Meg Ryan put it perfectly when she said, \\"I get caught up in the language, words like felicity and thither.\\"(You've Got Mail, 1998) Considering Jane Austen's formal education ended at age nine, Pride and Prejudice proves that America as a whole has been \\"dumbing-down\\" their children. I feel Pride and Prejudice is a timeless literary classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this is definately an amazing piece of literature. i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come. i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book. what more needs to be said...it is my favorite book..EVER! i place it above the rest, and truly believe there is no comparison. the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes. Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"At first, I had no desire to read 'Pride and Prejudice,' I thought that it would be drivel like so many other romance novels are. After the insistence of friends, I finally gave in and read it. While reading the first few pages, I was sceptical, but soon I was hooked. I couldn't put this book down and even though I knew what was going to happen, I still was intrigued and enthralled.For those of you who haven't read this book, you are missing out on a lighthearted, romantic treat. It is intelligent and fun and the characters are extremely likeable. I now consider it to be one of my favourite books.Also, if you haven't seen the film version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you need to see it. It may be about 6 hours long but it doesn't feel long at all. The book and the film are great companions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the first Regency romances ever written and still perhaps the best. This witty and complex novel features delightful characters, nonstop comic observations, clever dialogue and fast paced development of an excellent plot. Besides being a thoroughly entertaining read, Pride and Prejudice raises questions about appearance versus reality, society versus the individual and the nature of true love that still resonate deeply with us today. Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most complex, lively and fascinating heroines ever created, and her growing romance with the highly intelligent, proud and magnetic Fitzwilliam Darcy is one of the most compelling ever written. This is a seminal novel that no lover of romance-or student of human nature-should ever miss."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a must read. All the senior English classes at my high school watched the BBC movie. Everybody loved the movie. Even the boys. Everybody I know has either read the book since (or read it again in some circumstances) or has plans to read it as soon as they get a chance. The characters are perfect as well as all the description. The entire book is, in a word, perfect. Read It. Watch the movie. Fall in love with Jane Austen (like I have). I am now in the processing of reading all of Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was the book that introduced me to Jane Austen. I find the love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth simply irresistible. Will they get together? That kept me in agony. I have to admit that it was hard to follow at times, but it still kept me in suspense. It is so obvious that today's female (and some male) writers emulate Austen's writing, writing touching romantic comedies. This is definitely one of the books that I'm proud to keep on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The portrayal of Elizabeth and Darcy's love affair although not truly noticable was very strong and forgiving. Neither knew that they had feelings for the other until a rash judgement was made on both sides. Elizabeth declines the hand of her cousin Mr. Collins and therefore goes against the customs of the time period. Elizabeth defies most traditional customs when it comes to men. She wants to marry for love not money, or anything else. This novel keeps the reader interested and wanting more. Jane Austen is a superb author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was a really good book, although there was some confusing description at some points. It's about the daughters of the Bennet family, Elizabeth and Jane in particular. The courtships of Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Mr. Bingley are the focus of the novel. Jane Austen does a good job of describing the romances because the dialog for the most part is easy to understand."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book has humor, drama, romance. Everything I love to read in a good old fashioned story. If you have never read Jane Austen you don't know what you are missing. Even my husband was a convert after Pride and Prejudice!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A classic that remains relevant in any century. The ultimate book on romance. It is tryly timeless and the characters of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett will have you rooting for them throughout.A book that may be read a dozen times without ever losing its charm."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of the very few &quot;classics&quot; that I can honestly say I enjoyed. Most of them, I hate to admit, I find difficult to comprehend and relate to, but not this one. The dialogue was its greatest strength; it was so incredibly real! This book is so rich in its use of the English language. Pride and Prejudice is truly an enriching reading experience, and one that is guaranteed to be enjoyed over and over again. I just finished my sixth reading ... I can't wait for my seventh!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a fun, descriptive book. I used to think that was an oxymoron but it's not! Fun, descriptive books actually exist. This book is enthralling because I am able to relate to the characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite Austen book, beating out my second-favorite, Emma, by maybe half a mile! Every character is believable and human, and perhaps more importantly, can be understood by those of us of modern times.Elizabeth is entirely lovable because she is NOT entirely perfect. She has a penchant for mischief and irony that she has obviously inherited or absorbed from her wonderfully eccentric and hilarious father, and a slightly over-developed sense of her own worth that springs from her highly and consciously intelligent observation of all the folks that share her corner of the planet. But she is also wonderfully honest and capable of eating crow when she sees the error of her assumptions.Although this is a beautiful glimpse into the ways and mores of a very different age, it is also a timeless human drama, loaded with subtle humor."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is charming and i love when the author describe the old houses with appletrees, wild flowers and all that stuff. There's really something about Austen... ....what ever it is. This novel is very fine!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really appreciated this novel because it embodies the painful and well deserved work of those women who lived a few centuries before us ... Jane Austen shows herself as a powerful novelist and gives us the feelings ...even if we discover her writings nowadays ... This book has to be read : it is a masterpiece !!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's classic, Pride and Prejudice, is perhaps my favorite book of all time. Miss Austen's trademark wit and whimsy style of writing is appealing to readers of all ages, even to a modern teen like me. I find something, many things, to relate to within the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as I, like she, \\"[takes] delight in anything ridiculous.\\" Since the moment I read that infamous line: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged......\\" I have considered myself to be a firm and loyal Janeite, joining the ranks of thousands of hopeless romantics and head-strong women whom only hope to one day find their Mr. Darcy.Between the playfulness of Miss Bennet and the comically formalness of Mr. Darcy lies a classic lesson to be learned. Originally, Jane Austen thought to name this tale \\"First Impressions\\", as the moral of the story lies within the importance of not relying on just that. Lizzie Bennet's fatal --- or perhaps only --- flaw is her characteristic quickness to judgement, which nearly cost her the love of her life. Although by the end of the story one is almost always in love with Darcy, his personality at the beginning of the story is purposefully icy and rigid, depicting him as the perfect example of an excess of pride. By the end of the tale, however, Darcy stands proud as perhaps the most romantic hero of all time.Prepare to be \\"bewitched body and soul\\" by the whit and wisdom and Miss Austen, perhaps the most perfect romantic author of all time. In addition, plan to be enchanted by the playfulness of Lizzie, charmed by the misadventure of Darcy, rendered speechless by the nerve and lack of tact within the Mrs. Bennet, charmed by the sweetness of Jane and Bingley, enraged by both Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine, and most of all, infuriated by the ridiculousness and insufferability of Lydia and Kitty. There is always something to take from a story so perfect and so classic as this. I make it a point to return to it's familar story at least once a month. This beautifully penned tale only stands to prove that Love, more often than not, will be not so easily defeated."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the sixth time and can honestly say it was better than it ever has been before. The first reading, in high school, was a little rough. Since then, this book has grown on me each time (silly to say, since it is my FAVORITE book and the only one I have re-read as often). The humor is fantastic, the characters are both wonderful and suited so well to the time period, and Mr. Darcy is a classic \\"leading man\\". Who doesn't want to find the modern day version of Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It has been one of my favourites for years. Wheather you have read the other Jane Austen books or not, this is a \\"must read\\". This edition is really good and comfortable (in size, type size, etc.) to read and carry along for bus/ train travelling. Good to read and then watch the film."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this book is one of the most romanitic books i've read. i love this book. it is a turly romanitic story between a Women with alot of Pride and a man with both Pride and prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The beautiful language in this novel made it an instant favorite for me. The witty back and forth dialogues and characters created an amazinig atmosphere of intelligent and quirky people. Though the book does not give the reader an idea of what was happening historically at that time, that is part of what makes it a timeless classic. One gets a very good idea of what it was like to live in that time, but without the history it makes it open to all audiences. Pride and Prejudice is an amazing novel that does not disgrace the reputation of classic literature, but gives it a boost up."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"we received our book in one day. the book was in excellent condition. 5 star service"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Best romance book ever written and one of the top ten books of all time, in my opinion. Jane Austen has a remarkable skill for capturing cultural snapshots and portraying the essence of human nature like no other author I can identify. I also love the BBC movie version for the complete story and the recent movie with Keira Knightly for the highlights. I only purchase the Barnes and Noble collection for my classic books because they look nice together on shelves and have interesting introductions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Best novel ever!! And this one is the perfect size to tote around while on vacation or commuting. It is very small, but still easy to read. I really like the satin ribbon bookmark that is attached to the spine. I'd check out all of the novels in the mini gramercy collection and snatch up the titles you like. I hope they come out with more!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book twelve times, and I will never get bored with it. I'm hoplessly romantic, and I love the different conflicts, the interesting and independent characters, the plot twists, and the happily ever after at the end. Elizabeth Bennet is an independent, youthful, clever, and witty young woman in the eighteen hundreds. She is my favorite character in the novel, and has a wonderful spunky nature that keeps the book alive. The characters are fully formed and realistic, from beautiful Jane to the hilarious Mrs. Bennet. This is, by far, the best Jane Austen book ever published, and recommend it very strongly for anyone starting to read eighteenth and nineteenth century literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen. I give this book 5 billion stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been reading Pride and Prejudice on my iPhone through my Kindle for iPhone app...I purchased the book as well but found it easier to read in small increments that the Kindle provides.

I highly recommend this to women."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & PrejudiceIt might be the best book ever if you like this kind fo book, and let me tell you, I love romance novels. Whether its about humans, vampyres, or even Bram Stoker's Dracula, I love romance, and this is the kind of book that would make you want to cry and laugh at the same time! Never had I read such a book that made me feel like I was the heroine, yet as I turned the pages of the book, I didn't feel like I was in my small town in California, I felt like I was actually Elizabeth and I actually was in love with Darcy! I would reccomend this book for everyone who is tired of their boring life and want to escape to the wonderful land created by the wonderful and glorious Jane Austen!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was a good book. I loved the movie and liked the book more because I got to know more about the story throuogh the book. The only problem that I had was the style of the writing. It was a little hard to read and understand, but they did have a glossery in the back of the book that told you what everything ment that you don't understand."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P&P has a well-deserved spot amongst the classics. It's insightful, humorous, poignant and impeccably well crafted. As an astute observer of human nature, Austen was a genius at creating characters. I've read the novel numerous times in print, but I appreciate it in electronic form, too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love the story and this size is perfect for hand-held and keeping in a purse. I also like the ribbon bookmark - makes it easy to find my place."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"OK, so I'm a big fan of British actor Colin Firth. Especially so after seeing his BBC movie \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (or maybe it was the other way around). Anyway I loved that movie. I watched it so many times it made me want to read the book. I bought a hard copy edition but never took time to read it, just kept watching that movie. Kindle had a free edition, I said what the heck and I loaded it. Knowing the story already, I delved into the book. Happy was I to see that the movie was almost totally in sync with the book! I absolutely love the story. The \\"prejudiced\\" Lizzy reluctantly falling in love with the \\"proud\\" Darcy, and the Darcy who had too much Pride to get over his Prejudice towards her \\"lowly connections.\\"I will read it again definitely; it's got to be my favorite book, especially in the classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Two hundred Years this book has been around & still a bestseller. Sure the language is verbose & flowery , But Never has one book spawned hundreds of cookie cutter wannabees. Nothing will ever compare to the wonder that is this book. Jane Austen was a people watcher,I'll bet. As a writer, Jane Knew how to get under the characters skin to bare their souls of what mattered to them. What still matters to us.It was a satire of the times. Middle Class Women had to marry well because if they didn't they would be homeless or working at the lowest of jobs.So,alot of times they married the first dude that asked them to dance.I think Jane saw how unhappy the women surrounding her were in marraiges without any common ground or affection.She also explores the intricities of marriage and how differant personalities date and eventually marry. For some love for starts like a raging fire only to evaporate in middle age, for some love seems to elude them for no good reason ,and for others it comes softly at the strangest time. Some couples are dear friends, some roommates,others HAD TO GET MARRIED.Above all ,Ms. Austen shows us that Love can be savage,beautiful,tragic ,sudden,brutal,frightening,awkward,exciting,mysterious and confusing. That, my friends will never change.If this isn't enough reason to read this book, At least check it out for Lizzy Bennet and her well meaning,goofy mother, who loves playing matchmaker. Even though she is bad at it.Lizzy is everywoman. The men want to date her and women want to be like her."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book...it is a look into the window of how people use to behave in such a comical fashion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Dearest Readers of the century first and twentyith,I prooffer my highest and most esteemed recommendation of this fine book. Be not intimidated by formal British writing style of nearly 200 years ago, the occasional serpentine sentence, and words not oft' seen since the SAT exams (if at all). You will be highly rewarded with a most engaging story, skilled character development, and above all, acerbic wit. I trust you will be as delighted as this reviewer to have the felicity of reading this book.Very truly yours...P.S. Any 21st century western female reading this book will likely be as relieved as I am that we no longer live in a society where property conveys automatically to men, and women are totally dependent on men for their support. It's easy to understand why one character married for money and security only, and why the protognist's mother was completely obssessed with marrying off her daughters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a great read and Jane Austen is a gifted writer whose development of likable characters will be enjoyed for still more generations. It is hard at first to adjust to the language of the 1800s but is well worth the effort. Once the story begins to unfold you will not want to put it down. I also highly recommend Mansfield Park also by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of my favorites. This book is a classic and I highly recommend it!

Anyone who likes upper class, sappy, drawn out scenes of lovers trying to get each others attention can read this book and be enthralled.

ALL modern romance novels would be better than this, even if written by William Shatner."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I tried to read it, but I couldn't. I put it down at about page 100. From a fan of IMMANUEL KANT, this was too boring. Honestly, after I put it down, I had to study the Diamond Sutra and the Book of Job to get the vapid feeling out of my head. Someone on here wrote something to the effect of \\"as Blake saw the world in a grain of sand, so did Austen see the world in a drawing room\\". To this, I'd say that there is a vast difference in seeing the world in a drawing room, and thinking that the world IS a drawing room.Basically, it felt way too narrow for me. I will admit that I dislike British culture, as a whole, and have yet to make it through a third Dickens novel (have tried four). Still, I am a huge fan of Fielding, Defoe, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, and like a few other English authors."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"And I was very disappointed with 'Pride and Prejudice', which I read by choice.

The plot concerns a mother, Mrs. Bennet whose sole purpose in life is to see her daughters married. That's it. End of story and yet Ms. Austin takes several hundred pages to repeat this Theme Ad Nauseam.One has to remember that this book was written in a time when the only four things to do at night were get drunk, sleep, read or make love and some people did all 4 of these things in one lonely night!!!Ms. Austin takes full advantage of this and decides she has a story worth telling which is without plot, believable characters or any hint of suspense or excitement.

It may deal with &quot;emotions&quot; and &quot;the human spirit&quot; but it lacks the qualities of true literature. To be blunt, the book is boring. There is too much description and not enough meat. The story seems to be leading somewhere, and when you get there, you wonder why you took the journey in the first place. I plead to the human race not to let writers get off this easy by writing such unfulfilling books. Skip Bronte and read Hemingway or Poe."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this book was poorly written and i had trouble getting over the first page! i woke up after 10minutes and then realised that i had fallen asleep! i would recommend ppl to keep away from such a horror~ it hasn't got the right to be called a 'NOVEL'. i prefer lord of the flies. it's much more riveting~ now that deserves 5* rating"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"it's boring. Piece of advice for everybody who's forced to read this: buy CliffsNotes. This book is not worth wasting your time on.

I love the part when she is confronted by the Aunt and all her responses. She is sharp to the point and remains a Lady."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed this e-book very much because I have seen versions of the film and TV presentations and reading the book gives a more indepth study of the writing style of Jane Austen. The film and TV presentations couldn't include everything in the book such as a study of each main character. You must read the book slowly to enjoy her usage of words or you will miss the message because there are so many words to describe an event, person, scene, experience, etc. This book is very similar to a Harry Potter book - you need to read it more than once to capture the little things lead to something bigger. She gets you involved with her characters and you feel for them and you might even cry with them."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you were a proper English mother at the time of Jane Austen, what sort of novel would you want your impressionable young daughter to read? You certainly wouldn't want her reading romance novels, for that might result in her eloping with the gamekeeper! No, you would want her to read a sensible novel, about how it is important to marry money, and that upper class men, even if they seem haughty, are really the best husbands. You would want her to read novels that reinforce, rather than undermine, the class-ridden social fabric. You would want her to read novels that show that even less-than-beautiful girls can use their wits to snare husbands far wealthier than themselves. In other words, you would want her to read Pride and Prejudice, the ideal anti-romantic novel.The novel offers a stark contrast between sisters. The younger sister falls in love with a poor army officer, and, by following her heart, brings herself and the family to the brink of disgrace. The heroine, by contrast, by keeping her head, marries the haughty but wealthy man, saves the family, and climbs up a notch or two in social caste. The men in the novel are neatly arranged according to wealth: the best men are Darcy and his rich friends; in the middle is the father, a nice but ineffectual character; at the base is the poor and caddish army officer. Things appear differently early in the novel, when the army man appears dashing and noble, and Darcy seems rude and prejudiced. But by the end, the rightness of the class system is revealed, and the heroine discovers that marrying wealth is the best way after all.This is the perfect instructional tale for cynics of Austen's time, and for ours. Enjoy this masterpiece of anti-romantic fiction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful classic of English literature.

In Pride and Prejudice things didn't happened quickly but the book kept your attention.Melissa Nuis"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There seems to be a tendency to interpret the works of Jane Austen in political terms (Jane Austen and the State, Jane Austen and the French Revolution) which overlooks the question of gender and class conventions in Austen's novels, which go to establish the comic tone they bear so well. The critical introductions for Pride and Prejudice in both World's Oxford Classics and Penguin, by Isobel Armstrong and Vivien Jones respectively, do follow this trend and tend to overlook the rigours of feminist criticism, as appeared in Marilyn Butler's Jane Austen and the War of Ideas. As a post-revolutionary romance, Pride and Prejudice provides a reflection of political events, but this theme is only secondary to the critique of class and gender conventions, and which is only indirectly related to political conditions.The use of silence, or the withholding of information, as a narrative strategie to produce the complications in the plot that go to make up the story, follows from this indirect association. Another important theme in the novel is the difference between public and private space. The exchanges of information (gossip, if you may) between the characters, particularly between Elizabeth and her relatives and friends, reveal a society in which individual worth and reputation is decided by rumour. When rumour is too strong, this is, shared by many, it may not be worth one's while to attempt to change it even if it is found to be false. It is for this reason that Wickham is allowed to fulfil his mania for elopement and achieve a suitable marriage.It is no surprise that a society so concerned with opinion should be given to prejudice, this is, the conversion of uninformed unfavourable opinion into a general judgement. Prejudice is by no means to be seen as a privilege of the aristocratic class. The community at Longbourn are seen to be equally capable of misjudging and misrepresenting character, in particular Mr Darcy's.Elizabeth's one aristocratic feature in her character is her general dissatisfaction with everything she sees. Her critical gaze links her to the aristocratic crew that she meets and alienates her from her surroundings. But if she wants to become one with Darcy's \\"family party\\" it is precisely this quality that she is to tame. By looking at Pemberley's grounds, she learns to express her own (sensuous) satisfaction with things as they are.Elizabeth's sensual gaze has been educated through the novel in a process of humiliation and denial. It is when she accepts the humbling experience of Charlotte's wedding and goes to visit the Collins' that she learns to appreciate the stately fixity of Rosings and starts to give the appropriate steps to becoming Darcy's consort.In the words of Isobel Armstrong in the Oxford World's Classics \\"Introduction\\": \\"it is through the uncomfortable limits of sexual signals that the novel indirectly explores a deep political question: when is it right to conceal or to reveal information; when isit right to speak out?\\" Nevertheless, this question is in the novel less political than gender and class- based.\\"Female elegance\\", according to Mr Collins, consists in \\"rejecting a man on the first application\\". Affectation is taken for granted among women, which poses a problem for women who, like Elizabeth, wish to decline a proposal in spite of their economic need. Twenty years had scarcely passed after the publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Women, and it is characteristic of the peculiar genius of Jane Austen that she had already produced the first post-feminist heroine, a woman capable of turning the issue of marriage into an unselfish and pleasurable conquest - unselfish, because by marrying Darcy Elizabeth establishes her family socially, and pleasurable, because in accepting the stately home of Pemberley she fully reconciles herself to the sensuousness of life -."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book has well earned it's reputation as wonderful, but I would be much more inclined to place it in the romance section of the library than alongside Civil Disobedience and Wuthering Heights. Hold on, don't turn red just yet. My reasoning is such: this book was well thought out, much considered and had a depth of plot and characterization that I thought was approaching immaculate. The title was appropriate: this book is about pride and prejudice IN RELATION TO HAPPINESS, and only that. Austen dosn't go farther; she dosn't explore the depths beyond treading the seashore of what COULD HAVE been. We were only allowed to \\"dip our toe in the slough\\" for forty or fifty pages, until pride was rebuked, the truth was told and love recovered. Something more is required of a book than following the realms of happiness. \\"Suffering - perhaps that hasn't been properly looked at.\\" A classic must give something more, but this was a wonderful, heartfelt read! Put it between sessions of Bronte and Dostoevsky!For those who have read W & P and Pride and Prejudice: Tolstoy killed Andrei - Austen should have killed Darcy! Oh, dosn't Darcy reming you of Andrei???

I wish it was either more boring or more feminist. It was so witty and well-written that I couldn't put it down. But I felt uncomfortable with the underlying assumption that a woman's ultimate fulfillment is to marry a rich and gorgeous man. Of course it has very strong female characters, and was a very progressive novel for its time. The fact that it is still so popular makes me wonder how far we have come. I preferred Eliot's Middlemarch - a similar type of novel with a more balanced view of female ambition, morality and emotion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was difficult for me to read. The main drawback is the English (the real English they use in England) or maybe it's my lack of sophistication. The story of five daughters, seems like something for a teenage girl. There always seemed to be gossip and people really concerned about how others saw them. Maybe that's what makes Liz the main character standout. This story did not have enough action or masculine characters for my taste, but I understand it's a classic. The wahines must love Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I totally agree with the reader from NY who didn't like the novel(maybe it's something in the NY water). I didn't find any of the characters particularly interesting or the writing style very engaging; in fact, this was one of the few books I had to force myself to finish. All the characters were very pretentious, only caring about how you looked and what family you belonged to. After I finished this book I read JANE EYRE, fearing that I would have the same negative experience. But I cannot say enough about how great a novel Jane Eyre is, and I would recommend anyone thinking of reading P&amp;P to pick up Jane Eyre instead."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Never in a million years would I've thought that I'd enjoy a romantic comedy about a bunch of restoration period British richies, but this is a great book.

The book was realistic and I thought the eighteenth century English language to be fully enchanting. I think my most favorite parts were when Elizabeth refuses to marry Mr.Collins, her cousin (YUCK!), and her discussion with Lady Catherine deBourgh!

If I could write well enough to do the book justice, I wouldn't be a programmer, but I can say that it satisfies my craving for &quot;romantic slop&quot; without being in the least sloppy, and it entertains with both low comedy and keen perception. But my favorite feature of the book is what I've heard described as the &quot;comic precision&quot; of the speech of the characters. It would take a week of polishing to utter a single such phrase, and the idea of a group of people bantering effortlessly in this manner fills me with delight. And to the high school kid that said it wasn't &quot;profound&quot; enough: I might have said the same thing 25 years ago, but now the books that I thought profound then seem obvious, tedious, and/or pompous.

I also think Elizabeth is great heroin. the only thing I didn't like about the book is that the famly is so worried about the father dying and he doesn't even die. So what was the use of worrying. I also feel that Jane Austen was a great author and really wrote what womwn felt during the time when very few women wrote. What do men know what women feel. What gave men the right to write when they don't even know what women felt during that time. But I feel now that women and men are egual.

Jane Austen uses impeccable, meticulous language full of long descriptions and explanations to give the reader insight into the minds of all the characters. The character development indicates the author's striking understanding of human nature and acute observation of human tendencies. The story provides an intricate plot involving the intertwining lives and feelings of a few characters and is based more on character development than on actual events. Although the book is complex and somewhat wordy, it is interesting and not all that difficult to read. The story shows how individual tendencies and personalities can get in the way of love and happiness. It also adeptly portrays inter-family relationships and the profound impact they can have.

I made a list of a dozen or so and have had mixed results so far.I think that my expectations were too high, I was expecting something like Jane Eyre, which I loved. Unfortunately I found 'Pride and Prejudice' a little too frivolous for my tastes.Perhaps if I had known what I was getting before I started I would have been less disappointed? It felt like a fluffy romance novel, which I do not in general care for. I love a good love story, part of why I loved Jane Eyre.Maybe if it had been called 'Pretty Girls Out Husband Hunting' or 'Lydia Lands In a Jam' or something equally silly I would have known what I was in for.Maybe this wasn't the best first Jane Austen novel to read?I'm not sure if I will be reading another.Okay, I know that 655 of you loved this and many of you will have to give me a negative vote because we don't agree...So, let the negative votes begin *winces*."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I purchased this recording (read by Lindsay Duncan) through the iTunes store (something I will not be doing again), on the understanding that it was an unabridged recording.

Disappointing because I loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (with Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), so I thought I would like the author.And yes, I do love Dickens.

The hardcover book has a gorgeous aqueous / soft matte coating, and it's almost as if the letters/ cover text are screened on top. Really beautiful.

I'm so pleased with my purchase. I've purchased A-F (the only ones available at present, and will undoubtedly purchase the entire collection. Not only will I have a gorgeous collection of books by one of my favorite designers, but I'll be reading classic works.

It doesn't load well and is difficult to read as parts are cut off or wrap oddly.Even though it's free, it's not worth it. It's too frustrating trying to navigate and read.I'd spend a bit of money and get a better version, or better yet, buy the actual book, or even better, buy both. This has got to be one of the most romantic stories of all time.If you're not a Jane Austin fan, you will be within a few moments of entering into her world.For those of you unfamiliar with the story ~ (Do people like that even exist?) ~ Here is a brief summaryThe story takes place in Victorian England. We meet the Bennett family, the mother's sole intent is to marry her daughters off to successful men, ensuring they will be cared for properly since only males can inherit property. The story focuses on Elizabeth Bennett, the second daughter, who is attractive, but not as attractive as her older sister ~ She is also witty, smart, well-read and confident. Now we meet the wonderful Mr. Darcy. He is handsome and rich, but quite prideful and arrogant and rude. He is intrigued by Miss Elizabeth Bennett although he can't really figure out why. She mocks and teases him, and doesn't seem at all impressed with him, like every other female who has crossed his path.Throw in some other characters that help carry the story and you now have in your hands the most wonderful and romantic story ever written.Hmmm ~ perhaps I'm a bit biased.

According to Amazon customer service, there is no way to tell if any of the free Kindle editions of books are abridged before you download them. In this case, the book is clearly abridged, and it is a very poorly done abridgment. Hopefully, the paid versions of this book for Kindle are not abridged."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is a common tragedy that many high-schoolers and even adults do not read old books because they believe the books are not relevant. My words for them: human nature has not changed one bit since Jane Austen crafted her magic. Many people begin their reviews with &quot;Once you get past . . .&quot; but if any element were left out of this book (victorian society, language, high formality) it would diminish the book. Austen has shown through her characters the importance of valuing a person for who they truly are while 1) making fun of prudish victorian standards 2) showing gossip for the destructor it is, and 3) being one of the first writers to promote free thinking women as opposed to silly girls. Pride and Prejudice is called a classic for a reason: it will always remain a literary treasure."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Never before have I read a book as Austen's Pride &amp; Prejudice. Honestly, I don't read much book but I'm glad that I read this one.Throughout the first and most of the second volumes, Eliza criticized Mr. Darcy for his conceited, haughty attitude. She berated him for being so snobby at the balls. Eliza made assumptions about Mr. Darct only using his appearance and brief conversations with him as her premise. She also believed rumors from absolute strangers (Mr. Wickham) that slandered Mr. Darcy's reputation. Any bad news that she could find even the most baised resource was a good enough for her, just as long as it intensified her hatred for Darcy. One of the greatest accusations she put against him was his acts of prejudce and his big pride. However, she had made these conclusions based on her own prejudce against Darcy. This is the irony. She was a hypocrite in her own way. She deserves equal censure for her pride and prejudice. Unfortunately she realized her defects at near end. It is not surprisng that hse feels horrible about her discovery of her true self. The irony in all of this is that she got so caught up in finding Darcy's evil that she became who she hated most. She became the vain and prejudced one. She became the enemy she loathed so much. As you can plainly see, this book had a lot of impact on me. It was really enriching to read and Austen's delicate use of language which integrates the formality of that time along with slight English humor. The amalgam of languages helped me develop an intense vocabulary. I learned a lot of new words and feel better about writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, truly shows what great books are made of. The novel revolves around a distressed mother desperately trying to marry her daughters off before her husband dies. As a result, some hilaroius mishaps and misunderstandings occur, turning the novel into a humorous love story. Its conclusion will leave you smiling for days. A great book for anyone interested in love and all its follies!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's novel, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, was a great novel written as a portrayal of what life was like in the eighteenth century in England. This amusing tale revolves around an embarassing couple, named the Bennets and their five daughters. The Bennets, were what I would consider to be one of the most disfunctional families in all of history. The book starts way back in time when women could do nothing but to marry well, and as one can see having five daughters was more a curse, than a blessing.In the beginning Mrs. Bennet starts off by telling her daughters to marry well. At the same time, a wealthy man moves close to Netherfield, the house that they live in. The oldest of the five daughters, Jane, falls in love with this man, whose name later turns out to be Charles Bingley. Charles falls in love with Jane, depite her family's strange ways. Mr. Bingley and his friend Darcy talk often of the Bennet sisters, and later Mr. Darcy falls in love with one of them... the oldest Elizabeth, but she unfortunately turns him down, even though she later begins to have some other feelings for him. Lydia, the youngest daughter elopes with a man named Mr. Wickham and the family is very upset about this action. Jane and Mr. Bingley are getting closer but his younger sister Caroline tries to break them apart.Jane Austen's novel reflects many ways of life, including both the good and the bad times, all while in the search for happiness. This novel's story almost reminds me of another classic called, Little Women, which surprisingly enough was not written by Austen, because it has the same type of story line."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read &quot;P&amp;P&quot; when i was very young and i enjoyed it but didnt understand much other than Lizzie Bennett was adorable. but i recently read it again and it was so wondeful, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story. what's amazing is that even thought the book was written in Regency England the characters seem so recognizable: the pompous sycophant Collins, the overbearing mom Mrs. Bennett, the dishonest charmer Wickham, and of course, the sometimes self-righteous, sometimes sharp-tongued, but always lovable Lizzie, who's just my favorite. Now that i have a boyfriend i can understand the relationship between lizzie and darcy much better: unlike today's soap operas, where people jump into bed within minutes of meeting, Austen recognizes that true love takes time to develop and that lovers dont always say or do the right thing. it's just wondeful, the whole book, and i recommend all girls read if only to have a real role-model in Lizzie Bennett."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a love story that is slow developing, at least for Elizabeth Bennett. Because she is prejudice of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, she cannot see his fascination with her, nor can she see his true disposistion, which is delightfully uncovered over time. His fascination stems from her lack of desire to cater to his apparant haughtiness. She mistakes his shyness for rudeness and his disdainment for silliness as resentment towards others.And we musn't forget dear Mrs. Jane. Her love for Mr. Bently and his for her, make this book even more enthralling, especially as it all unfolds.Mrs. Bingly is a vital character in this book as well, as she covers jealousy, treachery to certain extent, caniving, and even back-stabbing. Of course she wants Mr. Darcy for herself.Jane Austen created memorable characters that each become a major part of this story! From her Father, Mr. Bennett, to the rediculous Mr. Collins and from Mrs. Bennett to the very silly Lydia. She even goes into detail about how things end up for the characters she created, at the end of the book! Great writing!This story also is an awesome detail of what it was like in the 1700's for families and women. Jane did not deal with the political side of life in this book. Some reviews from famous author's were disappointed that the book did not contain any information about what the men did for a living, but that was not Jane's intention. It didn't matter what they did for a living. They \\"went to town on business\\" was enough information. You come to understand that women didn't marry for love much, as in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. It was a convenience to be married for many. It also showed how important it was for families to have sons.I highly recommend this book, and the movie. You will not be disappointed. It is a great read, over and over."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have wanted to read this book for years, like many people, I've watched the A&E; movie, and have always been in love with Miss Bennett and Mr Darcy's story. I was held back so long from reading it because I was afraid (or perhaps more convinced than afraid) that because of how long ago this book was written, the language would be so difficult to read and comprehend, that I would find little pleasure in reading it. However, I was very mistaken! I was pleasantly surprised as I began to read this book at how smooth is reads while still retaining the magical way of conversation of that period. I loved it! I recommend anyone who has the same reservations as I had about reading Pride & Prejudice to not worry, it reads beautifully!After reading the book, I can really appreciate how true to character and events the A&E; movie kept, but no movie could ever compare! I'm impatient to read more Jane Austen novels, and only wish that I had done so sooner!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutley loved this book and had to keep reminding myself it was written ages ago. Apart from the dialogue, which was sometimes hard to understand, the story is timeless. Each character in this book was well developed and interesting. The twists and turns of the novel were well planned and thought out to keep the reader wanting more. I loved the setting of this book and Jane Austen's descriptions made you feel that you were there with them. This book is witty, charming, emotional and endearing. There is only one thing I didn't like about it...there wasn't a sequel. I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in a classic and a true romance.Bravo Jane Austen!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the first classic I've ever read and I really must credit Jane Austen for her wit. That's what got me sitting through the whole plot!The story is clear from the first chapter: Mrs. Bennet is trying for get her daughters married before her husband dies because since all five of her children are female, they won't get to inherit any of their father's money. Smart and sharp Elizabeth is the heroine in this book, and has a thing for judging people at a first meeting. It is not surprising that she developes an immediate annoyace for the arrogant Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy's friend falls madly in love with Elizabeth's sister Jane, who is astonishingly beautiful and shy.It's actually pretty boring to sit through the parties and dances, but there are some characters to keep us alive. Mrs. Bennet is one of the most comical characters ever; I can picture every one of her expressions when she is freaking out about her poor nerves. Lydia is flirtacious to the point of silliness. Mr. Collin's proposal to Elizabeth is so absurd,the seriousness of his stupidness and love for Lady Catherine de Bourgh is absolutely funny. Jane Austen has made her characters so lively and significant, you think you know them.Aside the fact that I've got a problem with Mr. Darcy being so rich and handsome (if I remember correctly), I liked this book. There are several turning points in this story, such as the letter that uncovers the charming officer into a man exploiting girls for money, and Elizabeth's sister eloping. I know Pride and Prejudice is incredibly old-fashioned, but that can't be helped. Try reading it at least."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading this book, my eyes have been opened to not only outward character but inner personality. Truly no other book has ever acheived international acclaim for so long. The reason is clear one of Jane Austen's best works, Pride and Prejudice has proven to contain the finest of elements which only contibutes to it's immortal relation of what happened during her days. Finally we have found a woman Shakespeare!!!A must read, for every literate."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has been considered a classic for many years and now that I've read it I definitely agree with its status. I read this book for a school project and did not expect much when I began reading. It was very difficult for me to get into the language and understand what was going on in the plot. I considered the book a bore until I was more than half way done reading it. I'm not sure at which point this transformation took place but I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and the plot. I wanted so badly for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to get together! I absolutely could not stop reading until I was done with the last page of the last chapter. Once I had finished I just sat there for a few minutes, reflecting on my experience with this book. My advice to readers who are struggling with the language is to keep reading! The challenge is part of the success you will feel when you finish the book. Jane Austen writes with beautiful imagery and has wonderful diction. This love story will touch you to the core. I am convinced that I will read Pride and Prejudice again, and in the second reading I will enjoy the first half of the book much more. I would say the ideal age to read this is college or older, at the youngest I would say a senior in high school. I urge you to read Pride and Prejudice and to let yourself appreciate Jane Austen's brilliant writing technique."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of my all-time favourites. It's Jane Austen's BEST literary work. This book revolves around 2 main characters- Elizabeth &amp; Darcy. Then there is Elizabeth's elder sister, &amp; her lover, Mr. Bingley. And then there are these other members of Elizabeth's family-Kitty, Lydia, Mary &amp; her mother, who are all silly &amp; superficial. Mr. Bennet (Elizabeth's father), feels Elizabeth is the only sensible one of the family. She certainly IS sensible, but not in love. When Mrs Bennet learns that Mr. Bingley &amp; his friend, Mr.Darcy have moved in Netherfield, she is overjoyed. After all, a bachelor with a huge fortune is always a target for matchmaking mamas. She schemes different ways to make Mr. Bingley fall in love with Jane, her eldest daughter. In the mean time, Elizabeth is busy antagonising with Mr. Darcy. But while all this is going on, a military regiment comes to town, &amp; the younger Bennets are busy flirting with the officers, the most popular of all being Mr.Wickham. After a few months of staying in Netherfeild, the Bingleys &amp; Mr. Darcy depart, leaving behind a trail of broken hearts. (the most important being Jane who really is in love with Mr.Bingley, but is no match for Mr.Bingley's sister,Caroline Bingley). After their departure, Mr Wickham discloses something about Mr.Darcy which makes everybody declare that they always knew him to a proud, selfish &amp; disagreeable man. Elizabeth, of course, believes him. Darcy, meanwhile realises that he has fallen in love with Elizabeth, but his pride is revolted by the very fact of marrying beneath himself. Whether he overcomes his pride &amp; proposes to her, what she does when he proposes, &amp; what happens after that, I'll allow to read it yourself. In the midst of all this lies the magnificent &amp; imposing figure of Lady Catherine de bourgh &amp; William Collins (also Elizabeth's cousin), who worships the very ground she walks on. This a VERY good book, &amp; the potrayal of the characters is so true, like its taken from real life. Take my advice..READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The novel of which I spent many a night, studiously reading, was a true masterpiece. The irony and satire with which Austen displayed the seventeenth-century society was beautifully mastered. The humor was impressive and understandable to the common reader. The relations, especially between Darcy and Lizzy kept the reader guessing about how their relationship would turn out. Thanks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is a truth not universally acknowledged, that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is probably not Jane Austen's best book. That honor is reserved for \\"Mansfield Park\\", a much deeper work. But it's almost everybody's favorite Austen, including mine, as much for the unforgettable characters as for the story.Elizabeth Bennet is the perfect heroine: she's bright, sharp, likeable, perceptive, nobody's fool, infinitely fallible, like all of us; but, unlike most of us, able to see and admit when she is in the wrong. Unlike her wacky mother and her shallow younger sisters, she does not see snaring a husband as her sole object in life, and thus she is supremely capable of putting Mr. Darcy in his place. Darcy's progression from an insufferable snob to an empathetic human being results from the realization that money and an old name are insufficient recommendations to a woman with real class, intelligence and character.Elizabeth's family is also well portrayed. We can understand why Elizabeth is her father's favorite child; he is as sharp and perceptive as she is, totally sensible and down to earth, a perfect foil for the ditzy Mrs. Bennet, who is so ridiculous you wish a chandelier would fall on her head, obsessed with marrying off her five eligible daughters. We know how the book is going to end almost as soon as it begins; Jane will hook Mr. Bingley in spite of the machinations of his nasty sisters, and Elizabeth, of course, will become Mrs. Darcy.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is very much of it's time, set at the end of the 18th century, but it's been loved by generations of readers for the past two hundred years and looks good for at least another two hundred. It's quintessential Jane Austen.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my first Jane Austen novel. It did not dissapoint!! New Years Resolution to read as many of the \\"classics\\" as I could. I have been pleasently surprised by this book. It left me wanting more and sad that it was over. Now I can't wait to read all of Jane Austen's books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"So many people - especially in the younger, 'trendier' generations, quite literally groan at the thought of reading a classic. And yet they do not realize these books are classics because they relate so well. They may not know that some of today's hottest blockbusters are based on this story; the unlucky in love bridget jones was based on this eloquent novel. as was the bollywood hit Bride and Prejudice.This story is about the wit of a young woman, who is unable to fight for her position in society with anyone else. This story stands for the right-minded, showing how they can change everything around them with only a touch of cleverness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a charming and witty excursion through the trials and tribulations of a middle-class English family at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Most of the action centers around a young spitfire named Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy), who, along with her four sisters and mother and father, is trying to negotiate the erratic fortunes of love and courtship amid the complexities of economics and social class.The independent and stubborn Lizzy meets the proud and very wealthy Mr. Darcy. His pride won't allow him to admit his feelings for her, and her adamant refusal to see his better qualities (her prejudice) stands in the way of their making a closer acquaintance. And so it goes for about three hundred pages -- but they are an intriguing three hundred pages of revelation, counter-revelation, comedy, and light suspense. However, to any experienced reader of romance novels, the ending will never seem much in doubt.Since Pride and Prejudice is a nineteenth-century romance novel, a prospective reader should bear in mind that the vocabulary and syntax reflect the time in which it was written. It has been called a seminal work and is standard fare in high school and college English courses; it certainly deserves that distinction. However, loading all this importance onto the book will constrain the casual reader from enjoying it as I imagine Jane Austen would have preferred -- a simple work of entertainment.The Oxford World's Classics edition includes a useful (but quite scholarly) introduction that provides the reader with a historical context for the novel and some background on Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is possibly one of the most beautifully written novels of all time. As one turns the pages of this timeless classic, she is brought into the wonderfully romantic world of Elizabeth Bennet and the rest of the so vividly depicted characters. One becomes familiar with the lavish mansions and picturesque countryside that envelope the setting of this novel, and at once becomes a part of the drama that surrounds the young women on whom the novel focuses.By far, my favorite character in Pride and Prejudice was Mr. Bennet. His quick wit and ability to survive in a household filled with marriage obsessed females are prime examples of the wonderful humor Austen brings to the novel. Another character I became quite fond of was Lizzy, for as a young female myself, I felt that the obstacles and tribulations she faced throughout the novel, especially the pressures put on her by her family and society, were timeless trials that all women go through.The turn of events in this magical novel leaves the reader both enthralled and ultimately satiated with the happy endings for the main characters. The plot is both unexpected and fulfilling at the same time, for Austen's writing is, at times, more gratifying for her characters than one could even devise in her own imagination. As the reader enters the world of the Bennets she gains a new perspective and appreciation of this era that lasts throughout the novel and leaves you thirsty for more at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read the Barnes and Noble Classics edition. This book dragged on and on in the middle and it is not an easy read due to the language of the time. But it's a fun, character-driven novel. My favorite character was the father - he's a riot! Don't expect much to happen, but there's a lot going on. For example, it's an interesting study of British class differences at the turn of the century. Also, the options women had were much more limited than today and it made for very different relationship dynamics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I started this book, I must say, it was with dragging feet. It was assigned to me for school and I was prepared for a sappy romance story, probably with big words, like most classics. The first half seemed to be living up to my expectations, minus the big words. In fact, it was so simply written that I began to wonder why it was called a classic at all. I know I may be speaking blasphemy according to some people, but all I could think in the beginning was that this was some twaddle about a bunch of giggly girls from the Victorian era! Then the middle came. At just about the exact middle of the book, things got interesting. Tension was rising; emotions were running like a river through rapids, and I was hooked. I suddenly found myself reading more chapters than I was assigned to that week, and of all the books I had to read in a week, that was the first one I picked up. I can't tell you any more specifically what grabbed me for fear of giving too much away, but I will tell you this: it may take awhile to get there, but it's well worth the wait. Once I had finished it I had to go back and read all my favorite parts! Now I, who sneered at Austen at the first, am planning on reading \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" over the summer. Austen, you have me converted!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the best reads this summer. Great writing, story brings you back in time when people actually had manners."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's just one of the best book I've ever read! Love it! And the movies are great too. Strongly recommended to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"That's probably one of the most famous opening sentences of a novel, along with Moby Dick. Pride and Prejudice is also probably one of Jane Austen's most famous novels. I certainly liked it much more than Northanger Abbey. It is the story of Elizabeth Bennet, who lives with five sisters, and an odd pair of parents at Longbourn. Her mother is constantly scheming about marrying off her daughters to wealthy young men, so when Netherfield Park is let to the rich Mr. Bingley, she is very excited indeed. (Mr. Bennet's estate will be entailed away from the immediate family upon his death, so at least one of the sisters has to marry well to provide for them.) And Mr. Bingley brings his very proud friend, Mr. Darcy. The book is about the courtships, and, of course, has many twists and turns. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and I suppose, the detestable Mr. Collins (who the estate will be entailed to) are the main men of the story.I really loved this one; it had humor and wit in it, and great characters. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet and his sarcasm very much, though Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are really too silly sometimes. So stupid. And of course, Elizabeth. She is really a very smart and spirited young woman, who will not be ordered around. I also watched the 1995 TV series from BBC, and I must confess, Mr. Darcy...never mind.Anyway, all the characters were well portrayed, and while the TV series is wonderful, it doesn't quite have the subtlety of the conversations in Pride and Prejudice itself. The TV series did have excellent casting though; all the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Collins were portrayed very well. (Yes, I suppose this is sort of a double review.) I would say though, that Caroline Bingley should have been a little prettier; she was just hideous, and Mr. Bingley was kind of silly-looking. But everywhere else, they did very well.Back to the book. As I said, there were many twists and turns which made this one a thoroughly enjoyable read. And really great characters. Though she is certainly less descriptive and florid than Dickens, Austen still manages in this one, to portray everyone extremely well. Mr. Collins really is detestable, Bingley overly-cheerful and positive, and Darcy stiff and stern (though he has his reasons, of course.) Mrs. Bennet is an extremely foolish woman, as is Lydia, the youngest Bennet. The pride and prejudice of the story refer, I believe, to Mr. Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice (though it is certainly debatable.) Mr. Darcy is very proud indeed at the beginning of the story, and Elizabeth's prejudice prevents her from seeing his true character for a while.I will just add that I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition from 2009, and while it has a very nice design, it does not have any analysis or introduction, so if you want that you'd be better off reading the Penguin Classics regular edition or Oxford World Classics. However, my Penguin Classics Deluxe edition arrived slightly damaged on the spine, which was a disappointment.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Can you imagine a more classic tale of romance?You are immediately transported back to the 19th century--I want tobring this book with me every time I travel to the English countryside.More than any other novel, this story really captures Austen's wit.Books these days are so lackluster in comparison, and it's becomeso incredibly hard to find a hero to live up to Darcy. I'm never, everbored when I pick this up--even on the hundredth read!PLEASE give this one a shot if you haven't already--you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Blame Jane - Austen that is - for The Marriage Plot: the idea that a woman's ambition and happiness rests solely upon marriage to a man; and that she is free to use any means to land her man, including to a great degree: gossip, deceit, and deception. In addition, she need not worry that he is not the ideal man, for she can mold him into what it is she wants because he is witless--putty in her hands. Unless he is a scoundrel, who turns the plot upside down on an unsuspecting nubile. Cheers, Mr. Wickham.Nora Roberts owes Austen for her fortune and success. Austen was the pioneer that many other romance writers have followed. Not only writers, but including real girls and women for, apparently, centuries, right on up to today; and is responsible for much of marriage's misery (sometimes for some people.) For some, I know, The Marriage Plot works.Jane Austen was a young, little (Actually, I don't know if she was little or what she looked like - but I do know she had one fine imagination.) twerp--writing wishful fantasies in her attic about things she had little experience with, having never been married, or \`properly in love,' or, \\"\`violently in love.\\"' Thank goodness she didn't write sex scenes.Oh Miss Bennet, no not you Jane, or you Mary, or her niece, or the other sister, or her cousin, or his cousin - yes, you Elizabeth, the creature that is Mr. Bennet's daughter, or should I call you Lizzy? Eliza? The writing is often confusing and redundant and nothing happens but gossip and sideways conversations - which is probably accurate for the times. It certainly is today. So there is that. If Austen were alive today she might be a stand-up comic. She's funny, and if you can muddle through the bad writing - amusing and entertaining. I struggled to finish the book, but then I'm not a fan of The Marriage Plot nor bad writing. Nevertheless - five stars because she was way ahead of her time - a true pioneer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I LOVE the movie so I decided to finally read the book. It's great!

It has quickly become a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What sets this work apart from many others is that the story is so well focused that one does not lose track of any of the main characters. Really, there is no need for sequels because all the loose ends are tied up. For that reason, Austen has given us a remarkable masterpiece.I will not go into the plot, you need to read it, but just know that this book is at one time a fanciful and a serious examination of the lives of women in the neoclassical era."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was one of the remaining Austen novels I have not read (Northanger Abbey is the other one). Emma, Mansfield Park, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion...loved them all. So I figured it was about time I pick this one up off my shelf.Boy, I was not disappointed! It almost felt like coming back to an old friend, even though I have never read P&P; before. But I know the story very well, having fallen in love with the BBC series. And I loved it. I loved it so much that I don't know what to say. It is that good. And it is jumping right up to the top of my all-time favorite lists.It's witty - I love the early banter between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth when Jane is recovering from an illness at Mr Bingley's home. It's funny - Mr Collins just cracks me up, and you just have to laugh at Mrs Bennett's scheming. Almost 200 years later, it is still a page turner. And as much as I love reading classics, I would not describe most of them as a page turner!It is also a comfort book. I can't help but love almost all of the characters, despite their flaws. Immersing yourself in the novel is like having a cup of tea with an old friend. It's a joy to read, and I am positive that over the years I will be reading it again...and again...and again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was so interesting! I sat reading and could hardly put it down. It has great suspense which I truly enjoyed. I am a romantic and anything that ends in true love is great. However most of the language (old English) can be challenging to read initially but you eventually get used to it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was maybe 10 or 11 years old. I came across it in my elementary school library, and was hesitant at first because the title suggested similarity to Crime & Punishment (let's be frank, Dostoevsky simply cannot appeal to a relatively normal 5th grader). I was way off base in this assumption, and have been smitten with P&P ever since that first reading. The story & characters never get old, and although some adaptations & variations are enjoyable to read, nothing can ever be quite like the original. If you haven't done so yet, read it. Please. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you haven't read this book yet, you really must do so! I never read any Jane Austen in school etc, and just out of nowhere picked up \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" recently. It instantly became my new favorite book. The characters are captivating, the story is enthralling, and it'll leave you wanted to go back and read it again. I warned my husband, though, that I'm not in love with another man.. and his name is Mr. Darcy :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is simply timeless, I reread it this Summer for the first time since high school and somehow I learned to appreciate Jane Austen's work even more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can not even begin to write the review that this book deserves. My only regret is that I didn't read this book sooner! If you enjoy a good love story then you MUST read this book! The characters were so well developed and the story was so well delivered that it was virtually impossible to put it down. In my opinion, this book deserves way more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always had a soft in my heart for Jane Austen. In fact, I can not say that there is any of her books that I do not like. About a month ago, I received my first kindle, as a graduation gift, from my boyfriend. I have to say at first I was very uncomfortable with using it because it just seemed like it would be very hard to read from it. I hate reading off the computer. However, I promised him that I would try. However, with this experiment I did not want to waste money on a book that I may never read from the piece of equipment. After searching Amazon I found the free section of ebooks and was delighted to find my tried and true author amoung those. This was the first ebook I had heard and though it has been many years and still enjoy it, greatly. Plus, I found that the kindle was right up my alley.Thanks, Jane; for giving me a book that never fails to capture my attention."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This story is one of the greatest pieces of English literature to ever be written. It may take some time to actually get hooked to the book, but once you do, don't count on putting it down. The tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy leave you wanting more. The love in the story leaves you speechless. It's a battle between the rich families and the poor families. I loved the book because it is a beautiful story that deals with tension, love, heartbreak and so much more! Also, the version of this book is easy to understand. The book is amusing, well written and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I could read P&P; over and over again, watch a million film adaptations, and never get sick of the seething love story behind it. The story of Elizabeth & Darcy is what all fiercely independent women (or those of us who would like to become such) dream of -- uncompromising love with a man who is somehow both kind and sexy and equal in every way.No one does romance like the Brits, and most subsequent romance stories are just rehashing the tales of Austen, Bronte, and the like."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"*happy sigh. I mean, really, do I need to say much more than that? I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Pride and Prejudice's happily ever after that goes above and beyond your average HEA. It could be because it has quite a few of my favorite plot devices in it. Austen certainly balances them all very well. At no point does one seem to outweigh the other. In one novel you have: a grievous assumption of character, manipulative sisters, a scandalous elopement, a dysfunctional yet mostly lovable family and the heroine who marries up.I think my favorite story arc is the same as everyone else. I love watching Elizabeth Bennet get smacked upside the head by love. I adore Darcy for not being aggressive in trying to win over Elizabeth. Instead he showed her who he could be. In one instance he wasn't guaranteed Elizabeth would ever know about his act of kindness. In fact he didn't want anyone to know. Their love story is both epic and legendary.I'll admit it took some time to understand the dialogue. Once I did, I found one of the greatest love stories ever written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i really love this book! i liked the movie with keira. (i never was into the whole pirates of the caribbean) i saw the movie first and then got the book from a bookstore, and when i got my kindle i downloaded the book so i could re-read it when i had craving for a pride and prejudice fix. i can read this book over and over.the only problem that i see is the formatting and that is why it is a 4 star, i really think it is the kindle itself because i have the pc kindle and everything is just the way it is in the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"like Pride and Prejudice. I really do. It's one of my favorite novels. But, I must confess, it's not my favorite Jane Austen novel. I like both Persuasion and Emma better and Sense and Sensibility is very, very close.I first read the book when I was 14 and I absolutely loved Elizabeth Bennet and her sharp wit. I really liked Darcy too, but everyone paled in comparison to Elizabeth. I thought the story was incredibly romantic. I even thought Mr. Bennet was a doll. I saw the 1995 version very shortly after I finished the book and my opinions were less than favorable. But that's a review for another day.My opinion has changed over the years and frequent rereads. I saw what a bad father and husband Mr. Bennet really was. I still like Elizabeth and Darcy, but mostly because they are dynamic characters who mature and grow to become a worthy couple. I find Elizabeth quite immature and a bit too sure of herself in the beginning and Darcy to be on the controlling side. They are both proud and both prejudiced in the beginning but I do like that they learn from their mistakes and change.The book is a delightful comedy of manners. But I more highly admire Elinor Dashwood, Anne Elliot, and even Fanny Price than Elizabeth Bennet. And I'd take Frederick Wentworth, Henry Tilney, Mr. Knightley, or Colonel Brandon over Darcy. Although the 10,000 a year does work in his favor..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and it is one of my favorites of all time! the characters are very detailed and believable, and the plotline is very interesting and dramatic without being totally unbelievable. having wanted one guy before discovering that another one was my match myself, I totally relate to this book. I also find the 17th-century culture aligned in the book interesting, such as the fact that girls were forced to marry for economic reasons by a certain age, often with men that they were not in love with. This book paints an amazing portrait of what 17th-century life was like, with all of its balls and activities, along with an amazing love story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I purchased this free book to try out my new Kindle.This book is a true classic and every bit as enjoyablea read as when I first read it forty years ago!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite novel and Jane Austin is my favorite author.

I loved it. While most of my friends would not see how funny this book really is or understand the romance of it, I found it one of the best books I have ever read. Obviously."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book lives up to what it is supposed to be--a classic love story. I can easily identify with and like the main character, Elizabeth. Throughout the book, I find it's easy to sympathize with her when she's embarrassed by her family or angry with Darcy. I feel her love for her sister. And, of course, I feel her anger and dislike for Darcy and the feelings of attraction and love that start to take their place. This is a love story. If you want to read a love story, read this book. If you're not interested in that type of thing, then pass this up. I promise you, though, that if you're interested in reading a simple love story, then this is a great one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"But I'm going to read it now and find out--have just in fact borrowed the book itself this minute from me local library where Pat, a woman as it turns out and a reference librarian to boot, procured a paperback edition from the stacks and placed it right beside me here at the computer which I have to use now in the library coz I don't yet have a box of rocks installed back in the hut. I do have a clock and a radio though. And a calendar too although strictly speaking that particular item is made out of paper. I do believe that I am going to bigly dig Pride and Prejudice in any case, hence the bold five stars. Well for starters it's considered a classic, innit? Plus I am very favourably disposed towards this writer on account of having read and thoroughly enjoyed some years ago the very bleeding brilliant Persuasion. That truly is a lovely book that is and an abiding pleasure to read. The BBC made a great film version of Persuasion too so they did, in the middle 90s and not long after I savoured this memorable novel for the first time, with deeply satisfying turns by Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. That little flick still strikes all the right notes for me. And so happily on to P&P."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the unabridged 1945 Hardcover (cloth) Book Club edition - which means it's just as great as it should be, since it IS Pride & Prejudice, but also that the book club-iness makes it not as valuable as it looks. This version has full page colored pictures of the characters through-out, and has that traditional deckled edge (uneven cut pages - makes it easier to turn pages imho).The book is a cute love-story about Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy set in that classic early 1800's English period where manners and one's dictated social existence means far more than independence and general happiness. You HAVE to take into the account the current society of the time period / location to understand the predicaments. The story is witty, albeit wordy but still very enjoyable even after ~200+ years.THIS is the version I was looking for, hard cover, ancient looking and good quality! Perfect for my personal PHYSICAL library! I have the Kindle version and yes, that comes with a huge amount of spelling errors and paragraphs broken up mid-sentence. BUT the Kindle edition is FREE a good deal of the time so you end up getting what you paid for... ;)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Firstly, I've changed the page count. With the additional notes and whatnot, the book is the number of pages first listed. The story itself is the number in the parentheses.On to the review! I'd always loved the Pride and Prejudice movie; the one from 2005 (I've never seen the really long one). I automatically fell in love with the story, just because I'm such a romantic and found everything about the characters and story so incredibly sweet. Finally, I dragged myself to Borders and forced myself (slash my mother, because I'm broke, hahah) to finally buy the book. I was not disappointed. I love old-fashioned stories, with old-fashioned language and learning about how they did things way back then. It's entertaining on all levels! Mrs. Bennet, though, could drive any sane person crazy, but she's leveled out by Mr. Bennet and her two sensible daughters, Elizabeth and Jane.The love story between Darcy and Elizabeth is priceless; I can see why this book is considered such a classic. However, this isn't a book to be recommended to someone who doesn't like lengthy descriptions and can't really translate nineteenth century speaking into modern day language. You will not understand a thing that is going on. If you read young adult romances and nothing else, this isn't the book for you.

That said, I think Pride and Prejudice is the best book she ever wrote. The characters are well-drawn and internally consistent, and the story line flows with a sense of inevitability.

No matter what mood I'm in, I can flip to Pride and Prejudice and feel warm, cozy, and content within minutes. Favorite book of all time. Weeeell..

But after knowing him, they kinda fall in love...I am doing a book cube project on this book, and this book is completly AMAZING!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the dismay of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is rich. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are good because of what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than \\"venison\\" or \\"meat.\\" Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" With that great opener, we are off to the races.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own. Somehow it seemed Jane Austen anticipated the future when much of her character's behavior would be seen as folly, though we certainly have follies of our own today."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved the book, a well-known English classic, and felt compelled to give it a good rating. I do have one criticism of the eBook format for this particular edition. While I was reading through the book I noticed, more than 100 times, that the book was inappropriately formatted. There were new paragraphs where no paragraphs should be (...Mr. (praragraph inserted) Darcy...), this was only a minor distraction, but it did become a bit annoying, and it is an easy problem to fix. Paragraph insertion also took place between sentences, this became especially confusing with paragraph long dialogues. Great book, but the formatting needs a bit of work"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the best classic books around. A love story of classes and impossible love.

It includes the story of a family who holds the possibility of falling into financial trouble. In order to maintain financial stability and remain in line with the standards of society, the daughters are pushed into marriage. This novel recurrently explores the theme of if one should marry for true love or if it is acceptable for the daughters to marry in order to fit in with society and attain financial security. Jane Austen does a great job expressing the ideals of her society in a creative and interesting manner through her novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is, of course, a timeless classic. Beautifully written. I haven't read it in years, but look forward to reading it again on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was the first time I had read one of Jane Austen's novels, and I am so enthralled with the story-telling and characters I am now looking to read every single thing she has written. The writing is filled with so many different layers; not only do I find bits of humor in a re-read that I missed the first time around, but the characters themselves are so different and have so much depth that you could easily imagine these people exist (or have existed) in real life.The dialogue is where this novel shines, which is good since the novel is mostly dialogue. Austen is able to convey the personality of a character simply through the way the character speaks, so that even though there are not a lot of descriptions of the characters, you have a clear idea of who each character is almost as soon as they open their mouth. Perhaps one of my favorite aspects of the writing style is the sandpaper-dry wit of Austen, which, when you understand it, can be very, very funny.Note that it may not be for everyone: since this book was written in the early 1800s, some of the turns of phrases are outdated, and may be difficult for a modern reader to understand. Another stumbling block is that while the writing itself is elegant and beautiful, the sheer density of words might make it hard for some people to read. For the former, my recommendation is to read as closely as possible, and re-read passages you didn't quite get the first time around; this will have the added benefit that you may be able to catch wisps of Austen's dry humor you might have missed the first time (I know I did). For the latter, it's a matter of preference. Personally, I love how poetic and elegant the writing is, and finding the hidden tidbits of humor as well as the ever-present underlying issues of the time was always rewarding to me; but if you find after the first chapter or two that you just can't get through the density of the writing, this may not be a good read for you.Since I downloaded the Kindle version, here's a review of the e-book format specifically: I did not notice any typos (yay!); it had a list of chapters near the beginning of the book, right after the cover, but does not contain an actual \\"table of contents\\" function. (i.e., if you click on \\"Go to...\\" the \\"table of contents\\" button will be grayed out.) Page numbers are included and total at 253; and for those who care, there are ten \\"Popular Highlights\\" at this time of writing, half of which are grouped around pages 12-15."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and PrejudiceLove Jane Austen Have seen the movie many times and read the book so much more exciting to read the book and let your mind visualize the settings.

Since I'm not used to reading classics during that time, it took me ages before I get the hang of the story and eventually finish it. Nevertheless, I was able to appreciate the story and it instantly became my favorite. Well, who would not fall in love with the story of Lizzie and Mr. Darcy?Three years later, this book was chosen as the featured book for the October face-to-face discussion of my book club and so I decided to read it again since I wasn't able to retain most of the details of the story in my memory. It was worth reading twice indeed for I find it sweeter the second time around. For some weird reason, I am really a fan of love-hate story and it was only when I read this book the second time that I realized that this is the best love-hate story I've read so far. It was also in my second time that I was able to appreciate more the care-free character of Elizabeth Bennet, the snob-outside-but-soft-inside character of Mr. Darcy, the annoying character of Mrs. Bennet and the cool father character of Mr. Bennet.Pride and Prejudice is truly an enduring classic so no wonder it became one of the most popular books in English literature and inspired most of the novels of today and became the favorite subject for film and tv adaptations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even though the language can be a challenge for me at times, I've ways loved this book!

The book is about a twenty-one year old girl struggling with three stupid sisters and an arrogant mother, with only her father and elder sister as her true friends.

Line breaks follow pretty much every occurrence of \\"Mr.,\\" for example."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Any reader of the novel Pride and Prejudice, be it novice or veteran, has certain expectations and apprehensions based on its incredible popularity and renown. The same can be said for the media, whose recent over-use of its famous opening line, \`It is a truth universally acknowledged...' can be found repeated in the opening of many a news, magazine or blog article announcing some creditable or dubious connection to Jane Austen's characters or plot. Interestingly, it has become the meme of the day passed along and re-used by those who want to appear in the know, but are sadly missing the point. It is debatable if Pride and Prejudice's profound truths can be reduced to just universally acknowledged one-liners. If the novel was that easy to figure out we would not care two figs about it, and after nearly two hundred years, it would have been lost to obscurity! What one can expect though is so much more; an engaging plot that keeps you thinking and re-evaluating characters every step along the way, witty, sharp and humorous dialogue that others wish to emulate but never quite achieve, and a love story which just might reign supreme for all eternity. With all of these expectations before us, who could not be a little intimidated?The Oxford World's Classics new edition of Pride and Prejudice might just meet your need to read and explore Jane Austen's classic novel. This edition presents the reader with a wide variety of supplementary material to help you along in your discovery of the universal truths in Pride ad Prejudice. Like many editions, it supplies us with an unabridged text that has been carefully edited by prominent scholars since it was first published in 1813. \`Carefully' is the operative word here, since the debate is on about what has been changed or removed from the text. I will again defer to my learned co-reviewer Prof. Moody to delve into that arena. In addition to the brief biography of Jane Austen, select bibliography, chronology of her life, and two appendixes on dancing and social status that are repeated in each of the six editions in this series, (and previously mentioned in our first review), this volume includes a twenty-six page introduction by Fiona Stafford, notes on the text including a publishing history, textural notes and explanatory notes unique to this edition filled with insights and facts neatly organized and easy to find.Writing an introduction to one of the most beloved and highly scrutinized novels in English literature is a daunting task indeed. My sympathies went out to Fiona Stafford even before I had read one word. Pride and Prejudice is so many things to different people, and not everyone's pet project could be addressed within the limit of space. I just hoped that she might enlighten me in some small way about a truth or insight that I had previously missed. She did not. But like one of the main themes in Pride and Prejudice, accounts by different people of the same events can have different truths. We all judge by our own unique agenda, so what I saw as lacking, another reader might find diverting. She did however, hit upon some interesting points; how the strength of our convictions can cloud our belief and disbeliefs, the divergence and attraction of different personalities, and how truth or the misconception of it can alter our judgment and future happiness.The truth may be uncertain in Pride and Prejudice, but on this fact I am convinced. I had difficultly writing about this introduction even after taking copious notes. This can be a telling sign to its clarity and content. I did however find one point of amusement when the author mentioned that characters can be distinguished by their speech patterns and gave examples; \\"Lydia's use of \`Oh Lord', Miss Bingley's \`Abominable', Mr. Collins' \`Lady Catherine de Bourgh', and Mary Bennet's lengthy, but largely content-free sentences distinguish her from her vivacious sisters.\\" This is definitely true of Austen's unique characterizations, but this introductions \`content-free sentences' certainly distinguished it from any other vivacious introduction that this writer has the pleasure to read.Besides my disappointment in the introduction, the remainder of the supplemental material including the very helpful explanatory notes and the extensive chronology were a delight. For the new student the additional material is a must to understand the full context of the novel; - and for those Janeites who are ready to start your annual re-reading of Pride and Prejudice, pick up this edition. It is a perfect size to stash in your handbag or brief case, and whip out when the next debate ensues about whether Mr. Darcy was too proud, or just shy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"...This book is a romance, and I liked it.My only excuse is, it's a CLASSIC romance!I loved it, in fact. It's on my Top Ten Favorite Books list. It wasn't gross, it wasn't weird, it wasn't annoyingly romantic. I loved it. (I might say that a few more times.)I loved Elizabeth, Jane, Mr. Bennet's relations with Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingly, Mr. Collins (my cousin cannot say his name without falling over herself laughing from what she saw in the movie.)I can't even find words to describe how much I loved this book. I read it this summer, and I'm still at a loss for words!All I can say is, I'll definitely be picking up more classics. And my book of Jane Austen's works will soon be veeeery well-worn.Rating: Very Good"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book about once a year. It has the wonderful dialogue and character development. AND it's funny! A must read for any self-respecting bookworm!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I went to a bookshop, this book 'Pride and Prejudice' charmed me with pretty book cover and familier title.When I started reading this book, I could not stop, i had to finish it. This book is very classical love story, even though it is written in a difficult english style. I was able to fall into this book very easily.Firstly, it was interesting how Jane portrayed the fluttering mind of village people like how all the villege people tried to contact with new villeger Bingley.Also it was interesting that how Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's first impresstion is bed. That shows the first impression is not everyting, it's changeable by knowing the person in depth.Combine with that period of time, the love story continues. I was queit impressed how their only hope is to get married. For example, wickham's case. Elizabeth's sister get crush on him, and just fall into him and gets marry with him.I also knew that in that period of time, there was big gap between rich and poor same as today. This story is more meaningful because the story overcomes the richness. Also the way Mr. Darcy acts out, how he helps Elizabeth without letting her know and how he tries to protext him was really romantic.One another thing is that these days, most of the love stories reverse the story at the end that might give readers a thrill. But this very classic book just kept on going to one direction the way that i predicted. That is the reason that i chose this book to write a review on.Lastly, as I read this book I learnt that the appearance is not everything, the thing that charms person is one's scent. What kind of personality and chracteristic the one has. I think everyone wants to be pretty and be nice like a flower infront of a person the he or she loves. But important thing is that should be not determinded by a appearance but by inner personality."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although this is my first Jane Austen novel (I started Emma but returned it to the library after a boring few pages), it suprisingly was a fun read. I admit I read this because of the movie and the BBC miniseries, but even watching both does not give the full story behind Pride and Prejudice. The book can be boring at a few scenes, namely, Mr. Collins, but whenever we read Elizabeth's and Darcy's banter, it makes it all more worthwhile. Definitely recommend the book if you enjoy the movie/BBC series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's books are fabulous. Her writing is superb and captivates the reader. Pride and Prejudice is an excellent book. It tells a story of five young girls to be married and has a very engaging plot. Young girls will not be disappointed with Jane Austen's novels. All her works are very inspiring.Cynthia Marie Rizzo author of \\"Angela and the Princess\\" and \\"Julie and the Unicorn\\""},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a gorgeous little edition of Pride and Prejudice.

I got a little frustrated with it sometimes, but I'm very glad I decided to keep reading it. Pride and Prejudice will always be a clasic. I plan on reading the rest of Jane Austen's books also. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I finally read P and P when I assigned it to my sixteen year old daughter. She really appreciated the little notes in the DK illustrated classics edition. I have been reading older novels for so long I didn't really take too much note of the explanations since they were all familiar to me but my daughter said they really helped her understand some things that were very unclear to her and keep her momentem reading the novel, which we both really loved."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a timeless and beloved classic. It's a beautiful story of class in Jane Austen's time that appeals to us today because it is so well-wrtitten. It's scrupulously clean morally, and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates the time when love stories were wholesome and pure and touching. All the characters have an appeal that's makes you appreciate the way they fit into the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As much as this book revolves around three of the four daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, all of those characters revolve around Mr. Darcy - whose personality and character matures and unfolds before you.Neither poor nor rich, the Bennets cannot establish great wealth and comforts for their children - and Mrs. Bennet's hard opinionated character further deprives the lovely lasses of possibilities for advancement. But, through the character weakness(es) will come happiness in all levels - where some smile and others are more joyous and laugh. And, thee events happen quickly, all within one year's time.Darcy, who adores his 10-years-younger sister Georgiana, is the proper gentleman who has never raised his voice during his 28 years. Elizabeth, her father's favorite and mother's least, befriends Mr. Darcy and soon aggravates his senses and challenges him to make it to 29 without harsh verbal exchange or raised voice.After some embarrassingly wrong misconceptions of his character, and equally wrong characterizations about a person whose life has plagued Darcy's, Elizabeth watches the young man blossom as he singlehandedly controls her family's pitfalls, confronts those who attempt to deliver her family to near disasters and financially saves the family from other possible misfortunes. In such actions, Darcy has to befriend an enemy, deliver embezzled money, negotiate with creditors of his enemy, and more. And, all for love - and who ever said love would be easy?Pride is swallowed not only by Darcy, but by so many others in this novel. \\"Pride. . . is a very common failing. . . Human nature is quite proud of some quality or other, real or imaginary.\\" We learn, \\"Vanity and pride are different things.\\" \\"Pride rises from a good opinion of ourselves; vanity from what we would have others think of us.\\"We are wrongly told \\". . . almost all his [Darcy's] actions may be traced to pride, and pride has often been his best friend.\\" In the end, we learn Darcy \\". . . has no improper pride.\\"Interestingly, prejudice is not a word defined, used or explained like its title counterpart. But, prejudice is a concept belying each page, each acquaintance, each personal affront, and somehow is easily overcome by youthful passion. Prejudice helplessly loses amidst the betrothing of the three daughters full of young passion.In the end, a Cinderella-like conclusion befits the young hearts' defiance to prejudice through passion. And, in the persuasive methods of young Elizabeth, the originally perceived overbearing pride of Darcy evolves into what she describes to be proper pride.If there is one thing this reader enjoys in this Austen book it is the dialogue. Whether it be the hindered ire of Darcy in civilly responding to Elizabeth's overzealous impertinence, or Elizabeth's steadfast refusal to succumb to Lady Catherine's requests that she never wed her nobleman nephew, the calm and polite retorts are deliciously phrased and eloquently presented. Few plays can match such work."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It seriously does not get any better than this! This book unfolds slowly allowing you to fall in love with the characters and get a feel that world and time. An amazing love story, it leaves you wanting more!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love Jane Austen all around, but most especially Pride & Prejudice. If I can't find anything else to read, I pick up P & P. Austen is so very clever, and the multifaceted storyline never gets old."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, with the exception of two things.First, the version that I read has a nauseating, fan-boy introduction. I don't particularly care which version of this book you purchase; you should skip the introduction. Just in case. This is not the fault of the author, but of the editor, and I will not ding the author because of its presentation - especially hundreds of years after her death. It would be dirty pool.Second, there is a single passage in the novel which details Elizabeth's growth as a character, where she, introspectively, weighs in on how she feels she has developed. This was out of character for her. She spends much of the novel in angst about various things (such as Mr. Bingley's interactions with her sister Jane, Mr. Darcy's feelings for her, and vacillating between like and dislike for Mr. Darcy himself). The loss of this paragraph would have, in no way, mutilated the perception of Elizabeth as a cogent and erudite character with a mind of her own that was well-working. Nor would its absence have colored an intelligent reader's perception of her growth.Mr. Bennet, however, was hilarious. His steadfast perception of all of the women around him (excepting Elizabeth) as being irredeemably foolish was, I think, a major highlight of the book. Not because it was accurate (although it certainly was in the case of the youngest daughter, Lydia), but because it highlights and gently satirizes the perception of ladies at this time in England. This is made particularly clear in the case of his wife, who is the most grasping fictional woman since Becky Sharp. The juxtaposition of Mr. Bennet's foolish perceptions of women (as themselves being foolish), and the intelligence of two of his daughters (Jane and Elizabeth) faithfully, I believe, points out one of the main purposes of Ms. Austen's writing: To throw into stark contrast the difference between the commonly, culturally accepted perceptions of women (e.g., Mr. Bennet) and the reality of their perceptions and their intelligence (e.g., the two eldest Bennet sisters). This was, in my perception, one of the most important purposes of Ms. Austen's writing, and she performed it well.The interactions between Elizabeth and several of the other characters, especially Lady Catherine De Bourgh, are often times hilarious. Other times, such as her frequent misperceptions of Mr. Darcy and her excercise of her sometimes rapier wit at his expense, are less amusing than they are painful; not because of their inaccuracy or their sharpness, but more because an astute reader will realize the reality of Mr. Darcy's character much earlier than Elizabeth does. And once that point is reached, and even before, it is hard to take her chidings with equanimity. Even if he is a jerk, he is still a human being, and it seems malicious of Elizabeth to treat him this way. Unlike some, I will not excuse her behavior as common for the times, because Elizabeth seems...transcendent of her times in some ways, much like the author herself.This was, by and large, a very entertaining book. It is well worth reading, whether you are curious about the foundations of romantic comedy (which got their first big push in the public here), in the time period of the Napoleonic War (which doesn't figure in the novel, but the social interactions of the time are well detailed), a fan of novels of manners (such as this one, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma, by the same author, Thackeray's Vanity Fair, or Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust), or just in the mood for a fun book. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.AHarkius"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There are few things more comforting in this world that sitting down with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and a steaming mug of tea. My mother first introduced me to the world of Jane Austen when I was quite young and I will say that this novel is one of the most battered books on my shelf due to how many times I have read it - at least once per annum. For years, audiences have been charmed by the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, the story's sharp-witted heroine, and admired the well-born Mr. Darcy, her verbal sparring partner. There is evidence to suggest that this novel in particular held a special place in Austen's heart, though one could hardly fault her if this is the case.It is impossible for me to resist being drawn in by the Bennet family - the tale of five sisters and an estate entailed away to particularly ridiculous male relation. Though it may be \\"a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" the prospects of marriage for any of the girls are far from ideal. However, more than love and marriage, character takes the center stage of this novel and within its pages is material enough for endless study and enjoyment.I hesitate to say too much more than that this novel is simply a joy to read; it certainly deserves its place in the literary cannon, withstanding the tests of time. I wish that all young girls would read it so that we may have more Janes and Elizabeths and fewer Lydias. I would also freely recommend a viewing of the 6 hour A&E; film after you turn the final page, as it truly does justice to the story - not to mention Colin Firth makes a particularly dashing Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little disappointed that this issue didn't have any illustrations in it, but the book is wonderful.

No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension.

Even if most people could not necessarily recount the plot and characters, the countless editions of the book, combined with movies and literary spinoffs stand in testimony to it as a cultural icon. There are not many who would not recognize the book by name and have some sense of its position and impact.This review then cannot do much more than to echo these commonly known facts and direct attention specifically to the Kindle edition of the book which was downloaded as a free public domain book and which I confess, my first time reading the entire book as originally written. The strength of the book and timeless qualities of it can be affirmed by the attention that it elicited from me. I was able to enter into the plot and see both the masterful writing as well as the true insight into human nature that this book represents. Apart from a few typos and the chapters not being very well differentiated, I had little difficulty wanting to return to my Kindle to continue the read and glad for the experience.This is one of the most appealing elements of the Kindle in my estimation. There are so many books in the public domain that provides an opportunity for the reader who has heard of and knows the place and importance of a particular book who can then download the book and take the opportunities during the day (and for me of a long commute) and fill the gaps in one's reading by pulling books that have stood the test of time as well as the convenience of the newer books that are available at a considerable discount over the new Hardback price.What a pleasure to read and more yet to come in the days ahead.5 Stars for the novel AND the medium!Bart Breen"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a romantic novel which I absolutely recommend to readers. If one is able to comprehend a 19th century woman's role and priorities, entailment, and discover insights on characters within letters and situations, you will surely appreciate this novel. I would mostly recommend it to readers ages 16 and up.One of my favorite chapters was chapter 34. In this chapter Darcy declares to Elizabeth his love for her and proposes matrimony to her. He does this when his love for her is at a stage where he disregards all obstacles that kept him from doing this earlier. He also does it at a point where Elizabeth's anger towards him is at a crucial point.One of literary devices that I mostly appreciate was irony. For example, in chapter 34 Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being prideful while Elizabeth accuses Darcy of being prejudiced. Even though both characters have fault in pride and prejudice, I found it quite ironic how the reader may think that Darcy symbolizes pride while Elizabeth symbolizes prejudice. Yet these two characters are viewed in the opposite way, where Darcy symbolizes prejudice and Elizabeth pride.I really did like this book, mostly because it did not bore me. I hope other readers appreciate this novel as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group. I recommend this book to whoever is interested in reading it. There is no violence, or any misconduct. The only thing mainly talked about was of love and the social class differences in the 19th century. One literary device that I appreciated is called allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings, and events stand for abstract and moral concepts. An example of this is the distinction people made in social classes. We can see this clearly in the way Mrs. Bennet desperately wanted her daugters to marry rich men, but Elizabeth wanted to marry for love. This moral concept shows readers that money, even though it has a great effect on many people, does not buy true love. I believe it has been one of the best books I have read so far. It was a beautiful, yet confusing love story. My favorite chapter was Chapter 18 from Volume 3. In this chapter Elizabeth and Darcy resolve the unanswered question of their relationship. Darcy had come with Bingley to Longbourn to see if he could make Elizabeth love him, and he knew from Lady De Bourgh's lecture to him about Elizabeth's evilness, that Elizabeth must have cared for him. Elizabeth insists that he only came to love her because she did not try to please him. She tells him &quot;You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.&quot; She is still embarrassed by the way that she misjudged him from the beginning. He is just as embarrased of his first proposal to her and his behavior toward her until that proposal. Since both Jane and Elizabeth have been proposed to, the entire neighborhood hears of the engagements, and both Elizabeth and Jane recieve congratulations. This is my favorite chapter because this is where all the conflicts are resolved, and thus begins a happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group. I recommend this book to whoever is interested in reading it. There is no violence, or any misconduct. The only thing mainly talked about was of love and the social class differences in the 19th century. One literary device that I appreciated is called allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings, and events stand for abstract and moral concepts. An example of this is the distinction people made in social classes. We can see this clearly in the way Mrs. Bennet desperately wanted her daugters to marry rich men, but Elizabeth wanted to marry for love. This moral concept shows readers that money, even though it has a great effect on many people, does not buy true love. I believe it has been one of the best books I have read so far. It was a beautiful, yet confusing love story. My favorite chapter was Chapter 18 from Volume 3. In this chapter Elizabeth and Darcy resolve the unanswered question of their relationship. Darcy had come with Bingley to Longbourn to see if he could make Elizabeth love him, and he knew from Lady De Bourgh's lecture to him about Elizabeth's evilness, that Elizabeth must have cared for him. Elizabeth insists that he only came to love her because she did not try to please him. She tells him &quot;You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.&quot; She is still embarrassed by the way that she misjudged him from the beginning. He is just as embarrased of his first proposal to her and his behavior toward her until that proposal.

I thought that was really hilarious because it determined that Mrs. Bennet just wanted her daughters to marry her no matter what.I think this book is appropriate for teenagers like me who could understand the meaning of the book, and in some situations be connected with the characters. It relates to me because just like Elizabeth didn't marry because of the money, I know that when I marry, I'm going to marry for true love not because of the wealth the man I marry has.A literary device that I appreciate was that Jane Austen used imagery. She helped her readers feel as if we were with the characters. For example when Jane was sick, Elizabeth went to visit her on foot trails and she arrived with soaked and dirty stockings to the house.I like this novel because it made me realize that you should not judge a person with out knowing them. I recommended this book to anyone who enjoys reading love and realistic characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought that this book was a great book. I liked the characters and also the plot. My favorite chapter was chapter ten of volume three. This chapter is about Mrs. Gardiner writing to Elizabeth and telling her about what Mr. Darcy did for his sister. This letter showed Elizabeth Darcy's true character and how much he really cared for her. I think that because of the letter Elizabeth was able to confirm the feelings she had towards Mr. Darcy.This book is appropriate for teenagers and up because Pride and Prejudice has characters with these ages. Elizabeth, Jane and also the Darcy's and the Bingley's were around their twenties. Elizabeth younger sisters were teenagers. The other characters were around their thirties, forty's, fifty's and maybe sixties. Their actions and some of the events that happened with them can be related to some of the things that sometimes happen to us.A literary device that it is used in the story is allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings and events stand for abstract or moral concepts. Allegorical references are made towards the moral issue of marriage when the Bennett family is disgraced because Lydia has run away with Wickham without the benefit of marriage.I really liked this book because I was able to picture in my mind everything that was going on in the story. Jane Austen is able to bring images and pictures to my mind because she was descriptive, and she also used long dialogues for the characters. I liked the romances and misunderstandings about the main characters because it made the story interesting and it made me wonder what was going to happen in the next chapter. I enjoyed reading the story and also learned about some problems which women confronted in the 19th century such as entailment, which was the main conflict of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far one of the best books that I have read in high school. The meaning of the title, Pride and Prejudice, is present throughout the novel. The main characters portray the meaning of the title. It was a must that they, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, marry, but their pride and prejudice were keeping these two characters apart temporarily. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are so different, yet so similar. Pride is one of the main barriers that creates an obstacle to Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. Darcy's pride in his position in society keeps him from interacting with anyone outside his society, which includes Elizabeth. Elizabeth's initial prejudice against Darcy is rooted in pride of her own judgment of people. She was very proud in her ability to judge people by their first impression. But these characters were able to overcome their flaws and realize they were destined for each other.My favorite chapters are chapter 12 and 13 in volume II. I like these chapters because this is where Darcy reveals the truth to Elizabeth and Elizabeth begins to analyze Darcy's actions. Darcy explains the reasons why he prevented Bingley from marrying Jane and the reason why Darcy and Wickham dislike each other. Thereafter, Elizabeth realized the she judged Darcy completely wrong and that her vanity has been the cause of her prejudice. This is the chapter where both Elizabeth and Darcy realize their faults and it is also the turning point in the novel.This novel would be appropriate for people 15 years and older. It does not have a complex plot, and the reader is able to evaluate each character after carefully reviewing their role in Pride and Prejudice.One literary device that I appreciated was the way Jane Austen revealed the personality of each character. Jane Austen revealed the characters through letters, and revealing the character's effect on others. I liked the way Jane Austen used indirect characterization, which forced the reader to use his/her own judgment, thus putting clues together to figure out the personality of each character.I enjoyed this novel and I recommend it to others. Throughout this novel one is able to see the flaws of people regardless of social standings. People from all social levels are alike-they are all PROUD. Therefore, one is able to conclude that human happiness is found by living a life in accordance with human dignity, which is a life in accordance with virtue. Human dignity and virtues go hand in hand, happiness is found in human dignity which is found in virtue, and together anybody could over come it, like Darcy and Elizabeth did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far one of the best books that I have read in high school.

The emotion and attachment set to the characters of such novels is fully upheld and boundaries of literature appreciation are exceeded with the reading of Pride and Prejudice. The essence of a classic novel that can stand the tests of time is displayed in this masterpiece of Jane Austen. Wit and one liners by the ever enjoyable Mr. Bennet reminds you of your favorite uncle, while the observant eye of Elizabeth Bennet reminds you of friend you always wished to have as she takes a stand on the dullness of humdrum society, constantly giving something to ponder and test the limits. This satire on nineteenth century Europe has a wonderful approach, allowing some periods of a curved brow that silently screams in agreement with our heroine, Elizabeth, all occuring between a chuckle of amusement that is often choked by a surprise twist of the storyline of the other well illustrated characters. This novel is recommended for the modern day romantics who would appreciate a played story of hard-to-get; for the everlastining realist who loves the power felt when a opinion and lifestlye is presented against the grain of normality; and finally, for the everyday classical reader who can ever remember a time where self-pride has made a place, only to be broken by the realization that prejudice is only what sets people apart. A classic situaion in our heterogeneous society where everyone carries a pride-filled opinion of our surroundings, forgetting that individually we make up the prejudiced society. Gradual and humble realization is to follow, as in the likewise case of Miss Bennet, while the timeless saga and appreciation of Pride and Prejudice continues..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While I had many high expectations for this novel, they were all far exceeded when I actually picked up the book and read it -- and then could not put it down. Jane Austen's wit and charm constantly present throughout this story make it quite possible to laugh out loud. At a time when marriages were to go not beyond political correctness and money, Austen writes about the Bennett family, whose 5 daughters are all meant to find these advantageous lifestyles. While Mrs. Bennett is on a hurried and frantic quest to marry off each of her daughters, the two eldest, Elizabeth and Jane, are each on a journey of finding their true loves, whether they first realize that at meeting them or not. The plot line keeps entertainment and holds captive attention, and the twists and turns of this novel keep the reader coming back for more. It has my highest recommendation -- so go out and read it today!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to say that Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I have ever read...and I have read a LOT! I think the first time I picked it up was back in 6th grade. I loved it then, but how much does a sixth grader really get out of it? Reading it again for my English class opened my eyes to some of the more subtle humor and details Austen includes in her witty satire of Regency England's society and customs, particularly those dealing with marriage. Perhaps one of the reasons I liked this novel so much was-it wasn't a \\"fluff\\" romance. I admit, I love romances, but this one surpasses them all, simply because it has sustenance. It has a fully-developed plot, well-thought-out characters, etc. It is thought-provoking and at the same time, a fun read.The heroine of the novel, Elizabeth Bennet, is intelligent, witty, and-of course-prejudiced. Mr. Darcy, the proud hero, epitomizes the saying, \\"Appearances can be deceiving.\\" Lizzie's journey to true love is fraught with obstacles-some of her own making and some due to her matchmaking mama; her indulgent, sarcastic, and perhaps at times insensitive father; her love-lorn older sister; and two boy-crazy younger sisters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was an extremely funny story. The funniest parts were when Mr. Darcy said he would consider Elizabeth a beauty as soon as he would consider her mother a wit. Not that her mother is totally stupid or anything. They were the two best characters in the book. Mr. Bennet is funny too at the begging when he sayd he is not going to go talk to Mr. Bingley and he does. He is one of the most likable or I should say 'agreeable' characters in the book. Why does my review have to come last?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of those books that I just keep coming back to over and over. Austen has spun an very romantic love story with this one, but it is much more than that. Her social commentary is biting and true, even for today's standards. Her dialogue, though that of over 100 years ago, still sounds true and real. The plot keeps you reading so you forget that this is a classic, and just enjoy it for the story and the beauty of the language. On of my favorites, and one I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was Jane Austin's best work. This was the first of the Jane Austn books i ever read and it got me hooked on oall the others...The relationship between Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth is s romantic it almost makes you wish you could be there in Pemberly and Netherfield..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently bought &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; for my daughter. She didn't want to read it, so I did. As I dug right into it, I realized that my daughter, being only ten years old, was probably still a little young for it anyway. In fact, it was tough enough for me...Well, at least I can admit it.It amazes me that some books, such as this one written almost 200 years ago, are filled with such style and prose. It seems that in our modern day world, with our stereos, TV's, computers and toys, that many of us unfortunately, don't seem to have the time to broaden our vocabulary, and grammatical abilities as well as some did 200 years ago. I guess,.. in some ways, we have certainly regressed in the natural progression of our intellects. Interesting ... It does make you want to read more books that were written long ago,..and broaden your mind a tad.This was an interesting book, although a little slow at times; probably because of the huge gap in our cultural differences. I can see why it could possibly be considered a bit out of sync with the world of today. The book displayed what now would be considered an imbedded chauvinistic society's way of thinking; young women sitting around all day with the most important thing on their minds being, &quot;Who's going to come courting me today?&quot; But, I don't think that was any of Jane Austen's fault.All in all, it was a very well organized and written story of life and mannerisms of old British Regency."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was assigned this book for my AP Literature class and the grunts and groans running through the room were audible. A comedy of manners at first seemed like it would be no comedy at all. From what others had told me, Jane Austen had always been lumped with that group of 19th century authors to avoid at all costs.I couldn't have been more wrong. Jane Austen is delightfully humorous and the sarcastic humor that underlies the characters of Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bennett rounds out the book and the characters themselves. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennett is an intelligent young woman stuck in the early 19th century. And while she is resigned to fitting the role of young women at the time, she is also able to see the silliness by which other girls govern their lives, and though she does nothing to warrant it, the reader automatically places her above the others. She contains all the elements of a charming protagonist as she is honest, intelligent and witty all at the same time.I loved Mr. Darcy, as well, on his first appearance. Admittedly he was haughty and conceited but from first sight Elizabth begins to chip away at his pride, though she frequently refuses to give him so much as a word. Reading the back cover I thought this was going to be a typical romance story, but it wasn't that either. Despite many other 'romances', the one the reader really wants to see is held off time and time again, and by the last few pages it feels like it may never come about.This is definitely worth reading and is above the ruin that college discussions will often cause."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was with wonderful anticipation that I sat down with Jane Austen's seminal work, Pride and Prejudice. I had previous knowledge of Jane Austen only as a giant of Western literature, but I resolved to read her work after seeing the delightful Emma Thompson movie Sense and Sensibility. I briefly entertained the notion of reading the novel Sense and Sensibility, but decided instead upon Pride and Prejudice. Mainly because Pride and Prejudice is widely considered to be the better book, but also because I wanted to read one of Austen's works that I had no previous familiarity with the characters and plot. I can happily say that this book has awakened within me a voracious beast of a reader who has every intent of devouring every Austen novel he can get his hands on. It is a testament to Austen's incredible prowess as a writer that she is able to breathe life into a historical period that 21st century readers are far removed from, and by the end of the book you have come to look upon Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy, not as the heroine and hero of a book 200 years old, but as completely fleshed out characters who could exist in any time, in any novel. The reader comes to understand their joys, their pain, their defeats, and their ultimate triumph, as if these emotions were his own. The hallmark of all great literature is an ability to awaken in the reader a true sense of understanding for what the characters are thinking and feeling, and that is certainly the case in this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book recently as an SSR book for my Honors World Lit class. I'm a sophmore in high school. I found this book very interesting, although it was a bit hard to translate at times. I would recommend the book for any teens who want to read a challenging classic. :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know, I know. How could I have let 19 years of my life pass by without reading this classic and constantly-alluded to novel? Yes, I delayed reading it for far too long, but it did not disappoint my anticipated expectations.In the opening chapters of the novel I was *gasp* - bored with the plot and characters. I was blasphemously thinking, &quot;Why has everyone made such a hype about this book for the past century or so? It's just a bunch of prissy girls wasting their lives away by waiting around on parties, dates, and personal Prince Charmings to whisk them away&quot;.However, as the novel went on, Austen's prowess at prose whisked me away, and I was totally intrigued. The Victorian world was opened up to me, and I tossed all former feminist theories momentarily aside as I became immersed in this setting, yearning for that time and place, where icould have lived like a princess and been loved by all, simply for being born female.I loved Austen's depiction of the relationship between Elizabeth and Jane, and I saw the closeness of my own relationship with my sister reflected in it. I was amused by Mary's disgust in boys and her blatant disregard for most people. Lucy and Kitty's attempts to capture the eyes and hearts of possible suitors were timeless characterizations of so many girls, at that time period and today. Most of all, I loved Mr. Bennett's sense of humor, and his remarks (especially those directed toward Mrs. Bennet) made me laugh out loud throughout the book.Count me in: I am the newest Jane Austen fan, and the one who deserves to receive the Procrastinator of the Century award for waiting so long to read her. For any of you who are putting off reading her like I did, there words of advice: do it, now. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Mrs. Bennet was a simple woman, with but one goal in life: to get her daughters married. She went about this task in a dedicated manner, pouncing on every man that comes by, from nobles to officers. Marriage was the only option for a respectable girl and the husband had to be chosen with care. We usually automatically make the assumption that the love and marriage go hand in hand. But at one time a marriage was thought of as a business transaction. Wealth and social standing were thought of first and foremost, love and happiness could come afterward. Any wealthy bachelor was \\"considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\" Elizabeth Bennet thought she knew better, for a happily ever after there had to be love and understanding. We follow her misadventures in search of happiness with a range of comical characters from her assertive, matchmaking mother to her arrogantly, meek cousin. Marriage, it seems, is more than both an economic decision and an emotional rush. We are given examples of each of these extremes through Elizabeth's sisters. Through this and Austen's humor and wit, we are given a delightful satire of the British matrimonial arrangements."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"it is a nice book for all age group."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this back when I was in Jr. High and fell head over heels in love with Jane Austen, with her sparkling wit and lively characters. Now, I am a college English major and after reading hunderds of books, I can safley say that this is still among my favorites. It is a classic story and an easy read in my mind, at least. The charcters of Lizzy and Darcy are among my favorite in all of literature.But after reading all the reviews on this site, I have became convinced that this is a book that does not belong in American High Schools. I had some of my friends read it in High School and they all loved it. I can only assume that we went to a batter HS or something, as every other bad review on this site (in fact, almost all the classic book reviews) it from some poor High School student who has never read a book over 200 pages in their life, doesn't know anything about literature ( I was laughing out loud at the \\"facts\\" presented in some of the 1 star reviews) and is just upset that they have to take time away from being spoon-fed things to pick up a book and think. It distresses me that we have become such a culture that we chide cultured books like this for not having sex and then turn around and call it a \\"soap opera\\" (anyone who has ever seen a soap opera and then read this book knows that there is no comparison between the two--for one, no soap opera writer has Austen's wit, her intellegence, her perception of the human condition).So, to potential buyers--it is a light, comic work that you shouldn't have to think about (don't believe the negative reviews--there is nothing deep in this) and I'm sure you will enjoy it, if you have a respect for art and a bit of intellegence. It is one of the best ove stories ever told. And if you are going to write a negative review, try not to make yourself look like an idiot in the process."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time! Although it was written about 2 centuries ago, it doesn't matter because it tells a timeless and believable story. All 5 Bennet daughters need to find husbands, preferably rich ones. How they go about it and how Elizabeth learns to love Mr. Darcy is absolutely fascinating, not only because of the way it is told, but because it shows people as they really are when something important is at stake. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm not sure what can be helpfully added to the 487 prior reviews of P&amp;P but I enjoyed this one so much that I must try. This is a fantastic work and should be the textbook for aspiring novelists' Storytelling 101 class. Austin's ability to create compelling characters that leap off the page and to maneuver them through an intelligent, gripping narrative is amazing. Despite the passage of 200 years, her characters resonate with their timeless flaws and virtues. I particularly enjoyed the snippets of intelligent, wry humor from both Elizabeth Bennett and, most notably, from her father Mr. Bennett. I finished the book on an airplane and struggled to stifle laughs.As an aside, the BBC/A&amp;E 5-6 hour version of P&amp;P is the best film adaptation of a classic book that I have ever seen and is well worth the time investment."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The plot is intriguing: an assembly of eligible men take short-term residence in a town full of unmarried women. As a result, several couples pair off and a few marry. The novel is concerned primarily with one couple: Eliza and Darcy.Obstacles prevent these two from seeing each other's worth. Darcy at first thinks Eliza possesses no great share of beauty. He is prejudiced and only sees her as a product of her class. But by gazing through the windows to her soul - her dark eyes - he slowly becomes fascinated by this enthralling beauty.Eliza, proud herself, will not accept the advances of a haughty, cold man like Darcy. Instead, she offers her affections to a bright-colored soldier, who possesses pleasing manners to match her own. But experience teaches her that a cool temper can hide love, and pleasing manners can mask cruelty.Appearances are deceiving, and lessons are hard learned in Pride and Prejudice, a light romance, occasionally skirting the depths of human psychology."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being a 20 something male, I was not sure what to think when I picked up this novel. I knew that girls had always loved this book, so I set myself up for a girlie novel. Elizabeth, the protaganist, is anything but a simple girlie character though. This book attacks the social structure of Austen's days. The characters are deep and well written. Some are characatures for comic relief, but you still come away with the feeling that you have known someone like that in the past. This book is a classic for a reason. I recommend this book to anyone, not just love sick teenage girls."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Is she proud and he prejudice? Maybe it is he who is proud and she who is prejudice? Despite the arguments that could be made both ways, Jane Austen does indeed do an excellent job in bringing together two people of such different moral standing and ensnare them in a delightful and romantic story.The heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a witty, presumptuous young lady with an uncontrollable urge to speak her mind. Her antagonist is the very wealthy and very blatant Mr. Darcy, who has his own ideas about how certain people should act and behave. So how can two people so wrong for each other and so different ever be brought together?Elizabeth finds herself alone with Mr. Darcy on many awkward occasions and always manages to say something to hurt his precious ego. I think it is absolutely amazing how he can fall in love with a woman who has nothing but utter disdain for him and everything he stands for. She is, however, an amazing woman.Elizabeth is caring and considerate and very much eager to be in love, although she sometimes hides it well. She has the utmost affection for her family, and especially for her older sister, whose heart she would gladly do anything to keep from breaking.In Mr. Darcy&#65533;s defense, he is a very well rounded gentleman. He has the highest and most prestigious upbringing. However, he lets his social status and wealth dictate his heart and cause him to spiral into a soul searching debate over love verses social standing.The entire story leaves the reader captivated and in agony, ready to flip to the end to see if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth truly find love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" Thus begins the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen. Written nearly two centuries ago, the novel still seems fresh and new owing to its radiance of wit and uncanny sense of candor. The characters are quirky, at times satirical. However, their actions and concerns mirror those of our own. Should we value property, position and esteem over virtue and principle? Should we forgo all romantic notions of love and marriage and instead be practical and settle for material wealth and security? These are questions the characters in this novel ask themselves and each other. It is a comedy of manners, but also, a story about young people trying to make rational and intelligent choices, pulled this way and that by their morals, their conscience, and often, their mothers.At the center of the story are Elizabeth Bennet, an intelligent and opinionated young woman, and Mr. Darcy, a proud, haughty gentleman. They meet and almost immediately, dislike each other - Elizabeth because she finds Mr. Darcy incredibly proud and completely lacking in humor; Mr Darcy because he thinks Elizabeth and her family are beneath his station in life. But one cannot help who one loves, and Mr. Darcy eventually feels great admiration for her. Elizabeth, on the other hand, realizes that she has been too quick to judge, and begins to look upon Mr. Darcy with some measure of interest. What follows is a delicate waltz of flirtation and witty repartee. We the readers, 21st century get-up-and-go, can't-stop-for-a-minute workaholics, then have the bucolic pleasure of bearing witness as to which will melt away first in the warmth of true affection - Mr. Darcy's pride, or Ms. Bennet's prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic detailed description of the problems faced in olden day England regarding women, enchanted my mind immediately from the books first sentence.

If you haven't read it already, you'll want to pick it up."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Bennet sisters Elizabeth and Jane are of age to court and find a spouse. Elizabeth find one person in particular that she will never court, Fitzwilliam Darcy, or will his charming ways find their way into her heart.This book is suppose to be humorous. I did not find anything funny or remotely interesting, well until Darcy came along. In all truthness I can not see how this book has gotten so many other books based on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth. I don't get it. I wish I did. I wanted to like this so much more than I did. All I could see the book is about is dancing and gossip. It reminds me of a older version of Seinfeld because it was about nothing. I did not give diddly squat about anybody in this book. Yes it is written pretty and well done but I had no connection to the people.You are probably wondering why I would give any stars if I dislike it so much but the truth is certain moments caught my attention and as I said it is written pretty. I only thought it to be okay maybe a little less than that."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Not my type of book. I read it all tho. But would not purchase it or a similiar one again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I did not read the book. I want this book off my kindle. I am getting very angry. very angry."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In the book Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen the story circles around the whole idea of marriage, and reputation. Everyone in the novel wants to find love, and marry someone. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her five daughters to find husbands and she makes it \\"The business of her life\\" (Austen, pg 5) to get her daughters married. Throughout the novel the characters must cope with the issues of pride and wealth in their community and in turn deal with the pressures of marrying into a good family.Mr. Bingley, who is a wealthy man, is very attracted to Jane, the eldest daughter. They dance at the ball and she believes that he is the right man for her. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's friend, does not want to dance with Elizabeth, Jane's sister, because she isn't part of the same social class as Mr. Darcy. This makes him seem very arrogant. However, as the novel progresses Mr. Darcy sets aside his prejudice, and actually starts to fall for Elizabeth. Elizabeth starts to realize that she actually has feelings for Mr. Darcy. She understands that she isn't as rich as Mr. Darcy, and that she does not come from the same world as him. Elizabeth looks past the arrogance she once saw in Mr. Darcy, and learns to love him regardless.Elizabeth's younger sister elopes with Officer Wickham, and the family is ashamed. Elizabeth fears that their pride may be ruined. Even though the two are happy together the family acts callously towards the couple because they do not think that Wickham is good enough for her, and she would be better off with someone from a high social class.Jane and Mr. Bingley get engaged and everyone is happy again. Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth about Mr. Darcy's intentions on marrying her, and that she should say no. Lady Catherine does not think that Elizabeth is worthy of her nephew because he is so wealthy, and she is just average. Elizabeth says that she isn't going to throw away her happiness, and accepts when Mr. Darcy proposes.The book was very well written but the plot was a little boring and goes back and forth too much. I felt that all anyone really cared about was whether or not they were going to get married. I thought that the way the characters spoke, and how the actual words were written were very eloquent, and made a simple phrase sound beautiful. I feel like what the author was saying could have been said in fewer words, and she could have condensed it into a shorter novel.I also liked how Elizabeth didn't give into Mr. Darcy right away and she stood her ground, yet Mr. Darcy did not give up on Elizabeth. She thought that he was very arrogant but then once she got to know him she actually appreciated him.Because the book focuses mainly on the subject of marriage, and love, only certain people may find enjoyment and entertainment in it. I don't believe that this novel was written for one specific age group, and could be read by many different ages. I think that young adults might enjoy the novel the best, because it deals with finding love. Again, the book was very well written, but a little too repetitive."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Miss Elisabeth Bennet is a very witty, ironically and independent woman. She is the opposite of Mr. Darcy. He embodies the modern, educated and pride person of the upper class. She is full of prejudices against his behaviour. It is a story of resentment and misunderstanding. The first impression of a person is a constant picture which you carry along with you. It takes time to get rid of it and so does Elisabeth. Jane Austen takes this picture to develop her story. The reader follows the view of Elisabeth in the whole story to the rear end. During the elopement of Elisabeth younger sister Lydia she realises that Mr. Darcy is not the kind of person she always thought of. Her change of mind takes place in the off. The reader is not familiar with it because Elisabeth rejects the love of Mr. Darcy every time. You feel astonished in the end when you hear what she reveals to Jane.The novel is characterised as a battle of words. There is no much description of the setting or the social class in the nineteenth century. It concentrates on the feelings and situations of the characters. Chatting all over, I think it is the typical pastime of every girl. The book is full of these situations. It is about love, envy, parties and what is hot in town."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted so badly to love one the classic romances of all time, but couldn't. I found the story incredibly dated. I was able to get past the archaic use of vocabulary, but not the lack of plot. Most of this lengthy novel is about idle English gentry socializing at each others homes. I had nearly decided to give up on finishing the book, when it picked up a little in the final third. I read the free Kindle edition. While the formatting is not as good as with paid editions, it is perfectly adequate. I can't see any reason to get one of the paid versions, unless you are an Austen fan who wants the collected works organized with an active T.O.C."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a classic and a must read for everyone. Its a perfect book for students in school to read. I love the love/hate relationship between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I couldn't let my piont of view opinionate this classic story, as I only saw the theater production. But as a body of the human race I'll say this, fall in love with it, become obsessed with it, just don't believe it. We would all wish to be the Elizabeth, but her character had no realism to one of us the real characters of this world.And so dream for your Darcy, Hope for your marrage but never contemplate life to be a script, you only get one rehersal in this life time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There is no wonder why this was the story You've Got Mail was based on! I also agree that Colin Firth himself is worth watching the movie, but the fact that it is so true to the novel is incredible! Trust me, if more stars were available, I'd use them. Austen is awesome!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I also saw the movie first and I was so impressed. You can read thic book regardless of your age, sex, and interest. This book is always in my mind after I have finished reading this book and I really adrmire Jane Austen. I think I became a fan of Jane Austen's. I also read Emma and Sense &amp; Sensibility but I think this is much better than that. Also you must see the movie. Though it is 8hours long, you won't regret at all. I promise."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book and I think it is absolutely Wonderful. Jane Austen is so original in her style of writting, I enjoyed it completely. I would recommend Pride and Prejudice to any literate I know."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A story of timeless romance between a woman and a man who cared not a fig for each other to begin with. Oddly humble and oddly fun to read! But then again, I did get bored at times, but pass that, this book was a delight."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the most interesting Jane Austen book I have read. I must confess that Emma bored me, and although I liked Sense and Sensability, it is nothing in comparison to Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen does a wonderful job of developing her characters. By the end of the book, one becomes acquainted with them. I am always sorry when I come to the last page of the book, and there is no more to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"DONT'T KNOW WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT IT.BUT ONCE YOU START YOU CAN'T STOP"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For those of you who think that this book is boring that just means you arn't educated enough to understand it.And no I am not an adult. I am 15 years old and I loved this book so much. I have seen the movie to with Colin Firth who is so fine. And he has the most beautiful smile.But if you don't know the meaning of vex you shouldn't be juding a intelligent book"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book. I felt that I was right there in jolly old England. As I was reading it, I was aware that it was written so long ago, yet, it is just as appealing today, perhaps more so. To be able to write such a story and to have it endure is truly to be gifted."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really love this book , and i have watched this for many times ( i think at least 7 times ) ."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this story! It has a great plot. It is a little hard to understand at first, but once you get deeper into the book it gets easy to understand. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You can see from all angles in this book...and then you just want to tell them to express their feelings!! The end is so amazing..how it all comes together, when you almost lose hope it all pulls together. A wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A very well written work. Pride and Prejudice is a novel you would want to read again and again. I love the idea of romantic notions--- love letters, unexpected meetings, and 'false hateful feelings.' It's a must have... Jane Austen is one of a kind!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. It's such a good read. You will absolutely love the characters, I guarantee it. Elizabeth is such a refreshing heroine, not simpery or weak or stupid but smart and funny and all that stuff. The book itself is hilarious. The funniest scene is the one where Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth. It's priceless. Anyway, if you've read Emma and hated it, DO NOT let that keep you from reading this, because they are totally different and this one is worlds better. I highly highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had a lot of fun reading Pride and Prejudice. That is the kind of novel made mostly for intertainment, but it certainly inform us about how people behaved in the old times and what were life perspectives for a girl. Jane Austin was also a master in capturing and describing peoples mind."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must say that Pride and Prejudice is my absolutely favorite book. I have worn out two copies of the BBC/A&amp;E version taped off my t.v. during the broadcasts. I bought the &quot;official&quot; video tapes recently and was estatic to find that this version had 30+ new scenes or parts of scenes. You have one very happy P &amp; P fan."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Pride and Prejudice movie is the best movie along with the book I've ver read and seen. I did'nt think that the movie would stay so close to the dialogue and story. I think Jennifer Ehle is the just the perfect Elizabeth[ pretty, intelligent and witty] and I cant imajine that she is anyone else and Colin Firth- Mr Darcy is everything I'd imajined him to be. I loved all the characters including Mr Collins and have seen this movie 4 times. I was so upset when it finished I wish Jane Austen had written a sequal. If U haven't seen the movie go to the video store and rent it now!! You'll love it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice would have to be the best book i've ever read in my whole entire life. I just totally fell in love with Elizabeth and Mr Darcy and all the other characters Jane, Kitty, Mr and Mrs Bennet. I think Elizabeth is the perfect role model for all women. I loved her because she's witty, stubborn, polite yet intelligent and gentle, I mean what a woman! I've read the book 7 times and cant get enough of it.The BBC adaptation of the book was brilliant Jennifer Ehle was the perfect Elizabeth and Colin Firth was the perfect Mr Darcy, both were exactly how I'd imagined the characters to be like. I would recommend this book to everyone of all ages because although it was written in the 1813 it's characters are truly hip. It is just the coolest book, I LUVE IT!."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is wonderful. Pride and Prejudice was a joy to read. I had the worst nights' sleep this past week because I truly couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This has to be my favorite Austen book, and my favorite heroine, ever. Elizabeth Bennett is intelligent, witty, and strong, the kind of woman that all women should aspire to be like. The fact that her counterpart, Mr. Darcy, values all of these qualities in her makes it one of the most romantic, yet unassuming stories ever told. The BBC video production is also excellent, and really captures the essence of the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely love the book and the movie. I was so sad when both were over. Throughout the book, I was wishing Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to get together. He was so wonderful. It was so much fun to see the ways that they both developed as people and how Mr. Darcy finally came around to being a decent guy. I just fell in love with him, right along with Elizabeth. In the BBC version of the novel, the adorable Colin Firth plays Darct to a tee. He was exactly the way I imagined him to be. And, of course there's the sweet and stubborn Elizabeth, whom I really enjoyed. Overall, if you haven't read the book by now -- go get a copy!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I decided to purchase this book after I watch the movie, to be honest, the movie is somewhat more entertaining than reading the book, the landscape is best describe in the movie. I need an extra effort to read every line in the book, word by word. Maybe my perception would be different if I read the book first, then see the movie."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was a required book in high school English. Thank God for Cliff Notes, because this is the book that taught thousands of young men to hate reading.This summer, I forced my way through the book, because I wanted to understand what was so great about it. I discovered it was GREAT to finish the book. Don't give this book to a kid to encourage reading.This book was clearly written for a different time. Chapter upon chapter of utter tedium conveying precious little to the course of the story. However, in that tedium was character development worthy of study by would be writers. Maybe that's why we were supposed to read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Most of the reviews I read (I had a big project to do)that were negative were from people who said &quot;Yeah, the book was like, really hard and stuff. And it was long.&quot; I found that these people just didn't understand it. So basically, don't pay attention to these people. :) It took me a while to get through Pride and Prejudice for an AP English project. I agree with other reviewers that it was extremely well written. However, I found the storyline to be rather transparent. It's not a novel to read if you want a deep, insightful book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Purchase is a big word as it was free but after trying to get it in my Kindle with 2 different technicians at Amazon we could never do it. Hopefully will be able to on a 3rd try."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"should have given it only 1 star, but since it is a well liked classic and i'd actually like to save the flames, i'd make it a two. i've read this book 2 times. the 1st time i got to the 40th page, the 2nd time i finished it. i tried to understand, i really did...fine, i didnt. but this story is just so plain un appealing. you spend the whole book hooked on elizabeth bennett and mr darcys' [silly] love affair. it would actually be better if the two fine main characters did not live their lifes in complete fluffness.the love lifes of a group of [silly] and giggling girls and the 'dashing' mr darcy, how much more interesting can it get?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This a book dealing with the same topic 300 pages long. It's boring and really longwinded, too longwinded in my opinion. Always the same people, the same stories, the same places the whole time. Every page you expect an end but it doesn't end. It just continous with the same things before for another 100 pages. Although you expect an end you aren't really interested in it. When you finishes the book you just have fogotten what you've read at the beginning of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The common comment on this book, seems to be people's love for the ... &quot;love&quot; story. Mr Darcy, and Elizabeth, how great it is to see them together. Howevor Jane Austin is not a Romantic novelist. Her intent was to criticize her generation. She was in a way, poking fun at people's prejudice. This book is actual considered an &quot;ironic comedy.&quot; The comedy I can not see, but the irony is definately blinding. The part of this book that bothers me, is not so much within the book itself, but the point of the book. If someone was truly in hatred of their society, noticing the flaws relentlessly, why spend 62 chapters of their life, writing about it? I personally felt that this book, could be summed up in less than four pages, with the same amount of content being delivered, the same lessons being learned."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"jane austen is the most manly woman i've never met. her books are full of the kind of intricate analyses that i've only ever found in men, like myself, and have never observed in women, even women supposedly very smart, with all the benefits of formal education, indeed, even phd's from such places as harvard and berkeley. women, however smart they may be, always fall back on intuition when confronted with perplexing problems. even when their intuitions are completely impotent. i've had women tell me that they \\"thought\\" the economy was on the edge of deep recession because their \\"intuitions\\" told them so. or who said they \\"thought\\" a new business venture was destined to fail because they had an \\"intuition\\" about it. yet, when pressed for further \\"reasons\\", they were able to elaborate no further.so it is against such a background that i approached ms austen. and having read p&p; and mansfield park i am truly astonished that a woman wrote these books. certainly, the subject matter betrays a woman's concerns. yet, she must have been a rare woman who could patiently analyze and untangle the thoughts and actions of so many confused characters, who could resist the feminine temptation to jump to easy intuitive conclusions. i am amazed. would that there were just a few jane austens in this world. or lizzie bennetts, even. but alas, the world positively teems with lydia and kitty bennetts - and mrs bennetts! sigh."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Such a book with themes such as reputation and class horribly expressed. The main conflict was worthless to begin with. Perhaps its just my tastes, seeing that every other reviewer gave this book 5 stars, I might as well, for the book's sake, give this book 2 stars.One word for you: Redundant!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently read Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, for a project in my AP English Class. I enjoyed the novel, and thought it fairly funny. The novel begins with Mrs. Bennet, who is earnestly searching husbands for her two eldest daughters, Jane and Elizabeth. The arrival of Charles Bingley, a wealthy bachelor, is an exciting prospect. She thus proceeds to set her daughter Jane up with him, and in the course of events, her other daughter, Elizabeth, falls in love with Mr. Bingley's friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy. The novel seems to lack; however, a more serious plot. The main themes are love, public status, and class, all of which seem to me rather less important in the scheme of things. All throughout the novel, the reader's main motivation to finish the novel is the unveiling of the fate of Elizabeth and Darcy. While the characters are very interesting and well structured, I feel the novel lacks a serious plot line. I believe the novel to be more of a gossip based story rather than a classic. I would not recommend this novel to others."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have watched the three versions of P&P on TV/Movies and loved them. So now I wanted to read the book. So far I am loving it also."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The story took you back to old England, loves lost and loves restored. I would recommend this to men and women."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book finally. I had seen the movie and the play. I enjoyed it very much and will be looking for Sense and Sensibility next."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Some things were harder to understand however I really liked the use of 3 different possible loves and how they played out. I'm planning on reading it a second time after others have been read"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I so enjoy Miss Austen' s lively characters. She does a masterful job of showing me a picture of life during this era - both the serious and the absurd."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought it was a good book, but definitely a hard read. I had to read it for school. And I thought it was a great love surely and I liked how the women rolled were powerful."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Beautiful, classic story. The descriptive language brings to mind romance, fancy balls and gallantry no longer found in this modern age."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is obviously a classic and easy to read. However, the amount of characters is too much to follow and also the author sometimes doesn't let the reader know when a different character is speaking. Which made it a bit frustrating fir the first couple if chapters. Also, I did not feel attached to the characters. Their emotions were held back through the whole book, so when Darcy and Elizabeth finally get together it is not as exciting and heart wrenching as it should be."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great read.

I tried and tried to read it, but it was all nonsensical jibber-jabber. I may try again, but doubt it. It's torture!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am not satisfied with the book\`s cover image. I would have greatly prefered to have the movie image as a cover, since I greatly appreciated the movie, and since we are in the 21 century, were we do not have this kind of image. I would have bought the book if the movie image was featured on it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"WHen I began to read Pride and Prejudice I was told by my best friend that it would be the best book I have ever read. To my dismay, it was not. I found the book utterly boring, and the only good part was at the end. Over two- hundred pages wasted on useless tasteless writing! I read this book in school, and it was a majority consensus in my senior English class that Pride and Prejudice was awful."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"From Becoming Jane to The Jane Austen Book Club, Me and Mr. Darcy toConfessions of a Jane Austen Addict, 2007 was the year of Jane-mania, sucking out whatever satirical bite Austen might have carried two centuries ago and replacing it with syrupy tote bags and cloying t-shirts that allow a girl to declare herself, \\"An Elizabeth in a Darcy-less World\\" or (more chillingly) \\"Property of Mr. Darcy.\\" In all the fervor, the only things overlooked were that Austen's prose is overwritten and dry, her plots torturously dull, and her characters one-dimensional clich&eacute;s."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Imagine being in a world where every girl's main concern is getting married to a handsome, rich man. That's the main point of all the character's in Pride &amp; Prejudice. Pride &amp; Prejudice is about the Bennet's 5 daughters who need to be married off. Unfortunately all of the Bennet women are poor judges of how to act towards men and how the men feel about them. (Both cause many problems in the book.) One person understands, Mr.Bennet, but he seems to kind of humor them and leaves the job of matchmaking to his wife to deal with that. Mr. Bennet did seem to pass on some of his knowledge to the so-called heroine of the book, Elizabeth, a character who seems to be the light at the end of the tunnel for Mr. Bennet. Sadly, at times her wisdom fades and she shows her true colors as a Bennet woman. The main reason that all of the girls (with the exception of Elizabeth) are so silly (as it was put in the book is mostly due to they're mother, Mrs.Bennet. I assure you that Mrs.Bennet will irritate you. Even though she always tries to do the right motherly things or what she things is best for her daugters she causes many problems you may not realize until you finish the book. You can see her ingorance in her first statements which she bases on the fact,&quot;That a single man in possien of good fortune must be in need of a wife.&quot; All in all, I really find the book and the statement above shallow. All though I understand that British society at that time diplayed courting as the top of the list for females, but this book makes women appear as empty-headed, man-hungry, child-like people that bow down to man's and society's every wish. I have found that a lot of British and other classics diplay courting as a high priority, but in other books, like The Inheritance and Little Women there was more on thier mind than finding a husband. I also find this book unrealistic for many reasons, mostly because the complete personality of the charcters change in the blink of an eye. I really feel that this book is not pleasurable to read, though it may benefit you to read it so that you can learn to find the good and bad pionts of a book and compare it to other literature like it or during that time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Everybody talks about the book. No one talks about the reading of this book by the reader, Irene Sutcliffe. I have not listened to the CD, but before I buy this CD, I want to see some review of the vocal delivery.

It's so incredibly boring and stupid!!! It was without a doubt one of the most torturous reading experiences for me. Now, I can appreciate great pieces of classic literature (e.g. Moby Dick, Red Badge of Courage, Gullivers Travels), but this assuredly does not merit to fall within that catagory. It is friviolous and devoid of any real substance. No plot whatsoever. Essentially, it concerns a bunch of smart-aleck, stuck-up self-righteous phonies who try to outdo each other with their sarcastic and smart-aleck remarks. Give me a break, all of you who supposedly like this dull, monotonous, shallow book!! It is utterly beyond my comprehension how in the world this garbage is considered one of the great books of world literature. It is simply a 19th century British version of the Jerry Springer show."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this book is for three kinds of people:1. people who think what so-called \\"classics\\" are all good. Of course, why would such book be called a classic if it isn't good?2. People who are really really old and are adapted to the cultural and period ideas3. people who like fairy-tale-like romantic storiesThat being said, I'm fair to not give this book a one-star. You can bang on the \\"unhelpful\\" button if you like, but I'm only telling the obvious truth.The story is basically about a mother trying to marry her five daughters off to wealthy men, so that she may \\"rest assured\\" on profits. Sounds selfish huh? Well.All the daughters are quite empty-headed and foolish except Elizabeth Bennet, who actually has clever \\"ideas\\" and is quick-witted with her tongue.They flirt around, using clever, humorous, or not-so-clever speeches that establishes each personality of the characters. Kind of like one of those old-fashioned playsI can just imagine Austen while she is writing, it goes something like this: \\"oh those pitful arrogant wealthy people, how I loath them! But it would be very nice to marry to one.\\" The truth is, she wanted to be a feminist, thus the Elizabeth character, but ended up a conservative anyways- women are better off marrying rich guy; rich guys are not only noble as birth, but noble in soul as well; high class people are in general, better than low class people. etc.So how did it end? well, I'm sure you can figure it out. All the girls married to rich-guys, or rich-guy-to-bes, with her main character married to the richest of all- and surprise! The best guy of all. And they all live quite happy.Some people said that they are enchanted by the \\"clever things\\" Elizabeth says. Yeah, they are pretty clever, but honestly, it's pretty much only because of the period difference. I think some pop TV shows' characters' speeches are pretty clever too with their usage of pop culture, I bet Austen can't think of those. WHY? BECAUSE SHE LIVES IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME!!! So why would people hold Elizabeth's speeches higher? Well, you figure it out.Sound like a dumb silly-old love story? well, you got that quite right. This is pretty much what I tell most people who are biased over \\"classics\\": classics may have that time-less fancy feeling with their wording, but story-wise, they are pretty silly and outdated."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"An email solicitation acknowledged me as an International Amazon customer, and invited me to download the Kindle Reader, which I did.However when I tried to download the titles I was advised that they were not available to me in Africa.Amazon knows I am in Africa because my email address and customer details describe my location as being in Africa.So much for not discriminating against the people who live in Africa!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Easy to get on my Kindle and to transport it everywhere.

Her prose is timeless. Her heroine is feisty,gutsey,witty, and unwilling to compromise. Her hero is often misunderstood. Her outcome is delightful.She has not been surpassed in 200 years."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The first time I read Pride and Prejudice I was in seventh grade and I found it difficult to read and of little interest; so when I picked it up again as a senior in high school and discovered its brilliance it came as quite a surprise. I should not have been surprised, however, for any work authored by Jane Austen is bound to be genius. With her witty dialogue that had me laughing out loud and the heartachingly poignant love fiascos that left me in tears of frustration, she successfully turned me into another Darcy fanatic.The characters are timeless-Elizabeth with her candor and brilliance, Darcy with his romantic soul waiting to explode, and Mr. Bennet with his stoic attitude towards the Mrs.-and the plot will never grow old. Even if the book were as long as War and Peace I would not be deterred if I knew I was to be rewarded with the defining moment when Elizabeth returns Darcy's declaration of love. What makes this book what is though is not just the tryst between Elizabeth and Darcy, but the social commentaries Austen makes about the period and all of the outcomes that are swayed by the civilities of society. Clearly a classic that remains just as magical as the day it was written, Pride and Prejudice should be required reading for everyone, boys and girls alike (hey you boys out there might just learn something from Darcy's quiet love approach)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even though Jane Austen might sound stuffy and old fashioned, her enthralling novel Pride and Prejudice is as pleasing today as it was in the 1800's when it was written. The story is all about two girls-Jane and Elizabeth Bennet- and their trials and tribulations in middle-class, snobby English society. Austen uses sophisticated word choices and witty remarks to portray what life was really like, and how everything wasn't always as it seemed. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, finds herself caught up in an elaborate love triangle--involving her sister, Jane, a wealthy, intelligent gentleman named Mr. Charles Bingley, and a plot to tear the two lovers apart. As the story goes on, more and more is revealed about who is responsible for breaking up the budding romance between her sister and Bingley. In the middle of all of this, Elizabeth finds that she has fallen in love with the man that ruined sister's relationship. With a tangled web of lies and deceit, the tale takes a sharp turn from entertaining anecdote to a gripping suspense story. Will she tell her sister who is responsible for the breakup? Will she continue her romance with the man that has made her sister so unbelievably miserable? All in all, the story is a riveting piece of art that shouldn't be taken for granted just because it sounds boring."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen obviously chose the titles to her novels with care, for this book truly is about pride and prejudice, explored through the eyes of the book's main character: Elizabeth Bennett, as well as the rest of the Bennett family, Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte and the upper crust families with which they rub shoulders.Set in the England of King George III, \\"Pride\\" details Elizabeth's coming of age and her exploration of her own romantic nature. As the second eldest of five daughters, and most beloved of her father, Elizabeth is used to being the quickest wit around, and fancies herself an expert of human nature. When Elizabeth finds herself sought after by several men, consecutively, she finds perhaps she isn't quite the expert she'd believed herself to be.Austen is a master of character study, and \\"Pride\\" is certainly no exception, being the finest example of her work. While a romance novel in earnest, Austen never hesitates to ruffles feathers with her quick wit.Characters such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Collins, and Lucas family and, of course, all the Bingleys, provide an excellent assortment of personalities and conflict that Elizabeth must navigate in order to remain true to her nature and find her position in English society of the time.Herself the daughter of a clergyman, Austen was no stranger to the lifestyle of which she wrote, and \\"Pride\\" provides excellent insight into her time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Oh! Can I even say enough about this delightfully wonderful book? I won't give any of the plot away. But, I will say that the tension and the passion between the characters is so strong that it comes through the pages, transcends time and you can relate to it precisely today as readers could a hundred or so years ago. The humor and wit is British, of course, and most of the sentencing isn't used any more; therefore it might be a difficult read for some. I admit I had some hard times getting through it. But it was well worth the effort! And now I read it once a year just so I can relive the pleasure. A good read for anyone. And much advised by me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book because it really grabbed my attention from the beginning. It also kept me away from the fridge for a good while so I skipped out on a lot of fatty snacks. I lost five pounds reading this book. Never mind &quot;The South Beach Diet&quot;. Read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is one of the best books I've ever read. The intricate style Jane Austen used to write this love story made it so the reader was sucked into it in every turn of the page. The way all the characters interact and the vivid picture the book gives on every person helps the reader understand the contents of the story and the reason the main characters act in the manner that they do. Apart from love, this book also has mystery and suspense. The novel never takes the reader to a dead end, but instead takes him/her to a sort of maze where anything can happen. This book is full of twists and turns that keep the reader on his toes and because of its contents dealing with society and its morals on being prejudiced, it is appropriate and a must read for any age group. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; the chapter that interested me the most was chapter 8. In this chapter Elizabeth is taking care of her ill sister when she joins Miss Bingley, Darcy, and Mrs. Hurst and the topic of an acomplished woman arose. In this little dispute of the upper class, a vivid description of an accomplished woman is given where a woman is accomplished when she has mastered all of the fine arts and has read many books. This was my favorite chapter because it gives an insight into the prejudiced mind of the upper class. To them an accomplished woman is one who has mastered the fine arts, but the only people in the 19th century that could afford the classes that helped a woman master anything were the upper class families. In laymens terms the only way for a woman to be considered accomplished was if she was rich and famous. The fine arts that were considered refined were the ones that could not be studied by just anyone and those were the art the upper class studied to feel superior. What made this my favorite chapter was the way Elizabeth reacted during the dispute. Even though she was being put down, she did not say a word to fight back. All she did was listen and let the birds chirp. Her pride was too great to let anyone tell her differently and that's exactly what I liked. Even though she was lower class, she had more respect and pride than the ones that were believed to be high and mighty. This book is appropriate for people of all ages. As long as the person reading understands the meaning of big words, this is a great book for them. This is so because of the morals of the story, and the connection you can make with the present time. This book shows you how and why some people feel superior to others and how in the end, the people they looked down upon ended up being the greatest people they've ever met. As you read this book, you come to realize that what you are learning is priceless and meaningful. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; gives you an insight into a problem facing every average person and, if read right, the solution to being prejudiced. If you haven't read this book, read it, and if you have already read it and understood it, read it to some one who hasn't, or give your book to someone you like or appreciate."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Let me begin by saying that, although I have been an Anglophile since the age of eight (for some strange reason!) not every novel from or about England captures my fancy like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; has, through the years...I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book (and was able to read it in England the second time, which really gave its words and sentiments added significance). What makes it special for me each time I read it is its historical content and reference. For example, the fact that some of the English people of the times spoke so concisely and brilliantly has always been, for me, a mental pleasure. The customs of the day have also appealed to me compared to some of the casual ways exhibited in today's world. (To say I am Victorian at heart would not be wrong...)Although &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; mirrors universal truths and concepts, it is the aura of propriety (sometimes abused and falsely applied, such as in the case of the Reverend Mr. Collins, the pompous Lady Catherine de Burgh, and the haughty Miss Bingley) which I like. Despite their ability to de-nobilize the demeanor of their time, I still enjoy their antics. They serve as a meaningful counterpoint to the serious business of living which drives Elizabeth and her sister Jane to seek more high-minded and worthwhile pursuits. I like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because it illustrates, once more, that &quot;there's always one in every crowd,&quot; that there exist among the civil gentry those who would thwart and turn back and simply congeal to impress (Mr. Collins, again!)In this same vein, Mrs. Bennett serves as the original &quot;stage mother,&quot; constantly pushing her daughters to the forefront of dances and other situations, wanting them to marry well. Yet she consistently annoys and insults those about her so her daughters' chances to &quot;marry well&quot; are minimized almost in direct correlation to her pandering.Mr. Bennett is one of my favorite characters, although he is not as clearly-drawn as most of the others. In him, I see a man of his times, saddled with a silly wife whom he married for looks and not for her intellect, and trying to make the best out of her urgent desires for her daughters' future wealth. In that regard, he is not so much depressed as resigned, a quiet man who keeps to himself but who also acquiesces to his wife because (alas) he still does love her. He is caught by son-less fate to have to cede the home over his family's heads to the Reverend Mr. Collins, a cousin. This causes Mr. Bennett grief but serves the reader as a historical footnote, a sign of the times that, fortunately, has come and gone.Since I have only limited space, I will describe only one more character, Miss Elizabeth Bennett. Amongst these pages, she has such courage, such intelligence, such a command of the English language, and an acute sense of responsibility in all areas of her life. (She is fictional, of course, but I find myself hoping I can someday identify with her - not only that, but she gained the affection of the equally-noble Mr. Darcy!) Elizabeth is the embodiment of cool reserve and ready wit, but she is also quick to comfort. As she stood out among the other characters in this book, so would a real person like her, during those times. The historical perspective of Elizabeth's life is informative, pleasing, and remarkable - a worthy history lesson as well as an entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the work of a scholar. Granted, it is expensive. But compared to other editions of Pride and Prejudice that imply scholarly expertise, this edition is a scholarly work. And Rogers credits his sources, too! Kudos to Professor Rogers!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I walk into a bookstore, you'd rarely see me pick up a classic. I typically head straight to the Young Adult Fiction section, home to my favorite first-class, high-quality novels such as Gossip Girl, the A-List, and The Clique. However, this time I opted for a change, wanting to read, for once, a really good book. With the movie coming out, I decided to give Pride and Prejudice a try. I fully expected to put the book down forever after the first page or so--- it seems to me that most authors writing before the 21st century hadn't quite caught on to the method of captivating the reader in the first few sentences, or even chapters--- but I was surprised. From the start, Pride and Prejudice was interesting, humorous and engrossing. I read on. Taking my clean hardcover copy with me everywhere I went for the next couple weeks, I read whenever I had a spare moment. I loved the language, of both the chatty and funny narration and the dialogue of the interesting, loveable characters. Some phrases and words were unfamiliar, but instead of making it hard to understand, I caught on quickly... for example, a teenage female's 'coming out'. And another thing I loved about this book--- it wasn't just a typical love story. There were all sorts of twists and turns, most noteably with the crabby, snobby Mr. Darcy-- who, by the end, had captured the hearts of the readers as well as the characters. All in all, I'm so glad to have overcame my fears of boring, difficult-to-read 'classic' novels--- this book is really one that nobody should miss."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an old time classic for me and one of my favorites.I have went through it about 5 or 6 times already, listened to it on audio cd and watched different versions of the movie countless times.Splendid conclusion!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I always resisted reading this book. I thought that the old, female bounding type society was something I never wanted to relive. However, I came to truly love Elizabeth.This was another 'home book club' pick of my daughters and I, and we also enjoyed it. We loved the language, which is so well spoken and hilarious (Elizabeth). She has a way of verbalizing positive demoralization, which makes others walk away with their tails between their legs!We also loved many of the other characters, such as Lydia, and the idiot Bennets.Now to why we only gave 4 stars. The Kindle version I have is FULL of errors! Also, one of our books had a HORRIBLE font, and was missing many of the illustrations that were in our other two books. I had to go to the library to get a copy for our reading group."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In thirty years of reading, I somehow missed reading this book (or anything by Austen). If I hadn't been trying to fill my new Kindle with free books, I don't know if I ever would have read it. There were too many movie adaptations that held zero interest for me and too many rip-offs from authors unable to imagine their own characters and wanting to pick up where Austen had left off. I didn't think that this book would have anything for me. I was too cool for Jane Austen.I was wrong. Austen is amazingly witty and the romance of Elizabeth and Darcy is one of the sweetest and realistically character-driven I've ever read. Despite the setting, the two of them are so well-imagined as to achieve a kind of timelessness. I highly recommend this book, especially if you've never read Austen before.As far as Kindle editions go, this isn't one of the best. There are some weird line breaks. The typos and repeated words mentioned in earlier reviews seem to be fixed, but any word with emphasis in the original is all caps in this edition -- it's a bit like reading an over-heated chat room discussion at first, but I got used to it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest novels in English literature and is truly deserving of being called a classic. First published in 1813, it is set at the turn of the 19th century in a fictional town near London. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are blessed with five daughters, ranging in age from 15 to 22. The novel opens with Mrs. Bennet anxiously thinking about how to marry her daughters off, as that was the primary way for women to achieve financial security during those times. The story is told in third person from the point of view of the second eldest daughter Elizabeth Bennet.Of the four Jane Austen novels that I've read, Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. This is not because I didn't enjoy the others, I most certainly did, but rather because Pride and Prejudice affected me on so many different levels. It touched my heart and swept me away, as I absolutely fell in love with Mr. Darcy. It also provoked my mind, as I reflected upon the many issues that Austen explores in this novel. It is a subtle book, as all Jane Austen novels are, and that is its beauty. All of the issues that Jane Austen raises in this book slowly simmer in your mind.One of the reasons I love Pride and Prejudice is that it is a romance for those with a bit of a feminist streak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong character who isn't afraid to speak her mind. She is no weak wallflower. Many romantic plots feature a damsel in distress who is saved by her knight in shining armor. That is most definitely not the case here. The love story in Pride and Prejudice shows that you can have chivalrous man and grand romantic gestures without a weak heroine.I also love Pride and Prejudice for Austen's excellent treatment of the characters. Both of the main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, grow, develop, and change throughout the novel. Their character developments are deep, thorough, and convincing. In contrast, the supporting characters do not change much. Their constancy provides a nice point of comparison to the growth of the main characters.The novel is a full-fledged social commentary on marriage, love, money, wealth, social class, propriety, as well as pride and prejudice. It is fascinating to learn how different those times were from today, especially in the lack of opportunity for women; and yet, it is even more fascinating to think about how relevant the issues are to today. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same.If you only read one Jane Austen novel, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Be patient with the old English language. It is not an easy read, but it is worth your while."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Beautiful clothbound edition. It is well made and will last a long time. I believe the typeface is Times New Roman, with standard margins. There is a ribbon bookmark in the binding. I plan to get some more of the Penguin clothbound editions in this set."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not dretract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing: e.g. one note in the chronology \\"the United States declare war on Britain.\\" There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the word \\"declare\\" where we Americans would more likely use \\"declares\\" is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress.Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses S.(stands for nothing)Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S. Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat Lincoln in 1864.I apologize for wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed. I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I.The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book.Thank you for your patience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Does the world need another P&P; review? No. Will anyone read this? Probably not, but I made a resolution to write a review of every book I read - and I read this for the umpteenth time while recovering from surgery.What is it about this novel? On the surface it is an ever-so-polite romance featuring the Bennett sisters, whose biggest concerns are their ball gowns and gossipy letters. However, what makes it ageless is the fully developed characters and the deep insights into the human condition. I never tire of it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Since I was a business major in college, I wasn't made to read a lot of the standard classics that most people have already read. I'm finally starting to make up for lost time.I loved this book. I have always loved 19th century literature, mostly because I love the societal rules and manners. (The House of Mirth is one of my all-time favorite books.) However, I was a bit surprised that I could be drawn in so much to a romance where no one even kisses. (Especially because some of the paranormal romances I read are practically pornography.) But I couldn't put this book down and I am now in love with Mr. Darcy like so many other women before me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"These clothbound Penguin classics are even more beautiful in person!

The period was one of war and revolution that severely threatened upper class privileges. Conscription at home and reports of endless damger can never be comfortable news from across the channel and on the seas of the world. There was also the threat of invasion that Napoleon planned but was ultimately unable to execute. Yet war is never mentioned in the novel. There are soldiers, officers only of course, but their sole military duties are flirtation and to supply dance partners.The true conflict, in fact the only conflict of the Bennet family, is the struggle to marry off the eligible daughters before their father dies. Primogeniture is the evil djinn of the plot and Mrs. Bennet and the daughters are never unaware of the perils of their situation. They live one heart beat away from being thrown out of their estate by the male heir, their cousin Mr. Collins. Their only options are marriage or a life of dependency on a relative's charity. The girls are untrained. They can never earn their livings and the only skills they possess are those required of a wife, a companion, and a homemaker. Here I am thinking of Jane and Elizabeth. The youngest, Lydia, runs away with a scoundrel officer and almost brings the family to ruin. The other two daughters, Mary and Kitty, are mere bookends of little note, useful perhaps to illustrate the unlimited production of Bennet daughters, and to highlight the misfortune of never having produced a son.Every unattached man the family encounters is defined by fortune. Darcy has an income of 10,000. and Bingley 5,000. Once these two are corralled, the fate of the rest of the family is secure and the novel ends with satisfaction. The great peril is that these two wealthy bachelors will not be induced to perform their assigned tasks, finding and wedding two suitable wives from an otherwise often embarrassing Bennet family. Among the great delights of this novel are the nuances of character displayed and the modulations of the central personages as fortune and misfortune threaten and abate.Loss of place and social ostracism run behind every line of text and the wonder of Jane Austen's novel is that the threat of material want is ever present and yet is rarely noted. In polite company such matters are never discussed, but they are implicit in every second of existence. The stress is desperate and the courage of the characters immense. Since it is never expressed, it is possible to imagine it lies hidden in their minds but never given place in speech.Dialectical materialism can understand and find clarity in the situation of the Bennet family. A rereading of Das Kapital might be a useful sequel to this great novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"No matter how many times I read this book, it still makes me smile.

The book has way too much talk in it, hardly anything is described in any other way than by someone remarking upon it. But I liked the story overall, and I thought the authors view on pride was interesting. The characters are believable and somewhat relatable. Some parts were hard to understand because the language is outdated, and I wasn't always sure who was speaking. Only that someone always was. But because of the social nature of the novel, I guess that works."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Enjoyed this more thoroughly than expected. This is a story about the potential damage or fortune derived from preconceived societal notions. This is a story about standing up to social conventions in an age where such a concept was unthinkable, not to mention before its time. Taken slowly, poetically and whimsically, the human drama in this book is deeply touching, and can be appreciated by every culture on the globe.There are 5thousand reviews here, so I won't go into further detail, but rest assured, it's a CLASSIC and it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little intimidated at first when I began this book, afraid I wouldn't be able to understand the old English language and terms.

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was PAINFUL to read.PAINFUL!!!!!The book is filled with rich people being super proper. Oh my goodness it was bad.Although a little more than halfway through the book, I did start to enjoy it. Mainly because they stopped being so stuffy and started being a little more real.There were a bunch of funny, underhanded proper comments, similar to something like \\"Why, doesn't she look pretty today?\\" but really meaning that she's super ugly and happens to have made herself look good for this moment.The overall story line: Daughters find people to become their husbands.Done.I just couldn't handle it.But it's a classic and I already know some of you are going to agree with me while others are like shouting at the screen in frustration at my review.So tell me your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Brilliant writing. What a use of the English language. So rich and complex. It takes a while to get into her writing stylewhich is so sophisticated and witty.Besides her use of the language which makes &#34;american English&#34; so much more pitiful, it is incredible how she weavesa fascinating tale, page after page, on the basis of a very simple story: i.e. boy meets girl.One is constantly in suspense and the level of eroticism is so high without even a hint of touch between the twoprotagonists for more than half the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"All I had hoped for and then some!!!

I found this book to be very good"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Collins classics version is outstanding. It's inexpensive ($6 or so when I purchased), though compact it is very legible. The paper is thick enough so that the font on the other side doesn't show through. Binding is tight though the spine gets bent quite a lot even after one read through. What I particularly enjoyed was the Collins classic English literature dictionary in the back. It includes many outdated or no longer used terms and words so that you don't have to reach for the computer if you don't really know what an 'entail' is or what 'persnickety' means. But it is a compact, standard mass market paperback size, and that's my one beef.As for the novel. Classic English literature is amazing, and this novel is one of the cornerstones of the 19th century English literature scene. Along with Dickens and the Bronte sisters, Austen's novels seem to capture the lives of the English in these times. Though Pride and Prejudice deals mainly with the wealthy, or at least the privileged class, we get to see a wonderful story unfold. Like the title states, this story deals with the pride of one character and the prejudice of another. Many peripheral plots unfold and help add to the overall story while the main plot moves along quite well.It's a novel that is often placed on reading lists in school, though I feel that in reading this in my early 30s that I can really truly grasp the emotions and trials of these characters more completely. If you read this when young, then do yourself a service and re-read this novel. It's amazing! Then watch the Colin Firth BBC series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Absolutely amazing!

On the inside cover it suggested not to miss \`Pride and Prejudice' and \`Romeo & Juilet'. So of course, I bought them as well!When I first started reading the book, being that it was written in 1813 and the language being slightly different then, I found the book a little hard to get into. Although, once I got to know the characters and the story began to unfold, I found myself unable to put the book down (literally). The romance, as well as the relationship, between Elizabeth Bennet & Mr. Darcy was highly intriguing and only added to the chemistry that makes this love story truly amazing! Now, I don't want to give away any of the juiciness that lies within the book so I won't say anymore. You'll really just have to read the book!NOTE: While browsing around, it appears that other authors have written books continuing the \`Pride and Prejudice' story regarding the lives and love of Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth Bennet.

This has all right to be called an alltime classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i finnaly decided to read this classic because i have heard so much about it.

The story is set in rural England of early 19th century and is centered around Elizabeth, second daughter of the Bennets, and her evolving relationship with 'proud' Mr Darcy. The author has done an excellent job keeping the pace of the story, while painting excellent character portraits.--A minor note:Some people observe that the name of the county where the military regiment is settled appears as \\"----shire\\" throughout the book. Strange as that may seem, it is not a typographical error; it is actually how it appears in the original (you can check the free online editions of the novel on Project Gutenberg or Google Books). According to an annotated version by David M. Shapard, that was done in purpose by the author to avoid naming a particular county, although the reason is not known for certain."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book so much!

I admit the language is a little hard to get used to at first, but once you get in a rhythm, it's fabulous. The romance is classic and probably forms the basis for a lot of the modern romances today.

Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason. Maybe the reason it seems a bit long is there are many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Remembered reading this in high school and not fully understanding a lot of the complex issues raised in this book. It's nice to have another read at an older age to appreciate the author's words, and have a better understanding of what makes this such a classic book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I decided to reread this classic because I wanted to read PD James' new novel which continues the story of Darcy and Elizabeth after their marriage when there is a murder. I wondered if I would enjoy this book after reading it some decades ago and seeing at least one movie version of it. To my delight, I found the rereading fun. The statement that a classic is a classic because people enjoy reading it is true. The book is filled with humor and witty social comments. Jane Austen pocks fun at the generally uneducated women of her age, their silliness, their interest in looking beautiful, men, marriage, and family, the strong difference between them and the men in their lives, and how some very intelligent women, such as Elizabeth Bennet, stand out despite not being as beautiful as her sisters, and accomplishing more than them. This was a time when a woman walking three miles was unusual and women reading non-fiction was extraordinary.The story focuses on Elizabeth and on Darcy's pride. He is very good looking, rich, more intelligent than most of the people he encounters, and sees their foolish behavior and thoughts as a waste of time and absurd. His first impression of Elizabeth is negative. Looking only at her surface, he sees a young woman who is not as beautiful as others at a party. As a result, he makes a remark that Elizabeth overhears, that disparages her. Later, he sees the beauty of her character and intelligence. But Elizabeth has become blind to his worth because of the prejudice created by his remark, and she avoids him. The story becomes even more interesting when other characters are introduced and we read about the five Bennet girls and their parents' reactions to them. Some seem good or bad at first, but are they, and why do they seem like they do?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I finally read P&P; at the insistence of a very good friend...we disagreed on the merits of the recent Keira Knightley P&P; film (I liked it; she didn't)...she challenged me to read the book so that i would understand, and now I do!The goal of all the great novels, the experts tell us, is to arrive at some fundamental TRUTH.The genius of Jane Austen was that she told us the truth from the get go: \\"that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" and the MORE important truth: \\"However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\"And by declaring the truth from the get go, she brilliantly illuminates it throughout.This is a book for EVERYONE:For fathers (like me!), who love all their children, but recognize each for their faults and good parts...delights in the marriage of their daughters if they will be happy (like I am going through now)...the most touching part for me was how much Mr. Bennet loved Elizabeth and Jane and missed Elizabeth so much when she was gone.For children, especially, teens who are MORTIFIED at the behaviour of their parents in front of their friends. I mean, could Mrs. Bennet BE more embarrassing?!For brothers and sisters, to see the beauty and challenge of being siblings, especially in a large family!But, especially, for people who are - as Jane Austen put it - *violently* in love. She expressed it so well in the almost manic internal ponderings of Elizabeth and even Darcy, and and all at once: I hate him/her, I love him/her, I hope he/she will see me, I hope he/she doesn't come, how could he be so uncivil, how could he/she be so kind, I think he/she loves me, he/she could never love me...and also the joy of being friends before being lovers.I loved how she portrayed Mr Collins only in terms of his ridiculous language and habits; the filmmakers \\"cheated\\" by making Collins short to be ridiculous and then piled on; Austen saw the comedy not in his stature but in his silliness.I also loved the emphasis on letter writing to pour out ones fears and feelings...it is a lost art and we are the worse for it.The only thing I didn't like, and will likely never appreciate, is a culture where people don't have to show up at work everyday...I just don't get it...I guess that's why I enjoy historical fiction of common folks of the 18th and 19th century (by Matthew Pearl, Louis Bayard, David Liss, and others), where even the elite have to actually *do* something.I thanks my friend and Miss Austen for helping me appreciate a true classic!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long age. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.\\"This sentence is from the novel Pride and Prejudice, the most famous book written by Jane Austen. The author set the background as conservative and traditional British countryside life which still pay attention to the reputation and have their own social circle. It contrasts with the people who are upper- class. They are selfish and prideful. Through five middle class girls how to choose love shows the values of marriage in that time, in that society. But among them there still exists people like Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley who finally choose their true love. And the sentence expresses the true love in a class structure society is really cherished between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. It fully shows Mr. Darcy's love to Elizabeth.For a long time, because of Mr. Darcy's pride, he hides his love to Elizabeth. It leads to Elizabeth has a misunderstanding to Mr. Darcy since the first time they meet. As the most important themes in this novel, love plays a special role in this book. The whole story develops around the different barriers in the true love and how people to respond these difficulties. And all of these difficulties come from one reason that is the social force. The social structure makes Mr. Darcy's pride that he feels like he should be proud of himself. Because he is richer than others and live in the upper- class. At the same time, it also the social structure makes Elizabeth's prejudice. She knows she and her family is just in a middle- class. So she is more sensitive than others and she does not want others such as Mr. Darcy looks down upon her. But just because of her sensitive, it makes her different from other girls. Elizabeth is the most intelligent girl in her family. She is clever and high- hearted. When she first meets Mr. Darcy, she has a really poor impression about him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy and intelligent gentleman, so faces Elizabeth's prejudice; he chooses to be silent and does not explain anything. When he proposes to Elizabeth, Elizabeth determined rejects him and mentions Wickham's deceit. But Mr. Darcy still says nothing about it, the only thing he says is \\"I don't want to talk about it at all.\\" This is just one obstacle between them. Before they realize their sincerely love to each other, they have faced the different troubles and numerous stumbling blocks- Miss Bingley's snobbery, Lady Catherine's attempt to control her nephew, Mrs. Bennet's idiocy and Wickham's lies. All of these obstacles make a big difficulty exist in their love. Especially, the class- structure and reputation is more serious. The class- structure is really significant in that society. There are so many differences between them. They have the totally different life style since they were born. So from the origin of their mind is different. In the beginning, Mr. Darcy's pride to the people who live in the countryside hurts Elizabeth a lot. He thinks as girl as Elizabeth should be happy that he loves. Therefore, in the first time he says courtship to Elizabethj, he thinks she would love to say \\"yes.\\" But he gets an unexpected answer. And finally he knows Elizabeth in the only woman who loves him, not his money. So he helps Elizabeth's sister Lydia and Wickham, who is a fortune- hunting officer. And he explains all things through the letter from Elizabeth's aunt. He earned his love back. That proves love is a force that can be separated from social structure and facts and it shows love can conquer anything even the hardest thing- people's mind.Reputation is another theme in the novel; it helps to strengthen the difficulty between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. For Elizabeth, reputation is not that important for middle class girl. She prefers to live with her family than cares about the reputation. So when she knows her sister Jane is ill, she walks to Netherfiled alone. She arrives with muddy skirt, to the shock of reputation- conscious Mass Bingley and her friends. She does not care how people judge her. In Miss Bingley's eyes, her behavior is absolute not acceptable in the upper- class. From Miss Bingley's reaction, it expresses Elizabeth's unique and her natural personality. But when sister elopes with Wickham and lives with him out of wedlock, the reputation- conscious happened again. Bennet family is not invited to the ball anymore, and even they walk as they run. Whatever Elizabeth does not care her reputation, but her family cannot avoid it. The social force still exists in her life. She cannot escape from it. But in her most difficult time, Elizabeth finds Mr. Darcy is the only person that wants to help her to find her sister back, give her sister money and solved all problems for them. She suddenly realizes she is wrong about her prejudice. So she decides to accept Mr. Darcy's courtship. They break the social structure and rules and finally get married.This novel reflects how people treat marriage in that society. People only pursue wealth and reputation. Girls can marry with a guy such as Mr. Collins, only for his money. Parents pay attention to the man who their daughter will marry is rich, not whether their daughter really loves him. They pursue social position instead of love. But just because of that, it shows the true love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth is special and cherished. The author in this novel also tries to tell people, in this world we need to change, change can solve anything."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One friend asked me why the book, Pride and Prejudice, became one of the most famous classics of all time. She knew it exemplified a great English writing style, but after reading the book, it only gave her the impression of an early 19th century \\"chick-flick\\", targeted for fans of romance novels. The book, however, offered me not only a witty, romantic comedy but also educational and historical values through the realistic depictions of an early 19th century English society.Throughout the whole book, the main characters constantly reminded me of the famous maxim: Don't judge a book by its cover. When the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, meets the male character, Darcy, she finds him handsome, young and rich; the type of men that any women during her time period would consider to be the perfect husband. But his proud arrogance and aloofness prick her pride, causing her to stubbornly decide to dislike Darcy. This fire of hatred is further fueled along when Wickham, a handsome soldier, wins Liz's heart through his seemingly agreeable personality. Providing her with spiteful lies about Darcy, Wickham helps Liz's prejudice to grow. When the truth is reveled, however, Liz realizes that she had made the wrong impressions about both Darcy and Wickham based upon their exterior behaviors and appearances. In fact, Wickham turns out to be a scandalous liar whose addiction for gambling has broke him poor and Darcy turns out to be a truly noble person who knows how to care for and love those dear to him.In the end, Liz learns to correct her mistake of making misimpression and eventually marries Darcy who loves her for who she really is. This unrealistically happy ending, however, caused me to be aware of the real matrimony system in the early 19th century. The main characters ended happily; a girl from a poor family married the perfect man from a wealthy background due to their true, inseparable love. But other characters showed otherwise. For example, Liz's friend, Charlotte Lucas, agreed to marry Mr. Collins despite the fact that her friend had rejected him a few days ago. No love existed in this marriage obviously, but Charlotte could not have been happier as the marriage had much benefit for her: it saved her from her poor financial status and even from the shame of remaining unmarried at her old age. Just like Charlotte, many lower class women settled to be content with marriages, if they brought them or their families a little benefit.On the other hand, Ms. Bingley and Lady Catherine show how the upper class of the early 19th century married. Ignoring love mostly, both compared Darcy's social class, financial status, and family background to judge if marrying herself (Ms. Bingley's case) or her daughter (Lady Catherine's case) would be the most advantageous combination. In both cases, the source of wealth and power could be traced as the men, whom the women had to depend on and negotiate with to marry as best as they could. Both classes considered greatly the effects on the future and the family that the marriage would bring and the way how these female character perceived marriages proved how the real women during the early 19th century actually married.In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice should not be only read for observing Jane Austen's talent in writing or for mere enjoyment of romantic comedy, but also for development in mature perception and the cultural history that the book offered. Pride and Prejudice is an educational novel that clearly depicts the difficulty in forming perspective about other people and the dangers that could arise when our impressions or senses are trusted too much. It does not only offer an insight into how women of the early 19th century really lived but shows their lifestyle, way of thinking and the harsh reality of the matrimony system."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book a million times.

It started when I was 12 years old, a friend of my moms gave me the A&E; version on VHS tape, you know, the one with Colin Firth!!! After watching all 6 hours of that for day's in a row, i found it hard to sit down and read the book?But then I got my Kindle, and this was one of the first book I read! It was great to have the details filled in that the movie left out, and also to have the image of Colin Firth in my head as Mr. Darcy! I love this book and the A&E; version of it! : I am now 26 years old, so it took me about 14 years for me to finally read the book, but it was well worth it. I now also own the movie on DVD!! ;)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"[...]Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has got to have one of the best male characters of all time, Mr. Darcy. I won't go into detail about the plot, it's a tried and true story, done many times in many forms of movie, I'll cover just a few here. But Mr. Darcy is the epitome of men. A specimen worth lusting over, he is the type of man that all women secretly want. Tall, handsome, and true, he is arrogant, prideful (or not prideful? That's for you to decide), and conceited. He's the type of man that although confident, will make you feel like once he takes you in his arms, you are safe and loved forever. There are many wonderful reasons to read this book, but I believe Mr. Darcy is the main reason women have been reading it for generations.Besides Mr. Darcy, my next favorite characters are Lizzie and her father, a relationship worth noting. They have an affection and understanding betwixt them that is both endearing and enviable. He understands her in a way that most don't and does his best to protect her from her worst enemy, her mother, the one who is always trying to give her away to the first available man. He is commendable. The other daughters are not as noteworthy, obviously Lydia is meant to be childish and annoying and it comes across well. Someone should have slapped that child silly. I almost wish two characters, Mary, the middle sister, and Charlotte, Elizabeth's best friend, had gotten more play. I understand Charlotte was there to represent the many women out there that are sensible and marry for reasons other than love, and so we need her, but it didn't seem fair she got the short end of the stick. And poor Mary, who just wanted to shine in her own way, whether through her demurely moral comments or her piano playing, and was often ignored or rebuffed. I think she had merit and would have liked to see her end up with someone. Alas, it was Elizabeth's story, and more so Mr. Darcy's and so we must focus on them. I absolutely loved it and it was just another example of Austen's genius.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was a nice, romantic novel with lovely descriptions allowing you to transport fully into the story. There were ironies and plenty of opportunities to dwell on the intricacies of the characters. Books today are rarely written with the depth of language and description found in Pride and Prejudice.

He is a rich and seemingly arrogant gentleman and she is a poor and very feisty young lady in a large, happy family of girls who must marry well.

All of them except poor Mary, she kind of reminds me of myself actually, she's the nerdy one.Elizabeth judges everyone, her mother, her father, her sisters and especially Mr. Darcy.

The articulate language and complex characters draw the reader into the story of sisters trying to find their place in life. The way in which it is written is rare to find in today's society, creating a sense of mystery and the unknown about society of the past. Elizabeth Bennett, the heroine of the novel, is a character that is easily relatable to for women both in the time that it was written and for modern women today. She struggles internally to find where her heart truly belongs, and leads the reader to question whether they themselves are actually proud and/or prejudiced."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and the Penguin Hardcover classic version is pure pleasure to read.

I did not notice any errors in the text. I have not yet read the introduction to this book, but have greatly enjoyed the introductions included in other Penguin Hardcover classics (especially Jane Eyre).I definitely recommend this copy of Pride and Prejudice.

I always did well in English class, but I never deeply loved literature until we read this book. I read far beyond the assigned pages in class because I loved Jane Austen's writing, her characters, and her witty lines. I often found myself smiling and occasionally laughing while reading the book. This book had such a profound influence on my life that I'm now an English major in college. After reading this I sought out other books in the same style like the Bronte sisters. Over the years, I've basically forced all of my friends and poor boyfriends to read this book so I could talk about it with them. I'd recommend this book to absolutely anyone who can understand and tolerate the language and dialogue. I'd recommend reading the first few pages for free here on Amazon, and if you can follow the writing of the time, get this book right away.

Jane Austin really knows how to make the characters come alive and you experience the book as if you are the one telling the story. You also get to see what life would have been like back then, you get to see and experience something you would not have otherwise experienced yourself. I am sure it was not an easy task to write feelings for another person. Unless you experience them yourself, how can you say it for another? The book kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next, and I truly did not want to put it down, until I had read it all. If you like history, romance, and a great story line then I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen masterfully tells this story which helps the reader engage in the relationships of people. Like her earlier compelling novel, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice is a romance story. Although there are many different printings of this work, T. Egerton, Whitehall first published it in January 28th 1813 with roughly 370 pages. While the original print did not have illustrations the first wonderful pictures were by Pickering & Greatbatch.Pride and Prejudice owes much of its popularity to its vivid portrayal of character. The story is set in early 19th-century England, a trying time for any unmarried maiden. Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Benett sister, was as open as a closed book shielding her true feelings. While Mr. Darcy would proudly separate himself from the common folk. Both characters are very likable despite their flaws.This pleasurable tale begins with the worries of a caring mother. Back then it was incredibly important for women to get married and none of her five daughters had. Thankfully a young bachelor by they name of Mr. Bingley came to town and was immediately attracted to the oldest Benett sister, Jane. Elizabeth on the other hand was somewhat fond of Mr. Darcy but he seemed to show no interest. Although Jane and Mr. Bingley had grown quite close, he left along with the rest of his party leaving a brokenhearted Jane behind. Elizabeth found out that Mr. Darcy was the one who convinced Mr. Bingley to go. While she was visiting at a friend's house she and Mr. Darcy crossed paths and he tried to propose to her. Still upset that he had broken up Mr. Bingley and her sister she declined the proposal.After a heated argument with Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth saw eye to eye with him and realized they had both been prejudice and maybe a little proud. Fortuitously, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy both moved back to town were they showed up to the Benett's house and had a somewhat awkward conversation. Later Mr. Bingley, who arrived alone, asked if he could speak to Jane apart from the other. A proposal maybe? If that wasn't enough to fill the mind of Elizabeth, knowing she thinks of Mr. Darcy differently would.Interestingly Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both recognized that they were prideful and prejudice. Which hints to why the title is call Pride and Prejudice. They're imperfect characters, and that's what people like about them! When I was reading this book I realized what made it different from other romance novels is that the love unfolded gradually. At some points in the book it seemed as if they didn't like each other at all. A lot of stories now a days quickly get to the point, forgetting that telling the story is the best part."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted to read some of the classic novels that are available for Kindle, and now I am hooked! This book was so rich in characters, story and setting, that I felt I had taken a trip back in time, to another era. A wonderful story, that kept me reading into the night. A classic, English romance. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Obviously Jane Austen was amazing and Pride and Prejudice is incredible. But WHY would they put this cover on it? Why take a classic and make it look trashy? It looks like Lauren Conrad wrote this book... I am disgusted with the publishers."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is one of the great masters of the English language, and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is her great masterpiece, a sharp and witty comedy of manners played out in early 19th Century English society, a world in which men held virtually all the power and women were required to negotiate mine-fields of social status, respectability, wealth, love, and sex in order to marry both to their own liking and to the advantage of their family. And such is particularly the case of the Bennetts, a family of daughters whose father's estate is entailed to a distant relative, for upon Mr. Bennett's death they will lose home, land, income, everything. But are the Bennett daughters up to playing a winning hand in this high-stakes matrimonial game without forfeiting their own personal integrity?This battle of the sexes is largely seen through the eyes of second daughter Elizabeth, who possesses a razor-sharp wit and rich sense of humor--and who finds herself hindered by her own addlepated mother, her sister Jane's hopeless love for the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and her sister Lydia's penchant for scandal... not to mention the high-born, formidable, and outrageously proud Mr. Darcy, who seems determined to trump her every card. But the game of love proves more surprising than either Elizabeth or Mr. Darcy can imagine, and sometimes a seemingly weak hand proves a winning one when all cards are on the table.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is simply one of the funniest novels ever written, peopled with memorable characters brought vividly to life as they both succeed and fail at the game of life according to the manners of their era. It is a novel to which I return again and again, enjoying Austen's brillant talent. I have little respect for people who describe it as dull, slow, out of date, for as long as men and women live and fall in love it will never be out of style, always be meaningful, and always be funny. A masterpiece of wit and style; a timeless novel for the ages."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the versions listed is published by \\"General Books LLC.\\" Another reader complained about the tiny and almost unreadable font - you probably bought the version published by General Books LLC - and here's the reason.General Books LLC is an imprint of VDM Publishing, (google them and take a look at the Wikipedia article on them) and they specialise in publishing books that are free of copyright without doing any editing or quality control.

In addition, Amazon is the Printer of these POD books and makes a substantial cut from them.

Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am really enjoying this book. I won't comment on it from a literary sense. Everyone has already exhausted that area. However, I will say that the kindle version is great except that the text does not always translate in the proper fonts. Every so often the author has emphazied a word and it shows in the Kindle as all upper case. I supposed it was supposed to be italics. A similar situation occurred in the Complete Sherlock Holmes. Certain symbols are not translated properly. The intent was still obvious. I was very reluctant to buy a Kindle at first, but I have used up all the available space in my home for paper books. The Kindle is a joy to read though and it goes very fast."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a most amusing and entertaining love story which has ever written that shows human limitations at its best. The title of the book is indeed well-named for pride and prejudice are the essence of the whole book. Pride of the hero Mr. Darcy and prejudice of the heroine Elizabeth Bennet combined to reveal what kind of character a person can be, regardless of his/her financial situation and social stature.British society under the Regency rule was exemplified and made explicit to generations of readers. The author was telling us about the everyday life of people living in rural England after the Napoleonic Wars, and Britain was on its way to become a maritime power in the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution of Charles Dickens' days had not yet arrived to upset the power of the English nobility and the landed gentry, so much so that gentlemen like Mr. Darcy, a landowner of vast estates, could live a life of luxury and self-importance, and could easily look down on the less fortunate who had to work for a living.Reading Jane Austen's work is always a pleasure. It puts me in with the characters, as if I were an unseen and unknown observer in the room! In fact, I feel that I am living in the early 1800s, doing the same things that those characters are doing, and feeling just as they are feeling."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved the style and social politics of the Regency period (the time of Jane Austen.) But when I read &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in 7th grade I found the first few chapters lifeless, dull and hard to read. Two years later I was encouraged by a friend to give &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; a try. I did and have since become a complete Janeite. I am now able to peruse joyfully through &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; with a new understanding and appreciation of Jane Austen. The reason? &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is fresh, witty and is a great introduction to Jane Austen's writing style without the formality of some of her other novels (unlike S&amp;S and Persuasion Austen does not give us a 10 page history of each family and their fortune.) If you have never read Jane Austen or have read her other novels and found them boring, read Pride and Prejudice. The characters, and the situations Austen presents to them, are hysterical and reveal a lot about Regency society and morality. This book perfectly compliments a great writer like Jane Austen and is essential to every reader's library. The Penguin Edition of the book is stellar and I personally recommend it not only for the in-depth and indispensable footnotes, but also for the cover that is non-suggestive of any of the characters' appearances. In summary &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a great book for beginner Austen readers and seasoned fans, and Penguin Classics is a great edition for fully enjoying and understanding the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Classics come to life under good audio treatment, as Irene Sutcliffe demonstrates by reading Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE with passion and style.

The corners of the pages are rounded giving it a soft look. The covers of all WAE, are completely black, except for the title and author and also have rounded corners. Attached to the back cover is an elastic band that goes around the height of the book and you can use this as a book mark or as a way to keep your book closed.-Each WAE novel has colorful inside covers depicting a scene from the novel and there are nice color drawings included in the introduction.-Each novel has at least three sets of notes written by Austen scholars. Most of the notes are the same in all the novels, but each novel has one additional note section peculiar to that novel. The notes that all editions have are a timeline in color of Jane Austen's world and a color map of Austen's England. In P&P; the additional notes is the illustrated Army in Austen's time.I bought used copies of WAE novels because even used, they are sturdy and comfortable. I am very hard on books by intention. I read while I eat, before I sleep, while waiting on lines, etc. But mainly, I like to embellish my books with beads, ribbons and lace, and even some rubber stamping on the white spaces in the text itself. I wouldn't have the heart to do that to an expensive hardcover.If you like the &#34;feel&#34; of books, I highly recommend the Winchester Austen Edition of any of Austen's novels. Let me know what you think."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great book I read it in a week loved this classic book Lizzy and Darcy is a true love story"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm really liking the Kindle and its nearly unlimited supply of free books.

I had to read this for my Women in Literature and Visual Arts class, and it was enjoyable. The characters are well developed, and the plot is simple enough to understand.

Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down, Austen immediately sucks you in with witty word play, dramatic irony, and catching plot points. The novel captures a wide audience, whether the reader is a hopeless romantic or more practical. It appeals to everyone; I can guarantee that future readers will not be disappointed. The main character, Elizabeth, is complex, stubborn, and full of wit. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both exude passion. Although there are multiple story lines the majority of the plot revolves around the love-hate relationship of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. Their relationship is full of twists and turns that are incredibly enticing to the audience. \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" this is the opening line of the novel, and it is perhaps one of the most know phrases in literature. It is incredibly ironic, and ties into the whole book.Pride and Prejudice is a spectacular book for the reason that it leaves readers wanting nothing. Some readers may say that it is an unrealistic ending, because many of the main characters had their fairy tale ending. In my opinion that is what makes this book a great read. There aren't enough happy endings in the world, but when reading about them it feels as if it's your own personal happy ending. Overall, it's a classic romance that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a clever, well written, and whirlwind romance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this for my English class, and I have to say that I loved it!

Not a pure romance however, Austen offers so much more to her readers in P&P: realistic relationships, interesting characters, comical situations and compelling subplots force readers to think in many directions and entertain far and beyond boy loves girl. This particular copy of P&P would make a perfect little gift for anyone just introduced to the story or Austen through this latest movie version (or as a companion to the movie) and is a wonderful beginning to immersing oneself in the English language of 200 years ago. To be certain, this sort of old classic literature may be a challenge to peruse at first, but rest assured that it becomes easier to assimilate the more you read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of reviews of this book, I somehow feel it important to share my thoughts. This is one of my favorite books of all time, though I came to it very late in life. During my 5th reading of it, I started musing over why this book had such an incredible impact on me. I finally figured it out. This book and almost of all Austen's other brilliant novels speak to me about the life-altering possibilities of love. This reality was completely integral to the lives of women in the 18th and 19th century. If you were a woman, your fate -- whether you became a wife, a mother, a mistress of a fine home or stayed at home the rest of your days taking care of your parents -- was completely determined by a man choosing you. But this idea, even in our times in which women actually have options and power to change their lives, is highly compelling. These books -- these characters -- capture the feeling that everyone who has every fallen in love has that in one instant their lives, if joined with another, will be changed forever and exponentially and in ways they cannot even imagine. It is that feeling of possibility that Jane Austen has put into words, and why, I believe, her books are still as influencial as they were 2 hundred years ago."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had heard good thungs about this book from my school friends and heard great praise from my librarian the day I checked it out. I had always wanted to read a Jane Austen novel and this was my first. I had completley fell in love with it when I was stuck inside, at home, on three snowy days and could not put it down. I immediately began seeking other Austen books, but this one stuck in my mind. I have read this, Persuasion, Lady Susan, and have seen the Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion movies. I have yet to see Pride and Prejidice, but I am looking forward to it.Pride and Prejudice's main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is strong-willed, intelligent, and witty. She makes snap judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudices. She is the second youngest of five sisters and no brothers and is the favorite of her father.The eldest, virtuous Jane, is her favorite who rarely sees the wrong in anybody. Jane is considered the handsomest sister. The middle child, Mary, is principled and only lives to improve her accomplishments. The next is timid Catherine, or Kitty, who is followed by exasperating Lydia. Lydia is silly and, if you have ever read Persuasion, like the Musgroves. She is cheerful and a flirt going after the soldiers' and fancying herself always in love. Her mother is hopelessly silly and her father is sardonic. They meet this man, Mr. Charles Bingley, who is considered very rich that just moved into the neighborhood. He is a perfectly wonderful man who fell in love with a Bennet. His friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, his name even convinces us that he possesses arrogant pride, is even more rich than Mr. Bingley but is disliked by the shole neighborhood.\\"It is a truth universally acknowlegded that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife\\", the first sentance of the book, states a theme of the novel. Marraige is talked of often in the book. Elizabeth meets both Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy and judges their characters. One she likes and one she doesn't. You can probably guess. But is her first immpression of Mr. Darcy wrong?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you don't fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet and her existentially endearing family, well, your heart must be made of stone.Jane Austen's best heroine is at the center of this romance that is so strong and true that it can be mined by the film industry - with good, better and best adaptations - and still manage to stand on its own pinnacle of imaginative wonder.Pay attention to Elizabeth's words--I feel that she is most often voicing the thoughts of Jane Austen. There are many occasions where Elizabeth's character shines through. She is a complicated person, and did you notice, at the center, she combines aspects of all the other Bennet sisters in herself. It is as if Jane said, \\"Let us show in the sisters, what having one or the other trait, without a balance, might look like.\\"Elizabeth is multi-layerd.What can we say of Mr. Darcy except that he is Jane Austen's ideal man. He may not be your ideal man, but there are a lot of other men with other traits to choose from in the book, so plenty of variety, there. And, we admit, Darcy comes close to disappointing at several key moments in the narrative; he is allowed to keep his own counsel to such a degree that this fine quality almost becomes his personal tragedy. Isn't it funny how our best qualities can sometimes do that to us?Also, pay attention to Elizabeth's relationship with Mr. Bennet. Parents are not supposed to have favorites, are they? Yet, in a household of all daughters, you find that the two of them have a bond of love and sympathy that is endearing even when Mr. Bennet seems to be kidding, unobservant or flippant. He comes close to being the omniscient observer, yet, like Darcy, keeps his own counsel.Mmmm. Perhaps this has something to do with how Elizabeth is able to find and appreciate in Darcy qualities she has already admired in someone else...?Darcy is so well off that the reader is tempted to wonder whether Elizabeth has the qualities worthy of a Mr. Darcy. This may be why we have the interchanges with Lady Catherine de Bourgh. There is strength of character and nobility in both women, and we get an idea that in her youth, Lady Catherine may have been much like Elizabeth. We might even push the matter to suggest that in her old age, Elizabeth could possibly become as imposing as Lady Catherine. Or perhaps not, since there is so much of love and tenderness in her.I have tried to say all of this without giving any of the fabulous twists and turns of the plot away.Replete with bon mots, tender and surprising scenes, and characters that even when they are at their worst, are deeply loved by their creator - and us - this book deserves every paean of praise that comes its way.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read \\"pride and Prejudic\\" by Jane Austen a total of 5 times now, and it just gets better every time. This book is definately a classic. The characters are witty, and the story is timeless. \\"Pride and Prujudice\\" is an interesting love story involving a very proud man named Mr. Darcy, and stubborn beauty named Elizabeth Bennet. Together they create a conflict so strong that at one point, neither wants anything to do with the other. But their love for each other is undeniable, once they both get over their pride, and yes, prejudice against one another. They arent the only love story in this classic novel, however. Also fighting for love is Elizabeth's gentle, kindly older sister Jane. She has fallen for the very rich, handsome Mr. Bingly, and it is as if he is under a spell of her charm. Though his sisters try to tear them apart, they somehow find each other again before its too late. Still the question of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's love for each other remains, will they ever give way to their love for each other? Or will pride and strong will keep them from eternal happiness? Only time(and lots of page turning) will tell. This is one of few books that has kept my interrest and i hope it can keep yours too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. After getting a list of books to read from my teacher, my dad said this would be the perfect one for me. I was slow to begin, but once I got started, I was quickly consumed. It had everything a great story should have. This book reminded me of a Danielle Steal novel, but written much better, and surely not a beach read. It took time and effort to complete, but in the end, the novel was worth the hard work. This book taught me a lot about myself. Even more than that, a lot about who I want to be. When I finished reading and discussed this book with my dad, I told him that I wanted to be Elizabeth Bennet. She was a great protagonist to watch grow throughout the novel. She was a very round character, who was revealed in pieces, not showing the true whole self until the end. It was amazing for me to see how much I could relate to a story written so many years ago. I feel now like the times have truly not change much. Love is still love, loss is still loss, and friends are still friends. This novel was a true untimely classic. Although this story is about love, it is not all good times. It takes Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy a long time before they become lovers. There are twists, turns, broken hearts, and shy wit along the way. This book was one of the first that made me both laugh and cry. I came out of reading this book with a slightly different outlook on life as I had before I began. At some points I wanted to just jump into the novel, rearrange some things, and come back out. It was so important to me for everyone in the novel to be happy, and everything to work out as I had it planned. The literary value of this work in unbelievable. As young as I am, and even though I have not read that many classics yet, I can tell you that this one is worth it. My favorite parts of the novel were the descriptions of the beautiful rolling hills, the wonderfully decorated rooms, and the people. Austen must have had an amazing picture in her head when creating this work! She truly moved me! This literary work was enchanting. As great as the novel was, there were some downsides you should know before picking it up. Although beautiful, the language was difficult to understand sometimes, for me at least. It was spoken in strong 18th century English, and not always easy to comprehend. This novel takes you winding through the souls of two people, both filled with pride and prejudices, hence the novels title. The long journey to love, is far, and difficult, but in the end true love prevails."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Do not waste your money on this! I thought i would get a book that looks like the original 1813 edition (ie., a scanned version of an original 1813 edition) but it looks like someone just typed the original version into word. There is absolutely no difference between this edition and the free version or any other version of Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The \\"Enriched\\" Pride and Prejudice sits somewhere between the Penguin Classics editions, with introduction and endnotes, and the more comprehensive and scholarly-minded Norton Critical editions.

The only thing i miss is chapter-level TOC links for faster, easier reference and access (only the three volumes are linked). This, of course, can be amended by manaualy adding a bookmark when you reach each chapter.You can think of this enriched P&P; as a general reader's Norton edition. Or as a Warner Bros. DVD as opposed to a Criterion. Not as highbrow and stacked, but (more than) good enough. The well-set text and the supplements and notes provide a much needed added value in these times of freely available e-books of classic literature.... as for the novel. Jane Austen rocks, baby!note: somebody at amazon made a mistake, and the cover that appears up there is from the Oxford Classics edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.As much as I love Pride & Prejudice, I must admit that some of the words are now archaic and some of the references have become obscure due to the passage of time. ThePride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)edition provides helpful footnotes to help readers understand the nuances of the novel more completely.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Imagine, this was the first download for my new Kindle International edition. Here in Australia we pay $2 more per publication, this triples the price of a $1 book. So what is wrong with this book? Not the content which as we all should know is exquisite. This downloaded book serious sucks because it is badly formatted. Every second line breaks in the middle and paragraphs are separated by 2 lines. This is a classic formatting error. For the technical types, an incorrectly formatted text file was used to create this book. It has embeded returns that just should not be there. An incorrectly formatted book of this nature should not be on the Amazon store at all!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybe The Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane is prejudiced and Mr. Darcy is prideful, or is it Jane is prideful and Mr. Darcy prejudiced, or do they both have a bit of pride and prejudice, which lends itself to a delightful novel filled with social boundaries, romance, disappointment, and comedy.The movie inspired me to read this novel for the first time. However, do as I did and read the novel before seeing the movie. You will not be disappointed. The first section of the novel introduces you to the character, setting, and social rules, as well as acclimates you to Austen's style. Once you have moved into the remaining sections, the book takes so many twists and turns that you cannot put it down. Even after my third reading, I still love the suspense of what will become of each Bennet sister."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What do books do for me that nothing else does? The most important encounter that I have with books is that I identify myself with all the characters in the book. I see all the nuances of those characters as present in me. I experience all those experiences and I am not the same after that. I cannot remain unscathed. I have evolved into a greater human being. I have climbed another rung in the ladder of spiritual evolution. One book that I enjoy every time I read it is Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The book is the baby of a literary genius. The most compelling feature of the book is its non-violence. At no point is there any harshness. Of course, we must consider the period in which it was written. English was most poetic even in prose. Given that credit, the novel refuses to show anyone in bad light at the end of it. All of human frailties are shown as natural and well, human! Neither Mr. Darcy is the villain nor is Mr. Wickham. Each person is a consequence of the experiences he has had in his life. Jane Austen treats every character with gentleness. There is an understanding that every human being functions only within the level of awareness he/she has. That is the appeal of the novel. This is the kind of work Walt Whitman would have been proud of."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you can help it, read this book before seeing any of the visual versions of the story. I couldn't help but put the visuals from the BBC mini-series version of the story everywhere.

Was I ever wrong!While the language is more proper and formal than what we are used to today, and certainly the customs and arrangements are very different, P&P; is in many ways a simply timeless love story about two people who seemingly dislike each other at first sight, but who are truly so right for one another. A century or two will not diminish this romance!At the heart of the story is the Bennet family, a family that has been \\"cursed\\" with five daughters and no sons to inherit the family's home and estate - - lovely, softspoken oldest daughter Jane, spunky and spirited Elizabeth, bookish, serious, almost dour Mary, silly, giggly Kitty and flirty, precocious and spoiled Lydia. Mrs. Bennet's sole consideration and worry in life seems to be finding appropriate husbands for her daughters, mostly so that once Mr. Bennet dies, she shouldn't be kicked out of her home with nowhere to go. It will quickly become apparent to the reader that Mrs. Bennet's favorite child is Lydia, mostly because Lydia seems the closest reflection to Mrs. Bennet's character herself.Into this story comes the Bingley and Darcy families - - sweet, good natured Charles, who quickly falls in love with Jane, his critical, judgmental sister Caroline, who secretly yearns for marriage to Charles' best friend, Mr. Darcy, who seems uninterested in the entire endeavor.As with most romance stories, the road to true love is a bumpy one. Mr. Darcy, although obviously finding Elizabeth attractive, feels that her station in life is beneath his. Elizabeth finds his pride and aloofness infuriating. Jane and Mr. Bingley, although in love, are torn apart by his sister, who believes that a marriage to one of the Bennet girls would be most unfortunate for her family. Add the arrival of Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, who as the next male of kin will inherit the Bennet home - - and his frantic search for a bride and Mrs. Bennet's efforts to assist him; Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte, a spinster of twenty-seven who accepts what life has offered her and makes some difficult choices of her own, in order that she might be merely content with her arrangements; Mr. Darcy's haughty aunt, and Mr. Collins' benefactress, Lady Catherine De Burgh, who has serious aspirations of her own to make Mr. Darcy her daughter's husband; the seductive Wickham, who shares a secret past with the Darcy family and catches the impressive Lydia's eye, nearly bringing downfall to the Bennet family.All in all, this was an incredibly satisfying story on all fronts - - a rich character study, an earnest romance, and comedy. The ending seemed almost rushed and an afterthought - - but perhaps because I had fallen in love with the stories and characters, I simply did not want P&P; to end.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is timeless and never grows old.

The Penguin classic has decent size print and makes the effort to come as close to the original manuscript as is reasonably possible. What more is there to want? Also the price is excellent, so that it will not be difficult to replace after I have worn it out."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"By far one of Jane Austen's most celebrated novels, Pride and Prejudice exists as a groundbreaking novel that paved the way for entertainment today. Think of Pride and Prejudice as a 19th century daytime soap chock-full of deceit and motive. Without the novel, we would probably live in a world free from \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"The Hills\\". Well, I guess that wouldn't be such a tragedy. But overall, Pride and Prejudice displays Austen's precise use of the English language, coupled with intricate interpersonal relationships that are sure to keep readers amused.Pride and Prejudice centers on the Bennets, a middle class family living in 19th century rural England. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, is witty and attractive while her older sister Jane is shy and sensible. Their younger sisters, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia exist as foils; as they are immature and ridiculous. Also in contrast, Mrs.Bennet is scatter-brained and judgmental, while Mr. Bennet is serious and dislikes any frivolity.The Bennets' world is turned upside down when a wealthy gentleman named Mr.Bingley arrives at his country home in a neighboring town. Accompanying Mr.Bingley are his snobby sisters and his impolite friend Mr.Darcy. It is when the Bennets, particularly Elizabeth and Jane, begin to intermix with their upper class arrivals that the drama is truly set in motion. The characters from both economic classes experience love, heartbreak, deceit, loss, and the side effects of pride and social standing.For those readers who seek an action packed, plot driven novel, Pride and Prejudice is not for you. The novel relies on character development and there are several chapters where the plot remains stagnated. Also, it is difficult at times to decipher some of the text, due to the fact that it is written in antiquated English. Again, this book is not for you if you do not wish to interpret phrases such as \\"she fancied herself nervous\\" (page 7) or \\"a mixture of quick parts\\" (page 7).Although it is more of a difficult read and is often stagnant, Pride and Prejudice has remained a classic for a reason. The novel's romanticism and elaborate depiction of characters has and will continue to make it a favorite among readers."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"These little classic editions are perfectly sized (small) and handsomely built. And the price is RIGHT. They are my favorite reading books -- nice binding and pages. I also enjoy the occasional illustrations. And they look very nice on my bookshelf. I'm so glad Amazon is stocking them!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this audio version of the popular novel. I often play the CDs while I am driving and the time flies. Susannah York's animated reading of Jane Austen's novel includes voicing the lines of the various characters. Even though I have seen the 2005 movie and the 1995 TV miniseries, I feel I have a much better understanding of the various plot points after listening to this audio version. This rendition follows the book more closely, although it is an abridged version."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is, to put it simply, unequalled. Not many books come as close to perfection as this one does. Flawless prose, crackling wit, good drama, fully developed characters and a perfect plotline make this the best novel in the English language. You may argue with me if you wish, there is no other book that satisfies like this one. Jane Austen was a woman for all time and she was a genius in every sense of the word. She understood people. We are blessed to have with us this remarkable work. How did she pull it all off so beautifully?I do not write much because I think that you, dear reader, should get your hands on this one pronto and stop reading this brief, rather trite review that does not come anywhere close to revealing Ms. Austen's creativity. I have returned to Longbourne, Netherfield and Pemberley several times in my life and will continue to do so. If I have the good fortune to meet Ms. Austen in the after-life, I hope that she will give me an autograph. Or at the very least, give me a nod in my direction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently finished my 3rd reading of P&P;, and I cannot begin to say how much I loved it. This is one of those novels that you can read over and over and never get tired of because you find something new every time! One of the most satisfying experiences is just being able to go through it slowly and savor every little turn of phrase, though for me this was not possible until I had already read it and didn't have the urge to rush on and see how it ended. As for the novel itself, so many people have given a synopsis that it would be pointless for me to do so. All I will say is that if it sounds dull just from reading about it, I still would not give up because Austen is one of the few authors whose works are very difficult to give a plot summary for that does justice to the story.One other thing- I would also recommend this edition because it is one of the most pretty and elegant I have seen, yet still very affordable. A fan of Austen who would like to upgrade to a nicer edition of the novels should really consider Everyman's Library because there are few others that are more lovely or durable.In short, don't miss out on this wonderful reading experience!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most beautiful and well-written stories throughout the centuries. It isn't meant to be viewed as a serious tale, but is instead satirical, poking fun at the different conventions of society at the time. The heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, is well-developed and extremely likeable, as is her sister, Jane. Even Mr. Darcy, whom everyone dislikes in the beginning of the novel, is likeable in his somewhat clumsy love for Elizabeth. The struggle that Darcy and Elizabeth go through to finally admit their love is complex and draws the reader into the story even further. I must say that my favorite character is Mr. Bennet, because his off-the-wall humor had me laughing out loud several times throughout reading the book. I read this book when I was 13 and thought it was wonderful, and over the years it has become even better. This book is such a remarkable piece of literature that it only gets more interesting and more fruitful of a read the more times you actually pick the book up and read it. Jane Austen is a master of literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I read this Jane Austen novel, I couldn't help falling in love with it. The romance, which I think plays the main part,was overwhelming, along with the beautiful charactirazation and the so well-thought plot. This novel contains everything it should contain to be a bestseller, and a besteller it is, even almost 200 years after it was written. This book is a true recommendation for everyone who likes his or her books well-written and full of humor, love, intrigues, social developments and such lively and realistic characters. Somehing that struck me, was the fact that Elizabeth is such an quick-witted girl that is so modern for her time: she wants to marry for love, (which girl wouldn't want that?! it really is just like a fairy-tale) and she has got a will of her own. She doesn't like to be toyed with and she has got her feminin pride that makes her so strong. Should you be considering reading this book, don't hesitate and just grab it, and you will soon see: it grabs you!&lt;BR"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; Jane Austen creates an entire universe out of the circumscribed world of genteel British society. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family, consisting of a nervous and silly mother, her indolent and sarcastic husband, and their five daughters. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her daughters to marry wealthy men, especially since Mr. Bennet's property will go to a male cousin, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.Soon, a likely marriage prospect appears in the person of Mr. Bingley, who rents a nearby home in Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet hounds her husband to call on Mr. Bingley immediately so that the Bennets can make his acquaintance. To Mrs. Bennet's delight, Mr. Bingley proves to be a perfectly amiable and wealthy gentleman. However, his close friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is quite the opposite of Bingley. Darcy is a man whose arrogance and cold demeanor make him immediately unpopular with the Bennets, especially with Elizabeth Bennet, one of the daughters whom he particularly insults.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; deals with the preconceived notions that people have about one another and how these ideas wreak havoc with relationships. Austen also casts her astute eye on the social mores of the time which made both men and women slaves to convention. Marriage was not just a pleasant state for a woman. It was a necessity, especially if her family lacked the means to support her for the rest of her life.One of the most noteworthy aspects of this novel is Austen's lively cast of characters. Elizabeth Bennet is surely one of the most vivacious, witty, and entrancing heroines in British fiction, and she meets her match in the dashing, proud, and inscrutable Mr. Darcy. Austen's portraits of the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins and his overbearing and opinionated patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, are hilarious.Austen's novel is a high-class soap opera in many respects, with a myriad of romantic entanglements and much intrigue to keep the reader engrossed. However, it is much more than that. It is a masterful tale of how people deceive themselves and the traps that they fall into when they are weak-minded and easily manipulated by others. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is also a beautiful and romantic story of how men and women find their soul mates in spite of seemingly insurmountable obstacles."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If a classic is boring, then this is not a classic. If a drawing-room comedy is stiff and trivial, then this is not a drawing-room comedy. This is quite simply one of the loveliest, wittiest, most utterly _wise_ novels ever written about human relationships. Every word sparkles. The dialogue fairly dances. And Austen does this without any of the things that we often assume make for an exciting novel. The most suspenseful question that arises is whether a certain two characters in the novel have gone to Scotland or to London (this is suspenseful for reasons having to do with 18th-century English marriage laws and social mores). And this event, certainly the most sensational in the book, is really only important because it helps the two central characters make up their minds about each other. Austen's world is a world in which every detail really counts--in which the slightest look or the most insignificant word can have earth-shaking meaning. And the result of this, as of all great literature, is to send us back into our own worlds with the renewed conviction that it all really does matter. In that sense, Austen's &quot;realistic&quot; fiction is a lot like good fantasy, such as Lord of the Rings. By heightening certain aspects of our experience, Austen gives new life to the &quot;commonplace&quot; world we live in. This is a book that makes you feel alive, and glad of it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found Pride and Prejudice an engrossing and well written novel. The book gives modern readers insight into the Victorian society, morality, and etiquette. The novel is made up of fascinating, well-developed three-dimensional characters. I loved Darcy and Elizabeth; although both were flawed people, they also had an essential humanity and goodness to them that made me root for them to get together. I thought the way Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy evolved was very realistic. I admired Darcy's love for his sister, and his strength, while finding myself frustrated by his arrogance and aloofness. I thought Elizabeth was a heroine modern women could relate to - she had fire, confidence and forthrightness.I also enjoyed the complex relationships between the various characters, be it Jane and Elizabeth, Elizabeth and Mr. Bennett, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. What I liked was that even the characters we weren't meant to like, such as Lady Catherine, were not one-dimensional (this isn't the case in Mansfield Park). I was just as interested in finding out what would happen to Lydia and Jane as I was in the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. The one complaint I have here is that I wish that Darcy and Elizabeth had gotten closer sooner, so that the conflict with Lady Catherine could have been a bigger part of the novel. There were events that I wish had occurred earlier so that more time could have been spent on them - the novel got off to a slow start.That said, overall this novel has much better pacing than other classic literature I have read (notably Mansfield Park). The author does provide a great deal of detail and description, but she is such a good writer, and the prose is so captivating, that I didn't mind at all. The dialogue is superb. The novel had a lot of charming, funny moments. The uses of satire and irony were exceedingly well done; Austen is the master of this sort of comedy of manners."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my all-time favorite book, and believe me, I've read MANY novels. Jane Austen has excellently captured human nature here, and all of her characters reflect the environment they grew up in which was determined by the social classes of the time period.The main conflict of the book is based on the interactions between these social classes, which is reflected by the title. The prejudice and pride of BOTH the upper and middle class is what the story revolves around, but it isn't the action and intrigue that mark this book, it is the characters that make this &quot;Timeless Masterpiece.&quot;Elizabeth Bennet, whose liveliness and quick wit have often attracted readers, is the main character from the middle class. Mr. Darcy is her counterpart from the upper class. These two drive the book, adding humor and depth with every word.Everyone over the age of 12, including BOTH males and females, should read this book. This isn't a silly romance novel for young girls, it is a classic masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. It has so many levels. On the surface, it's a book about 5 silly airheads who chase men &amp; go to parties. They obsess over all the single men in town &amp; how much money the men have. On a deeper level, you see that women in that time period had no rights. They couldn't even own their own home. Their very existance depended upon finding a suitable husband. Of course they were interested in catching a rich man!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It doesn't get much better than Pride &amp; Prejudice, people! A smart, witty, and sarcastic heroine like Elizabeth Bennet, a man like *drool* Mr. Darcy...and the burning question: can they overcome their first impressions of each other? My absolute favorite book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been listening to several of the classics on audio book this past year and finally grabbed a copy of Pride and Prejudice. I have never read this novel before, but have seen a couple of movie versions of it and really liked the story. This version had decent reviews, so I gave it a try. I was not disappointed.The reader was Kate Reading who did an excellent job capturing the characters and what I imagined the accents for that time and place would be. I found myself drawn into this novel and was always anxious to listen once again. I normally just listen while I'm driving but found myself listening at home for a few hours.Jane Austen's writing style and characters are very captivating. I found myself recognizing some of the characteristics of the characters in people I know and liked how she showed strengths and weaknesses in the major players. I especially liked the father's subtle sense of humor. I will definitely read more of her books.I strongly recommend this audio book for anyone wishing to enjoy literature at its best. Men as well as women should like this type of romance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed this audiobook overall, but found the reader's voice a bit annoying. I often found it difficult to focus on what it was that she was saying. The other thing that I did not like was how many tracts were on a CD. Each CD is divided into 100 tracks. Great if your listening to it on the CD, but a nightmare if you want to put it on your favorite MP3 player."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", first published in 1813, is considered her best novel. It continues to be a fertile source of material for television and film adaptations. First marketed as a romance, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" might today be labeled a romantic comedy. Its enduring appeal lies partly in Austen's biting and still relevant social commentary on the rituals leading to marriage as practiced in Regency-era England.\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a good wife.\\" So begins the story, as the five eligible young Bennet daughters and their scheming mother learn of the arrival in their small English village of a wealthy young man and his wealthy friends. A village dance provides the opportunity to meet the newcomers. The wealthy young man, Mr. Bingley, quickly becomes attracted to Miss Jane Bennet, the pretty, even-tempered, but reserved oldest sister. Elizabeth Bennet, the spirited and headstrong second sister, meets but immediately dislikes his seemingly haughty friend Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is more interested in the charming young Army officer Mr. Wickham, who feeds her derogatory stories about Mr. Darcy that she is all too prepared to hear. As the relationship between Mr. Bingley and Jane deepens, Elizabeth is ardently courted by her cousin Mr Collins, an obnoxious and clueless clergyman. Elizabeth, to the despair of her mother, will not have Mr. Collins, who instead marries her spinster friend Charlotte. When Mr. Bingley suddenly departs the village without proposing to Jane, Elizabeth soon suspects the proud Mr. Darcy of curtailing the relationship based on Jane's lesser social status. While visiting Charlotte, Elizabeth is astonished to receive a proposal of marriage from Mr. Darcy, which she refuses in the most scathing terms.This failed proposal is the dramatic crux of the story. Mr. Darcy, mortified by Elizabeth's refusal and by her accusations with respect to his pride and his actions toward Jane and Mr. Wickham, writes a long letter to her. The letter, if not exactly an apology, makes clear that Wickham's accusations were false, and that Mr. Darcy's actions in separating Mr. Bingley and Jane were based on the perception that Jane was less enthusiastic about marriage than her intended partner. Elizabeth begins to realize that she has been guilty of prejudice as well, a feeling reinforced by a chance meeting with Mr. Darcy and his adoring sister at his home of Pemberly in Darbyshire. When Elizabeth's flirtatious younger sister Lydia elopes with Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy will have the opportunity to prove his character and his love to Elizabeth.Austen's novel contains a huge cast of well-developed characters and a series of cascading social mishaps, yet the story remains tightly focused on the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They are attracted to each other fairly early in the story, yet are unable to appreciate each other's qualities for pride and prejudice.Underlying the humor in the social mishaps is a grim economic reality of Regency England, that failure to make a good marriage could doom middle class women like Jane and Elizabeth to a life of poverty. For Elizabeth's friend Charlotte, still single at 27, a loveless marriage to Mr Collins brings the saving grace of financial security. Lydia's elopement with Mr. Wickham not only disgraced her family but threatened to make her sisters ineligible for marriage as well. The Bennet family's lack of social standing and manners was a serious barrier to the making of good marriages, a fact less obvious to today's readers.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" features a engaging plot, lots of excellent dialogue and two classic romantic characters in Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a combination that holds up astonishingly well nearly two hundred years on. It is very highly recommended to fans of the various Jane Austen film productions as the entertaining source of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Classic, timeless, beautiful fiction. Perfect for young and old (I've read it a dozen times, but it was also a great gift for my niece to introduce her to classic literature)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that neither wants in the beginning but both can scarcely resist by the end. Other subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own and the various doings of family and friends. This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of the characters and their actions.The two main characters are probably as well fleshed out as any you are likely to see. They are certainly complex and multi-layered and they both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. The supporting characters are considerably less deep and are almost uniformly caricatures more than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written as it is a romantic drama and these secondary characters are all part of the tapestry that allowed Miss Austen to skewer her contemporaries so effectively. There are a few times where I thought a character's behavior was over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really enjoyed the sense of humour and the plot. The action is developing very slow so if you are not fond of this kind of a plot you might not like it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know that my daughter will always remember getting this lovely book on her 18th birthday.

It took me a while to read it, about 2 months, because it's definitely not fast paced. I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand.Mr. Darcy is \\"pride\\" and Elizabeth Bennett is \\"prejudice\\". These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves. This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns.I really like Mr. Darcy. He is the perfect gentleman. He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge. He also doesn't retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn't do or that are misunderstood.Elizabeth is also wonderful. She is doubtful about people and quite cynical. I really like that about her. It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly. This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him. Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself. I would probably be charmed by him too!This book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Regency England."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can't believe it took me until my mid-thirties to read this book. What is equally astonishing is the elequence Miss Austin was able to write this book at the young age of 21. Let me first speak to the well-done character development. The author does a great job of creating likeable, interesting characters. You have to love Elizabeth Bennet and her boldness. You must also love: Mr. Bennet's wonderful sense of humor, Mr. Collins' silly behavoir and what a haughty b*tch Mrs. de Bourgh is. Secondly, the author is very crafty in unfolding a plot in which the reader fully understands how their could have been lots of misunderstandings between Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Very well-written and entertaining. Don't wait as long as I did.

And Prejudice.The story has been dissected, narrated, adapted and recycled about a thousand times. Yet, for a plotline that is relatively simple and quite predictable, this book remains eternal. Jane Austen's vivid and witty prose makes you wish the book could be longer and that Elizabeth and Darcy's courtship would stretch out fifty (or hundred with Austen's descriptive style) more pages!This is one of the best novels ever written.

But overall it was understandable.As some people have stated, I did notice a lot of typos in the free Kindle version. It was annoying to have such a thing, but it was free & didnt make me love the story any less."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of my favorite Authors of all time if your looking for a classical romance this is a must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"So...what to say about this. Well, it surely is a girly book since the majority of the story is about romance. There are also themes of family, marriage, society, class, etc. The story was pretty good but boring in some parts. However, the ending really left me wanting a sequel. It made me want to know about *spoiler* the life after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. I also wanted to know how Darcy's sister will turn out and if she will also find her fated one. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet's situation in life is also greatly altered. It would have been interesting to see how they will get along and if there would be any rekindling of past fires or not. The two unmarried sisters can also be a topic of exploration, especially Kitty seeing as to how civil and improved she's becoming. I will miss Elizabeth and Darcy's witty conversations and I would have been delighted to read about a jealous Darcy. A sequel would have been perfect. Seriously, it would have been fun to read about their life after marriage and if they were going to have any kids or not. Then maybe there would be someone new in town who would intimidate Darcy and fight for Elizabeth's affection, which of course, can only belong to Darcy. Ohh! The possibilities are endless! How I wish for a sequel. Before anyone else writes one though, I will have to be satisfied with my imagination. I am aware of the fanfiction sequels out there, but there will never be a true sequel to this book. I'm also curious as to whether Elizabeth would conform to the upper class or not. Wonders if she improves her piano and other skills like the arts. And their kids.....would they be more like Elizabeth or Darcy? Hmm...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had borrowed this CD set from my local library, and the narration by Nadia May is so wonderful, I had to buy a copy for myself.

The delivery was very quick and without problem. This was only my second order on Amazon and was very pleased with all aspects.Signature Classics - Pride and Prejudice (Signature Classics Series)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is, in my opinion, the best novel Jane Austen wrote, although Mansfield Park follows close on its heels. And while there are a few spelling and grammatical errors here and there in the kindle edition, it is worth it to have it on kindle. This fast-paced story is hard to put down, and if you have not yet read it you really should give it a try. Forget the many versions you may have seen of the movie, which even the best of does not do justice to the novel, and sit yourself down with this for a wonderful ride. Humorous, witty and entertaining, it is well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is said that a good work of fiction represents the ways and manners of the people during the period when it was written. Being the case, I have a number of observations:1. The conversations feel that the parties involved are having an oratorical debate. It was an art in itself. Obviously, nobody speaks this way anymore. The language was so lyrical, very personally addressed, either face to face or through a proper letter.2. It was a time when ladies were expected (as dictated by good manners, decorum and propriety) to have knowledge of the arts and music. In contrast to the present time, parents and elders lovingly cultivate/develop the natural talents of their children. For those with no natural inclination, it is openly accepted as such, and never forced. At least this is what I have observed in general.3. It is a good thing that women of the present time share an equal footing with men (at least in many parts of the world), that they are not just relegated to marriage when they become of age. Imagine being set for marriage the moment a girl turns 16, with the mother almost in panic if her daughter is not engaged by the time she's twenty!4. What a closed and judgmental society it was during that time. The elopement of one daughter to an \\"undeserving\\" man ruined not only her reputation but that of her whole family as well, in the process making her other sisters almost unfit for marriage.5. Fifty miles of good road equals half a day's journey by carriage! Thank God for the automobile!I enjoyed this novel a lot, though it took some time for me to read because of the lyrical prose, which I am not so used to, and also the typos. Just the same, lyrical prose and all, it brought about the same excited feelings as when I read modern chick-lit fiction. I would have rated this a complete 5-star if not for the many typos in the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a novel to be read time and again to descipher new innuendos and witty remarks. The characters are beautifully crafted and the relationships they form complex. The novel remains an important social and historical commentary. It is an easy and charming book to read for young adults and rich and complex for those who want to re-read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen has been made into several movies, and remained apart of High School reading lists for decades. It is a heart warming book that discusses family dynamics, true love, money, social order, first impressions and reputation.The story is told primarily in dialogue. This is perhaps why it has been able to be adapted into several movies. It is the story of the Bennet family and their romantic entanglements. Jane Bennet and her relationship with Mr. Bingley, as well as Eizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The interactions between Miss Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are simply priceless. The famous proposal scene, and the line, \\"You are the last man in the world I could ever marry!\\" make this book an absolute gem.The only flaw with this book is the under developed characters. Only Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through changes. Even though the characters are under developed they are unforgettable. From Lady Catherine to Mr. Collins they are all very different. Read this book you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those novels which most people know the plot and the characters even if they haven't read the book. For myself, I had not read it in a long time, and I had also not seen any of the movies made using its plot, with the exception of the musical \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" a few years ago. I finally made time for it, and it was better than I had remembered. This was the second of Austen's novels to be published (published on January 28th, 1813), though the original novel (titled \\"First Impressions\\") was written between 1796 and 1797. There is no way to determine how much of the original novel remains and how much was rewritten, but clearly the two dealt on a larger scale with the some of the same themes.The main character of the story is Elizabeth Bennet who lives with her parents and her four sisters in the fictional town of Meryton. Elizabeth is the second eldest of the sisters after Jane. Outside of the Bennets, there is a large cast of characters including the three Bingley's, brother and two sisters, Mr. Collins, The Darcy's, Lady Catherine and her daughter, Colonel Fitzwilliam, the Lucases, Mr. Wickham, and the Gardiner's who are Elizabeth's aunt and uncle. The novel is told in three volumes, the first covers the period at Meryton where most of the key characters meet for the first time, the second covers the period after Bingley leaves Meryton unexpectedly along with those who came with him, and covers the period up to Elizabeth's visit to Mr. Darcy's home know as Pemberley, and the last covers the visit to Pemberley right through to the marriages and beyond.There are several plots running through the volumes. There is the relationship between Bingley and Jane, which Mr. Darcy tries to put an end to, along with the help of Mr. Bingley's sisters. There is Mr. Collins attempts to marry either Jane or Elizabeth, but ending up with Charlotte Lucas. There is the relationship between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy as well as between their families. There is Lydia's scandalous running off in volume three. But by far the mail story line is the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In volume one, Mr. Darcy arrives as the guest of Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy's prideful manner results in a negative first impression with Elizabeth whose pride is hurt by his attitude and she develops her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy as a result. Mr. Darcy becomes intrigued with Elizabeth, but her own negative impression of him is reinforced by stories told by Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy's silent attitude towards her which she takes as his looking down on her. Thus, first impressions play a big role in the story, though to be sure other first impressions, such as the first impression of Mr. Collins which is shared by nearly everyone are fairly accurate.In volume two, their relationship develops. Mr. Darcy cannot ignore the feelings he has developed for Elizabeth and this results in three key events in this volume. One is Mr. Darcy's declaration of feelings to Elizabeth. The second is Elizabeth's stern rebuke of Mr. Darcy's feelings followed by an attack on his behavior towards the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley as well as Mr. Darcy's treatment of Mr. Wickham. This leads to the third key event, which is Mr. Darcy's letter to Elizabeth where he sets the matter straight about his actions. The second event results in Mr. Darcy writing the letter and changing his behavior, though we don't witness the latter until volume three. The third event is important as the reader is privy to Elizabeth's change in attitude resulting from what Mr. Darcy has told her.In volume three, their relationship completes its change, as Elizabeth gets to know Mr. Darcy from where he lives, and by those who work for him, and she also learns about his character from actions he takes on behalf of her family, which he never means her to learn about. We also witness the change in Mr. Darcy's behavior, not only towards Jane, but towards her entire family. Of course, it is obvious that the two will end up together, but knowing the end does not spoil the journey.There is good reason why this book is a classic and why it is still read and enjoyed today. The characters are believable and well rounded for the most part. There is humor, societal and family challenges, and moral lessons weaved together throughout the book. I can also recommend the Penguin Classics edition of this book, as it contains an introduction and notes by Vivien Jones, as well as an introduction written by Tony Tanner for an earlier edition of the book. The introductions are both interesting reading, and the notes are useful as well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Book:Dover Publications does it again. This has to be the ultimate reasonably-priced edition of Pride and Prejudice you could ever get your hands on. Don't be fooled by the image of the stuffy dust cover; underneath the beige paper is a red cloth-bound, gold-printed cover which would enhance the finest library. The endpapers are embossed with a floral design, which is a lovely touch.This is a republication of an 1894 edition, in which the typography is perfect - that is, there are fewer words to a page making it easy on the eyes, while your progress through the book goes rapidly through its 476 pages. The paper is high-quality yet lightweight, which is great for a large hardcover like this. But the best features this edition has are the original Victorian-era illustrations by Hugh Thomson. Just...beautiful!The Story:Reviewing a classic like this almost feels silly, so I will do so briefly. The story moves slowly from \\"interesting\\" to \\"greatness.\\" For the first third or so it seemed like a funny, lightweight girly-gossip novel, and I kept thinking, \\"This book has got nothing on Jane Eyre!\\" Then it took a twist, and another, and got complicated, and the characters were developed, and the story darkened and I got totally sucked in until I could not put it down. Yep. Classic. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I feel fully unqualified to pass judgment on Jane Austen, it is true. But I thought I'd add my voice to the chorus of acclamation that has attended it for decades. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book--a masterpiece because of its writing (difficult and archaic, but beautiful), its plot (excellently woven and fully believable), and its characters (in whom Austen has perfectly captured the tendencies and caprice of human nature). It is lovable, enthralling, candid, and resonating.I don't like writing reviews that make the product sound flawless... except in this case, where I really believe it to be so."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice has long been my favorite book. But I must say, this edition is my favorite. The side notes are helpful in clearing up details that of the era which we don't understand. I would definately recommend this edition of Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel begins with one of the most recognizable lines in literary history: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" With that begins, perhaps, the most copied plot-line in human history. Sisters Elizabeth and Jane Bennett are of a marrying age. When a handsome and wealthy young man comes to stay in their neighborhood, the Bennetts waste little time making his acquaintance. It turns out the handsome newcomer, Charles Bingley, is a fine and friendly gentleman and he has a liking for Jane.Mr. Bingley's cohort, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is, however, not nearly so friendly. Cold and formal, he quickly incurs the dislike of Elizabeth. Mr. Darcy, though, appears somewhat taken by Elizabeth and makes some half-hearted advances. Despite his great wealth, Elizabeth distaste grows the more she learns of Mr. Darcy's past.Just as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley appears set for matrimony, Mr. Bingley suddenly leaves the neighborhood. Certainly, it seems, this is the doing of Mr. Darcy. Jane's hopes dashed and Elizabeth finding only comically unsuitable suitors, the Bennett sisters are headed for old-maidom. That is, unless the terrible events are due to improper pride and/or prejudice.Though I am not a great Jane Austen admirer and find much of her writing overly ornamental and preoccupied with unimportant subject matter, there is no disputing the greatness of this novel. The language usage is clearly Austenesque, but this book is nevertheless genuinely a page turner. Moreover, the tone is pitch perfect - touching the emotions, but maintaining an appealing comic feel. I found myself delighted to be in the company of Jane Austen who, though her writing is over two centuries old and her experiences obviously much different from ours, has a surprisingly modern voice.Even more importantly, this book is an invaluable cultural gift. Though perhaps not in the same league as the Bible or some of Shakespeare's works, the influence of Pride and Prejudice on our culture is simply vast. Familiarizing yourself with Pride and Prejudice will make literally hundreds of cultural products more comprehensible (or reveal them to be unoriginal). The plot-line alone has spawned countless imitations, slight modifications and commentaries. The characters, especially Elizabeth and Darcy, have become veritable archetypes. This is one of those stories that you are already familiar with through its imitators. None, however, has done the material so well and so thoughtfully as Ms. Austen.Even if you don't have the stomach for Ms. Austen's other material, this novel is worth reading. It's both good for you and an enjoyable read - often a tough mix to find."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Never fear this is not a novelization.

The cover is lovely, the binding is solid, the paper is thick and matte, and the font is legible.This book is to be read, loved and proudly shelved for display.

I think Austen was brilliant in this book because she is able to write so well about (and let's face it, fellow Austen fans--) such a mundane story line! The plot is very simply the story of five un-wed sisters and their very normal life at trying to get engaged. That's all there is to it. Why, then do we find this work so intoxicatingly enchanting? It is because of Austen's brilliant way with words...her descriptions of her witty heroine and handsome hero.If you like this book, I highly recommend reading Emma by Jane Austen and my other fave-- Jane Eyre. :) I give this book six stars!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austin wrote a story set in what i originally thought of as a boring period in time. Her story, however, is about five daughters and their love lives. The parents in the story are funny(the father is very sarcastic and the mother is obsessed w/getting her daughters married well off). I was surprised at how easy it was to read and how much it reminded me of modern teenage drama."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is definitely a book I would want my daughter to read. I first read it in high school and can not get enough of it. I love the characters and storyline. It is amazing the way she writes. I love watching Elizabeth and wishing she was a 90's woman who could tell Darcy what she really thinks without worrying about the do's and don't's of her time. I live for the ending when Darcy calls her his most dearest Elizabeth. Romantics this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This work is just wonderful and once you've read it, you can't forget it.

Not only did I find the character development incredible, but I also enjoyed how Austen brought in other themes such as extreme embarrassment caused by relatives (haven't we ALL been there...)the ability to laugh at oneself, the empathy for a family member that has been wronged and regret of a decision. I liked this book so much that I went out and rented the A&amp;E production and liked that so much I bought it. This is one story I will revisit again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I saw the 1995 tv series before I read this book, and I think that was good. Although the book is better than the series, I don't know if I'd fully understand the sarcasm and irony in the description of the characters. I despise Mr. Collins, but I also find him very amusing. And I admire Elizabeth for her honesty to herself and to others. Despite the fact that it might seem trivial at first, Jane Austen wrote a truly remarkable book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P&amp;P is one of my favourite books.The attention given to minor details and the portrayal of both Lizzy and Mr.Darcy is very endearing.I loved the witty remarks and the satire in the descriptions.I think Austen's command of the english language is enviable.Each sentence has it's own significance and there is no line in the book I would have omitted. I particularly liked the scene between Lizzy and Lady Catherine where Lady C demands a promise of her-that of never agreeing to marry Mr.Darcy-every dialogue is so well thought out and even though there is so little of a story to relate,the way the book keeps you rapt with attention is amazing! Whenever I feel lonely or left out this book makes me feel like a part of all its frolicking and ball-dancing.I think that is the power of an author-to be able to make a reader empathise and live thro' the pages. I am still living in the glorious days of Pemberley and Netherfield!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice so many times that by now I should have the book memorized. But, I don't. Instead, I cringe every time Elizabeth Bennet refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal and sit in suspense as I near the part where I think he should propose again. What if this time, they don't meet by chance as they ought? Or what if Mr. Darcy decides not to propose again? What if Elizabeth doesn't realize how wonderful I know he is? Jane Austen is the only author who captures my imagination so vividly every reading; I love her for it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this story! The characters are so consistent and so very realstic, it's amazing. You can't help but admire them, not only for their realism, but for who they were, and especially Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, whose opinions changed so very much, and how they came to accept each other. Not only is the main plot excellent, but secondary characters such as the droll Mr. Collins and the imperious Lady Catherine are real gems. This whole novel is well worth taking the time to read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first started this book I thought I would find a novel with alot of old time english and bore.

I first read Pride and Prejudice when I was 6-7 (I know, a little young, but I love to read), and I loved it. I've read the book 12-13 times, seen both big TV miniseries and the Laurence Olivier movie adaption, and a stage adaption. It remains on my list of top ten favorites. I love everything about it. I love the charming Edwardian language, the character's, and the plot. This book is not a girly fluffy book, even though the plot is a bit of an old one (who knows, maybe the plot came from J.A.?). I fell in love with Darcy and Elizabeth from the very start, and I still love them. I've read this book at least once every year since I first read it, and it just get's better every time. I laugh in it, which is unusual for me, I rarely laugh in books, even funny ones. What more can I say? If you haven't read it, then you ought to, don't just watch the movies. The only thing is that I've never found a guy who has willingly read it, and I've never found one that liked it. What's wrong with our guys?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely hated &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; when I tried to read it in high school. While I absolutely loved romances and novels set in the 19th century, when I attempted &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; I got as far as the scene where Elizabeth strolls around the room with one of Mr. Bingley's sisters and thought that all this walking up and down was the stupidest thing anyone could do and quit reading it.I didn't start appreciating Jane Austen until I read &quot;Persuasion&quot; for a graduate history class that explored how the concept of womanhood changed between the late 18th century and the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign. Our goal was to examine whether the new Victorian ideal of womanhood was something women themselves embraced or a role thrust upon them. And at last, I began to appreciate Jane Austen.By the time I got around to rereading &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; Emma Thomson's delightful adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; had made it to theaters, and I was old enough to appreciate that love at first site can be a disaster.Jane Austen may have been the first novelist to write about love from a woman's point of view--and wrote at a time when marriages were becoming more about love and not just financial considerations. Throughout many of her novels, Austen struggles with whether money should matter in matters of the heart. She seems to want to say that money shouldn't matter, and yet recognizes that when a young woman's entire future depended on her husband's financial status, money still had to matter.&quot;P&amp;P&quot; begins with the wealthy Mr. Bingley renting a house near the home of the Bennetts, a family with five daughters, no sons and an entailed estate that would have to pass to the nearest male relative. Much to her daughter Elizabeth's frustration, Mrs. Bennett immediately begins plotting ways to snag Mr. Bingley for one of her daughters. At a party, Elizabeth first encounters Mr. Darcy. Overhearing his criticism of her immediately gets them off on the wrong foot. As the novel unfolds, Darcy and Elizabeth discover each other's true nature, and eventually misunderstandings are repaired, and they develop an appreciation of each other. The pacing of &quot;P&amp;P&quot; more realistically reflects the growth of true love than many novels that I've read. Austen's witty commentary about courting rituals makes the book highly entertaining.To enrich the experience of reading &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; pick up a copy of Fay Weldon's &quot;Letters to Alice Upon Her First Reading of Jane Austen.&quot; Weldon's collections of essays to her fictitious niece enrich the experience of reading Jane Austen's novels by exploring what makes certain works absolute classics, what life was like for women in the early 19th century, and what Austen's life was like as she was writing these novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One thing I have learned form reading this book and then reading some reviews, is that one can either hate it or love it. Or love it and hate it at the same time.In my case, I loved the tale, it is one of must-read classics, and who ever enjoys romantic novels of any sort will fall in love with the story.Jane Austen, a great author, certainly has captured my heart making this tale to remind me of love when everthing else doesn't."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book! I read it first when I was 11, and hated it. I thought the language was stuffy and the plot contrived. But then I read it again when I was 15, and it has quickly become my favorite book. I reread it every few months. However, those who don't enjoy a fast-paced plotline, beware: the action is slow. Just make it through the first hundred pages and you'll gobble up the rest. For guy readers, I can only say that this is one of my father's favorite books; whether he is abnormal or just romantic I don't know, but anyhow this is such a good book that it should be required reading! Also, for anyone who did not like the slow action in the book, you must see the BBC movie with Jennifer Elhe and Colin Firth. I promise you'll love the book after seeing it (not to mention Colin Firth). Thanks for reading my review; now go read P&amp;P!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Last Fall I saw a A&amp;E version of P&amp;P. I enjoyed the movie. If I had not seen the movie I probably would not have finished the book. The problem with this is that one can not develop their own picture or opinion on the characters.What I liked the most was the amount of wit displayed between the characters interaction. It is a true book about people. It is funny, charming and romantic. It really opened my eyes to society in the 19th century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You must read this book, especially if you are just beginning to explore the world of classic literature. Out of all of Jane Austen's work, this is the best. It's pace and structure are perfect, the characters are so well defined that you could recognize them on the street, and the prose is delicious. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Can anything be better than reading Pride and Prejudice? I feel so stupid about myself now after having seen by my own eyes the creativity, the skills, the intelligence, and the passion for love that another being of my race can possess, and even more embarrassed that that person has also a heart so good as to venture the task of puting all these into use in a single book of unbelievable plots and conversations. I suggest you not to read any reviews here at all, for they will spoil the elements of surprise.OH, how much I wish I can love like them!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a very well written novel by Jane Austen. When i first began to read it, i thought i'd instantly hate it. i'm not a big fan of romance novels, but i decided to give this book a try. I was delightfully suprized with the vivid language and great dialogue which Austen used, and the novel kept my interest better than i had ever expected. from the famous opening lines, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife&quot;, to the wedding at the end, this was a great book. At some points, i got confused py a paragraph, or even chapter, and i had to re-read it carefully so i could fully understand the authors point, but other than that, i could comprehend the book easily. It is the first romantic book that has ever kept my attention, and i hope this will inspire me to try other books that i would otherwise walk right by without giving it a thought. The book did a very good job of developing the characters, as well. By the end of the book, i felt i had a good grasp on who's personalities Jane Austen wanted to emphasize, and what each character's roll in the plot was. Overall, i feel this was an excellent book, and i would reccomend it to enyone who loves to read, even if you're not a reguar reader of novels such as this one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a wonderful piece of literature. I have never read a truly great book until this. I have loved many books that I have read, but this book is beyond compare. As soon as I began reading, I became engrossed in it. I finished this book so fast it felt like the book was only 100 pages. I t was such quick read that I read approximately 250 pages in one weekend; I couldn't put it down. I strongly urge everyone to read this book, whatever the age. I am only in ninth grade and even now I'm able to understand its literary value. Although I can speak highly of the novel, there are some things that I can criticize. The most complicated aspect of the book was the language. At some points I had to go back and reread a passage to fully understand it. It is true that the language is beautiful, but frankly, I find it confusing. If you are not up to the challenge of figuring out the meaning of some different words, do not read this book The only other aspect of the novel that at times seemed irksome, was the long passages in which there was little dialogue. These passages sometimes contained Elizabeth's thoughts and observations, but it was the parts other than these that bothered me. The long descriptions of the fields and rooms bored me. This was unnecessary because it did not advance the plot or carry a large amount of importance. When a new plot line suddenly came into existence, this would be weaved in. In moments of suspense I just skimmed through these parts because they were not entirely related to the plot. My favorite plot line was the development and change of people and their feelings, especially love. This novel genuinely showed me how humans' feelings towards one another change, along with their judgments and prejudices. Throughout the novel the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy profoundly changed in enjoyable ways. Additionally, these changes describe the title, which I found most appropriate. When we first met Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy he was presented as aloof, cold, and full of abominable pride. As the story progresses we see a profound change in his character, which commences when he professes his love for Elizabeth. After this, we begin to see the real, improved Mr. Darcy. By the end of the story Elizabeth even says this about him, \\" Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable.\\" By overcoming his pride he leads Elizabeth to make a few changes of her own. Elizabeth is the character that I feel made the most significant changes throughout the story. I feel this way because she altered two major things in her life. The first, which I feel led to the second, is when Elizabeth realized her prejudice and surpassed it. She does not find this out about herself until wonderful Mr. Darcy places a white envelope in her hands. After reading what was inside the envelope she describes herself as, \\" blind, partial, prejudice, absurd.\\" The second thing that changed about her was her feelings towards Mr. Darcy. Over several months her feelings for Mr. Darcy grow fonder each time they meet, until she realizes her overwhelming love for him This is a classic love story, which I believe deserves much attention. In one word, this story is enchanting. The story of the Bennet girls will be one I will treasure forever. Finally, I will never forget the way Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy came together and overcame, their pride and prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is not only an epitome of classic literature, it is actually interesting. I bet if they made a poll, the people who read this book would be happier in life than most. I love this book so much. Ms Austen truly made a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was a very slow going book, but a very good one anyways. I enjoyed and hated the running arounds of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I wanted them to fall madly in love (finally) and everytime that I thought it was going to happen something got in the way. It was a terrific book and I enjoyed the ending the most! :) I would recommend it to anyone with a high tolerance for boredom and also one that has a lot of time to actually read the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is just AMAZING! Once you begin to turn the pages you just can't stop! I've read it five times and I still read with the same number of heartbeats(which must be like 1000 per minute!) Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books in the world. I just love the story of five sisters and their foolish and funny mother who thinks about nothing but marrying her daughters. Mr Darcy ,who marries Elizabeth, is my all time favorite male novel charachter. His passionate love for Elizabeth and his incredibly romantic nobleness will make him a favourite with female readers.There are people who consider the book boring , but if it is because of the Victorian English I think it just makes the book more classic and valuable."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"First of all, let me start out by saying, I love this book! I'm 17 years old and Pride and Prejudice has been my favorite book for years. It was the first work of Jane Austen's that I had ever read and it prompted me to read her others. In my opinion, Pride and Prejudice and Emma are her two very best. Her characters are so well-developed that you feel like you actually know them. Elizabeth in P&amp;P is an amazing and intelligent young woman. She has so much spirit that it's admirable. Darcy is intelligent as well and he has a self-confidence that makes him very attractive. The plot is always moving, always interesting. I've read P&amp;P so many times and I never get bored. Everyone should have this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This timeless classic by Jane Austin is probably the best illustration of why we should not let ourselves be guided by first impressions. Most previous reviewers have considered only prejudice itself to be the theme of this book, but I am convinced that this was not all of Miss Austin's theme (though it was a major part of it), but rather she was also showing the folly of judging people by our first impressions of them. Elizabeth (the main character), judged Mr. Darcy by her first impression of him (which was bad). She let her opinion of him be decided by this first impression, thus she was prejudiced against him. I think most people tend to focus on the prejudice and pass over the step that leads to it. Also, the same thing happens with Mr. Wickham. She lets her first impression of him (which was good) guide her opinion of him, which later turned out to be completely wrong, just as she had been about Mr. Darcy.Now, do not mistake me, prejudice is a major part of this book, but I think it is important to note that Miss Austin is not just showing us the effects and foolishness of prejudice, but even deeper, she is showing the precursor to prejudice, which is (in many cases) judging by first impressions.As for the form of this book, I thought it was very well written. There was no action whatsoever, unless you include going for a walk in your definition of action. I found it incredible that Miss Austin was able to write in such a way as to keep one's attention for hundreds of pages while including (almost) nothing but dialogue and very minor events.I also loved the believableness of her characters. Almost every character strongly reminded me of someone I knew, they were so like real people, which is very rare in novels, especially in Miss Austin's era. I think that Mr. Bennet quickly became one of my favorite fictional characters with his wit and dry humor, and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were very good characters as well. Mrs. Bennet was, as I suppose was Miss Austin's intention, very annoying and frustrating, even to the reader. Somehow the characters in this book were just more \\"real\\" than they are in most books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit Pride and Prejudice is one of those many books I \\"spark noted\\" in high school rather than reading. It wasn't that I wasn't an avid reader, just at the time I more enjoyed silly sci fi books. Looking back I'm very happy that it isn't until now that I've read this book, because now I think I am more able to fully appreciate it. The characters are very well developed. Be them witty, silly, meddling, proud or prejudicial, they are all a pleasure to get to know and explore. The story as a whole, and the way it is presented to the reader is wonderfull. This is, to date, one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. (And any one who disagrees should be immediatley taken out back and shot, or at the very least pitied for their simple-mindedness.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful book. Don't let anyone tell you it's not. A review in here got me thinking though. They said there is no such thing as books that are better than others because it's all subjective. This person is wrong, simple as that. Certain books are not literary towers because people have said &quot;wow! amazing!&quot; people say that about Harry Potter! I mean really! What distinguishes a book and makes it &quot;better&quot; than others, is if it's around in fifty, one hundred years. Pride and Prejudice has done this. It is &quot;better&quot; than other books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admired Darcy the first time I read this book at the age of 12 and yet now again at the age of 31 after having reread this book, I find myself surprised to experience the same feeling.Yes, he is pretty disagreeable in the beginning, but then I find people who don't intend to impress everyone to be more honest in the long run. Darcy's character grows on one as one goes forward in the story.As for Elisabeth, she matures remarkably, in general I find the book very realistic , we are all full of pride and prejudice when we meet people and they prevent us from seeing many of their more valuable qualities."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can still remember the act of reading this book, during a rather blase summer vaction in the middle of my college years. It inspired me greatly, maybe because I identified with Darcy, and thought that I could be a hero, too. For whatever reason, I enjoyed it thorougly."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A MUST READ for Austen fans!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen is a wonderful omniscient author and has a delightful perspective on people's traits and character. She realized that people are complex, and included their different sides in these characters. It's a feel good book, and we need those once in a while. Its like a mature fairy tale. This is my favorite book, however I only give it four stars because it didn't pose a challenge or have me ready to change the world, however I enjoyed this enduring love story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"I\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" This is the opening that initiated the whole story with a click, that not only addressed the theme of this book, but also of a \\"universally acknowledged\\" truth.In my long search for a literary classic that I could both enjoy reading as well as get something out of, I finally ended up with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", by Jane Austen. Upon reading the first sentence of this book, I was immediately captured by the story liveliness and soon found myself hooked. In addition to the lively, vivid tone of the book, what enchanted me the most was the seamless way in which each character behaviors and interactions were so carefully woven together in an intricate plot.Some characters that appear in the book are:- Mr. Bennet, a brilliant, sarcastic man who likes to ridicule the silliness of his wife- Mrs. Bennet, a middle aged woman who is eager to marry her daughters off to rich and prosperous families when they come of age- Their five daughters:- Jane, who, being the eldest, believes in human good and righteousness in all human beings,- Mary, their third child, who is always absorbed in books thinking about this and that- The shy Catherine, also known as Kitty, who always followed her flirtatious younger sister, Lydia around in flirting with officers.However, all the characters and indeed the whole story revolves around Miss. Elizabeth Bennet the second oldest sister, a witty, headstrong girl, and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, a very queer, shy man. At first sight, Elizabeth's assumption and observation towards Mr. Darcy pride made her prejudiced against him. Yet in the end an unexpected twist ends this book in a very satisfactory manner.Although many readers especially teenagers might be \\"prejudiced\\" against reading the old \\"classics\\", I found this book to be quite interesting. This book gave me an insight on the thoughts of the people during that time period, and some hints how they were suppress or discriminated by the class system."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like others, I came to this novel after years of it being pushed upon me like a drug. \\"Read it, you'll love it!\\" It took several starts and a snowy winter far from home to finally render the book's period drama understandable. As a student and fan of women's history, I was initially drawn in not by the plot of the story (though it is what soon carries you through to the delicious conclusion) but by the fascination of viewing family life in another time. As with any period piece, geographical, political, and mannerly allusions are lost without some historical understanding of the time. Not every \\"great book\\" is for every person. Also, PandP is very much a romance; you must be willing to romanticize to truly appreciate Eliza Bennett's struggle and change of heart. So don't feel you must read it just because others tell you to. But if you find yourself in a wistful mood, ready to be immersed in another world, give this one a try. Chances are, it will lead you to a minor obsession with Jane Austen.Extensions of the original: If the recent movie starring Kiera Knightley was enjoyable, the book will be more so, with richer details and more drama. Also recommended as a companion is the fullest dramatization of the book, the BBC's version starring Colin Firth. And for a chick lit homage, read the Bridget Jones books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this is definitely an amazing piece of literature. i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come. i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book. the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes. i believe that the subtleties and simplicity of the story is what makes it the masterpiece it is. Jane Austen's ability to turn a simple love story, into something greater, while completely engrossing us without the fluff of a typical romance are what make her a literary genuis in her own right. her novels are literary dessert. they aren't filled with the complexities and deep themes of dickens', hardy's, or eliot's works, they are light-hearted and this very fact is what makes pride and prejudice an amazng piece of art. Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. The characters, their lives, the struggles they face, the decisions (and indecisions), and most importanty their eventual happiness are what make the book. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love Jane Austen's books and Pride and Prejudice was the firts one I read and I fell in love with it.

The book is difficult to plod through, but once you get used to the intricate writing and you look past the rather uninteresting plot, you'll be surprised when you really start enjoying yourself.Pride and Prejudice is a classic in its own right!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice turned out to be a well involved tale of drama and romance. At first the book runs slowly, sometimes getting off the point and losing interest, but in a whole, when you finish reading the last page, you know you've read something great. The book truly tells a tale of pride and prejudice. Along with the many other stories involving other characters, the main interset is about two people- Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth along with her sister Jane and others are all finding their way into marriage, when two men Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come along. Mr. Darcy at first appearence is a crude proud man who does not involve himself in social confrantation, while Mr. Bingley comes to be a charming well wittted man. The story continues on with marriage proposals, refusals, and devious scandals. In Pride and Prejudice, many characters develop. Jane Austin creates their stories very well but sometimes as I was reading, I felt that there were too many people and I found it hard to keep up and get involved with it. But in a way, that was also the beauty of the story.So if you are intersted in this book, you have to be willing to be patient. But it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy?s marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be ?It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife? which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth?s romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice centers around the Bennett family, mainly Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest of five sisters. Throughout the novel, family relations, economical issues, humiliation of making a mistake, and falling in love are thoroughly described amongst all of the characters. Three of the five sisters marry in the book while encountering pride and prejudice of position or status. The eldest daughter of the Bennetts, Jane, falls in love and marries a man named Charles Bingley. She is the second of the three daughters that marry during the story because of a delay caused by Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy who had initially made Bingley think Jane does not love him because of her poor economical status and family relations. However, it is also Darcy who later convinces Bingley to finally marry Jane out of his own love for Janeas younger sister Elizabeth. After both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth overcome their pride and prejudice against each other, they are also married. Elizabeth is the third daughter to marry. The first daughter to marry is Lydia, who foolishly elopes with the untrustworthy George Wickham whose primary intention was not to marry her, but who eventually agrees to the marriage on terms agreed to by Darcy and Bingley. The novel describes the pride and prejudice that all of the characters manage to overcome in order to live contentedly.Although the language used in Pride and Prejudice was difficult for a fourteen year-old, as I kept reading it became clearer and easier to understand the 19th century speech. The womenaes rights that Austen presented were beyond her time and I developed great respect for her. The message about overcoming pride and prejudice and marrying not for money but for love was very powerful and I felt that it was appropriate to be read for a humanities class because it was closely related to the topics we have been going over in class. Overall, I thought that Pride and Prejudice was a very well written and entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Originally entitled First Impression, Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice is a sophisticated love story, elegantly portrayed during the 18th century. Satirizing the Victorian woman's quest for an ideal husband, Austen's witty humor provides much amusement for the reader. The complex plot and the dramatic lives of the Bennet family enable the reader to become engrossed within Austen's masterpiece.The points of view of the novel are shown through Austen's usage of the limited omniscient as well as first person accounts, which are shown through personal letters of the characters. Her unique literary style enables the reader to better understand the mood and dramatic emotions of the characters. The letters intertwined throughout the book, advance the plot and greatly invoke the interest of the reader.Although all the characters contribute to the entertaining quality of the novel, the most auspicious were indeed Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. With Elizabeth's out-spoken manners and Darcy's arrogant yet shy persona, both characters were quick to judge the other based upon their first impressions. As the novel progressed, Elizabeth's humor and charm, not only won over the reader but Darcy as well. We also enjoyed Darcy's evolution from a shy and rather self righteous aristocrat, into a kind, endearing, as well as understanding man. His interactions with Lizzy provided conflict and laughter. Mrs. Bennet's \\"nerves\\" also served as our source of amusement.This intellectual novel entails deception, love, comedy, and above all, a glimpse into 18th century society. We enjoyed the conclusion, in which Austen meets our satisfaction by tying all the loose ends together. Despite it's title, the characters of the novel overcome prejudice, but never lost their pride."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have wanted to read the classics of English literature since I did not do so during college. Because I am not in college, I do not have any need to have an edition with critical essays and copious notes about different versions of the book. A simple book with the story in front of me was all that was necessary. Wordsworth Classics filled the need quite satisfactorily.This edition has the complete text and not much else. The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book. There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult. It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.The particular story starts with the famous/infamous line \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Given this, and given Jane Austen, you know that you are in for a tour of marriage in old England. Austen's sketches of her characters are so well done that you can't help but hear the dialogue in your head in the voice's of people you are familiar with. Jane Austen understands how people work and is a very astute observer of human nature.In these pages you will follow the trials and tribulations of Jane and Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and the rest of their families and acquaintances. The read is well worth it. The reading is engaging and will keep you turning pages.

There is plenty of humor as well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book! The romance, the humor, and the characters we can all connect with set this book apart from other classics. Jane Austen was a genius... who doesn't want to be Elizabeth?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It as a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen, in possession of a good novel must be in want of a reader.Undeniably one of the greatest authors in classic literature, Austen begins her classic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, with her renown truth. Ironic, amusing and romantic, Pride and Prejudice still offers many delights for the modern reader. Whether it's flighty Lydia, brooding Darcy or the imperial Lady Catherine, you can fall in love again and again with her diverse cast of characters.Pride and Prejudice is essentially seen through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennett, second in a line of five daughters, gifted with a dry wit and clever conversation. The novel primarily follows her and her sisters movement though the social sphere of the 19th century, though social climbing, manners, and the strict regulation of \\"proper behavior\\". When Jane Bennett falls for Mr. Bingley, the fur starts to fly and Lizzy and Jane are forced to fight for each other and for the men they love.While Austen's text captivates and seduces, this edition constantly diverts the reader with it's countless footnotes. While these could be beneficial to a reader unfamiliar with British Society, the definition of \\"Militia\\" and its explanation of the significance of Gretna Green bordered on insulting. Though the quotes and opinions on the text in the back of the book were interesting and refreshing, the sheer magnitude of footnotes (generally explaining something well-known or easily inferred) distract greatly from Austen's stunning success.While Pride and Prejudice in itself is a work deserving far more than five stars, this Barnes & Noble edition cannot qualify such a rating."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was looking for a hard back book and was happy to have found one, when it came I was very disappointed that it was a bed book. I had never heard of the bed books before and I can't get used to the sideways printing. Amazon should make it clearer that you are buying a bed book and not a normal book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In my opinion, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's best work. I think it is one of the best books ever written, and one of the very few perfectly told stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" focuses on the Bennett family --- Jane, a quiet and demure woman whose angelic countenance matches her sweet and giving personality; Elizabeth, a level-headed lady with slightly more temper than her older sister, and a level of good judgment that sets her apart from other women of her set; Mary, a bookish girl with little talent to speak of; Kitty, a weak-minded creature who allows her flighty youngest sister to rule her life; Lydia, a hopeless flirt with no thought for anything other than fun and men; Mr. Bennett, who likes to retreat into his library and bury his nose in books; and Mrs. Bennett, a foolish woman whose primary goal in life is to get all her daughters married off to rich and handsome men. A simple family living in the country whose lives are turned upside down by the arrival of a wealthy young man into their neighborhood.Mr. Bingley, their new neighbor, instantly takes a liking to Jane, the oldest sister, while his best friend, the proud Mr. Darcy, spends his time trying NOT to like Elizabeth. As Mr. Bingley gently pursues Jane, he finds he gets little or no help from his friend Mr. Darcy or his own sisters, Louisa and Caroline --- who schemes for Mr. Darcy's hand herself.Set against a vivid backdrop in various locations around the country, Austen covers all kinds of English society. Her colorful, lively characters take this story all over the place, having their own adventures and learning about themselves and about life. Jane learns that not EVERYONE is sweet and charming. Elizabeth learns that first impressions can be misleading. And Lydia experiences a dangerous kind of life that should never have been embarked upon, and which lands her in a very sticky situation.Jane Austen has a keen sense of the ridiculous and loves to poke fun at her characters. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has one of the most delightful array of interesting characters ever to grace the pages of a novel --- the oh-so-charming Mr. Wickham, whose past is a mystery; the Gardiners, Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, who see much more than they let on, and understand its significance; Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's friend; Mr. Collins, the Bennetts' cousin, an oily clergyman who marries Miss Lucas after Elizabeth categorically refuses him; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, aunt of Mr. Darcy, a proud and unpleasant woman who likes to rule over and frighten others.Austen tells her story with the best mix of drama, wit, charm, humor, intrigue, and romance I have ever seen. The story is writted seamlessly, unfolds brilliantly and ends perfectly. The entire novel is beautifully written, with an elegant, charming style as only Austen can write. It's the perfect addition to any library!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin is a very interesting novel. It not only tells but also, shows what young women went though in the 18th century. Elizabeth Bennett faces many expirences that women go through today. From getting maried to dealing with friends, family, and men from a day to day basis. Elizabeth has seven sisters who are also going through the same expirences. She is closest to her oldest sister Jane. They seem to understand each other the best. The mother is the most interesting charatcter out of the whole novel because she wants the best for her daughters and tries to live their lives for all seven of them. Elizabeth does not let her mother do this and in the end her mother disowns her. This novel teaches what is worth in life and what is not.You should only do what is right for your self and on one else.This novel gives you hope that in any life you can become your own self and not be criticized for your own actions or how you think. This is a great novel and if you read it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love Pride & Prejudice. It's one of my all time favorite books. Therefore, and because it was free, it was the first book I downloaded for my Kindle. I have to say I found some typos in the edition. I'm not sure who's uploading these things but I don't like not being able to trust the content."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love my Kindle, but was hopeing to read a famous classic without any editing, meaning reduction, of the text. This edition is so poorly edited as to be confusing at some points, when, for instance, suddenly we are reading about a previously unintroduced Miss King, who is mentioned and then forgotten. There are no descriptions of clothing, very little of scenery, none really of homes/estates. The book consists of conversations, which are terrific due to the author's skill, and the bridges that get us to those. How can I get an unedited, unabridged copy of the book? That should be made clear when we order these \\"free\\" books: they are vastly edited. If that's not what you want, don't get these."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P&P is a book I come back to every couple of years. I first met Mr. Darcy and Miss Elizabeth Bennet when I was a young teen. I never tire of this book. For anyone who has only seen the movie, I urge you to read the book as well. Nobody writes like Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is considered a \\"classic\\" for many reasons. For one thing, it deals with themes that are still very relevant in our society today. The ideas of pride and family relationships are both important factors in every day life today, and help bring the book to life. Also, the characters in the novel have many character traits that are exhibited almost 175 years after the book was originally published. Aloof, rich people, flirtations, young women, and social, eligible bachelors are common types of people even today. By incorporating characters such as Mr. Darcy, Lydia, and Mr. Bingley into her story, Jane Austen has kept the book popular for hundreds of years. The plot is very interesting and keeps the reader engaged from start to finish. A family living in the British countryside that is almost continuously worried about marriage may not sound like an intriguing plot to many people, but in fact the plot is fascinating.Somebody who read the book might be a little bit disappointed by the fact that it was written 175 years ago. This affects many aspect of the novel and radically changes how the book is written. Although most of the vocabulary and style is easy to understand, every now and then there is a small section that is hard to understand. In terms of themes, the obsession of young people with marriage is not as apparent in today's society as much as it used to be. Finally, various decisions in grammar and punctuation may make the book more difficult for some people to read. At some points in the novel, such as letters or other dialogues, the whole page may be filled without any paragraph breaks. This makes for a more intimidating reading experience and may serve as a deterrent to people who are considering reading the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book, everyone had kept telling me to read it and I kept putting it off, then I saw the film and I read the book and I loved it. The language was a bit difficult to begin with, but I soon got used to it and it was well worth the effort. The book's very funny and the story's excellent, all in all a must read.If you want more, there's a book out called Darcy's Diary by Amanda Grange and it tells the story from Darcy's side, so you see the things you don't see in Pride and Prejudice, like Darcy going to London to track Wickham down, and it also goes on after the wedding, so all in all another good read. But make sure you read Pride and Prejudice whatever you do!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is and will always remain to be an all time favorite romantic comedy in the history of American literature. The story never fails to emphasize on the ethical manners played out in the 19th Century English society, an existence in which wealth, social status, and love prevailed lucidly in pithy marriages. It also differentiates with our human behavior in the modern world, how much we have changed in a sense.The emotions and intentions of the characters in this book are beautifully written and brought to life as they are living life to the rules of respect and manners. I highly recommend this book to all ages interested in reading romantic classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Love love love the book.

The incredible depth of the characters and the richness of the detail creates a wonderful read. However, should you find yourself lost in the middle of the forest with only matches and this book in your hand in dire need of light and warmth, don't hesitate to rip out several pages from the middle of the book, gather a few branches and start a fire... you thus will have the light to read by, and know the start and the end of the story.

It is actually the book on CD. This would have been great, except that it is abridged. This book is one of the great classics. I do not think that it is appropriate for someone today to decide what parts of a book written in 1813 are important and what are not. I did not actually keep and listen to this selection. I was not interested in having PART of Jane Austen's great work. Therefore, I suppose that this can not actually be called a review of the CD, only of the case."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know Jane Austen was a famous author but this book was written 200 years ago.

In short: love the book, hate the formatting.There are many typographical errors from simple typos to random line breaks in the middle of paragraphs, often following a title (Mr./Mrs.). For some reason the book is void of italics and emphasized words are in all caps, which is rather ANNOYING, don't you know? The errors haven't kept me from reading, but they are an irritating distraction.If I knew of the slipshod manner in which this book was transcribed I would have just sprung for the $0.89 version. In fact, I think I will now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I might be wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed. I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I. The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book. You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not detract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing.There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the wordswhere we Americans would more likely use is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress. Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S. Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat his opponents."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Since reading this several decades ago, it has been my first favorite book.

It's wonderful!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an account of society in the early nineteenth century. Austen primarily focuses on the ridiculous pressure to marry. She does an exquisite job satirizing or \\"poking fun\\" at the extreme views of those who lived during that time. She gives the reader a good look at how truly important first impressions are and how love can conquer all. Austen develops her main characters Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, with very conflicting character traits. These conflicting traits allow the build up of tension between these two characters. This gives the novel a pleasant amount of intensity that leads to an ousting ending. Austen sucks you into a thoroughly enchanting world, making the novel impossible to put down. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy intellectual wit and have a soft heart for romance. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderfully endearing novel that is bound to touch women of every age."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought it was absolutely amazing!

The Bennet family women, destined for poverty, vie for the attention of men belonging to a higher social status. Due to the mother's greedy nature, the affections of these men have been turned away. However Jane, the oldest daughter, finds the affection of one man, Mr. Bingley, only to lose him when he is convinced by his good friend Mr. Darcy that she does not love him. In an attempt to reclaim Mr. Bingley's affection, Jane moves to London to be nearer to him. In the midst of this drama, Lizzie finds herself smitten by an Officer whose negative opinion of Mr. Darcy influences her greatly. Because of this, the resentment that Elizabeth harbored towards Mr. Darcy from moment she met him is magnified. Lydia, one of Elizabeth's younger sisters, fails to act in a socially acceptable manner involving the Officer with whom Elizabeth was smitten. This behavior leaves the family vulnerable to public disgrace. Through this course of events, Elizabeth discovers the Officer's malicious nature, and her opinion of Mr. Darcy begins to change. Will the Bennett family women attain their much longed for higher social status or will they experience the repercussions of Lydia's careless decisions? Is the prideful demeanor that Mr. Darcy displays an indication of his true character? Has Elizabeth's prejudice obstructed her chance for true romance?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels. I was the first novel of Jane's that I've read and I could not put it down. The suspence and humor of this book makes it great.... you must read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this book my senior year in High School and I was afraid that it would be a boring, long read. But I was so wrong! It's an amazing story of...well pride and prejudice! Jane Austen is very witty and I found myself laughing and sighing and worrying as I read. Elizabeth is a wonderful heroine that you find yourself relating to and wishing to be! What a life those young women must have led! And Darcy, well I fell in love with him immediately. You can't get any better than Darcy when looking for a man who would do anything to protect and help you. I loved reading about the cynical Miss Bingley and her sister; silly Lydia and Kitty; obnoxious Mrs. Bennet; and hilarious Mr. Collins. This book is my favorite classic! I strongly recommend reading it BEFORE watching the movie!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read many, many novels including all of Jane Austen's; and still there is nothing to compare to \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is unquestionably my favorite novel of all time, and what I consider to be the 'perfect novel.'and I've decided to break down the aspects that I think make it so.The Characters:Elizabeth Bennet is my favorite literary heroine of all time, for the simple reasons that she is probably the most consistent, well-rounded character that I have ever come across. Not to mention that she is extremely likable. Mr. Darcy, though not a very intricate character compared to Elizabeth, is undeniably well thought out, and perfectly drawn. But, for anyone who has read this(I think I can speak for just about everyone)there are three particular characters that are memorable, and even lovable, just for their perfectly delightful absurdity; Namely Mrs. Bennet whose \\"sole object in life was to get her daughters married; and it's solace was visiting and news.\\" Then there is Mr. bennet's pompous cousin Mr. Collins, whose proposal to Elizabeth is one of the best scenes in the book. Finally, there is Lady Catherine, Mr. Darcy's haughty Aunt, whose class consciousness, and condescending airs are wonderful!The Plot:A simple love story, and a Cinderella story at that. Though there is no really important issues covered, no intellectual depth to fathom, it remains one of my favorite plots, becuase it flows so easily, there is no awkwardness, is tied together so well in the end; there is nothing I would ever dream of changing.The Diolouge:This is it's absolutely flawless point; the diolouge is perfect; perfect and consistent with each character, it moves the story along, and charms the reader non-stop.Language:Who can resist a novel that makes frequent use of the words:folly, felicity, ductility, oddity, and every other charming \\"ity\\" Austen uses.I really can say nothing else. I have read this book so many times I have so many different perspectives, so many opinions on it, have so much to say that I could not possibly say it all, so I decided to take the literary view, and build on that. All I can say in conclusion is go out, buy this book, and read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's stories have endured for years, and this one is probably her most famous work. It is a story about an empty-headed mother and her search for proper husbands for her five daughters. The book is a prime example of the manners and morals of the gentry in a small English village in the early nineteenth century. Ms. Austen does such a good job of displaying these strictures and morals in her novels, that to us in the present day it appears to be an entirely repressive era (which it actually was). The plot and the characterizations in this book are wonderful as in all Ms. Austen's works, and it tells a dazzling story. It is a charming and wonderfully warm tale that I never tire of reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is not your ordainary 19th century novel. It is so much more. Elizabeth Bennet and Fritzwilliam Darcy are the most amazingly interesting characters that I have ever come across in any work of literature. This is a book you can not put down and will be coming back to for years and years to come."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As I read Pride and Prejudice, one thing struck me--that I reacted to the twists in the plot rather strongly. I laughed aloud at the wit; I smiled at the *ahem* 'cute' romance; I shouted at the characters when they missed obvious signals and acted like idiots...but such as it is, lets just say that I was truly affected by this book. Touching, witty, and with happy weddings in the end...in short, a true Austen novel. I found this book immensely enjoyable to read, and it is among my top ten favorite books of all time (although, I must admit, my 'top ten favorite books of all time' list is often prone to change, as I am not very old and shall devour other books yet)...Nontheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever liked any other Austen or Austen-like book, as this is perhaps my favorite written by this particular author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read three incredible books lately and NONE of them were remotely connected by theme, style, or author. &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; was the first, &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; was the second, and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was the third. While all were excellent, P&amp;P was so great for me, simply because I didnt' expect it to be great. If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. Also try &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and &quot;Song of Solomon.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an amazing book; when I read it I just can't seem to put it down. This edition which is published by \\"Penguin Classics\\" proves to be a wonderful read because of the information included in the back.Ms. Jane Austen does an impeccable job of describing the characters in the story. Each one has their own distinct personality which is part of what makes this book such a classic. Mrs. Bennet is especially cute, the way that she is always talking about the fact that she'd like her daughters to marry, and seems to think that it would prove to be the pinnacle of her life if one of them married into wealth. When Mr. Collins comes into the picture and decides to marry Charlotte, he can't stop praising the house in which will one day be his.This is where the book really picks up. At the conclusion of volume one, an individual is left only to imagine what could possibly be happening with Mr. Bingley and his beloved Jane.In this charming love story, two people learn to \\"get over themselves\\" and develop feelings for one another."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I welcome this new edition from Penguin Classics with expanded notes.How does one demarcate pride and prejudice, or bias and stubbornness? In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen deftly exposes the folly of and further ridicules judging by first impressions.When Elizabeth Bennet first met the fine, tall, handsome eligible bachelor Fitzwilliam Darcy, she immediately deemed him arrogant, conceited and utterly obnoxious. Her first impression of Darcy, who was initially looked upon with prodigious admiration, was quickly assured as his conceited manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity.Darcy's conceit and selfish disdain of the feelings of others formed the foundation of Elizabeth's disapprobation on which succeeding events had built so inevitably a hatred. When she later found out Darcy had deliberately altered Bingley's opinion of her beloved sister Jane and determined to separate them, she was determined to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy.In the comedy of manners that follows, Austen, in a superb manner and prose so elegant and lyrical, verbalizes the stubbornness, bias, and prejudices of Elizabeth toward a man whom resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of his admiration for her escaped him. Despite the fact that he struggled to maintain his composure, in his breast there existed a powerful feeling toward her, which soon procured her pardon and directed his anger elsewhere upon Elizabeth's weighty accusations of him.Pride and Prejudice presents us a romance comedy with a modern feel and touch. The opening of the novel Fitzwilliam Darcy is blackened as the most obnoxious snob for whom \\"there is not another woman in the room who it would not be a punishment\\" to him to stand up with. To Elizabeth, almost all of Darcy's actions \\"maybe traced to pride\\" and \\"pride had often connected him to virtue.\\" No sooner had Darcy's superiority of mind (pride) been fully exposed than Elizabeth's prejudice was revealed.Unlike her sister Jane, Elizabeth was more hasty in censuring anyone (especially Fitzwilliam Darcy) and never supposed the possibility of any extenuating circumstances in the case, let alone urging the possibility of mistake and misunderstanding. In confronting Darcy of his inexcusable act of separating Bingley and Jane, Elizabeth judged from assumptions, suspicions, and the biased first impression. In a sense she sought to discredit Darcy and the relation of events that might be capable of a turn which must render Darcy blameless throughout the whole affair.When Elizabeth finally considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided Darcy, her anger and indignation was turned against herself and Darcy's dejection (more or less disappointed feelings toward her) became object of her compassion. Elizabeth's folly and rashness also become object of our compassion. How awful her petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting Fitzwilliam Darcy.Pride and Prejudice evokes the fact that human nature is prone to pride and very few of us do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or another. Pride usually relates more to our opinions of ourselves, of which Elizabeth has epitomized. Pride is the real superiority of mind, when along with stubbornness, bias, and determination, would casue irremediable regret. The novel also evokes the friendship, the values of marriage, and snobberies of English middle-class life in the early 19th century. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Fast and quick delivery. We also saw the movie so I can enjoy the book the more. I hope to enjoy this for years to come.

It is an amazing piece of literature, and I never cease to be amazed how many people can call it boring. For a story where surprisingly little actually does happen, with each read I cannot put it down. Each time I wonder if Mr. Darcy will be able to capture Elizabeth's heart, and I am always tickled when he does. I still get as choked up, and laugh just as much as I did the first time. Even compared to Austen's other brilliant works, I find Pride and Prejudice far superior.I also beg all lovers of its adaptations to actually read the novel itself. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have been looking for books on CD (long drive to work) and thought I would try this abridged version of Pride and Prejudice. I happen to love Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice is a fantastic novel. However, this abridged version lacked some of the best aspects of the original story. They cut it down to 3 hours (can't be helped, I guess) and, therefore, the story really only deals with Elizabeth, Jane being a mere afterthought. The other sisters are barely mentioned. I am looking forward to when someone realizes that there are customers out there with CD players in their cars and they would like to hear the UNABRIDGED version of popular and classic books. I also felt that Jenny Agutter did not distinguish that well between characters, Mr. Bennett sounded just like Lady Catherine.

This important book makes us face the experiences and effects of exile. Anyone who wants to understand Chile and its people should read this book. At the memorial to the disappeared and politically executed in Santiago's General Cementary, there is a stone with the message &quot;Para que nunca mas,&quot; which orders us to never let such suffering happen again. As one of the contributors told me, we must know his experience so that we will not repeat this tragic part of Chile's history."},{"Title":"Flight from Chile: Voices of Exile","review":"The book, &quot;Flight from Chile: Voices of Exile&quot; is a compelling account of life in exile told by the exiled themselves. The authors interviewed 33 Chileans who fled, or were forced, into exile following the military coup of 1973. The exiles came from many walks of Chilean life, including politically involved moderates and leftists, individuals active in social programs that were deemed &quot;threatening&quot; by the military regime, and even former members of the military and security forces. The exiles dispersed around the globe and the book does an excellent job of illustrating the difficulties they had adjusting to new and alien cultures whilst constantly thinking of home. Many of the exiles have since returned to Chile in what can only be considered a &quot;bittersweet homecoming&quot; and the book powerfully illustrates the changes that occurred in Chile and in the exiles themselves during the intervening years. The recent social unrest in Chile, resulting from the arrest of former dictator Pinochet in Britain, illuminates the volatile emotions still present in a country struggling to come to terms with the horrors of its past. In light of current events &quot;Flight from Chile&quot; is an even more powerful documentation of the human tragedy of political exile and its social consequences."},{"Title":"Flight from Chile: Voices of Exile","review":"I see that there is a used copy for 50 cents. That person probably feels the way I do about this book. I know one of the people that testifies and what is reported is very dramatic, very romantic and almost pure fantasy. And if there's one very rotten apple in the barrel. . . we need to assume, unfortunately, that they're all rotten. I expect fact checking if this was intended as a document, a primary source or as non-fiction.

Otherwise I'd a been a \\"Stage-door Johnny\\" for Eleanor Powell. She was -- as Frank Sinatra said in the \\"That's Entertainment\\" DVDs -- the greatest, and we are unlikely to ever see such elegant excellence as the best boy-girl tap dance ever done (first the paso-doble to Cole Porter's Begin the Beguine, then the jazz tap version to Artie Shaw's Clarinet.) Alice Levin has captured this in a dandy, easy-reading book laced with pictures of that beautiful hoofer. This is not a dry listing of tidbits, but a glorious feast for those who are young at heart, love musicals. Those were the days just before WWII, but still in the Great Depression, when \\"The Movies\\" and its Stars made America Sing! And Dance! And nobody, as is nobody, was better or more athletic a female tap dancer than the delectable,compellingly female and drop-dead gorgeous Eleanor Powell.

From the very first page you are engrossed in the plot and it's intriguing characters, who draw you into their lives. The novel begins on the shores of Lake Michigan where a series of seemingly unconnected brutal murders begin with the deaths of a police officer and several mob members caught in the crossfire of warring Mafia factions over a prize of two million dollars. What started in Wisconsin continues across the country and into Europe. The author's vivid imagery makes the scenes seem alive. You see the waves crashing against the rocks at Smuggler's Cove and feel the ambience of the locations visited. The plot snakes and twists as you try to discover the identity of the psychopath perpetrating the murders and his motives. I started reading this book and couldn't put it down until the very last page. I liked the book so well, that I did some hunting on the web to see if I could find another novel by this author. It appears that this is his first book. I can't wait for another book to be published by Mr. Bartholomaus, and will probably be one of the first in line to buy it."},{"Title":"Reflection of Evil","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

In addition, you'll find medical cures, cleaning how-tos and the directions for making many types of wine.This is not your typical cookbook, it should be considered a piece of history. From Nun's Puffs to preparing Souse Cheese, ingredients are more often than not measured in pounds, quarts and pinches then cups and teaspoons. One can only wonder what the taste buds of the people were like then. Sheep's Tongue, Beef Heart, and Brown Calf Head's Soup....you'll find proof why people did not live as long as they do now.I own several cookbooks from this era but this book had the most dessert recipes then any of the others. Vegetables are canned or cooked; I did not see anything that was used fresh such as in salads. Pickling to store for the long-term was very important. Fruits were often made into jams or jellies.

It is much, much more. The book contains lots of special tips and techniques that will help both flight simmers new and experienced to get a lot more from the game. I think that the book will greatly improve knowledge of the game and of aviation in general. As well as giving detailed and useful information on Flight Sim 2000, the book also covers lots of great real flight information. The book also covers playing Flight Sim 2000 on the MSN Gaming Zone.

These three works, two by foreigners, form the groundwork of a basic understanding of the American system of government. Such an understanding is basic to good citizenship. The lack of such an understanding is sadly demonstrated every day by America's journalists, professors, politicians, and average citizens.Reading Bryce's \\"Commonwealth\\" seems a formidable task at the beginning, since it is two volumes with a total of over 1600 pages. Yet once you begin, Lord Bryce's style is so natural, almost conversational, and the material so interesting to anyone with the slightest interest in American history and politics (and shouldn't that include every American citizen?), that it is actually a very easy book to read.Bryce was Scottish, born in Belfast, Ireland. He became an attorney and a professor of law at Oxford, then a member of Parliament. He was Ambassador to the United States from 1907 to 1913, became a viscount in 1914. He was very well-traveled and well-known in the US, about as well-qualified as anyone could be to write a description of the American form of government. Because of his reputation as a friend of America he had an important influence on the US entry into World War One on the Allied side.The first volume covers the national and state governments, the second volume covers the party system, public opinion, and various aspects of American political and social life. The first edition was published in 1888, and it was last revised in 1914. Over the years Bryce made many revisions as his observations and knowledge of America broadened and deepened.Bryce explains exactly how American government works. A listing of some of the more significant chapters will give an idea of the subjects covered:Chapter 3: The Origins of the ConstitutionChapter 8: Why Great Men are not Chosen PresidentChapter 33: The Interpretation of the ConstitutionChapter 34: The Development of the Constitution by UsageChapter 53: Political Parties and Their HistoryChapter 78: How Public Opinion Rules in AmericaChapter 84: The Tyranny of the MajorityChapter 85: The Fatalism of the MultitudeOf special interest are three appendices. The first is a review by Bryce of the predictions of Hamilton and de Tocqueville. The second is a review of \\"The American Commonwealth\\" written in 1889 by Woodrow Wilson when Wilson was a professor of political science at Weslyan University in Connecticut. The third is a review by Lord Acton.Bryce believed that had the Constitution been put to a popular vote in 1787 it would never have passed. As it was, the only reason the Constitution gained popular support was because of the fear of foreign powers. As Bryce puts it, in the years following the Revolution and the collapse of the Articles of Confederation, Americans felt very vulnerable to foreign intervention:\\"The fear of foreign interference, the sense of weakness, both at sea and on land, against the military monarchies of Europe, was constantly before the mind of American statesmen, and made them anxious to secure at all hazards a national government capable of raising an army and navy, and of speaking with authority on behalf of the new republic.\\"His comments on the relationship between the Constitution, the Supreme Court, and the American people are very timely.Of the Presidency he says, \\"The president has developed a capacity for becoming, in moments of national peril, something like a Roman dictator.\\"His description of the development of the political parties is equally timely, and is the best I have ever read.Some final quotations from Bryce:\\"Someone has said that the American government and Constitution are based on the theology of Calvin and the philosophy of Hobbes. This at least is true, that there is a hearty Puritanism in the view of human nature which pervades the instrument of 1787. It is the work of men who believed in original sin, and were resolved to leave open for transgressors no door which they could possibly shut. Compare this spirit with the enthusiastic optimism of the Frenchmen of 1789. It is not merely a difference of race temperaments; it is a difference of fundamental ideas.\\"He ends on this pessimistic note, echoing Benjamin Franklin:\\"To expect any form of words, however weightily conceived, with whatever sanctions enacted, permanently to restrain the passions and interests of men is to expect the impossible. Beyond a certain point, you cannot protect the people against themselves any more than you can, to use a familiar American expression, lift yourself from the ground by your own bootstraps.\\"Highly recommended in this authoritative and economical edition."},{"Title":"The Frontenacs","review":"Inasmuch as the famed Jesuit and Catholic poet Gerard Manley Hopkins died in Dublin, Ireland, in 1889, he would never have heard of Francois Mauriac, who was born in Bordeaux, France, in 1885.

Highly readable, conversational, and amiable, the handbook explores the issues faced daily by a theatre director. What is the spine, or main through-line, or the play? How do the characters' objectives relate? How does one deal with a truculent actor? What is the role of the audience, and how much should the director consider them anyway? Should one direct with the eye or the ear? And what exactly is Method?Clurman's book, though old, still rings true. He considers art and real estate, popular theatre and theories of the origin of drama in society. He has worked with some of the greatest artists of our time, and they turn up throughout the work: Marlon Brando, Elia Kazan, Lillian Hellman, Clifford Odets . . . the list goes on and on.Although I majored in theatre and took a year long course in directing, I found Clurman's book refreshing and useful.

Crazy about them, more like. Somewhere along the way, I lost the feeling. But then, in May of 2003 I found myself at a racetrack. Long story, funny story, but nothing to do with this review. Anyway, there I was at a racetrack and bedad, it was the Day of the Run for the Roses. I liked Peace Rules, felt nothing for the favorite (can't even remember his name as I write this...a Frankel horse, and I trust Frankel about as much as I trust Bush), but somehow this delicate chestnut beauty pranced by, shining in the Kentucky sun like a hot new penny. Funny Cide. Funny Cide. I saw him...and all of a sudden my love for horses came flooding back, filling up my blood and emptying my head. As I write, it's stronger than ever...I still love Funny Cide. I love him even though he seems to have decided he doesn't want to race anymore. (I hope he understands the game. I hope he's privy to some inside scoop that assures him he'll be \\"retired\\" somewhere nice and safe.) I won on him that day. I won on the Preakness. By the afternoon of Belmont, a complete bog of total mud, I knew things would be different, so I boxed Funny, and still won. He's a gelding. I'm paying a lot of attention to those \\"charming\\" old buds who had the incredible luck to buy him. Funny's never going to make them a dime at stud. And when he stops winning races? Like now. What are our old fun buds going to do then? Keep paying for his keep for no return on their charming old bud's moolah? I don't think so. No matter that the horse gave them the wildest ride of their lives, as well as earned them a pretty penny. Me, I'm cynical. I know what happens to race horses when they lose races. So I'm saving every penny I can get, all the color of Funny Cide, to buy him before they sell him on down the line, a line that leads to allowance races, then claimers, then a slaughterhouse. You do know, do you not, that people eat racehorses? Even great racehorses. The Japanese ate Ferdinand a few years back, like Funny, a winner of the Kentucky Derby. Now back to the book. It was a perfectly fine book. It wasn't the brilliantSeabiscuit: An American Legendby Laura Hillenbrand. (Is that her last name?) I couldn't give a rip about the cute stories of the guys and their wives. Not too interested in Santos either. But all the stuff about Barclay Tagg, a man after my own crusty heart, and Funny, now there was the stuff. I wish that when Joe McGinniss decided to do a book on a racehorse and a trainer, he'd chosen Funny Cide instead of Volponi. I tell you, when it comes to my copper gelding with the big heart, I'm nothing but a sucker. I bought the book just to have the spine in my bookcase. Just to look over at it. FUNNY CIDE.These days, I'm getting kind of silly about Afleet Alex. Once hooked, I stay hooked. So I'll follow the loveable Alex straight through. I also have a little thing for Pollard's Vision and for Evening Attire. Not to mention Funny's half-brothers: Commentator who just won the Whitney and Flower Alley who won the Travers (with me watching!). But Funny Cide is first all the way.You might not believe this, but I'm way over 13."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"This book was made for me, and people like me. As a kid I read every horse book I could find, and as an adult, I own a Thoroughbred in New York. I loved this story about honest and hardworking people and their nondescript horse who surprised everyone. The twists of fate are delightful: how the stable got the cash to buy Funny Cide; how Jose Santos came to be the jockey; how they came to ride a yellow school bus to Churchill Downs. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"Awesome read! As a race fan and bettor thoroughly enjoyed reading the history of the horse trainer and race horse."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"American success stories can make great books, and this is one of them. This book is about the race horse Funny Cide, who went from obscurity to winning the first two legs of the Triple Crown within two years, upsetting many bigger names along the way. The author delves into the world of horse-racing, and the lives of the people that make a living in horse-racing. This includes a careful study of the economics of horse-racing, who makes the money, and who ends up scraping by. The book focuses on those individuals linked to Funny Cide, from the group of childhood friends who bought him, to the husband and wife who raised him, to the washed up rider who rode him to victory after victory. The book focuses on the middle-class or even lower-class roots of those associated with Funny Cide. Never a big prospect, Funny Cide's physiology ruled out his use as a stud, and did not have the physique of a show horse. So racing it was, and through various ailments but never a broken leg, his trainers and owners rode him to national fame. This short book is a great read that flows easily and smoothly from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"Wonderful, fabulous, joyful read. This is something I wish I had done in my lifetime, owned a race horse. And these guys, who knew little or nothing (much like myself!) -- these Sackatogans -- DID IT. Not only did they find the right horse, but they found the right trainer, the right jockey (a \\"has been\\" no less!), the right veterinarians and then did the impossible: beat the favorites and won the Kentucky Derby. This horse had heart. I breezed through this book just as Funny Cide breezed on the inside in fourth place before making his historic move in the Kentucky Derby. WHAT a happy, wonderful read, I can't say that often enough. For a real treat: once you've read the Kentucky Derby experience (as the horses approached the track Funny Cide acted up in a way that wasn't expected and worried everyone), go to You Tube and WATCH THE RACE. It will give you the chills!"},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"My order was delievered fast & my item was in good shape just like it isaid it would be.

Its got personality and its a fun, easy read while still staying smart enough to not make you feel like a 3rd grader again. The story is coherent from start to finish, and over all I've enjoyed it. Heck, I've enjoyed it enough to read it more than once.However, as other reviews have mentioned, if you're looking for a detailed horse story from the horse breeders' and racers' world, this is not it. This story it told from a casual view of people who were not horse people in the true sense of the word. They were horse hobbyist wanting to have a little fun and maybe some success."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"As a horse lover, I loved reading this story about the 2003 winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Race. Funny Cide almost became a Triple Crown winner, but lost at the Belmont Race. It was interesting to learn about what goes into training a Thoroughbred race horse and the part that good luck and bad luck plays. This is true of many things in life."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"This is decent feel-good story of a group of \\"regular guys\\" from a small upstate New York town who pooled their money and wound up with a Kentucky Derby winner. The horse also came very close to winning the Triple Crown, something that still hasn't been done in 30 years.How it all happened is detailed here in the book. Some of this story will remind horse-racing fans of Laura Hillenbrand's tale of \\"Seabiscuit,\\" at least in regards to the trainer. In here, Barclay Tagg is almost a dead-ringer for Tom Smith, the crabby old, secretive trainer of Seabiscuit. The stories about Tagg, I think, were the best parts of this book.Since Funny Cide apparently did not have a long career, much of the book is about the owners, their background and their small town of Sackets Harbor. Those parts were so-so. I wanted to read more about the races but, overall, the book was still a fairly fast read and certainly brings back good memories of that 2003 racing season and all those folks coming to the Derby in an old yellow bus!I do wish the author had said something more about Funny Cide's career or life after his big year. There is no mention of what has happened to him."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"This is a modern day David and Goliath story, only with horses. A bunch of high school buddies pool their money and open a stable, competing with ultra rich Sheiks and bluebloods. And who wins the KY Derby--the little guys with their great horse Funny Cide. The best thing about this story is that it's true. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"Partnerships for owning Thoroughbred racers can cost as little as a few hundred dollars to (fill in your own number, and it isn't small). There are roughly 35,000 Thoroughbreds foaled each year and by their three-year-old season, only a maximum of 20 can reach the starting gate in the Kentucky Derby. At the end of that race, only one runner will emerge as a possible Triple Crown winner.There is a saying in the sport that how a person becomes a millionaire in Thoroughbred racing is to initially be a multi-millionaire. But for a group of friends who pooled their money together to purchase what was then considered a modestly-bred runner with the goal of trying to find success on the solid New York racing scene, well, let's just say they didn't just catch lightning in a jar; they caught the entire storm front and slammed it into the container.Funny Cide, the members of the partnership group, trainer Barclay Tagg and assistant trainer Robin Smullen captivated sports fans worldwide in 2003 when the gelded colt captured the first two legs of the Triple Crown, only to fall short of immortality on a muddy track at Belmont Park.Author Sally Jenkins has penned a highly readable and enjoyable account of everyone involved. And through it all, it is Funny Cide who did the most talking, with a solid two-year-old season - though it is fashionable to say he \\"emerged\\" literally out of nowhere to win the Kentucky Derby - and several gutsy performances at three that put him solidly into the mix of possible contenders on the Triple Crown trail.Funny Cide was marketed like a rock star in the few weeks leading up to the Belmont Stakes - after winning the Preakness Stakes in convincing fashion - with hats, shirts and buttons being quickly produced and bought up by fans, along with the future plans for a Funny Cide beer. Even in 2006, the New York Racing Association handed out Funny Cide pictures to race fans on a special day honoring his achievements.Though Funny Cide has had a very rocky racing career since the Triple Crown chase, the highlight being a commanding stretch drive performance to win the 2004 Jockey Club Gold Cup, Jenkins writes about that moment in time when a special runner took fans for a great ride in a sport which is not built on, but can sometimes produce, the best memories from modest beginnings."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"FUNNCY CIDE, the book, is not literature like perhaps SEABISCUIT is, but in its own way, it is easier to read and more satisfying. FUNNY CIDE is the once-in-a-generation, heart-warming story of a long-shot horse who broke though and made it big. FUNNY CIDE is not only the story of the horse but also of his Ordinary Joe owners, his has-been jockey, and his cranky trainer. Several times I had to put the book aside and wipe my eyes, blow my nose and otherwise compose myself after reading FUNNY CIDE. And you will, too. It just that kind of book, that kind of story of how hard work and persistance truly can pay off. FUNNY CIDE's success was not a freak but the result of dedicated trainers and vets, risk-taking owners and a talented jockey and, above all, a talented horse. If you like horse racing, you will love this book. If you just like stories of success against overwhelming odds, then FUNNY CIDE is also for you. For horse players, a useful tip from the book: the Belmont Stakes does not favor favorites supposedly because winners coming off the Preakness a couple weeks earlier may be too tired to go the extra distance Belmont demands. Thus Belmont Stakes long shots may be better choices. This book is a winner and would make the perfect gift for that horse player in your life."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"This is a very easy book to read in a short amount of time, and very entertaining."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"Okay, parts of the book about the owners may be a bit boring, but the storyline about this horse and his trainer make your heart sing. It is so refreshing to hear/read a story about folks putting the animal's welfare above profit in current times. I hope a movie is made of this wonderful tale that will rival the story of Seabiscuit.

But at that point - which was prior to Bail Money being claimed - they didn't have the money. So FC remained in Everard's care.After Bail Money's (unwanted) claim money materialized, they bought FC - according to the author (p. 125), shortly after \\"March of 2000.\\"This would have been...about four weeks before Funny Cide was born.Bail Money must have been claimed in March of 2002, not \\"March of 2000.\\"***Moribund Newspaper Sales Up 100,000%:All 104,000 attendees of the 2004 Belmont Stakes had bought a copy of the Daily Racing Form (p. 263).***Comet of Blazing Illiteracy Lands on Reader:Funny Cide \\"revenged himself on Empire Maker by beating him out for the Eclipse Award...\\" (p. 274; my italics).But I did look this up.

That was certainly the case with Funny Cide, the never-heard-of gelding who won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness thus almost copping the fabled Triple Crown. Yep, America loved him.The resonant voice of Dan Cushman chronicles Funny Cide's amazing story from starting gate to finish. Of course, it's not just a horse's story but also the tale of friends, including a trainer and a jockey who were determined to win a race.No one in this All-American story is a blue blood, not the racehorse or the men behind Funny Cide. They were blue collar workers from Sackets Harbor, New York (little more than a village with 1,386 residents) who pooled their resources to fund a small stable. They had a dream and, by golly, they were going after it.All who loved &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; will root for Funny Cide and the men who believed they'd found a winner.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"Funny Cide was an exceptional racehorse.

He was an underdog in the truest sense: unimpressive bloodlines and birthplace, with a jockey considered washed-up, and a group of owners from New York, who were neither outrageously rich or very horse savvy. In fact, they arrived at the Derby in a schoolbus: a handful of friends who had known each other since high school, who were in it for a good time and a way to bond.Funny Cide's journey to the most well-known horse race in America is fast paced, funny and irreverent as many of the people closely associated with the colt. A must for horse lovers and racing fans - and everyone who loves to root for the underdog."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"Sally Jenkins does a good job of telling the success story of Funnycide's career leading up to the \\"big three\\", but it's not your typical horse story. If you're loking for the insight on the how's and why's leading up to Funnycide's victory from the horse world's prespective, you will be let down. This reads as a biography of the entire Funnycide team (still a story worth being told). It's a great read for non-horsepeople, but those who are into horses and the world of racing will be disappointed from the perspective it is written from."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"The bookstore near where you live probably has many categories --- fiction, nonfiction and children's books, if nothing else. If it's a large enough bookstore, there are perhaps books that focus on religion and spirituality, health, self-help, recovery, and sorrow.It is one of the deficiencies of the bookstore experience that there is not a corresponding section about joy. If there were, this new book by Sally Jenkins would be there. The improbably titled FUNNY CIDE: How a Horse, a Trainer, a Jockey, and a Bunch of High School Buddies Took On the Sheiks and Bluebloods ... and Won, is steeped in joy. It is a gambler's joy, the joy you get when you figure out a point spread or get the right scratch-off lottery ticket or hit the winning exacta. But it is a pure, untrammeled joy, nonetheless. And in a culture so steeped in loneliness, anxiety and depression, anything that can promote and celebrate joy is a universal good.The story begins where stories about horses usually commence --- in a stable. In the wee small hours of the morning, an Oklahoma-bred mare gave birth to a foal at a New York farm. He was one of 33,689 foals born that year, and as Jenkins says, there were no thunderbolts present at his birth. He was a young colt, given the name of Funny Cide, and largely left to grow up to see if he could amount to anything. No one at this stage of the game expected that this horse would be anything special.Jenkins --- writing on behalf of the entire Funny Cide &quot;team&quot; --- tells their stories as well. The reader might know about the small-town friends who purchased the horse, how they pooled their money together in what seemed like a mad venture, how the circle of friends formed the &quot;Sackatoga Stables&quot; so they could get better seats and parking spaces at the track and feel like bigshots, and even make it to the winner's circle once in a while. What's not so well known --- and what Jenkins makes clear to even the casual race fan --- is the enormous gamble that putting money up to buy a horse is.Putting a two-dollar bet down at the track is a known proposition; in pari-mutuel racing, you're betting against your peers and conceding a small percentage of the bet to the track and to the state to help cover expenses. Putting two hundred thousand dollars down on a horse --- and purebred Kentucky yearlings can go for higher than that --- is much more of a sucker's bet, with a higher risk of loss than even the most rapacious Las Vegas casino would allow. You're all but guaranteed, Jenkins tells us, to lose half the money you invest in any given racehorse --- that is to say that what you pay for the horse, and what the horse eats while you own him, generally won't recoup you half of what the horse earns in his lifetime. You must have an above-average horse to even think of breaking even --- and an exceptional horse, a classic horse, to think about making money off the deal.On top of that, it helps to have top-flight people around the horse, people who know horses. (The principal partner in the Sackatoga circle is allergic to horses, we find.) Some of the best writing in FUNNY CIDE is about the horse's trainer, Barclay Tagg, and his lifelong struggle against pushy owners who think they know how to train a horse. Additionally, there's jockey Jose Santos, stuck on the backstretch at Belmont Park, waking up at five in the morning to exercise horses and riding longshots, hoping for the big score.This makes FUNNY CIDE sound a bit like Laura Hillenbrand's magisterial SEABISCUIT, but the two works are very different. First, the Hillenbrand book was written with a certain grave, elegiac style; Jenkins's prose is much more bright and breezy, free and easy, with a certain Texas lilt here and there. Hillenbrand was rescuing a lost tale from the collective unconscious; Jenkins is retelling us information we largely already knew from ESPN coverage. Most importantly, SEABISCUIT is filled with loss, regret and nostalgia. FUNNY CIDE is about joy piling on top of joy, as everyone around the horse realizes what his true capacities and skills actually are. (A little too late, as it happens; we learn about Funny Cide's gelding in the story, which wipes out any future stud fees.)Jenkins reminds us of the controversy surrounding Funny Cide's triumphant Run for the Roses, how a newspaper story alleging cheating was used to taint the horse's record and the jockey's reputation. That story is the only blot in the last hundred pages of FUNNY CIDE, all of which takes place amidst a torrent of joy, sparked by one horse who learned the right way to run, and to win, and never once forgot how.--- Reviewed by Curtis Edmonds"},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"I have never really been all that into horse racing except to make a point of watching the Kentucky Derby every year (it's a couple of minutes long after all! That's not exactly a Herculanean commitment)Nonetheless I picked up this book to see what the deal was behind Funny Cide, and I was very surprised with this great little story. There's a sort of All-American, virtuous underdog who beats the establishment through honesty and hard work charm to the story. The owners of Funny Cide were a group of friends from tiny Sacketts Harbor New York who wanted to do something different with their lives. So they pooled their comparatively meager savings (for the world of Horse Racing) and wanted to buy a race horse to just try to get into the Kentucky Derby (the concept of winning practically never crossed their minds. Even getting in was a sort of fictitious goal.) Instead of a race horse, all they could really afford was Funny Cide however. (After going through a few others first.)From the author's description of Funny Cide as a horse (I can't really say for myself, they all look the same to me) the concept of Funny Cide winning the Kentuck Derby must be comparable to, say, seeing Richard Simmons rocket past a Kenyan to win the Marathon at the next Summer Olympics. Funny was some sort of gangly looking runt, and a gelding at that. The crew from Sacketts Harbor were clearly not lusting for Empire in the horse racing world, they just wanted to have fun. But they picked their horse and stuck by him.Their trainer was a very old and sympathetic character who was quite good at what he did but apparently hadn't racked up any accolades just yet. He's the kind of guy you really wanted to see get just one real victory before he moves on. He saw something in Funny he could work with. Despite his awkward appearance, everything was basically there, especially an abnormally high level of motivation in a horse. Funny genuinely liked to go flat out and the trainer nurtured him into a truly great runner. There were some especially involving sections of the book centered around training race horses. The author's description of how a horse is basically designed by evolution to do little more than sprint short distances at tremendous speeds was one. The types of injuries they can endure, and the differences between speed and endurance tracks were others.Eventually Funny was winning races, and winning them by a LOT, and the impossible dream of actually reaching the Kentucky Derby began to dawn on the owners. Of course, if this were a Hollywood story, this is where our likable underdog hero would get some sort of ailment or into some situation that would cast the shadow of doubt on whether he could actually deliver in the film's finale. True to form Funny gets a mucus infection.Of course we all know that Funny goes on to actually win the Derby, and nearly the entire triple crown, but the author crafts the story so well that you share the suspense, surprise, and sheer jubilation of his owners when he actually does cross the finish line.This is a truly charming, happy ending story that affirms a lot of good values. It's a fun read and definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"Funny Cide was a great story, and every racing fan knows it pretty much by heart. Even non-racing fans were caught up in the wonderful story of this basically unwanted gelding's run for the Triple Crown.And unless you really want to know the details of the mundane lives of the &quot;plain folks&quot; who formed the syndicate that bought Funny Cide, then there's no need to buy this book. If you know someone who is just getting into thoroughbreds, then share this book with them. Otherwise, this book says nothing new."},{"Title":"Funny Cide","review":"This book is amazing!

He also pays insufficient attention to the new theoretical trends in the field, which again is no real surprise. I would advise anyone seeking a good understanding of criminological theory to avoid this book.

We can speak of two distinct mystical experiences: the monist and the theist.A monist believes that the universe is all made of one stuff. In the case of a religious monist, a category to which some schools of Hinduism belong, that one stuff would be God. Everything in the universe is part of God. Most of us are under the illusion that we are separate from God and from others and the spiritual person, in these traditions, sets out through meditative exercises to go beyond the veil of maya and realize himself as part of the Godhead.The theist, on the other hand, recognizes a sort of dualism between God and the world. The theist would recognizes the unitive experience of the monist as an important first step, but it falls short of union with God.Zaehner does a excellent job in describing the two types of experiences and their differences. In this time of a clash of civilizations, we might like to think all differences between religions are superficial and that they are essentially the same. However, Professor Zaehner proves that such is intellectually dishonest. It is too bad that this book does not presently have the readership of Aldous Huxley's \\"The Perennial Philosophy\\", because it would appear that the thesis of this latter work has gone largely unchallenged in the 50 years since its publication."},{"Title":"Mysticism, sacred and profane;: An inquiry into some varieties of praeternatural experience","review":"In this book, first published in 1957, Professor Zaehner analyzes various typesof praeternatural experiences, ranging from the sensations produced by drugs as mescalin to the mystical states described by the Christian and Muslim mystics and the various schools of mystical thought in India.\\"Utilizing sacred texts, together with the psychology of Jung, the poetry of Rimbaud, the manic states of at least one of his friends, and an experience of his own with mescaline, (Zaehner) distinguishes sharply between monistic mysticism on the one hand and theistic mysticism on the other\\" -- Saturday Review\\"The distinctions which Professor Zaehner draws are valid and valuble...his learning in so many feilds, both Eastern and Western, enriches arguement.\\" -- Times Literary SupplementMr. Zaehner was Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the University of Oxford and Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.Table of Contents1.

The excesses of Doors of Perception provoked this book by R.C Zaehner, an Oxford don of Eastern religions. Zaehner did not question the reality of what he call Huxley's \\"praeternatural\\" experience, although he could not refrain from poking fun at Huxley's drug-induced description of his trousers: \\"Those folds in the trousers - what a labyrinth of endlessly significant complexity! And the texture of the grey flannel - how rich, how deeply, mysteriously sumptuous!\\" Zaehner concedes that drugs can induce a form of natural mysticism in which the soul tends toward union with the natural world which is the reason for their addicting power. He also admits that people occasionally see the workings of nature as a whole through the use of deliberate techniques such as ascetic types of yoga or by the taking of drugs. But there are deep problems with this sense of unity with nature.Perennial Philosophy is a term popularized by Huxley who understood it as the principle that the most important aspect of all religions is the escape from ego which allows the individual to become one with God. Zaehner's book is a ferocious and largely successful attack on this popular theory that is still delicately advanced by the most popular authors of comparative religion such as Karen Armstrong and Huston Smith. I cannot do justice to the depth and clarity of Zaehner's argument here, but this is the book to read for well reasoned and religiously minded challenge to New Age thought. Since the turn of the last century, only four authors have stood out for the clarity and originality of their writing on this subject. They are William James, Evelyn Underhill, Aldous Huxley and R.C.

The authors contemplate the meaning of truth in a post-democratic era dominated by global capital. As the sales pitch mentality of corporate culture becomes increasingly necessary to legitimate a violent imperialism in service to capital, it becomes more urgent than ever to confront the powerful with the truth of their misdeeds and to demand positive change. To that end, \\"Telling the Truth\\" provides an abundance of razor-sharp critical analyses to help us better understand our present-day reality.The first two articles discuss neoliberalism in Europe and Latin America. \\"The cynical state\\" by Colin Leys discusses how politics in the U.K. has become more about the management of public perception than wise policy choices, as the state's administrative professionals have been replaced with ideological managers from the private sector who often impose privatization schemes against the public's wishes. \\"The truth about capitalist democracy\\" by Atilio Boron describes how democracy in Latin America has been constrained by the demands of international financiers. However, Mr. Boron contends that real democracy is in evidence in countries such as Venezuela where economic rights and social justice movements are exerting a positive force for change in the region.The next three articles wrestle with U.S. domestic politics and policies. \\"The 'business community'\\" by Doug Henwood discusses the business-class backlash against welfare statism where short-range, Wall Street-style thinking has led to huge deficits during the current Bush administration. Chillingly, Mr. Henwood speculates that in the wake of this Republican neoliberal disaster, Hillary Clinton's fate might well be to preside over the painful restructuring of a bankrupt U.S. economy. Frances Fox Piven's and Barbara Ehrenreich's \\"The truth about welfare reform\\" brilliantly connects the ideological convergence of market and Christian fundamentalism, where the evangelical church increasingly serves as a stand-in for the steadily devolving welfare state. Loic Wacquant's \\"The 'scholarly myths' of the new law and order doxa\\" debunks the 'broken windows' theory of New York City law enforcement, contending that the reality of targeted policing in poor communities is merely a statist attempt to manage working class social and economic insecurities.Two articles take on the Iraq War. Robert W. McChesney's \\"Telling the truth at a moment of truth\\" recounts the sorry story of the U.S. media's complicity in the buildup to war and subsequent occupation of Iraq. Mr. McChesney believes that meaningful media reform is necessary but must come about within a larger movement for significant social change. \\"Propaganda-managed democracy\\" by David Miller perceptively links the U.K. government's propaganda campaign to gain support for war with the gap between elite interest and material reality, where the privileged must rely on lying and factual distortion to circumvent popular resistance and democracy.Two essays discuss the World Bank. \\"Correcting Stiglitz\\" by Ben Fine and Elisa Van Waeyenberge suggests that Joseph Stiglitz' critique of World Bank developmental policies are mild (not radical) because his writings ignore the problems of power and class in deference to neoliberal market ideology. \\"Counting the Poor\\" by Sanjay G. Reddy casts light on the flawed money-metric approach to measuring poverty and blames institutional disinterestedness in discovering the truth about how neoliberal economic policies are harming millions of poor around the world.In an article about the politics of culture, \\"Playing with the truth\\" by Michael Kustow reminds us about the critical role played by the ancient Greek theatre and how today's independent theatre movement in the U.K. continues in the grand tradition of helping audiences face up to the truth and question power.The final three articles consider problems pertaining to education, theory and practice. \\"Postmodernism and the corruption of the academic intelligentsia\\" by John Sanbonmatsu contends that the teaching of postmodernism is a capitalist-friendly solution that dilutes the possibility of the student gaining the knowledge needed to change the world for the better. \\"Telling the truth about class\\" by G.M. Tamas compares Rousseau with Marx as part of a discussion about how class has been rendered all but extinct by capital's control of culture and politics. \\"On telling the truth\\" by Terry Eagleton detects an unusual agreement between postmodernism and faith-based politics in their mutual disinterest in the truth and the production of psychotic fantasies, which have often led to terrible outcomes.I highly recommend this superb book to everyone."},{"Title":"Atlantis: The antediluvian world (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"This is the book that started it all, written a century ago by a man as strange and dynamic as his story. Every fantastical image of a sunken paradise, or heated dispute about it's existence and location, all started with these pages.The origin of all Atlantis-hype, this book similarly starts with the origin of the concept itself. Donnely includes a translation of Plato's story that all Atlantean research goes back too. This was the most interesting part of the book, just hearing the first account all discussion and contemplation aside. It is also the most integral part of the book, since out of it comes all of Donnely's extrapolation.The basic point of the rest of the book is to try to show that 1) Atlantis could have existed and disappeared geologically ages ago, and then furthermore 2) to explain Atlantis's affect on the rest of human history. Here, his attempts are the most interesting, and, often, the most ridiculous. Generally speaking though, he does state his case scientifically, and in most cases, rather believably.The only glaring faults are his mistranslation of the original Plato, placing Atlantis most likely in the wrong area, and how sometimes he takes some rather huge leaps to justify his points. But hey, he wrote it 100 years ago and still manages to produce an intriguing study into the Atlantean question, without the aids of more advanced technologies.Either way, it's a very interesting book, and whether you believe in Atlantis or not, I'm sure it will give you a lot to think about, which was indeed Donnely's purpose in the first place. I recommend it to any inquisitive mind."},{"Title":"Atlantis: The antediluvian world (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"Ignatius Donnelly's groundbreaking work suffers only from hismis-reading of Plato as to the site of Atlantis. Donnelly'stranslation of the Greek led to his placement of Atlantis as&quot;opposed to the Pillars of Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar)&quot;rather than &quot;across&quot; from the straits as related in SirDesmond Lee's definitive translation (Desmond Lee was knighted in 1961for his work in translating Plato). Thus Donnelly, unfortunately to befollowed by scores of others, posited Atlantis as a sunken island inthe Atlantic (geologically unsustainable), rather than as anisland-continent across the Atlantic (the Americas)whose civilizationwas destroyed but whose &quot;bare-bones&quot; still appear (Caribbeanislands). Probably, he failed to grasp the scope of Plato's knowledgewhich described three distinct seas: The Mediterranean which Platodescribed as &quot;only a harbor, having a narrow entrance,&quot; thenamed sea (the Atlantic), and that other that &quot;is the real sea(the Pacific), with a surrounding land that may most truy calledcontinent (Asia).&quot; In fact, the North Atlantic 11,500 years agocould not have supported a climate such as that found in Plato'sdescription of lush Atlantis.

Donnelly's book I did cover in a footnote, so I thought I would write a review of some sort here. First of all, if you are familiar with classical scholarship let me point out - works such as this aren't taken serious (I was being kind by mentioning it in a footnote). There are basically two types of texts on Atlantis (excluding those that believe it was fictional or some sort of allegory): (a) the \\"popular\\" writers, who are usually always nutters, quacks etc such as Donnelly and (b) the few classicists who believe Atlantis had some rational historical basis (e.g. the Minoan hypothesis). While writing my dissertation I distinguished between these two schools. The \\"popular\\" writers, are those authors such as Donnelly, who hold zero credentials or reading skills in classical texts and come up with sensational claims (in Donnelly's case, hyperdiffusionism, but with others, crystal energy to aliens) which have nothing to do with Plato's dialogues on Atlantis. If you are interested in the idea that Atlantis has historical truth, these are the texts you should avoid, instead seek out the few books from school (b) such as Luce (1969). I do not personally believe in the Minoan hypothesis, and developed my own hypotheis, but works such as the Minoan theory which have some classical support are the texts to start off from."},{"Title":"Atlantis: The antediluvian world (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"In spite of its rejection by the academic establishment, this book remains a masterpiece of its genre, and has had a much bigger impact than is generally realised. There seems little doubt, for example, that Immanuel Velikovsky was greatly influenced by Donnelly, and it is a certainty that the recent revival of catastrophism traces much of its inspiration back to him, though most of the modern neo-catastrophists would probably deny it.Leaving aside Donnelly's enormous contribution of collating catastrophe legends from many lands and cultures, Atlantis, the Antediluvian World also provided an exhaustive overview of cultural parallels between the Old World and the New. These, Donnelly demonstrated, go well beyond the usual and clich&eacute;d examples of pyramid-building and mummification, and extend to incredible details of life and custom on both sides of the Atlantic.Donnelly's big mistake was his uncritical acceptance of the date provided by Plato for Atlantis' destruction (about 9500 BC) and his equally uncritical acceptance of the academic establishment's dates for the Pleistocene extinctions and the rise of the first civilizations. The critics were quick to point out, of course, that in the epoch mentioned by Plato (9500 BC) no civilization of any kind existed, far less the opulent Bronze Age culture described in the Timaeus and Critias. If such a civilization existed, they said, where are its remains? Donnelly argued that the culture of Atlantis must have been the prototype of all subsequent civilizations, and held that it was emigrants from the lost island who established the great cultures of the Old World and the New. This, he insisted, explained the striking parallels observed between the civilizations of the Old World and the New. Here again, however, chronology got in the way. According to conventional historians, the civilizations of the New World, with their pyramids, human sacrifice, and dragon-worship, were much younger than the ancient civilizations of the Old World, which also had pyramids, human sacrifice and dragon-worship. By the time the peoples of the Americas had begun to build pyramids, practice mummification, etc, the peoples of the Middle East had long abandoned these things. This was an objection Donnelly could not answer; and it is an objection that has remained unanswered to this day. It is an objection that cannot in fact be answered unless the chronology is challenged. But who would dare do that?Well, Immanuel Velikovsky challenged the chronology very effectively in the 1950s, and the assault he launched on ancient dates and dating-systems was never effectively refuted by the academic establishment. If the Old World civilizations are not as old as is commonly believed, and if they are in fact the same age as the civilizations of the New World, then the parallels observed by Donnelly become very pertinent indeed. If, furthermore, the Atlantis civilization was not a prehistoric culture of the tenth millennium BC, but a culture of the Early Bronze Age, as the description of Plato implies, then we might be justified in accepting the whole story as having a factual basis.We know that during the Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages the entire earth was afflicted by a series of powerful seismic disturbances, involving cataclysmic earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. This \\"vast eruptive age\\" as Percy Fawcett called it, left its mark throughout the Mediterranean and western Europe. Sunken Neolithic villages and forests are still regularly located around the coasts of the British Isles and Denmark, as well as much further afield. In volcanically active regions, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the disturbances must have been incomparably more severe; and this has been confirmed by the discovery of sunken beaches and shorelines (often hundreds of metres down) off the coasts of the Azores.The evidence, as I have shown in various places, suggests that Atlantis was an Early Bronze Age culture centred on a main island in the Azores (about the size of Ireland) and an archipelago of smaller islands straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These acted as stepping stones between the Old World and the New; and it was by means of these that the tobacco and cocaine, found in many Egyptian mummies, reached the Old World. Near the end of the Early Bronze Age, during the last of the great cosmic disturbances, the mid-Atlantic islands were sunk and the transatlantic connection severed. Yet the peoples on either side of the ocean remembered the lost islands and retained traditions and customs so strikingly similar that they could not have developed in such a way coincidentally."},{"Title":"Atlantis: The antediluvian world (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"Being a student of Atlantis I felt I should read this book since it's considered a classic on the subject.The theories about Atlantis range from the ordinary and mundane to the fantastic.Donnelly is definitely on the conventional, mundane side of that range. He views Atlantis as just an earlier culture that reached advanced stages of religion, government, and basic technological advances which we have now far surpassed.I am much further towards the new age, super race side of the range.I will give Donnelly credit for being well read on many subjects.However if you're looking for imaginative interpretations of the mythological legends surrounding Atlantis forget this book. Donnelly's interpretation of Hercules capturing the cattle of Geryon was that Hercules was a cattle rustler and he killed some guy and ran off with his cows.I find it puzzling that people quote Plato's account of Atlantis so often but then disbelieve everything Plato says.Donnelly calls the Greeks a 'degenerate race' and their mythology 'barbarian recollections'.Rather mythology uses metaphors to explain metaphysical concepts that are real.I skipped a few parts of the book based on the Editor's notes about Donnelly's information being worthless and inaccurate.Jeff MarzanoFulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and FutureThe Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient EgyptEdgar Cayce's Atlantis and Lemuria: The Lost Civilizations in the Light of Modern DiscoveriesGods of Eden: Egypt's Lost Legacy and the Genesis of CivilizationThe Giza Death StarSecrets of the Ancient World: Exploring the Insights of America's Most Well-Documented Psychic, Edgar CayceThe Atlantis Dialogue: Plato's Original Story of the Lost City, Continent, Empire, CivilizationInitiationInitiation in the Great Pyramid (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)"},{"Title":"Atlantis: The antediluvian world (Collector's library of the unknown)","review":"The research that went into this book is mind boogling.

As I said the author combines many resources which can leave the reader bewildered. For me there wasn't anything that really \\"grabbed my attention\\" as far as learning something new.Atlantis is a difficult subject to research, but I do know that Jesus said that as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man. And what does the Bible say about those days? Fallen angels engaging in relations with women and giants being in the land. Remember the movie City of Angels? I specifically remember the scene of angels observing the interaction between Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan. Those angels weren't dressed in white; they were wearing black!

Jeeves' droll patience is wonderfully tested time and again by the frail innocence of Wooster. Not all of the stories are set in England; the opening sequence sees the two in the United States on an errand of mercy for Aunt Agatha, the ever present deus ex machina of so many stories.Fans of the Fry and Laurie adaptations will find some familiar ground here, albeit much richer in the original.

I'd seen reviews in the past, comparing the Granada production against the original, sometimes favourably, sometimes otherwise, but now, having read the books for myself, I find I simply cannot envision anyone but those two in the key roles. The stories, which are familiar to me due to my fondness for the Granada productions, are brilliantly eloquent, with a turn of phrase that frequently causes me to laugh out loud. Literally. I actually try to avoid reading this one when on the bus, or in public places, as it tends to make people glance askance at me. The sparkling wit and clever use of language conspires to create the perfect image of a gentleman of the interbellum era. The stories are light and humorous, and give the perfect mood to an otherwise dull day; and can easily brighten my attitude. I tend to read snippits on my break at work (on my Kindle) and return to work, refreshed and capable of handling the ennui of another two hours or so."},{"Title":"The Jeeves Collection: \\"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves\\", \\"Inimitable Jeeves\\", \\"Carry on, Jeeves\\"","review":"I had heard of P.G.

If I were to make a list of the top 10 humorous books in the English language, number one might be Jerome K. Jerome's \\"Three Men in a Boat\\", and number 10 might be Evelyn Waugh's \\"Decline and Fall\\"-- all the rest on my list would be from the very lengthy PG Wodehouse oeuvre.This collection represents virtually everything that Wodehouse wrote before 1925. It includes many stories that will be unfamiliar to modern day Americans -- only a couple of his most famous \\"Blandings Castle\\" and \\"Jeeves\\" stories are included here (they are enjoyable nonetheless). Of particular interest to me were the many \\"school\\" stories which he wrote between 1900-1905 before he first traveled to America. These stories represent his recollection of his days at an English public school -- they are much concerned with cricket, rugby, and sneaking out of the house at night (a pastime I myself remember fondly from my school days).I also found that the background to the stories gives an interesting picture of what every day life must have been like in the period 1895 to 1914. All of Wodehouse's stories (which were written over a period of about 75 years from 1900 until his death -- he was working on a story in his hospital bed when he died)are set in a pre-World War I Edwardian world there never was -- no matter how much we wished it had been.Some (when they are down or depressed) will turn to chocolate, or ice cream; I, on the other hand, turn to my two favorite authors: one of whom of course is PG Wodehouse, the other being Rex Stout. No matter how bad I may be feeling, I can pick up any of these authors' works (no matter how many times I have read and reread them), and my spirits will immediately be lifted.The kindle formatting is good; the table of contents is helpful."},{"Title":"The Jeeves Collection: \\"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves\\", \\"Inimitable Jeeves\\", \\"Carry on, Jeeves\\"","review":"All the Wodehouse material in this book is enjoyable, and some of the short stories are among his best. It is a little strange to begin the volume with the late novella \\"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves\\" and then follow with the early short stories, including the one which first introduces Jeeves and Bertie (\\"Jeeves Takes Charge\\"). Also, the stories in \\"Carry On, Jeeves\\" occur before \\"The Inimitable Jeeves\\", so read the three in reverse order.The novella is fun but it's largely a self-congratulatory, nostalgic reprisal of PGW's earlier full-length masterpiece THE CODE OF THE WOOSTERS."},{"Title":"The Jeeves Collection: \\"Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves\\", \\"Inimitable Jeeves\\", \\"Carry on, Jeeves\\"","review":"Dante had his Inferno. Odysseus had to get past Scylla and Charybdis. And Bertie Wooster has to darken the dangerous halls of Totleigh Towers again to avoid the unwelcome bands of matrimony with Miss Madeline Bassett.Madeline's engagement to that world-class newt lover, Gussie Fink-Nottle, is on the rocks when Madeline insists that the meat-loving Gussie become a vegetarian. That's dangerous because Madeline has always made it clear that she will have no other man than Bertie as her husband if Gussie isn't available. So Bertie volunteers to enter that place where all others abandon hope in order to try to repair the engagement. But he's soon in trouble because Emerald Stoker, daughter of the American millionaire, has taken a temporary job as the cook at Totleigh Towers and is tempting Gussie with steak and kidney pie and ham sandwiches. Soon love is following the growls of Gussie's stomach, and Gussie insults the sunset and Madeline's favorite fictional character.At the same time, Stiffi Byng's engagement to Stinker Pinker is on the rocks as well because Pop Bassett won't come through with the vicar's job that Stinker needs to be able to afford to marry. A rocky day at the school treat makes progress even more problematical.Jeeves is the source of the all the solutions as he often is, but relations are strained even there by Bertie's new hat which Jeeves feels is unsuitable.Stiffi also takes to absconding with Pop Bassett's prize gee-gaw, which Bertie's Uncle Tom covets, and matters develop to make Bertie look like a thief again. Can Bertie escape the goal?In the best of the Jeeves stories, the plot unfolds in a fairly straightforward fashion that holds Bertie at ransom to fate. Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves has such a plot. I highly recommend this book to you.This book should also remind you to read the Jeeves books in order of their publication. Many of the best are sequels to the finest of the early stories. Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves is one of those sequels.

Instead, they work from their homes as freelancers. Their reliable outpouring of articles results in regular assignments and bylines. Freed of the necessity of a regular workweek complete with a tiny cubicle in the corporate world, these writers enjoy the flexibility and the comfort of their own homes. Most importantly, Contributing Factor$ provides the keys to becoming one of those successful writers through explanation, example, and experience.Even if you are not freelancing now, CONTRIBUTING FACTORS$ is still for you. This short book provides the guideline to the path of becoming a contributing writer or editor, including an overview of how to get started as a stringer, move through freelancing, and eventually attain the status of a contributing writer or editor. Moreover, it points out that while the title of contributor may only be a matter of semantics, the status of contributing certainly results in making more money while still freelancing, as well insuring frequent publication.CONTRIBUTING FACTORS$ includes much of the necessary, solid advice that is the substance of all good writing coaches: prepared samples, know the market, specialization. Yet it steps beyond absolute necessity. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS$ clearly demonstrates the pros and cons of becoming a contributing writer or editor, including not only the author's experience but also the experience of many other authors, making CONTRIBUTING FACTORS$ work unique among the many titles on the market.With the glut of electronic magazines, both paying and nonpaying markets, many writers are finding these new markets a convenient venue to insure an audience, and to add another entry on their resume. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS$ also tackles issues of publishing on the internet and the consequences of this evolving market. While many lack the budget to pay, CONTRIBUTING FACTORS$ lists reasons electronic magazines are still extremely productive, especially showing how to find new opportunities.Filled with interview material, first hand experience, and generous examples, CONTRIBUTING FACTORS$ is a must read for any writer looking for their name on a masthead and regular paychecks in the bank."},{"Title":"Queen of Hearts: Tales of Middle-aged Passion","review":"&quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot;.

Bobby DeNiro has just moved into this Hudson River Valley bedroom community. Artist Rita feels DeNiro is her ticket even if it is only to clean his new home. However, instead of DeNiro, Rita's ultimate fantasy is for her husband Trick to give her some attention without his remote.The two novellas and short story that make up this amusing anthology are all disquieting with potent messages. THE QUEEN OF HEARTS: TALES OF MIDDLE-AGE PASSION pulls no punches on its take on life. The plot centers on love lost as once thriving relationships either died or remain in a comatose state.

PHENOMENAL READ!! A PART OF HISTORY THAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD, IN ORDER TO ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE FUTURE!! A MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"Anthony C. Sutton is a libertarian conspiracy theorist whose book \\"Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution\\" argues that the Bolsheviks were financed by foreign powers, such as Germany, and then by the capitalists that supposedly were their opponents. Sutton believes that the Wall Street bankers and US monopolists wanted Russia to become a huge \\"captive market\\", and that the Communist regime made this possible.The question of contacts between Bolsheviks and capitalist groups is surely an interesting one. Indeed, I don't think any serious historian denies that such contacts existed. But why did they exist? To what extent? And was it really a \\"conspiracy\\" in the sense conspiracy theorists believe? After all, there are always strange bedfellows in politics. What about the CIA and one Usama bin-Laden?My main objection to this book is that it contains several pretty elementary factual errors, and a number of absurd interpretations. This makes the book highly problematic, perhaps even worthless, as source material. The authors research has been sloppy, so why should we trust him on anything? I therefore recommend customers to buy other books on Russian history. If you want to buy this one, do it simply because of interest in conspiracy theory, not out of interest in the actual issues covered.Here are some of the errors and misinterpretations I managed to find:Page 19. Sutton claims that there was a 700,000 strong Green Army during the Russian Civil War, which fought both Reds and Whites. He wonders why no history book ever mentions it. Simple: it did not exist. Peasant guerillas sometimes called \\"Greens\\" did exist, but they were never centralized into an army. Perhaps Sutton is referring to the great peasant rebellion in Tambov? But that rebellion is well known. He is explictly not referring to the equally well-known Makhnovists. Sutton's Green Army seems to be a hallucination.Page 25. Sutton writes that Trotsky crossed the Finnish-Russian border at Tornea on June 13, 1917. This is a double mistake. Tornea is situated at the Swedish-Finnish border, not the Finnish-Russian border. Moreover, since Finland was still controlled by Russia at the time, the border was strictly speaking the Swedish-Russian border! Finland didn't become independent until December 6, 1917.Page 33. Sutton claims, on the authority of Canadian intelligence, that Trotsky was a German agent, and even an ethnic German. The \\"proof\\" is Trotsky's real name, Bronstein. But this is not a German name at all, but a Jewish name. The Jewish language Yiddish is derived from German, but it was spoken by Jews in Russia as well. This is common knowledge, yet Sutton doesn't seem to know it. (That a lone Canadian intelligence operative didn't is perhaps more excusable.) Sutton also claims that the name \\"Trotsky\\" is Polish, citing this as another suspiscious fact. But some Bolsheviks were Polish, Felix Dzerzhinsky being the most notorious. Nor is this surprising, since Poland was controlled by Russia during the period in question!Page 47. Sutton quotes a Moscow newspaper, presumably published by the Kadets, complaining about the \\"social revolutionaries\\" getting money from the West. Since I haven't seen the original article, this may be risky to judge. But please note that there was a Russian political party called SRs or Social Revolutionaries. The article might therefore be about them, rather than about the Bolsheviks, who, as far as I know, were always referred to simply as \\"bolsheviki\\".Page 52-53. While the Mexican Revolution is surely a complicated story, Sutton's analysis of it is mystifying, to say the least. He seem to think that Pancho Villa and Carranza belonged to the same faction, when in reality they often fought each other. Carranza's faction was the most moderate one during the Revolution, which explains why the US supported him once he was firmly in power. After all, Carranza wanted to suppress the radicals around Villa and Zapata. That the Mexican Constitution was written by \\"Trotskyites\\" is an absurd statement, since there were no \\"Trotskyites\\" in Mexico in 1917. The claim that the constitution was \\"Soviet-type\\" is also problematic. It was a very radical document, to be sure, but Mexico has never been socialist! But perhaps Sutton has such a broad definition of socialism that even Mexico becomes socialist?These, then, are some of the errors I found in this book."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"This book puts forth the argument that during the 1910s, a small group of big financial players in the US lent material and financial support to the Bolsheviks in Russia. The big financial players include J. P. Morgan, J. D. Rockefeller, General Electric, Chase Bank, and several members sitting on the Federal Reserve Board. The support they provided included money, documents to facilitate travel thru specific countries, weapons, medical supplies, and access to confidential information. This support was provided via discreet and sometimes illegal means; i.e. money transfers via front companies, etc... The support essentially served as bribes. Specifically, these big financial players wanted access to both the natural resources and markets of Russia regardless of who was in control. Therefore, the support lent to the Bolsheviks was bribe money in case the Reds took over Russia. The author clearly states that this support was NOT meant to assure Bolshevik victory in Russia or anywhere else.The book is fairly short for such a controversial topic; under 200 pages excluding appendices and references. It is divided into chapters, with each chapter focusing on a specific event or person in this process. For example, one chapter focuses on Leon Trotsky's stay in the US and how wealthy, politically-connected Americans facilitated his travel from the US back to Russia; against the wishes of numerous government agencies including the US State Department. The book is well referenced, and lists as sources numerous personal notes, diaries, and biographies. The author takes care to separate his thesis from other \\"conspiracy theories\\". For example, one appendix is devoted to refuting any Jewish conspiracy in the Russian Revolution.All in all, this book is quite easy to read, and very interesting. I am no expert on Russian history, so I will not vouch for the validity of this book's argument. I will only say I found this book worth reading, and I recommend it for all history buffs."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"Have enjoyed this book tremendously. Not my usual speed for reading but would like to read other stuff like this. I have learned a lot and it certainly explains some questions I had in my mind. Good choice I made in reading material."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"Sutton's major starting point for his argument here is with Trotsky's trip back to Russia from New York in early 1917. Kerensky had requested that Trotsky be allowed back to Russia and the US government agreed to this. Sutton starts his argument off by completely misinterpreting the meaning of these events. Sutton tries to cast this as if it were evidence of a plot to place the Bolsheviks in power, but Trotsky was not a Bolshevik at the time. Trotsky joined with Lenin after the July Days when the Petrograd workers and soldiers carried out an uprising where they demanded that Lenin should take power. Lenin himself was caught off guard by this uprising and ended up retreating into hiding. The most detailed treatment of the July Days is by Alexander Rabinowich, PRELUDE TO REVOLUTION. Sutton would have done better if he had spent more time consulting works of this type. Anyway, Sutton starts off on the wrong foot here because he assumes that some aid given to Trotsky fits in as part of a conspiracy to place the Bolsheviks in power. In fact, it should signify the opposite. Before the July Days Lenin and Trotsky had been bitter rivals for nearly 15 years. The records of their writings in early 1917 show the same rivalry continuing in very harsh language. If some hypothetical New York conspiracy were attempting to place Lenin in power, then helping Trotsky in early 1917 would have been totally counter-productive. This, of course, was exactly why Kerensky requested that Washington should allow Trotsky to return to Russia. He had no reason to expect a coming alliance between the two. Actually, if the Provisional Government had signed an immediate peace with Germany (as Lenin did a year later) then Kerensky's calculation would very likely have been correct. It was only because the war had created such enormous discontent among the populace that Lenin and Trotsky realized the need to unite and take advantage of the opportunity.Sutton reports that when Trotsky was traveling back to Russia he was temporarily stopped midway and found to be carrying ten thousand dollars with him. After some disruption Trotsky was allowed to continue traveling. Many other sources often misreport this ten thousand as twenty million, although Sutton is probably more reliable on such a detail. Elizabeth Dilling attributed such aid to Jacob Schiff, but Sutton points out that Schiff refused to deal with the Bolsheviks after the overthrow of Kerensky's government (a government which Schiff had enthusiastically supported). Who's right and who's wrong here?On the matter of where Trotsky would have received the money from I tend to agree with Dilling. Since Trotsky was not a Bolshevik, clearly any aid which he may have received in New York had nothing to do with a plot to install the Bolsheviks in power. That fits with Sutton's own comments on Schiff's refusal to deal with the Bolsheviks after Kerensky's overthrwow. It should be kept in mind that no one has ever disputed Schiff's willingness to give some aid to exiles and oppositionists from Czarist Russia. Most such aid went to liberal groups who had no interest in Marxism, but it's not implausible that an exiled Marxist such as Trotsky would have received some aid in New York from Schiff. What we can definitely rule out is that any such hypothetical aid given to Trotsky in New York was ever part of any plan to install a specifically Marxist government in Russia. If Schiff gave some aid to Trotsky during the latter's few months in New York this would have simply been part of the general practice by Schiff of supporting Czarist exiles, not something aimed specifically at advancing Marxism.Lenin was almost assassinated in 1918. If that assassination had succeeded then it's likely that the later conflict between Stalin and Trotsky would have exploded into the open much sooner. This again shows how the possibility of Trotsky having received some temporary aid in New York would be incongruent with any hypothetical New York plan aimed at installing Lenin in power. If someone was making such a plan from far away then the only sensible thing to do would have been to help Lenin, the way that the German Kaiser provided Lenin with a trip back to Russia. Lenin was the authoritative head of the Bolshevik party. Lenin was the one recognized by the party membership as its leader. It was only Lenin's diplomatic influence within the party which enabled Trotsky to gain some grudging acceptance. But if the assassination had succeeded, then rivalries would have quite possibly broken out between the original Bolsheviks and Trotsky at a time when the Russian civil war just beginning.Kerensky's government was in a major bind in early 1917. The only real way that any Russian government could have survived at that time was by making a swift peace with Germany. Kerensky chose not to do this for two reasons. First, the Russian liberals who Kerensky supported were convinced of the need to remain aligned with the western democracies as a step towards making Russia into a republic. They rejected any notion of signing a peace with the German monarchy that would alienate the democratic governments whom they felt so beholden to. Second, the military officers in the Russian army were committed to the war and would have attempted a coup if Kerensky had tried signing a peace. These facts put Kerensky in an impossible position.But except for that, Kerensky's decision to invite all Russian Left-wingers of every stripe back home made perfectly good sense. The reality on the ground was that the Provisional Government which Kerensky headed was already rivaled by the power of workers' and soldiers' councils in the streets. This was an unstable situation which couldn't continue indefinitely, but any government which sought to resolve the matter had to be doing so under a clear Left-wing header. Since Kerensky was trying to present himself as a moderate Left-winger in support of republicanism, the best strategy for him would have been to get out of the war by signing peace with Germany immediately, let the peasants break up the large estates and takeover land as they wish, and simultaneously welcome back home all once-exiled Leftists to Russia.If this had been done, then Lenin and Trotsky would have emerged as part of a Left-wing opposition under the government. They probably would have continued many of their older disputes, rather than joining as allies. The case of the Spanish Left in the 1930s offers an abundance of examples of how Leftists can tear each other apart in a self-defeating manner. As longtime rivals there was no reason for Kerensky to expect that Lenin and Trotsky would form a working alliance for any length of time. The overthrow of Kerensky's government would certainly not have taken place in the form which it did in November 1917. The only monkey-wrench in all of this was that the Provisional Government had to be prepared to seek immediate peace with Germany, and they proved to be politically unable to do so. But there's no reason to believe that Kerensky's request that Washington allow Trotsky's return had anything to do with a plot intended to install the Bolsheviks in power.An epilogue to this affair is that once Trotsky had been exiled from the USSR in 1929 he was refused the status of polital refugee by more governments on earth than any subsequent exile from Russia. Most Cold War exiles such as Solzhenitsyn were readily accepted by western governments. Trotsky repeatedly applied to numerous countries and was rejected by the majority, with the few that eventually agreed placing sharp restrictions on what he could do. While it's perfectly plausible that Schiff gave Trotsky some aid in New York, this clearly was not part of any long-term agenda aimed at advancing Trotsky's politics.Now once that much is cleared up, it becomes apparent that Sutton has not provided any argument to show that Lenin ever received any aid from Wall Street prior to the overthrow of Kerensky. He recieved some aid from Germany, which clearly had an interest in undermining the government it was at war with, but none from Wall Street. However the revolution changed that for a few months. Again, it must be said that Sutton grossly underplays the significance of the First World War in determining Allied calculations. Instead, he imposes the standards of the Cold War on a much earlier time where they have no place.It was apparent from the beginning that Lenin intended to begin sending revolutionary propaganda into Germany the moment he gained power. The Kaiser had aided his return to Russia out of short-term common interest. But once the Bolsheviks had seized power a new debate began in the Allied circles. Some advocated that the Bolsheviks should be overthrown to get Russia back in the war, but the priority was the war against Germany. For this reason Bruce Lockhart and some others advocated that Britain should accept the new government and attempt to aid them in carrying the revolution to Germany. The debate over this lasted 4 months, from the time of the Bolshevik revolution to the siging of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty.The reason that it took so long to sign the peace was because of differences among the Bolsheviks. Bukharin urged that Russia should declare a revolutionary war on Germany. Lenin insisted that it was necessary to leave the war if the Bolshevik government was to survive. Trotsky, as the negotiator with the Germans, attempted to compromise these positions by refusing to sign any treaty but insisting to the Germans that as far as Russia's new revolutionary government was concerned the war was over and there was no need to sign any treaty because the German and Russian proletarians had no cause for war anyway. The Germans responded by resuming their advance into Russia. The Russian fronts collapsed everywhere and Lenin now got his wish that the party agreed to sign a peace.Before the treaty was signed however, there were attempts by the Allies to aid the Bolshevik effort to subvert Germany. Sutton distorts the significance of this very badly by downplaying the First World War, saying nothing notable about Brest-Litovsk, and distorting the record of Lenin-Trotsky rivalry. Because of all of these misstatements of fact which appear in Sutton's book, the naive reader is led to believe that he is seeing a grand conspiracy directed from Wall Street with the aim of placing the Bolsheviks in power. Once the facts are sorted out, it becomes apparent that nothing of the kind has been demonstrated here.Following Brest-Litovsk, the early stages of the Russian civil war began with early uprisings of the Whites in South Russia under first Gerneral Kornilov, followed by Denikin and Wrangel. In this civil war, the Allies attempted to give aid to the Whites. But they were severely constrained by discontent at home. The British unions attempted to locate and derail shipments of aid to the Whites. The French armies which entered Russia showed signs of total disintegration. Allied aid could only be effective to the extent that the Whites themselves were. No major Allied intervention would have been politically possible.To appreciate why the Whites lost the civil war, some of John Hodgson's observations have relevance:-----\\"I did not, during the whole of my service with the Army in Russia, ever see a nurse in a British uniform, but I have seen girls, who were emphatically not nurses, walking the streets of Novorossiisk wearing regulation British hospital skirts and stockings,\\" wrote John Hodgson, a British war correspondent sent to report about life in Denikin's Russia. \\"I saw and talked to young ladies of good social standing ... who were wearing costumes made of British officers' serge,\\" he added, as he wrote of men at the front who went into battle \\"wearing practically nothing but a print shirt and a patched pair of trousers.\\" Almost every minor bureaucrat in South Russia seemed to have a new, crisply creased British summer uniform. \\"It is impossible to believe,\\" Hodgson reported, \\"that we sent out clothing for the benefit of lawyers and petty civil officials.\\" ... Transferred to the military sphere, such massive corruption proved destructive. While Denikin's desperate commanders tried to break through Red fortifications with infantry, British tanks sat on the dock at Novorossiisk. Although Hodgson found \\"it was always possible for a local profiteer to bribe railway officials and obtain freight cars ... on a colossal scale,\\" it proved impossible to find trains or trucks to move the tanks inland. \\"One night,\\" Hodgson noted sadly, \\"a typical Black Sea storm caused one of the tanks to slip its moorings, and the whole consignment [of ten] slid quietly to the bottom of the harbor.\\" Nor was that an isolated instance. While men dying from typhus and dysentery lay on rotting, lice-infested sacks, Hodgson watched the equipment for an entire two hundred-bed British hospital disappear at wharfside. \\"Beds, blankets, sheets, mattresses, and pillows disappeared as if by magic,\\" he reported. \\"They found their way to the houses of staff officers and members of the Kuban Government.\\"------- W. Bruce Lincoln, RED VICTORY: A HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN CIVIL WAR, pp. 218-20.That just scratches the surface, but it should be a reminder to someone that the reasons for the White defeat were much more fundamentally basic than simply an alleged Wall Street conspiracy. Sutton shows no real awareness of anything that occurred in the Russian civil war, and therefore the entire framework of understanding the eventual Bolshevik victory is way out of line in his book. Some other related points made by Peter Holquist are worth noting:-----In describing this expedition, the insurgents portrayed Podtelkov, who had balloted for the Consituent Assembly as a Left Socialist Revolutionary, as \\"conducting Bolshevik agitation.\\" Anti-Soviet insurgents similarly depicted the Soviet land decrees that so disturbed the Cossacks as \\"Bolshevik,\\" even though the decrees reflected Left Socialist Revolutionary views at least as much as Bolshevik ones. The Manichean identification of all foes as \\"Bolsheviks\\" reduced all support for either local soviets or Soviet power to one party, the Bolsheviks. Such a narrowing of categories was a significant development, for many pro-Soviet Cossacks on the Don had earlier identified themselves with the revolution generally or somewhat loosely with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. The insurgents' equation of all support for local soviets with \\"Bolshevism\\" unwittingly reinforced the Bolshevik Party's own attempts to claim for itself the mantle of sole party for the Soviet state... Of interest here is not so much the veracity of the Cossack leadership's narrative as how the leadership came to interpret the conflict as one between monolithically anti-Soviet Cossacks and uniformly pro-Bolshevik peasants.------- Peter Holquist, MAKING WAR, FORGING REVOLUTION, pp. 150, 152.It's important to bear in mind that what we now regard as \\"the Bolshevik government\\" really did not emerge until 1921 in the aftermath of the civil war. Dismissing Kerensky's phantom government in late 1917 did not give the Bolsheviks decisive control over Russia. In other parts of Russia far away from the capitol the Social Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and other Left-wing groups were effectively the government. Although Lenin maintained that such conciliationist parties should be dismissed, the Bolsheviks were on many occasions in the early stages forced to adapt themselves to the reality of such parties holding power. It was the White uprising, and the fact that the Whites were so rabidly hostile to all of the traditional Russian Left, including the Bolsheviks's rivals on the Left, which allowed the Bolsheviks to place themselves at the head of the revolution decisively.As it became apparent that the Whites were a hopeless cause, the Allied governments (and Britain especially) began reconciling themselves to the need to resume trade with Russia as a way of reviving the economy. Sutton again tries to cast this fact as evidence a grand plot to bring the Bolsheviks to power. That of course is silly. If Sutton had taken more time to actually study the Russian civil war and better appreciate the causes of the White defeat, then he could have spared us such nonsense. The fact is that Britain's economy was really sagging and labor leaders had pointed out that resuming trade with Russia was a logical way of reviving the economy. If the Whites had been less incompetent, if the White officers had given their support to a Left-wing government led by Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, then Britain might have been able to give aid to victory over the Bolsheviks and subsequently begin trade with this government. By 1920 it was clear that no native Russian force would be able to overthrow the Bolsheviks anytime soon and that if trade was to be eventually resumed it would have to be with a Russia led by them.All in all, Sutton's book stands as a remarkable display of ignorance masked as scholarship. If you really wish to understand how the Bolsheviks managed to gain power then you'd do better to start with Lincoln, RED VICTORY, as a real scholarly history of the Russian civil war."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"I do not know whether this was Suttons first book, but it reads like it is. The information would be far more effective arranged quite differently. Even the publisher did not correct either the authors style or his arrangement of the material.Over all, I was disappointed.

A lot of the book is more \\"guilt by association\\" then guilt by actual evidence. This book could have been researched and written to be much more precise, clear and organized.Many other books do a better job bringing out the hidden side of history.

Wall Street provided those funds for American trade. It must be that Putin doesn't know his ountry's own history and still is fantasizing about RUSSIAN POWER."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"This book not only streches conspiracy to the limit but it certanly distorts the Russian Revolution itself. Apperantly the American elite funded the revolution to build and control its economy, why than was there no economy to speak of after 14 different armies from 14 different capitalist countries attacked the Russian working class to strangle the revolution at its birth from fear that people in their own country would rise against them. Dear ignorant people until then the country was controled by the working class politicaly and economicaly after that Stalin took control of the state smashed its socialist qualities and built a government and economy not at all socialist but state owned capitalist and so forth rose the abomonation called Stalinism not to be mistaken with socialism. The auther is one of many who immediately assumes that communism is \\"bad\\", but if any of you were simply to pick up the book \\"Das Kapital\\" writen by Karl Marx the inventor of socialism and see what socialism is you would be stearing at a wall in dismay thinking what is all the hype about. Poeple democracy is a socialist idea hellllooo before socialism it did not exist. I do not see at all how the elite supporting the revolution was to profit since the revolution itself was about ending supression of the working class, which is really how the elite profits, and returning not only political power to the people but also giving them full control of the economy and abandoning private and government ownership the latter was brought back by Stalin."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"The contents of this book will both shock and disgust you. This book shows the costs and negative side of 'engagement' advocated by the American Establishment and their boot-licking cronies in academia and 'think tanks'. Sutton draws upon govenment files, books, newspaper clippings and biographies to support his claims.He shows that the American government intervened on the behalf of Leon Trotsky, who was detained by Canadian authorities, so he could travel to Russia and agitate for the Reds. Apparently Trotsky might have been German instead of Russian, but in the end I guess we'll never know for sure. Both Trotsky and Lenin were sent into Russia with money and assistance from foreign governments to stir up trouble.This book also goes into detail on the 1917 American Red Cross mission to Russia which had more bankers than doctors. William Thompson, then a Director of the New York Fed, gave $1 million to the Reds for propaganda purposes. He then brought enough of his Wall Street buddies on board that the Bolsheviks were their guys, to bring the White House over to their side. Wilson's influential advisor at that time was Edward Mandell House, who in Phillip Dru: Administrator stated that he believed in socialism as envisioned by Karl Marx, but with a spiritual leavening. With advisors as such, it was not so difficult.House also used his influence to get Red agitator Minor, who drew a cartoon showing Wall Street types fawning over Marx in the introduction to the book, off the hook after being arrested by military authorities in France for distributing subversive Bolshevik propaganda. His daddy was a well-to-do person back in Texas, where House came from, who gave good old E.M. House a call to get junior off the hook.Sutton also showed how many of the businesses that did business with the Reds originated from 120 Broadway. Since the robber barons already ran out all competition in the US, they needed captive foreign markets to satisfy their insatiable greed. They had a boot in all camps, and used their ability to feed, fund, and arm the winning party, in this case the Bolsheviks, to obtain trade concessions. This lot did the same by backing Sun Yat Sen in China, and various governments in Latin America.Sutton also shows how many of these Wall Street supporters of the Bolsheviks started a group stating their opposition to the socialists. They then told New York Times reporters that they feared a Red revolution in America and that the Reds would sabotage and wreak havoc on our economy even as they were setting up the Ruskcom Bank and conducting business with them. Sutton appropriately described this behavior as totally amoral.There was one quote from the book that will be forever etched into my mind. This quote was from a business figure working in the American consulate in Russia to a British colleague. It was along the lines as such:You may have heard that I own 50% of the forests in Siberia and all of the Magnesium deposits in Georgia. Now, of course, this isn't true. But, let's say that it is true. I am an American wolf and you are a British wolf. But, both being intelligent wolves, knowing if we don't join forces this hour and together hunt the German wolf, we will come to naught.That, ladies and gentlemen, is the business mentality. It has always been that way, and with industrialization and our livelihoods increasingly put in the hands of these people, it explains very easily how the man in the street gets screwed. Read this book and take it to heart. These egotistical, greedy SOBs have been running our country into the ground for over a 100 years, and reading this book and sharing it with fellow patriots is the only way to stop these treasonous scumbags!"},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"Professor Sutton provides us with another remarkable tool that goes far towards exposing the lie of the 'spontaneous rise of the Bolsheviks,' and the culpability of American financiers in this traitorous history.

He uncovers little known stories such as America's Red Cross Mission to Russia in 1917 whose contingent included more financiers than medical personnel. More time was spent negotiating business contracts with Kerensky than tending the sick and wounded. Rockefeller agent William Thompson funneled $1 million to Lenin just for propaganda purposes! Years later Kruschev would maintain that he constantly received codes, money and secret government reports via Rockefeller dominated CIA 'Quislings.' Interestingly, The Federal Reserve Bank (which the Rockefeller's own! [see also; 'The Federal Reserve Conspiracy' by Dr. Emmanuel Josephson] was located at 120 Broadway in NYC. The principal conduit between the banking community and the Bolsheviks was The American Intermational Corp. located at 120 Broadway. The Guggenheims and General Electric (major financiers of the revolution) also had offices at 120 Broadway.

His stuff is often rehashed in other, much more well known, peoples work."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"Anthony Sutton's WALL STREET AND THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION is a series of case studies of powerful U.S. executives catering to the Bolsheviks or Communists beginning in the early 1920s. Sutton cites U.S. business leaders from the budding electronics industry, oil, agriculture, etc. who worked to subsidize the Communists and literally saved the Communist Revolution which tragically ruined the Soviet people and later those of Eastern Europe and Asia.Sutton explores a supposed Red Cross mission which was political and not humanitarian. These people helped to provide food and business connections to Lenin & co. at a critical time when the Bolsheviks faced civil war with the Whites and a Polish invasion. The fact is that without U.S. business executives both in the \\"private sector\\" and government, the Bolshevik Revolution would have failed. Lenin's only solution to the bitter protest to his revolution was the use repression and concentration camps. Readers should note that Lenin had more political executions his first year in power than all the Czars, including the tyrannical Nicholus I (1825-1855)had in the 19th. century.One interesting anecdote is Sutton's comments of the General Electric executives bankrolling the Soviets' hydroelectric projects beginning in the 1920s. One of the largest if not the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world was/is in the old Soviet Union. This facility helped the Soviets industrialize their empire quickly even at the expense of the poor souls who had to work on it.Sutton is clear that Wall Street executives worked tirelessly to uphold the new Soviet regime. One wonders how the Soviets ever paid for any of this largesse of technology, industry, and huge projects. The fact is, the U.S. international business executives were most likely paid via the sucker U.S. taxpayers.One of those corporate executives who was close to Lenin was the oil tycoon, Armand Hammer. His help was indispensable to Lenin and his supporters, and Lenin had Armand Hammer's portrait in his office. The Bolsheviks and later the Stalinoids were only too glad to do business with \\"The Running Dogs of Yankee Capitalism.\\"The agrument may be posed that the Cold War is over. Sutton's book is still useful. During recent U.S. military capers in Iraq and Afghanistan, some alert folks have cited the fact that America's wicked enemies are using U.S. made weapons and technology. This is exactly what Sutton alludes to regarding the death of U.S. military personnel re the Korean and Vietnam wars. While the names of the players (the enemies) have changed, the pattern is the same. There is credible evidence that the Saudi ruling family are arming Sunni insurgents in Iraq. This is similiar to the American authorities arming, directly or indirectly, the North Koreans,the Chinese Communists, and the North Vietnamese during the Cold War. Another interesting anecdote is the fact that during the build-up to the recent Iraq and Afghan Wars, a U.S. business executive was asked about the morality of arming and supplying \\"the other side.\\" His response was that he would sell to anyone as long as they could pay for it. One should note that Reagan and Bush both supported Osama Bin Laden in teh 1980s when the Afghan rebels fought agains the Soviets. Then Pres. Reagan was warned but to no avail.Maybe Sutton's book is an exposure or Orwellain wars and political machinations. The fact the Soviet authorities continued a Cold War for so long enabled U.S. authorities to spy and persecute U.S. citizens while for being Communists while doing big business with Big Communism. Pres. Nixon made a political career attacking Communists here in the U.S. while extending diplomatic and political overtures to the Communist Chinese and the Soviets. The wicked Communists did not play fair. The worst thing happened to the Communists when peace broke out, and they did have the Yankee Imperialist Devils to fear.Anthony's book is instructive in that the examples and case studies sound all too familiar given the continuation of war scares and shooting wars. The only difference is the change of the enemies. Anthony Sutton's book is still relavent."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"Author Anthony Sutton has done a remarkable job of documenting the insidious betrayal of the super wealthy American elite, who literally bankrolled the most brutal communist government of all time. If you have ever wondered why the very wealthy should seem to be sympathetic with communism, herein lies the answer. This is extraordinarily important information, which deserves a wide audience."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"The orthodox history of the Russian Revolution, like most \\"official histories\\", always seems somehow superficial, facile, lacking certain crucial details, despite the vast amount of literature available on the subject. One of the most important considerations when viewing major events in human history is always the question of who provided financial backing; this naturally shows who supported the idea and their subsequent behaviour often shows why. Or in other words, follow the money. The orthodox historiography of the Russian Revolution does not include, like so much else which threatens the status quo, detailed analysis of the financial backing and behind-the-scenes organisation which must go into a successful revolution. Instead we are treated to a deluge of pompous and nonsensical verbiage from the so-called revolutionaries themselves while the real revolutionaries, the instigators and planners, skulk back to their richly-appointed holes.This book is the first in a series of three by British-born researcher Antony Sutton, the point of which is to irrefutably demonstrate Wall Street promotion and support of barbaric socialist regimes in the twentieth century in order to create captive markets for government-backed monopolies, and also to control international markets by creating false competition and various other deceptions. That there are only three books in this series naturally does not mean that there were only three totalitarian socialist regimes in the twentieth century; the point is simply to demonstrate a pattern; that this particular pattern involves two of the most barbaric regimes in human history, as well as one of the more obvious socialist experiments in the supposedly-capitalist USA, all involving the same relatively small group of (privileged & wealthy) people, is a particularly important point that should not be lost on the reader.Leaving aside claims of inaccuracy by some reviewers whose hackneyed use of the epithet \\"conspiracy theorist\\" demonstrates they are too mired in the false left-right paradigm and consequently too ignorant of the intricasies of the individualist/collectivist argument (including the true nature of socialism) to be truly objective, and whose quibbles demonstrate they have misread, and therefore misquoted direct quotations, misrepresented facts, and generally read and reviewed the book with a view to \\"proving\\" the author wrong (and failing miserably), the author has in fact succeeded in doing exactly what he set out to do in this book: he has shown beyond any reasonable doubt that the Bolshevik Revolution was aided and abetted from the start by Wall Street. There is additionally the suggestion, not examined in great depth here, that it was not only aided and abetted from Wall Street but planned there as well.Using unimpeachable primary documentation, mostly from government archives and personal memoirs, and backed up by meticulous research (this was, after all, the author's occupation) the author here presents the untold story of how Wall Street bankers and industrialists funded and helped organise the Russian Revolution, using the 1917 American Red Cross mission to Russia as the primary vehicle, aided and abetted by well-placed people within the US (and other) governments. This is not, I hasten to add, an implication of the Red Cross; the author is quick to point out that Red Cross missions have often been used for revolutionary purposes without the knowledge of administrators. But the fact that the American Red Cross mission to Russia was staffed predominantly by Wall Street bankers and lawyers, that they acted on behalf of Wall Street and Russian revolutionaries whilst on the mission, that official channels were often bypassed or ignored, and also that subordinate Red Cross missions (for instance that in Romania) suffered from a total lack of support or communication from their masters in Russia, are all well documented and astutely connected and summarised, as are the direct relationships between Wall Street luminaries, politicians and revolutionaries (or terrorists in the modern idiom).Wall Street & The Bolshevik Revolution is concise yet incisive, well documented and well argued, impeccably referenced and researched. An essential addition to the history library and once again, like so many similar subjects, it is real history that SHOULD be taught in schools. The reason it isn't is explored in later books by Antony Sutton."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"As a life time political activist, who became a \\"leftest\\" in college, influenced by professors whom very much did not share this book with us. If they had, my take on \\"leftest\\" \\"progressive\\" social movements would have been greatly altered. It is clear from Mr. Sutton's book that \\"the elite\\" have used the alchemical/Hegelian approach to controlling reality. By creating leadership in what 'appears' to be diametrically opposed opposites the \\"elite\\" are able to control the 'apparent' solutions/compromises. Hence you find the New York skyscraper at 120 Broadway giving both to \\"communists\\" and \\"anti-communists\\". The American \\"elite\\" work out of this building (as an aside you can Google earth this building, it is less than a block from the wall street stock exchange.)delighting in how very easy it is to control society when you have all the money in the world and a vision of how to use it. Now it is clear that resistance to the New World Order must begin by breaking from as many connections you have with it as possible and that includes work, consumption and leisure. Controlling Local Markets is the only sure way of breaking from the globalists."},{"Title":"Wall Street & the Bolshevik Revolution","review":"_Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution_, first published in 1974 and republished here by Buccaneer Books in 1993, by noted economist and researcher Antony C. Sutton is an astounding tale of the involvement of Wall Street bankers in the Bolshevik Revolution. Antony C. Sutton (1925 - 2002) was a British born economist and conspiracy researcher who worked for a time at the Hoover Institute. His works attempt to show the involvement of certain individuals within the United States in aiding the rise of the Soviet Union. This book is the first of a trilogy focusing on Wall Street and its involvement in the Bolshevik Revolution, the New Deal, and Hitler's Germany. As Sutton explains in his Preface, the common notion that finance capitalism is fiercely opposed to Marxian Communism is entirely fallacious. Sutton maintains that this view of capitalism and Communism as two opposing forces which was first put forth by Karl Marx himself does not stand up to critique. In fact, it can be seen that finance capitalists and international bankers took an active part in furthering the Bolshevik Revolution in their quest for unlimited profits and their desire to tap into Russia's new markets. Further, as Sutton explains the quest for monopoly can be seen manifested in the realization of socialism in which all competition is stifled and a single monolithic state controls the means of production. Sutton dedicates his book to the \\"unknown Russian libertarians\\", the Greens, who in 1919 fought against both the Reds and the Whites. This book documents the role of Wall Street capitalists in financing the Bolshevik Revolution and actively promoting Communism. As such, it shows the apparent mutual antagonism between finance capitalism and Marxian Communism to be based on a false notion.This book begins with a Preface where Antony Sutton explains how since the 1920s various books and pamphlets have been put forth attempting to provide a link between \\"international bankers\\" and \\"Bolshevik revolutionaries\\". Sutton maintains that his book is based on hard evidence and will show the commonly believed notion of capitalism and Communism in opposition to be fallacious. The first chapter is entitled \\"The Actors on the Revolutionary Stage\\" and begins with some examples showing the influence of Wall Street bankers on Bolshevism. To begin with, Sutton considers a cartoon of Robert Minor in 1911 for the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_ showing J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockfeller, Teddy Roosevelt, and other Wall Street figures shaking hands with Karl Marx. This cartoon resoundingly expresses the sentiment feared by many that Wall Street played an active role in promoting Marxian Communism. Sutton finds the usual form of the political spectrum going from extreme left to extreme right as less than useful and instead considers the possibility of placing collectivism against individual freedom. Sutton argues that collectivism is based on monopoly interests and shows how in his infamous book _Confessions of a Monopolist_, Frederick C. Howe explains how the monopolist must enter into politics to increase his control. Sutton contrasts the interpretations of the revisionists such as Gabriel Kolko and Murray Rothbard with the more traditional views of individuals like the American ambassador George Kennan who maintained a false dichotomy between Wall Street financiers and the Communists. Sutton then explains the Bolshevization of Wall Street and how Wall Street financiers sought to increase their profits through developing a centralized Soviet Communism as opposed to a centralized tsarist Russia or a decentralized free Russia. The second chapter is entitled \\"Trotsky Leaves New York to Complete the Revolution\\" and traces the role of the internationalist Leon Trotsky in furthering the Russian Revolution. Sutton asks the question of how Trotsky survived in a capitalist America in New York and finds that he survived rather well surprisingly. Trotsky lived very well indeed and drove around in a limousine despite the fact that his supposed only means of income was through a meager writer's salary that could have barely covered his rent. Sutton then dares to consider the real source of Trotsky's funds to explain this discrepancy. Sutton examines such issues as the Overman Committee which investigated German money in the United States funding Bolshevism, Woodrow Wilson issuing a passport to Trotsky, Canadian government documents on Trotsky's release, Canadian military intelligence views of Trotsky, and Trotsky's intentions and objectives. Sutton notes that Trotsky's objectives were in line with the objectives of other American elites in creating the Russian revolution. In an ironic note, Sutton examines the Stalinist show trials of the 1930s in which Trotsky's name came up. During these trials, Trotsky was claimed to be in league with foreign aggression and international fascism. Such remarks make much better sense when put into the context surrounding Trotsky and the influence of international capitalists located at Wall Street on both Trotsky and fascism. The third chapter is entitled \\"Lenin and German Assistance for the Bolshevik Revolution\\" and explains how German officers aided Lenin through Lenin's transfer to Russia in April 1917. Sutton examines the Sisson Documents which are believed to be forgeries as outlined by George Kennan but which have been argued to prove a Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy. Sutton considers the tug-of-war in Washington by examining the influence of U.S. officials and noting the prominent role of such individuals as Woodrow Wilson and the nefarious Colonel Edward M. House. The fourth chapter is entitled \\"Wall Street and the World Revolution\\" and shows the prominence of Rockefeller and Morgan interests in furthering the goals of World Revolution. Sutton considers the fact of American bankers and Tsarist loans, Olof Aschberg (the \\"Bolshevik banker\\") in New York in 1916, the role of Olof Aschberg in the Bolshevik revolution, the role of Nya Banken and Guranty Trust joining Ruskombank, Guaranty Trust and German espionage in the United Sates from 1914 to 1917, the Guaranty Trust-Minotto-Caillaux threads noting the role of Otto Kahn in praising socialist aims to be brought about through \\"non-socialist means\\". The fifth chapter is entitled \\"The American Red Cross Mission in Russia - 1917\\" and examines the role of the American Red Cross Mission to Russia as an operational vehicle of Wall Street financiers. Sutton provides a list of those involved with this mission, examines important documents, details the American Red Cross Mission to Romania, examines the role of Colonel Thompson (who gave Bolshevists $1 million) in Kerensky's Russia, considers the role of the socialist mining promoter Raymond Robins, and examines the role of the international Red Cross and revolution. The sixth chapter is entitled \\"Consolidation and Export of the Revolution\\" and shows how consolidation led to the export of the revolution. This chapter considers the role of William Boyce Thompson in the revolution, the role of Lloyd George and the British War Cabinet, and various unofficial ambassadors to Russia including Robins, Lockhart, and Sadoul. Sutton also explains how the revolution was exported to Russia and considers the case of Jacob H. Rubin (a mysterious figure and a banker who \\"helped to form the Soviet Government of Odessa\\") and Robert Minor (the cartoonist mentioned above who was active in promoting Bolshevik propaganda). The seventh chapter is entitled \\"The Bolsheviks Return to New York\\" and considers such things as the raid on the Soviet Bureau in New York, corporate allies of the Soviet bureau, and European bankers and the Bolsheviks. The eighth chapter is entitled \\"120 Broadway, New York City\\" and shows how those financiers who helped fund the Bolsheviks were all located in or around 120 Broadway in New York City. This chapter examines the role of American International Corporation, the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, and the role of prominent Bolshevist proponent John Reed as an \\"establishment revolutionary\\". The ninth chapter is entitled \\"Guaranty Trust Goes to Russia\\" and shows the role of Guaranty Trust in promoting the Bolshevists. This chapter considers the role of Wall Street and Professor Lomonossoff, setting the stage for the commercial exploitation of Russia (the real goal of the Wall Street bankers in hopes of attaining access to Russia's vast natural resources), the struggle between Germany and the United States for Russian business, Soviet gold and American banks, and Max May of Guaranty Trust and the Ruskombank. The tenth chapter is entitled \\"J. P. Morgan Gives a Little Help to the Other Side\\" and shows the role of J. P. Morgan in financing both Communism and anti-Communism in accordance to Hegelian doctrine (thesis-antithesis-synthesis). Sutton considers the role of United Americans (a virulently anti-Communist group founded by Morgan), and the role of Morgan and Rockefeller and Kolchak (a Russian general who opposed Bolshevism). The eleventh chapter is entitled \\"The Alliance of Bankers and Revolution\\" and examines the evidence presented for this case. Sutton quotes from Georgetown professor Carroll Quigley to show that Morgan was active in financing various far left wing groups and then provides an explanation for this \\"unholy alliance\\" of big capitalists and communists. Sutton maintains that in the quest for profits capitalists sought to tap into Russia's enormous potential even if that meant financing Bolshevists. Further, as Sutton shows by examining an argument made by Gabriel Kolko (showing that railroad owners and not farmers wanted more regulation of railroads) the goal was ultimately to obtain monopoly through socialism by ridding the world of competition. As Sutton explains, \\"The gigantic Russian market was to be converted into a captive market and a technical colony to be exploited by a few high-powered American financiers and the corporations under their control.\\" Sutton also examines the Marburg plan which allowed for the socialization of the world. Sutton concludes by noting that Wall Street, the Morgan-Rockefeller complex located at 120 Broadway, sought to achieve control over Russia by going to bat for the Bolsheviks in Washington. Sutton then shows the horrors wrought by the Soviet state and the Korean and Vietnam Wars in which over 100,000 soldiers died after technology was given from the United States to finance the Soviets. In sum, Sutton concludes that the Russian revolution was betrayed as maintained by the anarchist writer Voline. The book ends with several appendices. The first appendix provides a list of names of those involved among the bankers. The second appendix considers the issue of \\"The Jewish Conspiracy of the Bolshevik Revolution\\". Sutton will argue that the Jewish conspiracy notion has been discredited, but still it must be noted that a large number of those involved in implementing the Soviet state were of Jewish ethnicity. And the third appendix provides a list of documents which prove the involvement of Wall Street bankers in financing Bolshevism.This book provides an excellent analysis of the role of Wall Street finance capitalists in furthering the aims of Bolshevists. Sutton shows that the apparent mutual antagonism between capitalist and communist as first put forth by Karl Marx is in fact a chimera. In fact, capitalists sought to increase their profits and attain monopoly by funding the Russian Revolution which gave birth to the tyrannical Soviet state."},{"Title":"Beyond the Blue Mountains Hb","review":"Penelope Lively tells a variety of short stories each of which is somewhat lacking in the depth of detail found in many other short stories, but which provides just enought detail to enable us to understand the human drama which unfolds.

On occasion thought-provoking, but generally just a good light read.If you like these you will probably also enjoy the Jeffrey Archer collections of short stories."},{"Title":"THE TEXAN","review":"The Bitter Creek Series, are modern day Western Romance/Adventure stories, by Joan Johnston. In this the second of the series, \\"The Texan\\", Bayleigh Creed and Owen Blackthorne are thrown together to try and find their brothers, who are both some way involved in an intriguing and tense mystery concerning the theft of some deadly VX nerve gas. The Creeds and Blackthornes have been bitter enemies for generations, and although the romance that blosoms between the two is predictable(their siblings fell for each other in the first of the series, \\"The Cowboy\\"), there are several other stories going on that will keep you from putting this book down. The hunt for the brothers and the stolen VX nerve gas, puts them in danger at every turn, and the mystery of finding out who the bad guys are, is captivating. Other family members have various sagas going on as well. The young Summer Blacthorne, and \\"Bad' Billy Coburn start becoming more then friends, and their story heats up with complications. The older generation doesn't get left out either, as the parents story goes back to long before the children were even born. Joan Johnston puts some great finishing touches on the end, but as always, leaves you wanting more. The third in the series, \\"The Loner\\", picks up the unfinished stories.Miss Johnston adds just enough of the previous story to fill you in on the background of the characters and the families, so if you haven't read the first one, you will not be lost. She also gives you a good taste of the prequel series, \\"Sisters of the Lone Star\\", so that not only will you get an idea of the family history dating back to before Texas was a State, but will leave you wanting to read about the predecessors as well. Those books are (in order), \\"Frontier Woman\\", \\"Comanche Woman\\", and \\"Texas Woman\\". All full of fabulous Western adventure,intriguing family sagas, and the steamy romance that Miss Johnston always brings us.The characters are always strong and interesting, and the stories seem well researched and they bring realism and sometimes a bit of a history or current event lesson to the story.If you have not read any of the books mentioned above, and are interested in those as well, please see my reviews for details.Also available in paperback.Enjoy the read...Laurie"},{"Title":"Get Out the Vote: How to Increase Voter Turnout","review":"I am a 60 something Campaign Worker that has been at it since Students for Nixon 68, and have worked in both Marketing and Management since then.

However compared to the movie the book is much more in-depth with more characters and details.

Is there an unique interpretation to a legal prescription, or language is dubious by nature? This questions are largely discussed in the later work of Brian Bix. In his oeuvre professor Bix confronts some of the most prominent authors of contemporary legal theory and philosophy of language as well. Varying from H.L.A. Hart's \\"open texture\\" to Ronald Dworkin's \\"legal answer thesis\\", the philosophy subjacent to the legal debate is exposed and revisited. Starting from the radical indeterminacy thesis, professor Bix discuss the (mis)interpretations of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's skeptical paradox (cf. \\"Philosophical Investigations\\", paragraph 201). Professor Bix argues that Wittgenstein conceptions about rule-following refer only to the \\"clear cases\\", i.e., cases which following the rule is reputed self-evident. That is to say: the rule-following thesis is worth only when one do not think before obeying the rule, when there is no \\"interpretation\\" in the strong sense of reflection. His point, however, somehow miss the main part of the issue. One possible exegesis of Wittgenstein's secondary philosophy is that all the rules are applied automatically or, at least, we could not determine when one stop to play the \\"language games\\". Wittgenstein uses the clear cases just as prototypes, small and simple models for study. Not withstanding the foregoing, professor Bix has exceeded his skills of legal argumentation, bringing forth a strong and well grounded book of jurisprudence."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Presents Wedding Music for Two Violins","review":"I've been using this book at weddings, where my friend and I get hired to play violin duets, and we use most of the songs in this book at some point in the ceremony.

So if you are familiar with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), you can use it to programmatically perform tasks within each Office product, like Excel, Word or Powerpoint. Or, within one of these products, you can write an application that can invoke an instance of another program.Within one book, Stephens shows an efficient and unified way to learn how to do all this, and more. The trick is to be able to use VBA as a macro programming language. This is the key to understanding and using MS Office as a coherent entity. Ultimately, Stephens suggests that it is quicker than learning how to program each product on a case-by-case basis.Stephens cheerfully dumps on other texts that call you an idiot or dummy. (If you know what I mean.) He unabashedly expects you to be conversant in VB or VBA. To be specific, he doesn't waste time going over the elementary syntactical points of VBA.

He provides statistics about: depth, water temp., activity of the victim prior to the attack, and even body parts that were attacked. This book is in my opinion, one of the greatest shark books to date"},{"Title":"Shark attack","review":"This was a favorite book of mine when I was a teenager. I even wrote a letter to the author, picking some nit or other (and he replied). In re-reading it decades later I have discovered all over again what I liked so much then - that the author revels in the scientific process, that mere data without analysis can lead to misunderstanding... that knowing we need to know more is not an admission of defeat. Plus of course there are all the shark stories! So, read it for the gruesome thrill, or read it for the tour-de-force of science at its best, but either way it will reward. Asimov, Sagan, Dyson, all wrote excellent books about scientific enguiry. If you do read this book, and like that aspect, these guys will also be good reads."},{"Title":"Theory of games and economic behavior,","review":"I'm not even sure I'm qualified to pass judgement on this book, but what I understand, I give 5 stars without hesitation. The authors discuss almost every class of game (2-person, 3-person, zero-sum, non-zero-sum, etc.) and even a very simplified version of poker.You basically have to be a mathematician to get full value from this book. This book is absolutely full of equations and complex proofs. For a beginner with little math, I'd recommend Game Theory by Morton Davis, or for someone with some university math I'd recommend Games and Decisions by Luce and Raiffa. However, if your math is good, you might as well go straight to this book, which started the whole field of game theory."},{"Title":"Theory of games and economic behavior,","review":"Let me start out by acknowledging that this is THE BOOK that started Game Theory as it exists today. While Bayesian statistics are an obvious precursor, everyone agrees that von Neumann's and Morgenstern's work was ground breaking.That said, this is not the best written Game Theory text out there. Like all seminal works, it suffers from the basic fact that we've learned a lot of new things since the time it was written. Many people have gone on to build and expand on the insights contained in this book, especially in the area of bargaining and cooperative game theory.This is a very impressive book to keep on your shelf, and the discussion of poker and the role of bluffing is very interesting, but, owing largely to the 60+ years that have passed since its initial publication, it's not the best reference work or study material available.Another word of warning: The review below is correct that the level of math that you must understand to fully appreciate this book is quite substantial. This book is more for the mathematically sophisticated who want to develop an appreciation for the origins of game theory."},{"Title":"Theory of games and economic behavior,","review":"I am in the middle of this book now. I chose it because it was the first in this field. It presents so much information, it can overwhelming. Perhaps I should have chosen a simpler book for my first. Oh well, I will plod along. My limited math skills meas I miss out on a lot of the book, but the stuff in between the math is great and is helping me to better understand the ideas.I'm giving it four stars. It is jam-packed with great research and the reader can learn quite a bit, but the heavy math emphasis makes it difficult for many to consume."},{"Title":"Theory of games and economic behavior,","review":"A fundamental book in the application of the theory of games in the social sciences, it compares the application of games to social behavior with similar progress in the physical Sciences; and anticipates similar progress . Apart from the first chapter which is on applications to Economics,the remnant seems to be on the theory of games"},{"Title":"Theory of games and economic behavior,","review":"This book is a must for high level math or econ. majors. To truly understand all the math you need advanced calculus, but the book is still worth while if you only have a basic knowledge of math. The work von Neumann did was revolutionary, with game theory being a joke before this work. You should read it."},{"Title":"Theory of games and economic behavior,","review":"Like reading murky Elizabethan prose for this generation of game theorists.Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (TGEB) is the Ur-text of game theory, and Morgenstern and von Neumann bridge the gap and make discoveries between logical positivism, formal logic, choice sets, number theory, and binomial and multinomial outcomes.But in retrospect, this work is rather cumbersome and notation, because so much of it was new, is often baffling to those who have learned game theory from more modern lecturers: a lot of clarity and light has been shed on the field since this was written.As brilliant as the insights of von Neumann, and to a lesser extent Morgenstern, were, they were building in response to the nearly simultaneous discoveries by Nash of a new sub-set of mathematics, and like all new fields the first expression needed editing and focus. For this is this work's flaw: it attempted as a first expression of a new field to be comprehensive. Whereas Nash's discovery of equilibrium was lean and concise, with profound reverberations throughout decision sciences, TGEB is bloated and sometimes misguided: economics is too huge a field, and even then the concept of homo economicus rationalis was crumbling under the discovery that people make suboptimal decisions all the time.For those who are reading this for historical curiosity, I suggest William Poundstone's \\"Prisoner's Dilemma\\" in conjunction with TGEB, but frankly modern expressions of game theory in more abbreviated texts such as Harold Kuhn's works are actually better because they've cleaned out the dead ends and tightened up the notation and expression."},{"Title":"Theory of games and economic behavior,","review":"This book is very important for the quality of argument by two big personalities.

It is one of the most rational studies of the issue of homosexual boy prostitution in America. Many aspects of Lloyd's study are still applicable some twenty years later.Lloyd covers this controversial topic beginning with his discovery that both his teenage son and ward have posed in the nude for a pornographer whom they first met while hitchiking to the beach. He covers the topics of boys consensually selling their bodies for money to older men, chickens and chickenhawks in his terminology.He tells the story of 12 year old Jimmy who ran away from his abusive family in the Appalachians to make his way in New York. Befriended by a 15 year old pimp, he is introduced to gay sex and selling his body to older men. Lloyd gives the details of this seamy indoctrination.He also tells the stories of some of the older men who pay for willing sex with these boys. Like the judge who had 18 boys that he had loved over his lifetime come to his funereal. He is unusual in that he puts real faces to these men, and does not demonize them. He even gives examples where boys have benefited from the caring given by older men, and have grown up to be good citizens.Lloyd covers the faults in society, many of which still persist 20 years later, that cause boys to turn to prostitution. From abusive homelife, to child care institutions who provide abuse not care, to the juvenile justice system. Also he covers the problems of adoptions and fostering for openly gay boys.He offers solutions ranging from new government bodies to speak for youth to liberalized adoption laws. Also the timely spending of money on youth in need of care before they become a criminal justic system problem.While sensational in areas, even explicit in sexual details, this book is overall a sensible, rational study of the issues surrounding boys willingly sell themselves for sex. Many of the issues still persist today, and too many of the corrective actions remain to be implemented. All in all a good read for those interested in boys and their welfare."},{"Title":"FOR MONEY OR LOVE: BOY PROSTITUTION IN AMERICA","review":"I found this book to be very informative and interesting. It references specific cases and where boy prostitution can be found. Although dated, the problem still exists. I would love to read an updated version by this author to gauge any progress that has been made in the institutions in which we house young boys. I would recommend."},{"Title":"FOR MONEY OR LOVE: BOY PROSTITUTION IN AMERICA","review":"The book deals with a subject that is taboo in america, and a society that demonizes the boys and men who participate in older man boy sexual relations. In a way, it discusses pedophilia, since the boys are young, and the men who pay them are older, but it puts a face on the boys, and the men who pay them. Unlike conventional wisdom, which demonizes all sex between older men and boys, this book portrays the reality of such coupling, and the after effects. In other words, these relationships can be positive, and harm no one. The book covers the subject from the 1800, and the boy brothels in San Francisco, to the modern area and how boy prostitution is carried on. Although the book mainly deals with boys who get paid for their sexual favors, it also shows that at times money is given out of love, and not because of the sexual favors. All in all, this is the first book I have ever read that treats the subject without the stain attached to it in the modern era. It is best to read it with an open mind, and set any prejudices aside."},{"Title":"Write on: Journal-Keeping for Teens","review":"Patricia L. Fry's book Write On!

Such themes are dealt with as the life of the prostitues, the conflict of a writer who wants to tell the truth, a harsh one, but who is under contract to paint it over into a musical comedy and a computer learning to appreciate aesthetics.As usual this work is written in Resnick's deceptively easy to follow style wherein one is not hit over the head with his often poignent themes but rather do they sneak up with subtly haunting impact on one who thinks he is merely enjoying a fluff piece.If the first three selections in the series are weak, and I have no reason to think they are, this collection is still worth the price of admission for the final novel"},{"Title":"Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure - Universal Edition Revised","review":"Demeter's manual is an outstanding companion to Robert's Rules of Order.

A lot of \\" boy, that Mathewson sure was a heck of a guy\\" and \\"I wish we were all like Christy\\" If you want to read a boring book with little to no excitement, pick this one up. However, if you want excitement and emotion, head towards Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, Satchel Paige or Hal Chase."},{"Title":"The Player: Christy Mathewson, Baseball, and the American Century","review":"It's been almost 90 years since Christy Mathewson last threw a pitch in a major league baseball game, and more than 75 years since his untimely death from tuberculosis. Yet time has left his on-the-field achievements and his greater legacy undiminished. His 373 career wins are still third highest in major league history. In this slim, gracefully written volume Philip Seib explores not only Mathewson's role in the game, but in the context of the larger society as well.Professional baseball at the dawn of the 20th century was still seen as a haven for rowdies. The college-educated Mathewson represented a new standard, one in harmony with President Theodore Roosevelt's affirmation of the active life. As America moved toward involvement in World War I under the idealistic Woodrow Wilson, Mathewson's willingness to serve was once again in synch with the mood of the era. When Matty stood against the corruption that infected the game in the late teens, it was a precursor to greed and scandals that seemed to dominate national life in the 1920s.Seib's book is a worthy tribute to a great player, and more significantly, a great man.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"The Player: Christy Mathewson, Baseball, and the American Century","review":"This book is a decent read but it is less a biography of Mathewson than it is a commentary on the times and events that he lived through. I had hoped to learn about who Christy Mathewson was and what made him so great and instead I felt like I read an overview of the major events in baseball and history during the late 1800's to the mid 1900's."},{"Title":"The Player: Christy Mathewson, Baseball, and the American Century","review":"Considering the book is less than 200 pages long I wondered what this book would tell me about Christy Mathewson I haven't already read somewhere else. Author Philip Seib emphasizes the positive role model Matty played both as a player and as a private citizen. The author also provides us with details of former major leaguer Eddie Grant who lost his life fighting in World War I. His monument used to appear in center field in the Polo Grounds, and I was pleased to read details I hadn't read before. Mathewson enlisted in World War I, and came in contact with poisonous gas in a training drill in Europe shortly before The Great War ended. He returned from Europe to help McGraw as a coach with the Giants, and once again encountered the crooked Hal Chase whom Matty had in his brief tenure as manager of the Cincinnati Reds after his (Matty's) playing days were over. He was an observer of the 1919 World Series between the White Sox and Reds, and to his dismay, observed what he believed to be crookedness in the play of the Chicago team. His cough persisted, and progressed to tuberculosis. Matty spent time at Saranac Lake in upstate New York where the dry air was thought to be helpful to patients. He felt well enough to join the Boston Braves in the front office, but had to return to Saranac Lake where he died during the 1925 World Series. This would be an excellent book for both beginning readers of Christy Mathewson, or those who have a more extensive knowledge of one of the first five members elected to Baseball's Hall of Fame."},{"Title":"The Player: Christy Mathewson, Baseball, and the American Century","review":"When I was given this book, the gift-bearer informed me that it was the perfect gift for me, \\"... a book about baseball AND U.S. history.\\". Being the grateful recipient of said gift I of course bit my tongue, didn't respond, \\"How do you separate the two?\\", and accepted the gift in the spirit it was given. Now, after reading it, I realize how smart my niece is. The book is indeed about both, and without wandering too far from its subject, (Christy, in case there is some confusion), is a very engaging read. Similar books about this time period in baseball tend to get repetitive and somewhat choppy to read by piecing together newspaper reports and box scores. This author alleviates that problem by also tracking events in the U.S., (and the world as 1914 approaches), while Christy pitches his way through his baseball career. This is recommended for baseball novices, hard core fans and anyone in between as it's a nicely written book."},{"Title":"The Player: Christy Mathewson, Baseball, and the American Century","review":"There is not enough baseball detail in what could have been an interesting book. Seib's efforts to set the career of BIG SIX in a broader context is laudable, but misses the point for a book this brief and this short. Some people devote their lives to the history of the world's greatest game. Seib is not one of them. The mechanics of his prose will not put you to sleep, but do not linger in the mind either. But the glaring error of this book is selling Christy short. Seib can bring himself to devote less than two pages to one of the greatest World Series performances in history, where Christy spun three shutouts. While some baseball books devolve into pitch-by-pitch tedium, more detail here is demanded.If there is a better Christy book out there I will consider reading it. Do not waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"The Player: Christy Mathewson, Baseball, and the American Century","review":"\\"The Player\\" provided a trip back in time to what it was like playing ball around the turn of the century through the times of the first World War.To understand what Mathewson meant to the game itself is truly amazing. Not only being a phonomenal pitcher with exceptional control, he realized that he was a role model for others, not only the young kids that idolized him, but the everyday american worker. To know what he gave of himself to others off the ball field, his charity work, volunteering for WWI at the age of 37, gives us a better insight to the individual.The book also tells of his attempts to clean up the game, before the Black Sox scandal. He knew it was going on, tried to warn others, but no one would listen.A great read if you want to get a much clearer insight into one of the greatest ball players of all time. One that is unfortunatelly forgotten by too many in today's game."},{"Title":"The Player: Christy Mathewson, Baseball, and the American Century","review":"The Player is an enjoyable, quick read with several charming stories about Mathewson and his time. However, there is surprisingly little detail about games and achievements and the year to year growth of Mathewson into a great player. Seib does mention the year he pitched 3 shutouts in the World Series and a few other astounding achievements, his incredible accuracy, his college years, his relationship with McGraw and others. It is also nice to see all this put in the context of the time but too often the context is often close to irrelevant in its detail and Mathewson gets lost in the mix.

It's definitely worth reading...but just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"The Player: Christy Mathewson, Baseball, and the American Century","review":"As a fan of baseball history, I have been looking for a modern, definitive biography of Christy Mathewson ever since I grew to admire him many years ago. I was hoping that Philip Seib's The Player would be that elusive work, but I was wrong. Although it covers the major events of Matty's life, Seib works very hard to put him in context as the first major baseball star and the times that he lived in, so what we're left with is less of a biography and more of a social history.This is all well and good, and the premise is an interesting one, except that Seib doesn't take it far enough and when he tries to expound on his theory, he ends up giving more info on other figures of the times like Billy Sunday and Woodrow Wilson than on Mathewson.Almost contradictorally, the main problem is that it all just feels too thin. At less than 200 pages it's a one and a half day read at best and you come away not knowing anything more about Mathewson than you would reading any history of baseball. Were I Seib's editor, I would have recommended that he go in the opposite direction and really blow out his research. Joseph Durso wrote an excellent double biography of John McGraw and Casey Stengel that captured the general history of American society as well as baseball and that is clearly what Seib is aspiring to but falls short.I don't want to knock the book too much since I enjoy general history as much as anyone, but I guess I just expected so much more. Also, Seib labors in spots to draw his conclusions and ends up being extremely repetitive. His reverence for Mathewson is well-appreciated, but borders on overindulgence.If you are interested in reading more on Mathewson, I would recommend seeking out the Jonathan Yardley essay \\"The Real Frank Merriwell\\" for a terrific mini-bio and tribute to a great pitcher."},{"Title":"Insight on the Scriptures Vol. I & 2","review":"I'm pretty sure this is illegal.

His experience as a newspaper reporter (I believe) allows him to effectively suppress any biases he might have possesed toward the conflict in Viet Nam. He makes it hard to put down.I immediatly wanted to know what was going to happen next. He covers the attack upon the US embassy in Saigon in depth. He also covers the worries US military brass had about Khe Sanh. Additionaly, he covers General Westmoreland's attempts to secure another 209,000 troops and the negative publicity and the anti-war backlash created in America by the Tet offensive that would not allow President Johnson to send that amount of troops. This book is a must for those who want to know about the Tet offensive."},{"Title":"Tet!: The Turning Point in the Vietnam War","review":"Don Oberdorfer does a great job in describing the key battle in the Vietnam war. The political decisions made by both sides about the battle are included. The background and key players on our side and their thoughts are described.The battle of Hue is gone into in some detail, including the killing of thousands of civilians, and some other foreign nationals by the North Vietnamese.For anyone wondering why we got out of Vietnam, this is a must read. The shift in attitude from the pro war stance of Johnson's &quot;wise men&quot; is gone into in some detail as they move from pro war in Nov '67 to we must negotiate in early '68.The chronology of events at the end of the book is a great help.The &quot;We had to destroy the village to save it&quot; comment, by Peter Arnett is told too. Peter Arnett was an anti war reporter from the beginning. In 1965 he wrote a bogus report about our Marines using toxic gas on the VC. It was just tear and pepper gas, and was widely used in Vietnam to clear bunkers and tunnels. It was thought more humane than blowing up the people in the tunnels or bunkers. Arnett reported it as poison gas and made world wide headlines. This is discussed in Utters Battalion, another book.In this book, he invents a quote &quot;We had to destroy the village to save it&quot; and again it makes world wide headlines.During the Tet offensive at the battle of Ben Tre, Arnett says an Army Major made the comment. Neither the Major, or any other living person heard the comment.The story of how Westmoreland came to generate the request of 206,00 more troops is told too."},{"Title":"Tet!: The Turning Point in the Vietnam War","review":"Contrary to the previous reviewer, I think Oberdorfer tackled the Tet subject comprehensively and covered all bases in explaining the turning point of the Vietnam conflict.Oberdorfer begins the book by fully explaining what really happened at the American Embassy that fateful January night in 1968. Although most Americans today believe the Embassy was 'overrun,' Oberdorfer explains the true story of a platoon of Viet Cong blasting a hole in the wall to enter the compound but never being able to enter the Chancery building. I believe the reason Oberdorfer starts his book off with the subject is to dispel the 'overrun' myth of VC running through the building capturing documents and, even though it was a minor military skirmish compared to the street-by-street fighting in Hue and siege at Khe Sanh, the American Embassy attack was the paramount event which woke America up to what was happening in SE Asia.Also, the previous reviewer complains the book focuses too much on the politics and media coverage of Tet, not realizing Oberdorfer's main point of the book is that Tet might have been won on the battlefield, but it was an epic defeat on American televisions and in world newspapers. The Tet offensive's primary aim was to cause political upheaval in America to give the Communists a victory exactly like what defeated the French a decade earlier. In a 1947 tract by Hanoi called \\"The Resistance Will Win\\", it states \\"...as a result of the long war the enemy troops become weary and discouraged, and are tormented by home-sickness. The French economy and finances are exhausted; supplying the army is difficult, the French people do not want the war to go on any longer. The movement against the diehards in France goes stronger and more fierce. World opinion severely condemns France...world movement for peace and democracy scores great successes, etc. ...Subtract France from the quote and insert the US and there is the political reasoning for starting the General Offensive. Also, Tet not only caused US and ARVN troop casualties, but it ended a presidential administration and forever changed how the news is presented to the American public by the media. A study of Tet not involving the White House, LBJ, McNamara, Clifford, or for that matter Cronkite, the Wall Street Journal and Time, would be like reading about the light bulb and failing to mention Edison.Oberdorfer's does a great job balancing his information by devoting whole chapters to subjects like the history of Vietnam, pre-Tet America, the shockwave that hit the US after the attack, the 'shot seen around the world' of the Saigon police chief shooting a VC prisoner on the street, the military disaster of Tet to the Viet Cong ranks, the battle of Hue and a section on one of the most decisive months in US history - March 1968.My only gripe is that the book was first written in 1971, which interestingly gives the reader an unusual perspective as the war was still going on, but is begging for a complete Afterword section to fill in the gaps as more information on the North is now available. BTW, there is a great Chronology at the end of the book which makes it easy to follow the play-by-play and would be a student's dream in helping research information."},{"Title":"Tet!: The Turning Point in the Vietnam War","review":"A new edition of this book was published in 2001 with, I believe, a new introduction by the author. I am using the old edition for my own political purposes. I will read the new introduction at some point and add comment at that time.Recently I was listening to Talk of the Nation on National Public Radio and the subject concerned formation of political consciousness. One of the callers identified himself as an ardent 1960's anti-Vietnam War protester and self-styled \`hippie' who in 1984 \`got religion' and saw the error of his ways. The formative point of this new found wisdom was a documentary on the Public Broadcast System (PBS) that indicated to him that the Tet Offensive of 1968 has not been a military victory for the North Vietnamese/South Vietnamese Liberation Front forces (hereafter NVA/NLF). Somehow along the way he had assumed, based, he said, on information from Walter Cronkite that it was a military victory. Well, this writer then as now, as we celebrate the 40th Anniversary of that event, can confirm for that caller that, indeed, Tet was not a military victory NVA/NLF. Here is the point, however, military victory or not, it was certainly a political victory for those NVA/NLF forces. In modern conditions, sometimes political victories are more important that military ones. The book under review, what else it shortcomings might be, confirms this view.Is this book the best one on the history of the Tet offensive? Probably not. However it has the virtue of having been written a short time after this major political event. Thus, although it is not the first draft of history it is close enough for our purposes. The drawback here is that it was written while the war was still going on so that the relationship between Tet 1968, Tet 1972 and then the final military victory in 1975 does not give the event its full impact in the overall scheme of NVA/NLF strategy and American/South Vietnamese counter-strategy.The author hits all the high points of this decisive several month period from about the summer of 1967 when the NVA/NLF decided to make a major push against the South to Tet itself and its immediate aftermath. The author starts off his book with a description the famous NLF raid on the American embassy, goes on to the discuss the strategic aims of the North Vietnamese and the American response to it, the personal saga of one Lyndon Baines Johnson and the in-fighting in the old Cold war national security establishment about the proper American response and then the results and aftermath of the offensive.Reading history with a purpose, in short, to learn some lessons is sometimes a chancy thing. Here that purpose can be encapsulated in the following few words- to draw the lessons of history of the Vietnam War in order to apply them to the opposition struggle against the Iraq war. Yes, the differences between Vietnam and Iraq, in the final analysis are probably greater than the similarities however the American hubris that led Lyndon Johnson to escalation in Vietnam and George W. Bush to occupation in Iraq is still in operation. In the end the author draws the conclusion that history will eventually draw on Tet 1968, and that today's American leaders seem to be willfully ignoring- in modern military warfare the political question is the question. From the NVA/NLF side that entailed heavy and dramatic losses but I would argue that their decision to probe American resolve was essentially correct.

People called him the Human Target, and the nickname stuck. However, no one could ever guess at the huge price Chance had to pay to become someone else. The Human Target didn't just change his looks when he assumed an identity; he also changed his thoughts and feelings, becoming the person he was trying to protect. Now, Chance is semi-retired and he has a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; named Tom McFadden stepping into his shoes. Only Tom is struggling with the whole Human Target gig too-struggling so much that he sometimes forgets who he is and can't remember how to be who he really is. Earl James is a militant black preacher drawing a line in the sand against the local drug dealers, headed up by Dee Noyz. Emerald is an assassin-for-hire, every bit as dedicated and driven as Christopher Chance, and she's been contracted to kill the Human Target. Christopher Chance is caught in the middle of a vicious crossfire: he wants to save himself and Tom McFadden, who feels he must save Earl James. At the same time, Chance has to stay out of the line of fire from Emerald and Dee Noyz. Chance is working against the clock. How can he find the man he trained-someone who can be anyone?Christopher Chance, the Human Target was first created back in the 1970s by Len Wein and Carmine Infantino as a series of eight-page and ten-page backup features in ACTION COMICS, DETECTIVE COMICS, and THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD. Rick Springfield portrayed Chance in a seven-episode television series in the 1990s. Peter Milligan brought Chance back to life for the cutting-edge Vertigo line at DC Comics. Milligan has also written HUMAN TARGET: FINAL CUT, the X-Force monthly comics series, ENIGMA, THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF CYCLOPS AN PHOENIX, CATWOMAN DEFIANT, and SKIN. Edvin Biukovic, the artist on the graphic novel, passed away but left a body of work as his legacy that includes: STAR WARS-THE LAST COMMAND, STAR WARS: X-WING ROGUE SQUADRON THE PHANTOM AFFAIR, GRENDEL TALES: DEVILS AND DEATHS.HUMAN TARGET is a graphic novel that satisfies on numerous levels. For old-time nostalgia fans, the reappearance of Christopher Chance-though in a very different and dark incarnation-is a welcome marriage between the old and the new. The original idea of someone willing to risk his life by being someone else is simple yet fascinating, and all the storytelling is very human. Milligan succeeds brilliantly in bringing that humanness to his story. The fact that every character in this book is driven by needs and emotions that erupt from the core of his or her being is powerful. All of the characters are at once strong and complete, but each one carries his or her faults and the seeds of his or her destruction. The secondary characters in the story-McFadden's wife, Earl James' wife, Emerald's husband, Dee Noyz's old girlfriend-all contributed to the bullet-slick pacing and the emotional implosions that come at the climax. Biukovic's art is phenomenal, an array of lights and darks and fiery colors that dropkick images and action from the pages. The bullet-riddled cross left after the attack in the church and Dee Noyz's attempt to keep Earl James from getting shot by an assassin are stark and moving. Biukovic was as at home with penciling action scenes as he was in penciling simple scenes such as when Becky McFadden was talking with Chance and hanging out her laundry. The plot is convoluted and takes close reading, but is a gem of suspense and building anticipation.Although Milligan somewhat covered Christopher Chance's background, a little more was needed. Where did Christopher Chance come from? Why did he get into the line of work that he did? Where did he get his training in martial arts and in disguise? Where did he find Tom McFadden? How did he train McFadden? Although these missing pieces don't spoil the overall story, their presence would have been welcome.Fans of Greg Rucka, Brian Michael Bendis, and Ed Brubaker will want to add HUMAN TARGET to their reading list. Also, anyone interested in seeing what Vertigo Comics is capable of producing in the way of crime fiction for the mature reader will find no better introduction than this graphic novel."},{"Title":"Human Target (1 of 4)","review":"I was first exposed to Peter Milligan's work when he was writing DC Vertigo's SHADE, THE CHANGING MAN, an eclectic group of stories that usually bordered on the weird. Milligan turns tail on the surreal to write this spy thriller, THE HUMAN TARGET, featuring the tale of two masters of disguise and their penchant for becoming lost in their adopted identities.Milligan does a great job of delving into the empty souls of two men who immerse themselves so fully into their assumed roles that there is little left to work with when their done. They sacrifice their own individuality to take on the dangerous jobs they're given.There's plenty of impressive cinematic action in the book thanks to the excellent work of the departed Edvin Biukovic. For a newcomer to American comics, his storytelling skills were impressive. It's a shame that this Croatian wonder passed away before his star really had a chance to shine.For Europeans, both Milligan and Biukovic show an astounding ability to relate an American story. I guess American media really IS pervasive!HUMAN TARGET is a terrific graphic novel for the adult crowd. I rank it right up there with Vertigo's recent 100 BULLETS series by awesome writer, Brian Azzarrello."},{"Title":"Human Target (1 of 4)","review":"A stunning, stirring tale of identity and redemption that helped point the way towards DC's Vertigo imprint telling tales outside the arena of horror and psychodrama. This book, a revival of a 70s detective series (which also briefly saw life as an ABC television series starring Rick Springfield -- but don't hold that against the title) helped set the stage for the current &quot;100 Bullets&quot; series.Christopher Chance, the original Human Target, has retired. He's been replaced by his assistant -- who now believes that he *is* Christopher Chance. In the middle of all this are a minister who's lost his faith and a crime novelist who wants to make a name for her second life as an assassin.Peter Milligan and the late, much lamented Edvin Biukovic pack this book with jarring plot twists, quiet moments of humanity, and some of the most realistic action sequences I've ever seen. The artist's death from cancer robbed the comics world of one of its future superstars."},{"Title":"Human Target (1 of 4)","review":"I got this comic as a present, since my wife and I enjoy the TV show. I had heard that in the comic, Christopher Chance (the main character) protects his employers by disguising himself as his employers, making himself a human target. I thought this was a ridiculous idea, however, as I started reading this comic, I quickly became interested in the main character and thought the premise was brilliant.The movie Mission Impossible uses this idea of perfect masks to disguise someone, but in the comic, Chance not only wears a mask, but he acts like his character. He changes his voice, changes what he eats, he really becomes the person he's trying to become. After months of playing that role, he even has trouble coming back to being Christopher Chance. This is what made me very interested in the story as it became an study on one's identity.This collection consists of two stories. The first one is a complicated story involving a black priest that tries to save a community from drugs, a house wife/ assassin that is trying to kill Chance and identity issues both in Chance and in his understudy Tom. I really liked this story. The plot kept me interested in what would happen next, while the identity issues made the story be more than just a mystery.The second story involves actors hiring Chance to find a kidnapped kid. The kid is a child star. This story plays around with how many people in the acting world have identity issues and it is also an interesting whodunit. I liked it a lot.With respect to the art, the art in the first story was better than the second one. I really liked the way the book looks. Biukovic was a great artist. It is sad that he died so young (he died in 1999, at the age of 30).A great comic, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Human Target (1 of 4)","review":"Human Target is a top notch piece of visual storytelling. It's a powerful tale about identity and personal redemption told in graphic novel form and these themes are explored in varying degrees with each character in the tale.

The late Edvin Biokivuc provides some wonderful illustrations that are not only a joy to look at, but also enhance Milligan's tale. You can't go wrong with this book...give it a look!"},{"Title":"Human Target (1 of 4)","review":"I admit to being very jaded going into this: I've no great love or interest in the whole noir field. But what sets this apart is that it avoids every single cliche of the genre and instead is a slow burn tale of identity and ID. There are some very startling moments of very brilliant storytelling in there: just when you think you know where the tale is going, it makes sharp left and you're left stunned.The art is clean and easy to understand.

This book shows that he always is a successful business man. Not being a racing fan, I wasn't too excited at first, but I enjoy reading motivational and self-improvement books, so I thought I'd check it out. Although I wouldn't say it turned me into a racing fan, I got to appreciate the scientific and sporting aspects of racing.The advice given, although not earth-shattering, is both true and effective. For example, he talks about the desire to succeed and how this is a necessary &quot;fuel&quot; for winning. Many other self-development authors speak about this much as well. It is not anything new. However, He gives vivid examples from his racing career and from other anecdotes of friends and acquaintances. These examples are well-chosen because they are inspiring.This is similar to other sections of his book. Bobby Unser seems to be very principle oriented as well as a man of integrity. He talk about instances where he could have turned his back on a commitment for monetary gain or to get on a better racing team (he made it seem like it was a somewhat common occurance in auto racing), but he stayed true to his commitment and it ended benefiting him in the end. This is refreshing considering some of the stereotypes of big business today where the search for a dollar seems to be the guiding principle sometimes.I highly recommend this book. Even though it has a lot of auto racing stories, Unser tells them in a way that non-fans would really enjoy them and get motivation from their example."},{"Title":"Winners are Driven: A Champion's Guide to Success in Business and Life","review":"This book is packed with absolutely incredible and helpful guideance.

As an avid reader of business books, having read over sixty, I find this book to be one of the best I have ever read.The book really excels when compared to books written by college professors that give theory rather than Bobby's proven practices. The clear explanations and categorizations are superior to or equal to any book I've read anywhere. Thanks Bobby for giving back with this great book offering one of the best perspectives of how to be excellent generally, how to constantly improve, and how to win in competition.I love auto racing, the sport where Bobby had his success, though I don't watch it much today. USA racing seems to be for any nationality other than an American. Europe's Formula 1 is a joke having grooved tires to slow the cars and chicanes to break up the straightaways.Bobby's period of racing was a best one having high speeds and the basics of all the technologies including advanced aerodynamics; it was only lacking in some of today's safety items and it lacked the hideous computer systems that take away from driver responsibility and skill. The drivers of Bobby's period of history were the real road warriors. So-much-for today's pretty boys... Great book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Winners are Driven: A Champion's Guide to Success in Business and Life","review":"I'm glad I checked these tapes out and listened to them.

My Amazon River Day gives readers a treasured insight into the life of Peruvian riberenos - &quot;people who live near the river.&quot;Told from the perspective of 10-year old Patricia, it follows her day - dawn to dusk - living near the Amazon River where seasons are marked not by changes in temperature, but by the changes in the river level.Edward G. Lines Jr.'s abundant, rich photographs capture life from every angle. Kris Nesbitt's engaging text captivates the reader's attention, being neither too detailed for children, nor overly-simplistic for adults. It answers many questions children and even adults would have about river life: How do they use the water for drinking, bathing, transportation? What are their houses like? What chores do the children have? What is school like for them? How do they play with friends, relax with family? What foods do they eat?My Amazon River Day includes an abundance of information (how do they deal with those pesky mosquitos?) without diving into more serious issues, such as poverty. But most importantly, it teaches a lesson we as parents all hope to pass on - that people all over the world share many similarities, but are beautifully different."},{"Title":"My Amazon River Day","review":"Ms. Nebitt has captured the wonder of the Amazon and how its people live in a marvelous narrative from a child's point of view.

Christmas Day 1995 in Los Angeles at the exceptional age of 101 years, 9 months, 28 days) was an institution. He labeled himself a 'musical lexicographer,' having written several indispensable musical reference works such as 'Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians,' and 'The Lexicon of Musical Invective' (containing hilarious entries from reviews and other sources), as well as the esoteric and encyclopedic, 'Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns.' He also wrote one of the most amusing musical autobiographies around, 'Perfect Pitch.' But before he became a scholar/writer he was a pianist, conductor, composer, and champion of modern music. For instance, he was the first person to conduct an orchestral work of Charles Ives in Europe, and in an appendix of this gargantuan book (1260 pages) he prints twenty pages of letters he received from Ives. Because he lived so long he knew just about everybody in the field of twentieth-century music. (I even met him once when he was approaching his 100th birthday.)The primary content of the book is a day by day account of musical events throughout the Western world from January 1, 1900 up to the death of Ernst Krenek in 1991. This volume, its Fifth Edition, contains all the material of the previous editions (with corrections and additions) plus 1500 additional entries for the period after the Fourth Edition.For a reasonably well-informed music-lover there is rarely a page in this book without information about events in music history that are familiar, as well as others that are interesting but otherwise unknown. To illustrate this I opened the book literally at random to pages 150-151 and found entries, among others, on the premi&egrave;re of Zandonai's 'Francesca da Rimini'; a squib about the fifteen-year-old Henry Cowell demonstrating 'tone clusters' to the San Francisco Music Club; the premi&egrave;re of 'Hashish,' a tone-poem by Sergei Liapunov; the premi&egrave;re of George Butterworth's 'The Banks of Green Willow'; the premi&egrave;re of Vaughan Williams's now-beloved 'London Symphony'; the premi&egrave;re of Franz Schmidt's opera 'Notre Dame'; the premi&egrave;re of Alb&eacute;ric Magnard's magnum opus, his Fourth Symphony; the first performance as orchestral piece (as opposed to accompaniment of a ballet) of Stravinsky's 'Sacre de printemps,' Pierre Monteux conducting. All these took place in February-April 1914. You get the idea.Also included is a section of musical 'documents' such as the Ives letters mentioned, as well as things like the Futurist manifesto, a talk by Alban Berg entitled 'What is Atonality?,' letters to Slonimsky from luminaries such as Arnold Schoenberg, George Bernard Shaw, Anton von Webern and Edgard Var&egrave;se. There are documents from Soviet Russia illuminating the control the government placed on composers and some of their responses.Also included is a valuable section of definitions of musical and allied terms applicable to the modern era with entries from abecedarianism (a gentle term to describe simplistic music - oh, what he has to say about what we would now call minimalism!) to Zen (and its influence on the avant-garde). He also defines some of his own neologisms; for instance, he tends to refer to twentieth-century music as 'vigesimosecular.' One can imagine him smiling at his mock-pompous use of such words.Slonimsky's writing style is idiosyncratic. He is frequently puckish, sometimes acerbic, always superdensely, polysyllabically multifactual; I counted 300 words in one exuberant Russian-doll-like sentence. He created an enormous number of musical neologisms to describe musical processes and styles, some of which have entered the technical vocabulary; for instance, 'pandiatonicism' to describe the process by which 'all seven degrees of the diatonic scale are used freely in democratic equality.' He takes sly pokes at music he does not admire but is never mean-spirited. He gives technical analyses of major works (e.g., his extensive exegeses of the Mahler symphonies which were premi&egrave;red in the 20th century.) He has some inexplicable hobby-horses. For instance, he gives the precise age at death of important musicians as I've done in my opening sentence. He raves about composers that few others seem to care for, e.g., the Swiss Hans Huber. He completely omits some composers that are now well-thought-of, e.g. Sweden's Wilhelm Stenhammar. He tends to go on at length about uses of scales and melodic patterns, not surprising considering his expertise in that area. But overall he is fair-minded and although not anywhere near complete - that would be impossible - the encyclopedic nature of the work requires fervent admiration. There are a few typos along the way - unavoidable - and an occasional error of fact, although it is clear that he makes every effort to correct them (there are frequent retractions of errors made in earlier editions); this even extends to poring over governmental and church birth and death records and newspaper reviews of premi&egrave;re performances.For someone like me who often writes reviews of recordings of obscure twentieth-century works, this volume is indispensable. For others who are generally interested in the musical history of the previous century it would be valuable if not absolutely necessary. Every library worthy of the name ought to have a copy. Slonimsky was one of our cultural treasures and thank goodness his words will live on.Review by Scott Morrison"},{"Title":"Phantom fortune: A novel, (Collection of British authors, Tauchnitz ed)","review":"A nice read that gives the amount of description towards clothes & mannerism, which I really like, but the 'protagonist' story line is not predictable."},{"Title":"Though The Heavens May Fall: The Landmark Trial That Led To The End Of Human Slavery","review":"This volume is a compact, but complete, treatment of the famous 1772 Somerset decision by Lord Mansfield that confirmed that slavery was not legal within Great Britain (but left slavery intact in British colonies and possessions). The key actor upon which the entire narrative focuses is abolitionist Granville Sharp, who initiated several cases challenging the legality of slavery in Britain until he was finally successful in Somerset. His crusade demonstrates the merits of not being easily discouraged by initial setbacks. Given the fact that he subsisted on and financed litigation through a clerk's salary, one can only stand in amazement at his determination to terminate the practice. The author does a good job in discussing the background and character of Lord Mansfield, certainly one of the most influential actors in the development of English law. The reconstruction of the trial itself is well done. While the research is predominantly based upon secondary sources, as is appropriate in a \\"popular\\" history, the narrative is quite easy for the non-lawyer as well as the legal professional to read and profit from--no mean accomplishment in legal history volumes. The endnotes identify valuable sources for further reading on this topic. I found chapter 16, \\"The Mansfield Judgment,\\" particularly interesting in that apparently there is no 100% official text of Mansfield's decision. The author also does a good job in discussing post-decision developments that reflected the impact of the holding, including some in America. A good solid treatment of an incredibily important legal development."},{"Title":"Though The Heavens May Fall: The Landmark Trial That Led To The End Of Human Slavery","review":"This well-researched and highly readable account of the Somerset case in the gestation period of the Abolitionist movement brings home just how close to us in time is the phenomenon of slavery and the stark contradictions of social justice and the abysmal conditions of class struggle, mostly sanitized in standard histories. The rescue of James Somerset from certain death in the sugar plantations of the Caribbean and the process of his trial in the labyrinthine system of the British courts is almost a suspence drama. The saga occurs just at the turning point on the question of bondage and freedom and the next generation will struggle on to achieve the result, but this moment shows the breeze picking up before the storm, like a butterfly effect from small changes to massive transformations.

This book is so meticulously researched, with careful citations of every case mentioned, that it is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Though The Heavens May Fall: The Landmark Trial That Led To The End Of Human Slavery","review":"This is a fascinating book on several levels.First it is the story of a landmark trial that first freed slaves in England - with the comment: \\"The air of England is too pure for a slave to breath in.\\" This story is well worth telling. The hero of the story is Granville Sharp, a Government clerk who educated himself in the law and used his own small income to bring cases on slavery to the bench.The second point that I find interesting is the fact that this was done in court. Parliment could have ended slavery at any time, but didn't. This is saying that even 250 years ago the elected officials didn't want to tackle the difficult issues but passed it over to the courts to take the heat. This rings a familar tone with the way the Congress left it to the courts to handle the segregation issues in the United States. (And today they passed the buck to the courts regarding keeping the feeding tube in the lady in Florida.)Third, this case took place in 1772, long before the American declaration of independence in 1776. It specifically restricted it's enforcement to England proper, not their colonies -- \\"Colonial slavery, he wrote, was a different matter.\\" Had those words been different, slavery would have been outlawed in the United States as well.

Might it have eliminated the Civil War where 600,000 Americans were killed?Beyond these issues, the book itself is well researched, written in a manner as interesting as a novel."},{"Title":"Though The Heavens May Fall: The Landmark Trial That Led To The End Of Human Slavery","review":"Dr. Wise writes in a story telling manner that is easy to read and understand.

The Negroes in whose names the suits were brought play a lesser role. The story of the celebrated Mansfield decision is told with all the drama of the event. Though the question seemed to be whether a slave in the West Indies was a slave in London, the real question was whether under English law-- IN ENGLAND-- a slave was a person or a thing. Mansfield's decision decided that question and also said that slavery was so contrary to the common law that it could only be upheld by positive law and not comity or tradition, or custom.An exciting book as good as any legal mystery available today."},{"Title":"Though The Heavens May Fall: The Landmark Trial That Led To The End Of Human Slavery","review":"It's usually called the Mansfield Decision: the Lord Chief Justice wrote the 1772 opinion that, in outlawing slave status, reinvented England as a Land of the Free. Far better to name it properly as the Somerset Case, because James Somerset had the courage to challenge centuries of legal tradition, and the initiative to find able allies (notably Granville Sharp, the book's \\"star\\"). They unearthed and brilliantly deployed the key precedents---the best of that legal culture---giving it a bold new progressive dimension. Unfortunately there isn't much on Somerset himself, but author Wise has done his best with a thinly-documented life. Lengthy accounts of English legal reasoning and courtroom procedure will tax many readers, but it richly evokes the London atmosphere in which the trial occurred; this is pleasurable reading compared to most books by legal eagles. After winning his case Somerset vanished from history like so many Blacks in that age. But unlike most other slave resisters he sought his own freedom in a manner that struck a heroic blow for all. We may never know enough to call him a great man, but surely he had greatness within him.

The translators also provide a fascinating introduction (pp. 7-22) that discusses Celan's life and career. Semilian and Agalidi note that Celan, who is considered a major German-language poet, grew up and was educated in Romania, and that German was spoken in his parents' home. They also note that the poems and prose poems contained in this short volume (76 pages) were written during time that Celan spent in the Romanian capital of Bucharest between 1945 and 1947.The introduction further describes these Romanian pieces as \\"somewhat 'secret' or private\\" writings--texts that Celan \\"did not translate, publicize or intend to publish.\\" I found these pieces to be strange and surreal--overall this body of work reminds me of some of Gertrude Stein's adventurous writings. Celan uses words in odd, hard-to-decipher combinations; he often creates weird and striking imagery. There are occasional cultural references--Spanish dancers, Columbus, the Great Southern Cross, etc. But overall, there is very little in the poems that anchor them to identifiable historic or cultural moments. They feel more like deeply personal psychological phenomena. He also frequently uses the pronouns \\"I,\\" \\"you,\\" \\"we,\\" or variations thereof.Here are sample fragments that may give a sense of the overall flavor of the book: \\"Our phosphorescent eyeballs will scurry down from the walls\\"; \\"I offer my fingers bloodied by the floating spines of the nocturnal sky.\\" Other interesting phrases include \\"a chiming of celibate coins,\\" \\"the leprosied curtain of the bloodstained tents,\\" and \\"the razor-edged fanfare of the eyeless platoon.\\" This bilingual edition presents the Romanian and English versions on facing pages. Although I can neither read nor speak Romanian, I appreciated having the distinctive-looking Romanian text available; it adds visual excitement to the overall presentation.

This is required reading for anyone interested in philosophy or its history, and honestly I don't see how this work can be ignored by anyone interested in the history of ideas. It's also a work that I'd recommend to anyone who wants to be introduced to philosophy by reading the work of a great philosopher. And don't worry: it shouldn't take you more than an afternoon to read through it.The Meditations has had an incalculable influence on the history of subsequent philosophical thinking. Indeed, according to nearly every history of philosophy you're likely to come across, this work is where modern philosophy begins. It's not that any of Descartes's arguments are startlingly original--many of them have historical precedents--but that Descartes's work was compelling enough to initiate two research programs in philosophy, namely British empiricism and continental rationalism, and to place certain issues (e.g. the mind-body problem, the plausibility of and responses to skepticism, the ontological argument for the existence of God, etc.) on the philosophical agenda for a long time to come. Moreover, Descartes was capable of posing questions of great intrinsic interest in prose accessible to everyone. So the Meditations is a work of value to both newcomers to philosophy and to those with a great deal of philosophical background.The First Meditation is Descartes's implementation of his method of doubt. Descartes's aim here is to systematically doubt everything he believes that seems dubitable in any way and thereby to arrive at something that is absolutely certain and indubitable. Here Descartes formulates two very famous skeptical arguments: the dreaming argument and the evil demon argument. The dreaming arguments calls into question my current beliefs about the world by drawing attention to the possibility that I might be dreaming now. Can I know right now that I'm not dreaming? If not, doesn't it seem that I don't know much of anything? The evil demon argument is even more radical in that it focuses my attention on the possibility that almost my entire conception of reality is based on a very general delusion. What if my every experience and all my reasoning results from constant deception by some being with God-like powers? What, if anything, would I know if this were the case? These worries, Descartes thinks, allow him to doubt nearly all his beliefs, and it indeed they may preclude his having any certain knowledge at all.The rest of the Meditations is Descartes's attempt to find something he can know for certain. Famously, he begins by claiming that he can be certain of his own existence. Even if he's dreaming or being deceived by an all-powerful evil demon, he can be sure that he exists. For he couldn't dream or be deceived unless he existed.But even if he can be certain of his own existence, how can Descartes move beyond this to knowledge of a world outside his own mind? By appealing to the existence of God. He provides two distinct proofs for the existence of God: one a variant of the ontological argument, which attempts to prove God's existence from an appeal to the very concept of God, and one a type of cosmological argument, which attempts to prove God's existence by appealing to something whose only possible cause is God. Both these arguments, Descartes claims, prove that the world includes an absolutely perfect God. And it is the perfection of God that Descartes to be confident that he can know things beyond his own mind. For God, as a wholly perfect being, wouldn't provide Descartes with intellectual faculties that allow him to go wrong. Consequently, Descartes can be sure that his beliefs are generally correct, provided that he has used his intellectual faculties in the way God intended.This work also includes a statement of the sort of mind-body dualism with which Descartes is widely associated. Although his arguments for dualism are obscure here, it is fairly easy to explain the central idea. According to Descartes, mind and body are wholly distinct kinds of substance that interact with one another. Mental states aren't a part of the natural world revealed by the sciences, and so, for instance, they are not reducible to certain things going on in a brain. Instead, they're a wholly different type of thing--though a type of thing that is somehow causally connected to a brain.All of this is material, and a lot more, is covered in roughly sixty pages of text, and it is presented in some of the clearest, most straightforward philosophical prose ever written. Plus, the reader needn't have mastered any arcane jargon or previous work in philosophy to understand Descartes's views. And because it is written as a series of meditations in which Descartes leads us through something like his own process of through about these issues, it makes for relatively easy reading.This edition also includes Descartes's Discourse on Method, which, though it isn't as important or philosophically sophisticated as the Meditations, is an essential text for understanding Descartes's conception of his own project. The book begins with interesting intellectual biography involving an account of his disillusionment with the intellectual culture of his time and of how this disillusionment led him to the project of finding a philosophical basis for a systematic scientific conception of the world. This is followed by a short presentation of an early version of the main lines of Descartes's philosophical argument that he would go on to develop in the Meditations. Then Descartes shows how he applied his method to discover a priori &quot;solutions&quot; to certain scientific problems. The Discourse, then, provides one with a better sense of Descartes's self-conception as a philosopher and the role he thought his philosophical system should play in the thinking of his timesThis is a serviceable edition of the Meditations and the Discourse for students, and I'm sure it's perfect for the average reader. The translation is readable, and it doesn't seem significantly different from other translations of Descartes that I've read. While there aren't a lot of frills here, there's a very brief account of Descartes's life and a short bibliography."},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","review":"Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy of 1641 is one of the four or five most important and most influential works in the history of philosophy. It expresses an understanding of the independent power of the human mind that was pivotal to the scientific revolution, and that continues to shape our everyday perception of our own human reality. The subsequent history of philosophy is largely classified according to how it responds to this work. This is an excellent translation, and it is helpfully bound with Descartes' Discourse on Method. It is cheap, and well-manufactured, and is the textbook I normally use when teaching this material."},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","review":"This is a review of the Donald A. Cress translation of Discouse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy by Rene Descartes.Philosophers disagree about everything: except about the fact that modern philosophy begins with Descartes. No contemporary philosophers agree with Descartes' positive views. However, Descartes left Western philosophy with a series of puzzles that it continues to wrestle with: how is it possible to know anything? (Descartes' \\"dream argument\\" and \\"evil genius\\" argument are powerful sources of philosophical skepticism.) What is the relationship between mind and body? (Descartes argues that there is a fundamental metaphysical difference between the two, so they cannot be identical.) Is there some certain, indubitable foundation for knowledge? (Descartes thought that we need one to escape doubt, and that he could provide it.)Some historical context helps to explain certain features of his writing. In 1521, Martin Luther was excommunicated, beginning the Protestant Reformation and dividing Christianity. Luther encouraged Christians to read the Bible translated into their own languages (e.g., the King James Bible) and use their own individual judgment to interpret it. In 1543, on his deathbed, Copernicus published his book arguing that the sun was the center of the solar system, not the earth (as had been taught by Aristotle). In 1633, Galileo was forced by the Inquisition to renounce his defense of the Copernican hypothesis.Given the sharp intellectual controversies of his era, it is not surprising that Descartes says he has \\"realized how numerous were the false opinions that in my youth I had taken to be true, and thus how doubtful were all those that I had subsequently built upon them\\" (59). Descartes concludes that the only way to escape his doubts is to reconstruct his beliefs using his own reason, rather than relying on traditional views. In this respect, he is somewhat like Luther. However, mindful of what happened to Galileo, Descartes begins the Meditations with a letter to the Faculty of Sacred Theology in Paris, defending the orthodoxy of his views and pleading for their support. In addition, Descartes wrote the Discourse in French (his own vernacular), but wrote the Meditations in Latin (the language of the Church), \\"lest weaker minds be in a position to think that they too ought to set out on this path\\" that he has followed (51).If you are going to read only one work by Descartes, I recommend the Meditations. (However, you might want to quickly read Part 4 of the Discourse first, since it gives an overview of the whole Meditations.) In the Meditations, Descartes decides that, paradoxically, the only way to overcome his doubts is to doubt everything that can be doubted, until he finds something absolutely certain, upon which he can build up knowledge. (Descartes is therefore an epistemological foundationalist.) Descartes notes that his senses sometimes deceive him. Furthermore, for all he knows, he is merely dreaming right now that he has a body and is sitting in a room writing. It is hard to maintain such doubts, so Descartes resolves to pretend that an \\"evil genius, supremely powerful and clever,\\" is attempting to deceive him at every step of the way. Descartes ends his First Meditation in this pit of uncertainty.In the Second Meditation, Descartes realizes that, even if he is mistaken about everything, he still has to think to be deceived, and if he thinks, then he exists. (In Part Four of the Discourse, he phrases this concisely as \\"I think, therefore I am.\\") Descartes then realizes that, while he can conceive of himself as a thinking thing without a body, he cannot conceive of himself as a body that never thinks. So while he may, in fact, have a body, his body and his mind are metaphysically distinct. (Basically, since he can conceive of body and mind as separate, therefore they are, in principle, separate.) Thus, Descartes is a metaphysical dualist.In the Third Meditation, Descartes argues that God exists. He gives a version of the ontological argument for the existence of God (defended before Descartes by St. Anselm, criticized after Descartes by Kant, and still later resurrected by Alvin Plantinga). Contemporary readers, even ones who believe in God, are unlikely to find Descartes' argument here compelling, but it is an important part of his philosophy. Descartes argues that, since we know that God exists, and since we know that God is all good, we can be sure that our senses and our reason are not fundamentally deceptive. (Why would an all-good God make us prone to systematic mistakes?)But the Third Meditation suggests a puzzle: since God created us, and God is all-good, why do we humans EVER make mistakes? Descartes' answer in the Fourth Meditation is that belief requires both the intellect, which simply perceives ideas, and the will, which chooses whether to believe those ideas. So long as we only choose to believe ideas that we \\"clearly and distinctly\\" (87) perceive, we will only believe what is true. Error occurs when we precipitately choose to believe unclear or confused ideas. (Part Two of the Discourse describes the methodology Descartes recommends in a bit more detail.) This may seem like a trivial claim, but Descartes is actually arguing for something controversial (and probably false): we can and should withhold belief from anything of which we are not absolutely certain, and so long as we use our minds correctly, we can be guaranteed to never believe anything false.The Fifth Meditation gives an alternative formulation of the ontological argument for the existence of God, and suggests that some ideas (such as those of mathematical objects) are innate, so that, \\"when I first discover them, it seems I am not so much learning something new as recalling something I knew beforehand\\" (88).Finally, in the Sixth Meditation, Descartes turns to material objects and sensory knowledge. His general conclusion is that \\"I must not rashly admit everything that I seem to derive from the senses; but neither, for that matter, should I call everything into doubt\\" (97). In general, Descartes is concerned in this meditation with how we can have a God-given faculty for discovering the truth, yet so often be in error over sensory matters (e.g., the Sun appearing to be the size of a fist).I do not read French or Latin myself, so I cannot comment on the accuracy of the translation. However, I will say that it is very readable. Furthermore, the selected bibliography is helpful. I do miss three things that were left out of this translation, though. First, Descartes meant for the Meditations to be read along with a series of \\"Objections\\" written by his correspondents and \\"Replies\\" he wrote in response. Second, perhaps the most insightful critic of Descartes was Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, who raised in correspondence what is still generally considered one of the strongest objections to Descartes' dualism: how can soul and body interact if they are as radically distinct as Descartes suggests? Finally, Descartes' Fourth Meditation emphasizes the distinction between having a property \\"formally\\" and \\"eminently.\\" In Cress's original translation of the Meditations, he has a footnote explaining this distinction. That footnote was left out of this enlarged edition. If these three things were included in this translation, I think I would give it five stars instead of four."},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","review":"Reading Descartes is like a breath of fresh air. Frankly I'm surprised no one has reviewed this before now. Reading Descartes is kind of like being informed you were going to die today, but were miraculously saved at the last moment, all without your knowledge. It changes your version of the world in the way only really good poetry can. He is so logical it makes his writings and thought process really clear and concise and this translation seems really user friendly to a layman like myself. I can't be positive, but I think he blew my mind."},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","review":"Rene Descartes is often considered the founding father of modern philosophy. A true Renaissance man, he studied Scholastic philosophy and physics as a student, spent time as a volunteer soldier and traveler throughout Europe, studied mathematics, appreciated the arts, and became a noted correspondent with royals and intellectual figures throughout the continent. He died in Sweden while on assignment as tutor to the Queen, Christiana.Descartes 'Discourse on Method' is a fascinating text, combining the newly-invented form of essay (Descartes was familiar with the Essays of Montaigne) with the same kind of autobiographical impulse that underpins Augustine's Confessions. Descartes writes about his own form of mystical experience, seeing this as almost a kind of revelation that all past knowledge would be superseded, and all problems would eventually be solved by human intellect.In the Discourse, Descartes formulates logical principles based on reason (which makes it somewhat ironic that this came to him almost as a revelation). Descartes had some appreciation for thinkers such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, but he thought that Bacon depended too much upon empirical data, and with Hobbes he disagreed on what would be the criteria for ascertaining certainty.Descartes was a mathematician at heart, and perhaps had a carry-over of Pythagorean mystical attachment to mathematics, for his sense of reason led him to impute an absolute quality to mathematics; this has major implications for metaphysics and epistemology. Descartes method was a continuation in many ways of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle and the medieval thinkers, for they all tended toward thinking in absolute, universal terms in some degree.Descartes in his first section discounts much of Scholasticism, stating that the only real absolutes are theology and mathematics; because theology is based upon revelation, it is therefore beyond reason, and thus, mathematics becomes the only rational truth. Descartes develops this idea further with rules of method, which include ideas of intuition, analysis and deduction. He uses some of his method to come up with his greatest proposition:Cogito ergo sum - - I think, therefore I am'The Cogito is a first principle from which Descartes will now deduce all that follows.' This permits Descartes to deal both with rational elements and empirical data.The other major piece in this collection, 'The Meditations', includes several different mediations, including that on the existence of the soul, the existence of God, the material world, things we may doubt, and other philosophical problems of the time. These meditations do incorporate Descartes attempt to employ his method to some degree, but at the same time divert into other means. For example, Descartes' meditation on the existence of God is in many ways the Anselm ontological proof revisited, and has a certain circular reasoning to it.This is an important text, one that I read the summer before I went to college, and makes a good study for those who wish to see the personal element in the development of philosophy."},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","review":"One is supposed to advance one step or two already in the search after wisdom reading Descartes' work for once, but I am definitely willing to read all three of \\"Discourse on Method\\", \\"Meditations on the First Philosophy\\", and \\"The Principles of Philosophy\\" a second time at some point in the future to better understand more of his reasonings. If reading is really a species of conversation we hold with the authors, here I claim Descartes is someone nice to chat with. Still, I agree with Tom Griffith on that the foundations of modern science and technology are well laid, and we don't need to read Descartes to reassure ourselves of this - the reason for reading him today is that we miss one of life's great pleasures if we don't."},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","review":"This little book changed my world view when I read it almost three decades ago.

The DOM serves as a programmatic summary of what Descartes considered a revolutionary new method of knowledge; it is a kind of philosophical confession of faith which serves as an apology.It is important to remember that DOM was the preface to three works of science--the Geometry, the Dioptrics, and the Meteorics--which followed it in the original text published in 1637. These served as proof of the success of the method.Descartes presents himself as an earnest and humble seeker of truth. He delights in all manner of learning, but is unsatisfied with its uncertain status. Though well-schooled and well-traveled as a young man, his heart finds no rest in authority and tradition. He finds clarity and certainty in mathematics but sees little of philosophical value built upon its foundations. So he is discontent.It is important for Descartes to convince the reader that he failed to find certainty in the conventional places. This helps to convince the reader that a new and revolution method is needed. Descartes now resolves to make himself alone the object of study.In Germany, Descartes repairs to a secluded room heated by a stove to occupy his attention with his own thoughts. Here he begins to discover his method.When Descartes begins to philosophize he discovers four \\"precepts of logic\\" which he resolves never to violate: (1) to believe nothing except what is clear and distinct, (2) to divide up problems into appropriate parts, (3) to proceed from the simple to the complex, and (4) to make sure nothing is left out. This method can, Descartes thinks, deliver a kind of mathematical certitude. Yet he deems himself too young and inexperienced to commence the project. He waits until he is more mature.Descartes then sets out to doubt all that can be doubted (while keeping religion provisionally intact), not in order to be a skeptic but to find indubitable certainty. He then gives a brief treatment of issues more thoroughly addressed in (also autobiographical) The Meditations (published later). Everything can be doubted except himself as a doubter: \\"I think, therefore I am\\" becomes the indubitable and foundational principle of certitude upon which the structure of knowledge and science can be safely built.He goes on to report his conclusions concerning the existence of God, the distinction of mind and body and the immortality of the soul. These conclusions are reached by rebuilding philosophy from himself as an autonomous knower. Thus, according to Hirom Caton, is \\"the origin of [modern] subjectivity\\" and the animus of his autobiographical stance. (I owe several of the following observations to Caton's book, The Origins of Subjectivity.)To this point, Descartes uses philosophical autobiography quite skillfully. The telling of a story draws in readers who might not be normally attracted to philosophy. He conveys a sense of intellectual adventure and he personalizes the positions as his positions, grounded on his perspective, not merely as abstract speculations of no one in particular.The autobiographical form is not incidental to the philosophy proposed. Descartes' autobiographical form is intrinsically connected to his philosophical program. Because of his distrust of tradition, he must, as it were, begin philosophy all over again from himself as an autonomous being. The starting point for Descartes' positive philosophy is not an abstract proposition but an existential statement, \\"I think, therefore, I am.\\" By making himself the central object of study, he demonstrates that philosophy and autobiography are intimately and necessarily related. A statement of his philosophy requires a history of the study of himself.Descartes used autobiography to avoid an overtly didactic or dogmatic manner by saying that the book is merely a record of how he himself conducts his reason. Using the autobiographic form, Descartes can avoid the authoritarianism of the schools while still making broad sweeping claims as to the veracity and utility of his method. He believes his method is sound, but he asks his readers to test what he says against their own reason. He thus decided to write the work in the \\"vulgar\\" French instead of the traditional--and scholastic--Latin.The rest of DOM consists of portions of an unpublished work on physical science and Descartes' comments on why he has not published it. In these later sections Descartes launches into a kind of campaign speech for his own greatness and the indispensability of his scientific method.He laments that he could not publish his work--The World--because of the prevailing authority's disagreements with his conclusions. Descartes fears that publication would threaten the equanimity he needs to be a successful seeker of truth; but his dedication to human betterment demands that he arrange for its posthumous publication.Descartes is particularly shrewd at this point. He seems to be enlisting public support for the publication of a work he is afraid to publish. He tantalizes the reader by saying that his findings have tremendous practical value for the alleviation of human suffering and betterment of human health. Descartes ends the DOM with a restatement of his mission as a seeker of truth and benefactor of humanity.All in all, Descartes uses philosophical autobiography quite successfully. The form fits the philosophy throughout most of the DOM in that Descartes is challenging the inherited wisdom of the schools by urging a personal discovery of truth through a radical method of rethinking philosophy with self-awareness at the center. His self-awareness is the foundation of his method.Descartes presents himself as a kind of philosophical hero of almost mythical dimensions who is on a quest for the holy Grail of certainty. He claims to have captured the Grail which blesses him with the ability to envision an entirely new philosophy and science of nature. He gives the Geometry, the Dioptrics, and the Meteorics (which follow the DOM) as positive evidence of the fruitfulness of his method. They are, he claims, harbingers of even greater discoveries.Nevertheless, Descartes sustained self-promotion at the end of the work seems intrusive at times and does little actual philosophical work. He is fighting for the chance to be heard by showing us his good intentions and intellectual genius. But the philosophical hero succumbs to hubris and the semblance of humility is betrayed by a kind of egotism which spills over the bounds of propriety and actually gets in the way of concrete philosophizing."},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","review":"Book was in excellent condition.

No strange text clipping or anything like that."},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","review":"This is the second time I've read these works. The first time I read Discourse on Method was a public domain edition and this, the Cress version, is far more readable and superior. On the other hand, the first time I read Meditations on First Philosophy was with the Cambridge Cottingham edition which had a far superior introduction, notes and perhaps translation (since I can't read Latin, I can't confirm the accuracy of this).Discourse is pretty interesting, Descartes decides to throw way everything he's learned and approach everything as geometric proofs where he builds on top of what he can completely infer. At first he rejects all senses and perceptions because they could be an illusion, the only thing he knows is, \\"I think therefore I am\\" (or if you read the Cottingham version, 'I am thinking therefore I exist'). From this he bases everything. He later goes to present his own modified version of the ontological argument, basically he thinks of something more perfect than himself, since he knows there is something more perfect then this, then eventually the most perfect thing is God. I'm sure many theists will agree with him that perhaps God is the only other thing they know is true, but I'm not sure how the thought of a most perfect being is more apparent than everything he experiences around him. I realize that his could be in illusion, but the thought of a most perfect being is more concrete? If someone doesn't perceive of this most perfect being instead assumes that everything is partially flawed does god cease to exist?Meditations further explains his ideas. He rejects everything he was taught and arrives at the fact that he exists, god exists, finally that other things exist and that the body is separate from the soul. It seems his god argument in this one slightly expands to a slightly different argument, namely that something can not come out of nothing and since imperfect things can only come from something more perfect than themselves, if you go up the line of perfection the most perfect thing or God. I guess to me all of these years later, I don't see how this proves god. Secondly I'm curious if the idea of god is natural, meaning if someone was born and never hear the idea of god mentioned would he arrive at the same conclusions of a perfect being or was Descartes influenced by his opinions found from a lifetime of learning from \\"the great book of the world\\". For the material things he realizes that for god to be perfect he wouldn't deceive him by making everything around him an illusion, therefore since God is not a deceiver, matter is real. My initial thought is that if an insane person perceives things as existing which do not, then they're not real and therefore would god then become a deceiver using this reasoning? Anyways regardless of one agrees with Descartes, these works are pretty interesting and for their importance to philosophy alone they are essential reads."},{"Title":"Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy, 4th Ed.","review":"The bare translation...with little to no commentary.

All the MBA's, CPA's and LLB's have brought boardroom boredom to the small screen by confusing reporting with entertainment and bottom line statistics and you get criticized for being critical of the blunder bosses, with the publication of Bad News. They were born too late.They will never understand the intellectual and social advantage of entering this world during the Great Depression when heroic men and women inspired great hope in what should have been the worst of times; and then, moving into the adolescent years, a part of the total commitment of the Greatest Generation of World War II. Meatless meals and ration coupons were no sacrifice while GI's we knew were dying for a proud country and twenty-one dollars a month. We had stable, supportive neighborhoods; extended families, and dependable, imaginative, friends. Additional encouragement was surely provided by the poorly paid nobility of superbly dedicated teachers. All of it grew us. There was no bottom line, no money issue beyond survival. The issue was posterity.Tom, do you know of a front office exec that has used - or even understood - that word? It was the selfless platform that our founding fathers built a nation on. Too, the early newsmen at CBS knew they were builders for the future, not grasping bottom-liners. What a world of giants you followed, Tom, with those paragons of intellect and elocution, Edward R. Murrow's \\"boys\\" at CBS News: Eric Severeid, Charles Collingwood, William L. Shirer, Robert Trout, Ed Bliss, Bill Downs, Richard C. Hottelet, Howard K. Smith, Larry LeSueur, Winston Burdett, and Murrow's producer, Fred W. Friendly? All of patrician mien if not patrician birth, they were mesmerizers and rarely, if ever, spoke a word in error.That you aspired to follow them does you credit, Tom, a courageous recognition of personal worth....and you certainly fit that CBS mold, now discarded in some musty attic of fading memory, an artifact that wouldn't find a buyer on eBay or a price on the Antiques Road Show.The inspirations are long gone now, Tom, remembered and commemorated only in the minds of the elderly among us mourning the lost legacy of the great issues your words speak of in Bad News.

No such luck. Too many of them are paid to be personable gigglers and chatter-boxers, too good looking and too sexy (in somebody's opinion) to be given the boot. They blend perfectly with the made over, tucked and enhanced generation. Alas, these jolly anchor people are now used as occasional correspondents in more distant venues. They are save-a-buck assignees, doing in-shallow reporting in fractured English. What ever happened to incisive follow-up questions? Soft ball players!Dare we expect something better from our news centers while the United States is listed near or at the bottom of the world's industrial nations in educational quality, in knowledge of our native language, in math skills, and even in our pitifully low contribution of foreign aid as a percentage of GNP?

Ordinary Americans need real News about important issues that truly effect their lives. However, most of these real issues are not sensational and sexy. Therefore, they can not sell enough product for advertisers. Advertisers almost always reach for the most sensational of issues to bring to the public. The bottom line is that there is a dumbing down of information that is provided to most TV viewers. What is called \\"News\\" is usually not News at all, but really some type of exploitive reporting designed to \\"capture\\" the viewer at an emotional & visceral level and \\"glue\\" that viewer to the TV for tens and hundreds of hours so that the TV source can pour out commercials that are in themselves often exploitive.Media (351/1)"},{"Title":"Bad News : The Decline of Reporting, the Business of News, and the Danger to Us All","review":"... to Tom Fenton on his comprehensive book as well as to the guts to finally say what needed to be said.Mr. Fenton points at \\"wasted air time\\", \\"lost trust\\", and a \\"disillusioned audience\\".

Networks can now target viewing trends by the second and avoid stories that are shown to have a ratings dip.Tom Fenton has the connections to investigate the problem from within and the honesty to unleash heavy punches. \`Bad News' is extremely dense with information and the writing style is at the same time hard hitting and engaging. It's certainly not a feel good book, after all Mr. Fenton draws a parallel between the various filters on American media reports and Soviet totalitarianism where citizens were fed a steady diet of government propaganda. The United States government is known for using \`soft power' in order to gain influence and this extends to control on media content. There seems to be a quid pro quo relationship with the large media conglomerates and the government who owns the licenses. The White House in particular has become quite adept at freezing out unfavorable reporters. Ironically much of the problem is brought on by reporters themselves who are either too lazy, too worried about losing interviews or too budget constrained to actually do their own investigative journalism. It's much easier to recite White House talking points than investigate their validity or larger impact.It may be small consolation but the United States media is still doing better than most overseas. Sure, Al Jazeera may be showing U.S. inflicted carnage that doesn't reach our shores but that doesn't mean they don't have their own thick filters. Italy has practically a state run media monopoly and France media is owned almost exclusively by two conglomerates. In some ways the current U.S. media suffers from comparisons with what may have been the golden age of reporting during the Cold War. Unfortunately as bad as the news media has sunk since the end of the Cold War they seem to be continuing their race to the bottom with the modern day William Randolph Hearst, Rupert Murdoch leading the decent.Tom Fenton focuses almost exclusively on the decline of foreign reporting but he's missing the degradation in domestic reporting. The problem is that reporters have become little more than stenographers except in the case of partisan reporting like Fox News. Bush can travel the country giving clearly misleading information on the tax cut savings for the lower and middle class and the media says nothing. It's a delicate balancing act to offer context and informed judgment without biasing the report but stenographers can sometimes be worse than useless by giving legitimacy to lies. The lack foreign reporting and poor job in informing the public on important domestic issues leads to a vacuum that's being filled by agenda driven partisan reporting and ignorance has left the door wide open for political spin as was evident in the 2004 election."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],D={key:0},z={key:1};function C(n,e,s,u,r,o){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(t(!0),i(w,null,g(o.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(t(),p(m,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),i("span",z,"Loading...")):(t(),i("span",D,"See more"))],8,S)):b("",!0)])}const x=c(B,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-1d3838ed"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/35.md","filePath":"people/35.md"}'),J={name:"people/35.md"},L=Object.assign(J,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{H as __pageData,L as default};
