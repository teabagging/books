It doesn't just focus on the \\"Big Two\\", Marvel and DC, but also has plenty of information on some of the current so-called independents, various defunct companies from the Forties to the present day (many of which were absorbed by DC), and also a smattering of entries on non-American comics.However, a heck of a lot of the detail that is presented is in the way of simple timelines about when a given series was published or resurrected and who might have been writing or drawing it. So we learn a lot about the year in which a title first debuted, when it was canceled, when it was re-started, and what issue numbers were involved in each run. There's just a good amount of strangely mundane detail that would be of little interest to anyone but the specialist. This book is sort of the equivalent of one of those super-focused tomes on the military costumes of the Napoleonic Wars. Sure, somebody wants to know that stuff, but most people want to get to the good parts about battles and generals and kings and campaigns, and not dwell on what kinds of buttons and flashings your average Austrian grenadier had in 1805. So the relative lack of commentary on the actual characters themselves and the key plots is rather disappointing.The organization is also idiosyncratic and a bit off-putting (a simple A-Z listing would've sufficed), and there are a fair number of spelling and grammar errors. The entries themselves basically give equal weight to every selected character or group, so the Avengers get the same number of paragraphs as comparative unknowns such as the Challengers of the Unknown.Really, this book is best used as a resource to learn about some of the more obscure non-mainstream or now-unpublished characters or to find out see which artist or writer was working on which title. Definitely not for the casual fan."},{"Title":"500 Great Comicbook Action Heroes","review":"If I had to pick the most important feature of a reference book, it would probably be accuracy of information. Almost as important would be the comprehensiveness of information; a dictionary, for example, would be of little use if it only covered the letters A and Q. Finally, a reference book should have easily accessible information; that same dictionary would be hard to work with if the words weren't in order. Mike Conroy's 500 Great Comic Book Action Heroes scores well enough on the first point and decently on the second point. On the last item, however, it is not very good.In terms of accuracy, the book does a good job. While I am a comic book fan, I am not nearly enough of one to truly say if every detail is accurate; for all I know, the fact that the first Blue Beetle appeared in 1939 may be right and may be wrong. On the other hand, the information I do know fits with what is presented in the book, so I'll take the other stuff as true until told otherwise.Comprehensiveness is harder to judge. Certainly, most major superheroes (and other action heroes) are here, but anyone familiar with the genre can probably name a few that are not mentioned. For example, such \\"classic\\" heroes from the 1980s as Rom, the Micronauts and Ka-Zar (all of whom had decent runs) are basically omitted, as well as other folks like the Moon Knight and Luke Cage (Power Man) and the Question. On the other hand, we do get to read about some interesting but obscure heroes such as the Badger and Congorilla. It's a mixed bag. Are there even truly 500? I never bothered to count.The big problem is with organization. While the heroes are basically listed in alphabetical order by category (such as Male, Female, Teams and War Heroes), each section is interrupted by special items on specific items and trends. There's a lot of fun information here, but it's often hard to find. The Table of Contents does provide some help, but the lack of an index is a major problem.Overall, the book looks nice, with plenty of art and nice paper, but I am hard-pressed to give it more than a high three stars. On a fundamental level - organization - this book is sub-par, so as a reference book, it doesn't do the trick as well as it should."},{"Title":"500 Great Comicbook Action Heroes","review":"This book covers a lot (and I mean a lot) of material. As a nice, quick overview of Comic Book heroes and their history, as told from a loving and friendly point of view, this is fairly good. There were characters in here I did not know about, or had forgotten about (and I'm a lifelong comic fan).However, Mike Conroy could have used some fact checking. With the sheer amount of detail, I suppose we can forgive a few small errors, but here are a couple of details I found to be more than incidental:On page 149, he refers to the character Starseed as \\"malevolent.\\" In fact, the opposite was true. Starseed did drop a mountain in the middle of Sunset Blvd. - but he was merely returning it from when he took it ages ago. He was actually benevolent, and offered to cure Morbius, Man-Thing, Ghost Rider and Werewolf by Night of their afflictions. Unable to control their monstrous selves, the monsters killed Starseed rather than accept his gift. The tale was a tragedy, with Starseed as the hero that dies in the end. Next time, read more closely, Mr. Conroy.On page 141 he refers to the character of Blade, the Vampire Slayer as \\"African-American.\\" I find it hard for a man who was born and raised in England to be an American, but maybe his citizenship changed later in life (although all Blade's early adventures take place in or near London, where he was living with his girlfriend Safron).If these two small errors don't bother you (they actually don't bother me all that much), then the other errors likely won't bug you either.A good, solid book of capsule histories and an accessible, quick reference work."},{"Title":"500 Great Comicbook Action Heroes","review":"This little reference book has a quality of fandom and charm about it.

I found the narration charming. I don't think that Chef Roux used an interpreter, so the text has a few idiosyncracies (e.g., &quot;pet hates&quot;).The chef really has a thing against frozen entrees and other processed foods, but I think they make life easier. Ease of preparation and taste are important, especially when you're trying to fit in school, work, and running and I think The Marathon Chef is lacking a bit in those very important areas.As for the recipes themselves... they are a little too sophisticated for my tastes. The flavor combinations are unusual, like basil and fruit. Also, the ingredients are measured in grams and milliliters so you'd need to get a kitchen scale to make them.On the plus side, the bread section is good and so are the fish recipes.

The irony that Osenton points out is that we are victims of our own success - pushing for more and more consumption - and getting it! - only to begin to approach levels of saturation. He points out that there are currently more than 32 million more registered vehicles in the United States than there are licensed drivers! Talk about surplus. For the first time ever, someone has explained WHY - beyond the simple explanation of greed - that corporations are cooking their books in order to make the numbers. It's because their respective top lines are lifeless, and they have squeezed every penny, every productivity gain they could out of the corporation.

It describes the struggles, defeats, and victories of those brave souls that have sought to maintain order and stabilizing constancy in a world seduced by innovation and progress. It also gives one increased confidence in knowing that Conservatism has and does provide the insightfulness and practicality for governing since it appreciates and accepts human nature as it is (as opposed to governing using fashionable theories of how humans can or ought to be).The book can be difficult to read at points due to the detachment from events described. But even those points are not without insights and inspiration for the modern Conservative reader. In my opinion, the last 150 pages or so were the best as they dealt with 20th century Conservatism in America.This book is an absolute must read for anyone wishing to understand and appreciate the Conservative Heritage."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"~The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot~ by the late Russell Kirk is arguably one of the greatest contributions to twentieth-century American conservatism. This is real conservatism, not the typical neocon tripe by David Frum or Sean Hannity that masquerades behind the appellation of 'conservative.' Kirk presents a rock-solid historical journey through the conservative mind. Conservatives are of course more sober-minded than the assorted radicals and progressives of the Left. Conservatives have a sound doctrine of anthropology, because they grasp man's nature, and are realistic about the implications of it. Whereas, the political Left has a positive view of man, and from that emanates romantic quixotic fixations that manifest themselves in repugnant ideology that seldom meshes with reality.The vignette sketches of Edmund Burke, John Adams, John Randolph, John Calhoun, Thomas Macauley, James Fennimore Cooper, Alexis de Tocqueville, John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Disreali, Irving Babbitt, George Santayana, and other luminaries represent insightful overview of the conservative movement in all its stripes. The essence of conservatism always lingered in the American mind, but when Russell Kirk distilled its core principles in his erudite works, he reinvigorated the intellectual groundwork for its defense and continuance. \\"People will not look forward to posterity\\", Burke wrote, \\"who never look backward to their ancestors.\\"\\"As the prophet of American conservatism, Russell Kirk has taught, nurtured, and inspired a generation. From... Piety Hill, he reached deep into the roots of American values, writing and editing central works of political philosophy. His intellectual contribution has been a profound act of patriotism. I look forward to the future with anticipation that his work will continue to exert a profound influence in the defense of our values and our cherished civilization.\\"--Ronald Reagan"},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"This book has been a major inspiration to me and my way of thinking. It is not very difficult to go online and read any number of Conservatives talking about all of the issues of the day. But, this book stands alone in following and celebrating the history of Conservative intellectuals. Often times it is portrayed (not without some merit) that Conservatives are anti-intellectual. I have frequently heard that Liberals are just naturally smarter or more inclined to be an intellectual. But, The Conservative Mind blows a hole through all of that. Kirk examines major Conservative thinkers like: Edmund Burke, John Adams, George Canning, Benjamin Disraeli, John Randolph of Roanoke, Orestes Brownson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John C. Calhoun, and T. S Eliot (amung many many others).The most difficult aspect of this book is to accept John Randolph and John Calhoun as figures to be celebrated. They both were men who used their talents to protect an evil system of slavery. Although, as another reviewer elquently noted, Kirk was not endnorsing slavery or racism or anything like that. Just the fact that Conservatism is a The \\"negation of ideology,\\" and that change will happen, in Kirk's prospective Calhoun was only following that line of thinking. I personally don't agree with it that far. As obviously slavery was antithesis of what the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution stand for. But, again stating, Kirk is not writing to argue that slavery should not have been eliminated- only that change has to follow the methods of that society.I would recommend this to anyone- Conservative or Liberal. It is a magifnicent study of Conservativism. It can be a little dense at times, but that is to be expected and it shouldn't detour anyone from reading it."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"It is truly astounding how little Kirk's vision of conservatism resembles the versions heard most often in contemporary politics.One repeated note throughout this book is that markets and economic forces are disruptive and need to be tamed. Alternative sources of human values, other than what they command in a wide-open economy, must be preserved. The market, left unchecked, has the potential to overrun settled ways of life, to undermine religious faith, and to coarsen standards of behaviour. While this is not Kirk's only point, it is the one that seems most conspicuous today.This is a remarkable insight, especially coming from someone who obviously rejoices in the name of Conservative. We are used to seeing &quot;conservatves&quot; as the money party, a body of apologists for entrenched financial interests, interested chiefly in free markets and free trade, and somewhat heedless of the human costs. Upward mobility is more important than social stability. Indeed, this viewpoint is so deeply engrained in the United States that it is hard to imagine what form a political challenge to it could take at this stage.The chief difficulty is that conservatism of this sort becomes largely a matter of -taste-. Human relations take precedence over economies or formal hierarchy. Understatement, mercy, and discretion are as important as any programme of laws. How to translate this question of taste into something that can play in a democracy, especially a democracy whose electoral processes are so in thrall to financial powers already, is something I cannot begin to answer."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"With all the other superb reviews posted I'll get straight to the point. This volume, by BN Publishing, even though printed in 2008, is not the most current edition of Kirk's work. TCM was first published in 1953 and the 7th revised edition (still in print) was published by Regnery in 1985. BN should make plain that their text is a reprint of an older edition."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Although I have only finished the first three chapters of this book, I still want to give it a rave review, at the same time as I wonder why I was never exposed to it, at any time during my American education. I read plenty of books by liberals, but somehow this brilliant work by Russell Kirk was regarded as something like the deadly nightshade.Not so! And I will repeat the same complaint again: after reading the chapter on Edmund Burke, I wonder again why no teacher, and no course, ever even *mentioned* Edmund Burke, certainly one of the most profound thinkers of the last five centuries.And this book acquires even more importance when put with Melanie Phillip'sThe World Turned Upside Down: The Global Battle over God, Truth, and Power, because I suspect that she has not read it. She should read it, because some solutions to her problems appear in these profound pages.As Kirk summarizes Burke: the moral order among men is only a reflection of the moral order of God. Governments are instituted among men primarily to provide for safety --- safety from the marauding Saracen without our borders, and safety from the mob within our own borders. From this, Burke deduces his own, extremely interesting list of the rights of man, which to my mind rivals the list of natural rights listed in the Founding Documents of America. \\"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\\" -- yes! But Burke adds: freedom to participate in an ordered, organized and intelligent society [not his words, I paraphrase].After trying to summarize Burke, Kirk turns to the equally difficult task of trying to summarize John Adams, until recently our most-overlooked Founding Father. This \\"dour Federalist\\" is most likely the man responsible for our Federalist system of government, with its three branches (legislative, executive, and judicial). He accomplished this by \\"simply\\" writing an immense three-volume lawyer's brief, which surveyed and examined an immense range of successful governments:A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America Against Attack of M. Turgot in His Letter to Dr. Price, Dated the Twenty-Second Day of March, 1778. Fortunately, David McCullough has been resurrecting the life and career of this brilliant man, John Adams --- and the life of John Adams is now available on DVD:John Adams (HBO Miniseries).There are lots of books on the market \\"explaining\\" liberalism, which usually teach such dubious doctrines as the Perfectibility of Man (Condorcet) and the Natural Equality of All Men. For the Conservative side, Russell Kirk's book is the heavyweight champion.On the negative side, Kirk strikes me as much too fond of religion and much too critical of economic progress. If we were to take him at his word, we would wind up with a much poorer America absolutely devoted to the Virgin Mary. If Kirk understands that a strong economy can pay for a strong military, he doesn't say so. Myself, I'm pretty comfortable with a strong and free America, with enough money to go around for everyone.If you want to have a balanced and informed view of the 21st-century political debate, this is a book which you must take into account."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"This is a very readable book of political theory, as Russell Kirk, the Scholar of Mecosta, Michigan, presents us with the great conservative thinkers since Edmund Burke and their ideas. Don't call Kirk an intellectual, which is a Marxist word; call him a cleric or a scholar.What defines the historical conservative? I must say this conservative is different from a reactionary such Julius Evola who advocated an absolute monarchy who would be a representative of god on earth and closely connected to God to preserve the union of the state. From what I gather from this book, the conservative is for a democracy, but in a limited way, and is for change, as long as it does rock the foundations of tradition. Change is thought to be providential, although I have my doubts. The struggle for conservatives since Burke's time, around 1789, the year of the French Revolution, is to slow down change so that it reforms institutions, but does not destroy them by radical revolution. The main trouble has been that the conservatives were unable to control democracy, this bucking bronco, so that it would be limited within the boundaries of wisdom of tradition and custom, which Burke called \\"prejudice and prescription\\".To get down to the details, arguments about who should be voting are covered. The ever expanding franchise of voting has dismayed conservatives who would rather have men of wealth, ability, and qualification voting in elections for various interests in society. These representatives are not delegates, so once they are voted in to office, do not call them with your opinion, they know better than you how to govern and you should show deference to their authority. The one man-one vote system today does not distinguish between an informed vote and an uninformed one. By limiting democracy to its best representatives, society will not be leveled down to grey uniformity of the envious proletariat who wish that no man be better than another and vote to have income stolen from the rich to give to the poor. It would be better for society not to tax the creative class, the natural aristocracy, who produce the enterprises which give the proletariat their jobs. This creative class is largely responsible for robustness of the economy, not labor. However, those who become rich should make their money in an honorable way.Conservatives were against such intellectuals as Jefferson, Rousseau, Bentham, J.S. Mill, and Marx. One fault they found with Bentham and Mill were their tendencies to treat society like a machine; by calculating the greatest good for the greatest number, they would atomize society into making everyone just cogs in a machine. But a man is actually supposed to be more than just an unconnected individual; he must have ties to a certain class, guild, church, place, and community to be happy. The philosophies of the radicals have a dehumanizing effect on society. The argument against Rousseau and Marx is that they dream of unworkable utopias and deny the doctrine of original sin which makes it impossible and inhumane to perfect forever fallible human beings. Without taking sin and limitation into account, social policies will not work. These secular philosophers do not realize that morality is severely weakened when it has no transcendent reference to religion.Such idealists like to talk about giving power to the people. But referring to the people as homogeneous whole is absurd. Which people are you talking about? Government can only serve people as they are grouped in different categories with differing interests. And idealists should not refer to people's rights when they are actually just aspirations or desires. The conservative wants God to save the King, the aristocracy, the country gentlemen, the middle and working classes. Each level should be granted their appropriate rights and privileges. But if we keep following the footsteps of radical democracy, we will find ourselves less free, more equal, and more miserable because we have denied the differences between men.Another complaint from conservatives is that democratic societies have a lust for innovation by passing an overabundance of laws when it would be better not to pass any at all. In this democratic age, people suffer from impatience and will not wait for prudent reforms. Some radicals throughout history have reduced their arguments down to \\"Pass this law or I will slit your throat!\\" But this foot dragging of the conservative amuses me sometimes: As for slavery reform, a conservative before 1860 could have said \\"Give us more time!\\" Kirk mentions the joke from Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary about how the conservative is comfortable with existing evils and the liberal wants to replace existing evils with new ones. And I think sometimes a conservative may place too much faith is the wisdom of tradition, as if the tradition had some pure, infallible beginning."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"&quot;The Conservative Mind&quot; is the book that created the modern conservative movement and is a book that every conservative should read. It isn't an easy read, it does deal intimately with the nuances of conservative thought all the way back to the 18th Century Whig politician Edmund Burke, but at the same time it explains in depth why conservatism developed the way it did and what the philosophical roots of conservatism are.Even those who aren't conservative but have an interest in truly understanding conservative political philosophy would do very well to read this book.In order to be an effective advocate for or against any position, it is critical to first understand what the position is. &quot;The Conservative Mind&quot; is a seminal look into conservatism as an ideology and as a political movement, and is critical to an understanding of what conservatism really is."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"This text is the definitive work on Anglo-American conservatism as an intellectual philosophy. Starting - as all true conservatives must - with Edmund Burke and working his way forward to the mid-twentieth century, Kirk traces the variants and evolution of conservative thinking over nearly two hundred years. It is an immensely valuable work for the mastery and beauty of the language Kirk uses and for the breadth and depth of his knowledge. What makes it priceless, however, is the virtuosity with which he collects the scattered threads of conservative thinking - some from places one might not expect - and reassembles them into a tightly-woven tapestry which rises to the level of ordered and intellectually consistent philosophy.The only thing that could be said negatively about this book is this: Kirk writes at a high level and expects his reader to know something about the world and its ways before approaching the text; for this reason, Kirk has been utilized far too rarely as a pedagogical text.Everyone - liberal, conservative, libertarian, or otherwise - who wants to understand modern conservatism and to know who really is conservative in public life today needs to make time for this book.

By pulling together the thought of great conservative thinkers from across the ages, Kirk conclusively proved that a philosophy of conservativism did exist and that it was a worthy alternative to the once-dominant liberal line of mid-twentieth century America. That may not sound like a spectacular feat, but at the time many wondered whether there was any such thing as a conservative mind, much as many now wonder whether an evangelical mind exists. Because Kirk mines centuries rather than decades, this is a book that doesn't go out of style."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"This extended essay explains with a wide breadth of historical knowledge what it truly means to be conservative. Its not just voting for republicans or Tories or even cuttings taxes. What Kirk reveals is that conservatism isn't rooted in politics and economics but in culture and ethics. Conservatism is a way of life, based on respect for time tested truth and a belief in the preservation of a natural all encompassing law outside of petty human politics which is the basis for society.A must read for anyone who thinks conservatives are just greedy corporate minions. Quite the contrary, a conservative believes the free market to be a means to a free and moral society not an end in itself, and that it should have reasonable regulations based on actual need and precedent (and in the constitution). Government cannot create morality because its unrestrained growth requires force which prevents voluntary moral decisions (read frank meyers defense of liberty) and corrupts natural voluntary societal institutions like the family or the culture which grow spontaneously without any coercion or central planning(read hayeks constitution of liberty)Conservatives especially in America must too realize what they are conserving isn't just economics, but a moral system which cares for the dignity of human beings in pursuit of a sense of community and belonging. The rising Ron Paul Libertarians must also take heed of kirk as the left wing promotes itself by claiming moral righteousness over \\"robinson Crusoe economics\\". Moral arguments are necessary for libertarians must have a basis in tradition in the founding principle's of western civilization from which our liberties have developed to argue against reckless social innovation and utopianism by the state. That doesn't mean being archie bunker but just believing in what kirk called the permanent things.An excellent continuation of this history of ideas is George Nash's the conservative intellectual movement since 1945 which discusses contemporary conservatism including Russell and the growth of the alliance with libertarianism which kirk discusses in the chapter about Tocqueville and Macaulays \\"liberal conservatism\\".Disclaimer: this is a philosophical book using a history of ideas and therefore is not light reading (at over 500 pages.)"},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Russell Kirk has done a masterful job of presenting an in depth historical look at the foundations of \\"The Conservative Mind.\\" I read the hardback version which was a gift from a friend.Of coarse as with so many other books of this length and intensity, one must take care not to nod-off, as they become engrossed in the rich philosophical treasures inculcated in it. Not because it is boring to be sure, but more so because of its' shear length and the mental necessity to take in and absorb each important word, phrase and paragraph. There is simply so much essential knowledge and awe inspiring wisdom and information presented here that one can easily overload themselves, if they try to take in too much at once. So my advice would be take your time and make this one of the long running adventures in your life, with a few smaller less intense books in between, like \\"Bias\\" or \\"The Final Days\\" for mental relaxation and vacation.If the reader is like myself, they will spend a great deal of time highlighting, circling, underlining and writing comments in the margins of each and every page, making critical notes in the front and back of the book on the blank pages. This also extends the amount of time necessary to complete this magnificent book. A book that I place on par with Barbara Tuchman's, \\"The March to Folly\\" and William J. Federer's, \\"America's God and Country\\" among others.One could spend many paragraphs trying to relay to others the vast amount of fascinating scholarly material within Mr. Kirk's book. But it is sufficient to say that for any student of history, the conservative movement and even one of a liberal persuasion this book is informative, enlightening and helpful in formulating philosophies, rebuttals and basic political ideals.It seems terribly interesting to me, that in so many of these great philosophical works. The vast majority of societal problems we continue to encounter have been foretold and predicted by the great thinkers of the ages for centuries and even millennium, but we never seem to heed their warnings or avoid them. We just, strike out and step right onto the most negative paths possible with our eyes wide open. In short radical liberalism is incompatible with real civilization, yet we continue down the path anyway to corruption, deviance and self-induced social disintegration.It is almost as if the radical or fanatic left leaning politicians and social elitist pick up these books of warning, which are so full of a prophetic wisdom. Then creep off into a cave somewhere and huddle like a bunch of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trolls, deciding to make every error and mistake within them. In fact the platform for the lefts political parities and special interest group supporters seem to be a conscience determination not to follow the sage advise within the covers, but to take the well warn path of error and depravity.An important read for one interesting in the foundations of social, political, economic and spiritual philosophy. Mr. Kirk is to be commended."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"My favorite aspects of \\"The Conservative Mind\\" were the author's summaries of the beliefs of Burke and Macaulay. Indeed it is far easier to understand Burke and Macaulay by reading \\"The Conservative Mind\\" than it is to read the works of those authors directly.I also like when Kirk points out repeatedly a fact that most people seem to hide themselves from today: that most people don't know or understand anything about government and therefore universal suffrage democracy backfires.Kirk loses me with his insistence that protection of property rights cannot come about from people following the path of enlightened self-interest. Instead, Kirk insists that religious morality is the only way to convince people to protect property rights.But, besides that one issue, the book is excellent and well worth reading.John Christmas, author of \\"Democracy Society\\""},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Whether he is liked or disliked, Russell Kirk's intellectual influence in the twentieth century cannot be disputed. Many have credited him, along with William Buckley, as a founder of the contemporary American conservative movement. Whereas Buckley has traditionally been considered the movement's organizer and engineer, Russell Kirk, with his classics The Conservative Mind (1953) and The Roots of American Order, has been seen as the mind behind the movement.In The Conservative Mind, Kirk makes the case for the six canons of conservative thought: (1) \\"Belief in a transcendent order, or body of natural law, which rules society as well as conscience\\"; (2) \\"Affection for the proliferating variety and mystery of human existence, as opposed to the narrow uniformity, egalitarianism, and utilitarian aims of most radical systems\\"; (3) \\"Conviction that civilized society requires orders and classes, as against the notion of a \`classless society'\\"; (4) Persuasion that freedom and property are closely linked\\"; (5) \\"Faith in prescription and distrust of \`sophisters, calculators, and economists' who would reconstruct society upon abstract designs\\"; and (6) \\"Recognition that change may not be salutary reform: hasty innovation may be a devouring conflagration, rather than a torch of progress\\" (pp. 8-9). Having defined the conservative movement with these canons, Kirk proceeds to critique those notions that oppose them, such as economic egalitarianism, and presents the thoughts of writers such as Edmund Burke and T. S. Eliot in their favor.It is interesting to note that both of the writers mentioned in the title of the original 1953 publication, Edmund Burke and George Santayana, as well as T. S. Eliot, who is mentioned in title of later editions (The Conservative Mind: from Burke to Eliot), were European citizens (Eliot became a British subject later in his life). Many of the thinkers discussed in the work, such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and John Henry Newman, were similarly European. Is the conservative mind American or European?"},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"This book gave greater breadth and depth to my knowledge of conservative history and philosophy than any other book.What I found to be most enjoyable about this book is its examination of the nature of many conservative thinkers, showing similarities and differences in the thinking of those who made the greatest impact on conservative philosophy.

I loved every page. Kirk recounts the modern conservative movement from Edmund Burke to nearly the present. He explores, in depth, the pedigree of the modern conservative mind. IMO, there is no finer introduction to conservative thought than this particular book and in general ANY book by Russell Kirk.In addition to being a compendium of conservative thinking this book is an articulation of the author's own take on the conservative mind.

It is almost a perfect teaching tool.I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Over 60 years ago, The Conservative Mind, a 450-page articulation and distillation of the Anglo-American conservative intellectual tradition conservative ideas was published. Its young author, Russell Kirk (1918-1994), then an obscure professor of history at Michigan State University, would become widely acknowledged as one of the founders of the American post-World War II conservative intellectual movement and as a leading spokesman.During his long and varied career, he would wear many hats. He was a political observer and advisor, a scholar, an educational reformer, founder and editor of two journals, newspaper columnist, lecturer, author of horror fiction and, lastly and most proudly for him, a \\"man of letters.\\" His life work spanned a broad range of topics and interests, embracing political theory, intellectual history, and social, cultural and literary criticism.His second and mostly likely most enduring of his over thirty books would have a dramatic three-fold impact on the tenor and direction of a conservative movement struggling to be born in the 1950s.First, when the dominant ideological currents of the time had nearly extinguished the responsible voices of intellectual conservatism, Kirk's articulation of the tradition of conservative principles originating with Edmund Burke, the founder of modern conservatism, reinvigorated a dispirited conservatism adrift and barely conscious of its philosophical traditions. The ideas fashionable then in intellectual circles were of a decidedly liberal or socialist orientation. As the historian George Nash notes, its publication \\"dramatically catalyzed the emergence of the conservative intellectual movement\\" which at that time amounted to \\"at most, scattered voices of protest, profoundly pessimistic about the future of their country.\\" In Kirk's \\"prolonged essay in definition\\" he discovered a tradition, battered and often routed by its adversaries, but still vibrant, stemming from Burke and extending down through the generations, linking writers, poets, and statesman. Among those belonging to this tradition in Britain were Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Benjamin Disraeli, Cardinal John Henry Newman, James Fitzjames Stephen, W.E.H. Lecky, and T.S. Eliot, and in America, John Adams, John Randolph, John Calhoun, Orestes Brownson, Henry and Brooks Adams, Irving Babbitt, and Paul Elmer More. From a body of intimately related and mutually supportive ideas common to these men of conservative instincts, Kirk was able to distill the essence of the conservative position. Its impact, Henry Regnery, Kirk's publisher, recalled 26 years later, \\"is hard to imagine now. After the long domination of liberalism, with its adulation of the 'common man,' its faith in mechanistic political solutions to all human problems, and its rejection of the tragic and heroic aspects of life, such phrases as 'the unbought grace of life' and the 'eternal chain of right and duty which links great and obscure, living and dead,' and a view of politics as 'the art of apprehending and applying the Justice which is above nature' came like rain after a long drought.\\"Second, when the majority of establishment intellectuals were prepared to dismiss conservatism as a permanently discredited ideology, Kirk's rediscovery and articulation of a viable intellectual conservative tradition in the English-speaking world restored credibility to a body of ideas that had once dismissed as the bleatings of bourgeois Babbitts. By defining and applying its principles to modern challenges, he fortified and strengthened the conservative position. He demonstrated in a compelling fashion that conservatism is an integral part of the Western political tradition and that the American political tradition is Burkean.Lastly, although he was writing a history of conservative ideas, the first historian to attempt such a task, his intent was more than historical; it was didactic and polemical. The rationalism of the philosophes, the romantic idealism of the Rousseauists, Benthamism, positivism, Marxism, Social Darwinism, pragmatism, and socialism were among the ideologies he condemned as inimical to the social order of the post 1789 world. From them sprang the belief in the perfectibility of man, the enthusiasm for social and economic leveling, the impulse for innovation coinciding with a concomitant contempt of tradition, the denial of the power of Providence in history, and the rejection of what T.S. Eliot called \\"the permanent things,\\" those enduring moral norms which make civilized social existence possible. Against the proponents of radical innovation, Kirk enthusiastically defended tradition, old values, and prescriptive establishments.In an age of liberal complacency, Kirk issued a challenge that could not be easily ignored. Others, closely associated with the resurgence of conservative ideas in America, quickly grasped the significance of this assault on liberal dogmas. His work renewed scholarly interest in many heretofore-neglected thinkers. It further provided conservatives with a coherent set of principles with which they could identify.Some conservatives today distort, however, the depth of hostility that greeted the publication of Kirk's book during the 1950s. Given the general atmosphere of hostility toward conservatives, they imagine that conservatives such as Kirk had to struggle to have their ideas heard. Kirk biographer James E. Person, Jr. points out (National Review June 16, 2003), for example, describing this grim period, \\"liberal statism bestrode the nation like a colossus triumphant and in command of the foreseeable future, and conservatism was struggling into existence.\\" The works of conservatives then \\"were widely mocked as wellsprings of bigotry and antiquarian fanaticism.\\" While such allegations are still made, he assures us, \\"they sound increasingly shrill, hollow, and silly.\\" If Person's description of the intellectual climate of the 1950s is accurate than the expectation would be that The Conservative Mind and Kirk's other books should have immediately descended into oblivion and only after the conservative movement gained in political visibility and clout after the Reagan victory in 1980 would his books be generally read and critically well received. In fact, the reverse was true. The first edition of The Conservative Mind was warmly praised in the pages of publications considered today to be bastions of left-wing bigotry, including The New York Times. Newsweek and Time magazines hailed the young Kirk as \\"one of the foremost intellectual spokesmen for the conservative position\\" and a \\"gifted\\" writer. His work was widely discussed and critically evaluated in scholarly books and prominent journals and newspapers. Even the harshest assailants of the \\"New Conservatism\\" grudgingly acknowledged him as an intellectual figure worthy of serious attention. Kirk was well on this way in the 1950s to becoming one of America's leading literary figures.Yet, just a decade later, it would have been unusual to find him mentioned in these same publications. His books and articles received scant attention outside conservative circles. Moreover, and even more startling, within the conservative movement, he was often a \\"neglected mind.\\" His ideas puzzled and troubled conservative activists who do not know exactly what to make of him. Kirk could be often as harsh in his criticism of business as he was of government or labor. He deplored American military adventures and the prospect of environmental destruction as any liberal activist. Although he relentlessly attacked liberal shibboleths, he exhibited no interest in developing alternative conservative policies. Instead, his writings were mostly about long-dead and frequently forgotten political thinkers and literary figures who seemed irrelevant to contemporary concerns. Kirk's anti-modernist traditionalism seemed as out of place among the sleek Reagan Republicans during the 1980s as his characteristically unfashionable dark three-piece suits. These were the years of Neoconservative ascendancy during which the fame and influence of not only Kirk but many of the leading founders of the postwar American conservative intellectual revival markedly declined. Much more interesting than celebrating Kirk's supposed defining influence on American conservatism as we know it today is to ask why has it been that one of the most important political minds of the twentieth century was not only scandalously neglected by the intellectual and literary establishment but also by the very movement he helped found.One reason that Kirk was ignored by many of his conservative brethren was because of the difficulty they had grasping the decisive importance he assigned to culture. Because he never offered specific programs on health care, tax-cuts, foreign policy, market deregulation, crime reduction, Kirk's work appeared irrelevant to those who focused on the attainment and use of political power. They dismiss his work as little more than a literary diversion, or even more disparagingly, call him a \\"beautiful loser.\\" For Kirk, culture precedes politics, and unless a healthy, vibrant civilized culture exists, no amount of \\"conservative\\" political victories will have an enduring impact. The breakup of the conservative movement in the wake of the Reagan Administration and the short-lived \\"Republican Revolution\\" following the 1994 Congressional elections, Kirk would have agreed, can be explained by the failure of conservatives to pay sufficient attention to the moral ills afflicting contemporary culture.Another characteristic of Kirk's brand of conservative thought hence is its non-political inspiration. While Kirk often wrote about contemporary political events (particularly in his syndicated newspaper column) and kept abreast of daily national and international news events (even though he famously did not own a television set), he rarely became involved in political advocacy. Of primary concern for him was the discovery of and apprehension of the \\"permanent things,\\" those eternal moral norms that give meaning to and enrich the quality of life. A conservatism identified with a mere laundry list of public policy issues, he believed, would not long endure. The battle for the future direction of America cannot be won by \\"conservative\\" political victories either in Congress or at the ballot box when the things of the heart and mind are neglected. Kirk also had no faith in the capacity of politics to cure the moral and spiritual failings of a society.The moral imagination instead formed the core of Kirk's ethical teaching. This faculty of ethical perception makes use of such resources as historical studies, humane letters, fable, myth, and religion. The work of a gifted historian, for example, proves imaginatively stimulating and morally salutary because the historian has fashioned intuitive ethical universals out of the myriad, fragmentary historical facts he has examined. Ethical universals embody truths about human nature from which we derive self-knowledge about our potentialities and limitations. The imagination further enables us to escape from the confining limits of our personal experience to become conscious of what is beyond ourselves. By perceiving what we hold in common with others, or imaginatively seeing things from the perspective of others unlike ourselves, we becomes aware of ourselves as members of a community. \\"Through the moral imagination, one may escape from the pit of solipsism,\\" he wrote. The \\"moral order is perceived to be something larger than the circumstances of one's time or one's private experience; one becomes aware of membership in a community of souls; one learns that consciousness and rationality did not commence with one's self or with one's contemporaries.\\" The imaginative faculty, further, enables us to regain order in our souls as we become aware of our personal failings of \\"concupiscence, error, and ennui\\"...\\"including the sins of omissions,\\" an awareness of which \\"the average sensual man is spared.\\"Conservatism is not an ideology then as Kirk strongly and repeatedly stressed. In fact, conservatism, by its very nature, constitutes an anti ideology. In support of this argument, he frequently cited H. Stuart Hughes's famous description of conservatism as \\"the negation of ideology.\\" To Kirk, this issue was of no small importance given his conviction that ideology threatens the civilized order. Ideology means, he observed, political fanaticism or, more precisely, a Christian heresy that asserts \\"that this world of ours may be converted into the Terrestrial Paradise through the operation of positive law and positive planning. The ideologue -Communist or Nazi or of whatever affiliation--maintains that human nature and society may be perfected by mundane, secular means, though these means ordinarily involve a violent social revolution. The ideologue immanentizes religious symbols and inverts religious doctrines.\\" \\"As a fanatical political religion, it can brook no challenge. What religion promises to the believer in a realm beyond time and space, ideology promises to everyone except those who have been 'liquidated' in the process in society.\\" Ideology is, hence, inherently inimical to the civilized social order because it amounts to \\"a passionate endeavor to overthrow\\" that order. The ideologue rebels against God and his order. In an ideologue's system, \\"there is no room left for Providence, or chance, or free will, or prudence. He is the devotee, often, of what Burke called 'an armed doctrine.' His ancestor was Procrustes, and he is resolved to stretch or hack all the world until it fits his bed.\\"Abstract ideas, whether a priori or a posteriori, which fail to give prudent consideration to fact and circumstance, according to Kirk, stand in opposition to conservative principles. The conservative, by contrast, \\"looks with deep suspicion on the cult of Reason the worship of an abstract rationality\\" which would force \\"men and societies into a preconceived pattern divorced from the special circumstances of different times and countries.\\" Burke had condemned the ideology of his day, that of the Jacobins, as advancing a \\"barbarous philosophy, the offspring of cold hearts and muddy understandings...\\" which by its defective reasoning dissolved all \\"the pleasing illusions, which made power gentle and obedience liberal, which harmonized the different shades of life.\\" The art of politics, then, can never be, the conservative would argue, an exact science of inflexible and unchanging principles. An exact science of politics would be an impossibility, and baneful in its implications, given the passionate and fluctuating nature of man which defies all efforts to create a perfectly organized society.As an alternative to ideology, Kirk implored conservatives to \\"aspire to what P.E. More calls the aim of Burke: \`to use the imagination as a force for order and self-restraint and political health.'\\" If conservatism \\"quickens the imagination\\" of this age, he predicted, we \\"may succeed in conserving far more than our goods and chattels.\\"America has been much altered since the publication of Kirk's 450-page examination of the history of conservative ideas from Edmund Burke to George Santayana, but little of this change would have given Kirk much comfort that the country was moving toward the realization of the principles embodied in his classic work. The America I knew during the 1950s, as child, was a place of prescriptive communities, intact families, and traditional gender roles. The tentacles of government did not penetrate so aggressively into the everyday mundane affairs of business, communities, families and our personal lives. Despite a conservative movement steadily growing in electoral clout in the last half-century, the march toward what its founders saw as leveling social policies and intrusive managerial politics has not been significantly abated. Conservatism has not moved America to the Right, but rather the Right allowed itself to be pushed leftward. The traditional commitments to an isolationist foreign policy, minimal government, rooted communities and social hierarchies, the pillars of Kirk's thought, have now fallen into disrepute. Instead, conservative activists now stress material opportunity and social improvement, and, in the name of global democracy, an interventionist foreign policy.The industrial working class and union membership during the past thirty years has shrunk considerably. Although working conditions and wages have vastly improved in recent decades, the issues of deracination and social boredom persist. In fact, the old working class neighborhoods of the past came closer to being true communities, as Kirk defined them, where neighbors knew and interacted with each other than do today's middle-class suburbs of long distant commuters. Civic and church participation has declined in modern suburbia while the rates of social pathologies such as divorce, drug addiction, and abortion have climbed. The loss of community, it may be argued, is felt more keenly today than when Kirk began discussing this topic fifty years ago.The central concepts of his social and political thought--\\"the permanent things,\\" the moral imagination, the contract of eternal society, and man's flawed nature---tied these apparently disparate enterprises into a coherent intellectualAmong the most strident critics of the historical past that Kirk invoked to vindicate his socio-political principles are the Neoconservatives, e.g. Irving Kristol, Michael Novak, Norman Podhoretz, and the disciples of Leo Strauss. Together, they have helped reshape political conservatism in a way that treats most of the Western past as a prelude to the present generation of democratic values and human rights.Kirk only aroused himself to respond to the Neoconservatives in 1988, long after they had become a dominant force within the conservative movement. His prolonged silence on the Neoconservative challenge was curious. Other than sharing the label \\"conservative,\\" he and they had nothing in common. Further, the Neoconservatives constituted a more formidable adversary than any he had faced within the conservative movement. Unlike the libertarians, who Kirk attacked as \\"chirping sectaries,\\" they would energetically and ruthlessly redefine conservatism, leaving no place for Kirk. They did not share Kirk's appreciation of literature and art--save as something that might be instrumentalized for political value. Their primary interests were policy studies and social statistics, and their admiration for democratic capitalism can be traced to a quasi-Marxist appreciation of its transformative power. Rooted communities, traditions and prescriptive rights did not appeal to Kirk's new opponents because they are viewed as barriers to personal power and political change. In their new democratic order, Neoconservatives were striving become an integral part of the managerial elite.Although he never regained during his lifetime the recognition he enjoyed in the 1950s, Kirk's reputation was sustained by the scores of disciples who trekked to the rural solitude of his central Michigan home in the village of Mecosta to learn and study. Many of these minds, first cultivated by Kirk would become the bearers and purveyors of \\"the permanent things.\\" \\"By the Nineties, there were dispersed throughout the United States a great many people in their middle years or their careers who had read\\" his works \\"and had been moved thereby,\\" he wrote \\"Of the disciples who at one time or another had beaten a pathway to Piety Hill, some had become lawyers, and some teachers, some journalists, some professors; some were in the book trade, others had been ordained, yet others obtained posts in government. They might leaven the lump of American society.\\"Since his death, interest in his work has grown. Dozens of articles and several major book length studies of his thought and legacy have been published. The Russell Kirk Center for Cultural Renewal, a research center for the scholarly study of his work, which attracts scholars from around the world, was established at his former library in Mecosta, Michigan and a branch office was opened in Grand Rapids. Many of his works are still in print and several have recently been translated and republished. C-Span-TV included him as part of their 2002 \\"American Writers\\" series. Even Neoconservatives such as Jonah Goldberg and David Frum, with whom he would have had little philosophically in common, quote him approvingly and praise his achievements.Conservatives should take note of the sixtieth year anniversary of the publication of The Conservative Mind to reflect upon what has been achieved and has been lost since a nascent. self-conscious conservative movement burst upon on the American political scene. What is popularly called \\"conservatism,\\" many believe, led to the political victories of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. It also made possible the historic Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, and appeared to be temporarily victorious in American political, cultural and moral life. But was this \\"resurgence of conservatism\\" what Kirk propounded, or was its central inspiration more closely attuned to the views of the libertarians or of the welfare-state oriented Neoconservatives?Whereas Kirk was vilified or neglected in the past, his reputation faces a different problem now. His reputation has too often been distorted since his death by certain hagiographers who either venerate him uncritically at the expense of understanding him comprehensively or use him further their own ends. Too often, I have noticed \\"conservatives,\\" who have not read him deeply, quote Kirk selectively to promote agendas that would have been foreign to his thinking and nature. On the basis of my personal knowledge him as his former assistant and later friend, I do not believe that he would have wanted to become an empty icon to a political movement. Always suspicious of the ambitions of the proponents of expansive government and an ardent opponent of global military adventures, Kirk would have cast a skeptical eye on the ambitious schemes heard too frequently advanced by prominent conservatives to spread democracy throughout the world, to link government to private faith-based organizations under the rubric of \\"compassionate conservatism,\\" and to \\"reach out\\" to racial minorities by opening nation's borders to immigrants and purifying ourselves of time honored customs and symbols because they allegedly might offend some self-defined \\"victim\\" group.Did any or all of these positions define the orientation of what would become to be known as the conservative revival? To what extent did Kirk's ideas play a formative role in this process? Such forbiddingly complicated questions may not be answerable. The various strands of the social and cultural forces that came together in the postwar conservative revival may need more time to be fully untangled and understood. My own sights are aimed at a more modest goal the examination of that body of ideas that Kirk produced as a conservative thinker. If the resurgence of conservatism in politics and culture in recent decades has been in some sense inspired by Kirk's ideas, then we should know the tradition to which these ideas are related, and why they have lost appeal to a later generation of conservatives. All of this true, but then Person goes on to make the dubious claim that not only have Kirkean ideas triumphed in the intervening decades, conservatism has become part of the American political mainstream. Moreover, The Conservative Mind not only renewed interest in a nearly forgotten tradition of ideas and gave conservatives intellectual respectability, but it also gave definition to the essence of the conservative intellectual position. Former National Review publisher William Rusher, who Person quotes approvingly, asserts that the ideas articulated by Kirk in The Conservative Mind became \\"the warp and woof of conservatism as we know it today.\\"Despite these differences and criticisms from segments on the American Right, Kirk is assured a place of prominence as one of the foremost thinkers who anchored conservatism in moral norms and culture. Unlike the Neoconservatives and members of the New Right, Kirk recognized that the key to the recovery of order lies in the discovery or rediscovery of those permanent norms that give meaning to and enrich the quality of life and community. The central principles and insights of his work have a perennial significance because they address the eternal dilemmas of the human condition. Consequently, his essays and books will continue to be studied by generations of thinkers long after the works of some of his critics have been relegated to commentaries on late twentieth-century cultural history.Kirk's achievement cannot be measured by his influence on transient policy issues. Rather, he will--or should--be remembered because he championed those enduring norms of social interaction without which civilized existence is rendered impossible. Without the guidance of these \\"permanent things,\\" order in the soul and commonwealth quickly evaporates. He reminds us that if conservatism is to survive in the twenty-first century as more than just a label, then conservatives must clearly rethink what it is they are trying to conserve. They cannot forget, without losing their reason for being that sound political reform depends upon a healthy cultural environment.If Kirk were still alive, he would entertain no illusions about conservative prospects for the short term. \\"Yet cheerfulness will keep breaking through,\\" he always maintained. It was never his nature to succumb to despair, cynicism or bitterness. When things appear at their worst, there is always reason for hope. While the fabric of social order seems today irreparably frayed, there are those (the \\"Remnant,\\" as Kirk liked to call them) \\"doing their best to stitch together once more the fragments of that serviceable old suit we variously call \`Christian civilization' or \`Western civilization or \`the North Atlantic community' of \`the free world.' Not by force of arms are civilizations held together, but by the subtle threads of moral and intellectual principle.\\"Kirk, more than most, devoted his life to the long haul. As he frequently reminded his audiences, quoting his friend, T.S.

On the minus side, the source notes are not linked, and two or three of the substantive notes appear to be cut off in midstream (e.g., there's one in the discussion of Cardinal Newman that says, in effect, \\"here are some other relevant observations:\\" with nothing after the colon).Regarding the book itself: It's easy to see why \\"The Conservative Mind\\" caused a stir when it first came out and why it's become a classic. To borrow Kirk's own term, it's an \\"extended essay\\" in intellectual history, dealing with a particular thread of thought running through Anglo-American history from the late eighteenth century to the 1980s, when the last edition appeared. By examining the works of numerous English and American (and one French) thinkers, some well known and some forgotten, Kirk offers a worldview significantly different from modern liberal conventional wisdom. I really can't improve upon what some of the other reviewers have said, particular Bibliophile (Dec. 14, 2008).A great achievement. At a minimum, anyone with an interest in modern politics should read this book."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Kirk is a \\"good writer\\" but an appalling communicator. Instead of just saying what he has to say, clearly and simply, his passages read as if they were a puzzle to be solved. Fancy words, obscure references, half-made hints and suggestions - it quickly becomes irritating.I get the feeling that Kirk wants to impress us with his intellect. But any writer that leads with his ego is in trouble, and this is a fine example."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"The introduction with the six &quot;conservative principles&quot; is a brilliant definition of conservative political thought. Like some of Kirk's other books, this remains a bit unclear. Kirk doesn't seem to care about essential political issues and differences. For example, the differences between Burke and Disraeli. And disraeli's social policies - although an essential part of geniune conservatism - seems a bit embarrasing for parts of the American conservative opinion. (By some reason, I'd guess that many - at least in America - who would regard themselves as &quot;conservatives&quot; - would have much more in common with Liberal Gladstone than ever with Conservative Disraeli. Gladstone was a laissez-faire liberal, anti-imperialist, pro-democrat, and a Christian moralist...)"},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"I came to this book with very high hopes of hearing a well-presented literary history, and argument for, what Kirk calls the \\"conservative mind.\\" Unfortunately, the book proved to be neither a good argument (Kirk hardly argues for anything, rhetoricizing not being the same as argument). His historical recounting is appalingly bad. And, as others have noted, he is quite mistaken in the thought that his attempts at literary turn of phrase make for a tedioius read.As history, the chapters focusing on early American history are scorchingly bad. He suggests that the American revolution was a conservative revolution. To do this, of course, he ignores such facts as that, for the first time, a nation was premised on the absence of royalty, feudalism was quite abolished, and a written constitution that only slightly resembled the Magna Carta was produced. (For a great argument that the American revolution was radical rather than conservative, one can consult any number of books likeThe Radicalism of the American Revolution).Kirk calls Alexander Hamilton the \\"most vigorous organizer\\" for \\"a federal government.\\" The rest of us, of course, see this distinction as belonging to Madison, the primary author of the constitution and Federalist Papers, and president. Unfortunately, Kirk readily ignores this, which makes him quite the revisionist historian.Neither can I be sure that Kirk intends to argue for the consevative position becuase, if this was his intent, he does about as bad a job as anyone could possibly do. Most of his arguments consist of quoting a figure who said what he wants to argue, and recapitulating the position in his own words. If he ever does tackle objections, he does little more than dismiss them out of hand without argument. I dare anyone who doubts this to read his redundant chapters on Burke and find one ARGUMENT againt one of Burke's detractors. (So that everyone knows, I am not saying that there are not good arguments against Rousseau, Condorect and the like; just that Kirk provides none.)Anyway, rather than read this muddled piece in order to understand the conservative view, I would highly reccomend that one read Sowell'sA Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins of Political Struggles. It is better written and argued than Kirk. Sowell not only presents many of the same ideas as Kirk more clearly and convincingly, but his grasp of what is and is not a fact is much better than Kirk.If your goal is to learn about, or hear a defense of, the conservative viewpoint, don't spend money on this volume because it will be money lost."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, \\"[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man\\". But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, \\"What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well\\" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as \`magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a \`defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern \`anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a \`strong protest against domination by class or region'.Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, \\"state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law\\". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as \`puny' and \`impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. \`Prejudice', he writes, \`is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Every true conservative knows the Conservative mind. It had a enormous impact in 1953 and is still very respected. In my opinion it's overrated. The book is dull; Kirks style is uninviting. He keeps repeating the same slogans over and over again: religion is the basis of all society, there must be order and the left is demolishing the world. I advise you just to read the introduction with its famous canon of conservative tought. That will do. Kirk is only interested in explaining his own philosophy and that's why every conservative seems the same in this book. Take for example Edmund Burke. No word about the liberal part of his political philosophy or the inconsistency between his common sense epistemology and his christian metaphysics. If you want to read a good book on American conservatism, I would advise Conservatism revisited by Peter Viereck."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Kirk's book is supposedly the bible of Conservatives. Not neo-conservatives, but Conservatives. He sets up the long standing debate between the French, and Voltaie, and the English, using Burke as it's spokesman Supposedly Kirk would limit the vote, have a professional class of government officials, reduce if not eliminate most taxes, and let each individual strive for success. This is the basic mantra of classical conservatives, and is all well and good as far as it goes, but only a few of the many ever succeed this way. One of the surprises is how young Kirk was when this book was written; it's as if he had some inspiration for on high (probably not), or was cherry picking history (probably closer to the truth).After reading this book I had a better understanding of where the Conservatives are coming from, althohgh I still don't understand why an obscure Royalist politician from the 18th century should be their flag bearer. Royality as a form of government most likely will never occcur in the US, although we seem to flirt with it from time to time.Conservatives seem not admit of a meritotocracy, as we currently have in the US: they would rather rely on accidents of birth, cronyism and college organizations to select administrators, rather than people who have succeeded in other venues. A very informative, albeit frightening, book."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"You know how it is? You are looking forward to the release. Then you cannot wait to get home and start an all night reading session. After Chapter 1 I had lost that sparkle, lost the urge to pull an all-nighter to read the whole thing.It was just terrible, though. I am trying to think of one positive thing I took away from all the time I spent reading this. But my dog leaves better works of art in tightly coiled packages on the front lawn.It is a snooze fest from the time you open the book until you decide, unlike me, to just abandon it.

Let me save you the trouble. The gist of conservatism: oppression good, education bad, allahu akbar...that, too. also."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"You don't have to be a Conservative to like this book. I found it very useful in understanding the basic worldview from which a Conservative might operate; and from that, one can make good assumptions as to how Conservatives view Liberals. Kirk's thinking is profound, his reading extensive, and his arguments well-written. The major points I took away from this discussion are:1) The Conservative assumes that the design of the world is not by accident, but by transcendental purpose. Metaphysical, permanent standards of Right and Wrong exist: moral standards are not relative. Similarly, the structure of society is not arbitrary. We should not attempt to alter society using science or social engineering, because we are strictly human, and our understanding is limited. Change, when it happens, should be modulated in such a way as to limit its effects on society.2) A \\"natural aristocracy\\" exists in any society. It consists of the best and brightest individuals, and perhaps those born with reserves of wealth. No legislation or voter majority can eliminate it. John Adams defines a member of the natural aristocracy (in a Democracy) as anyone who has the power to influence at least one vote other than his own.3) Individuals are born with certain Natural Rights, consisting primarily of property rights. Government should always act to protect property rights, especially in a Democracy, where the poorest elements of society may employ their voting power to redistribute the possessions of the wealthy few. A Democracy that gives unmitigated power to the people quickly deteriorates into the worst kind of tyranny.4) Instincts and prejudices frequently have meaning: the individual may be foolsh, but the species is wise. The thinking of a few bright persons should not take precedence over tradition.Most of this comes out of Edmund Burke. The Natural Aristocracy theory is primarily from John Adams. The dozens of other conservative thinkers that Kirk discusses tend to modify or enhance the thinking of Burke and Adams. De Tocqueville, for example, sounds the alarm over the potential \\"Tyranny of Democracy\\", but that seems to follow from Burke's thinking on natural rights.I had a few exceptions with some minor points. Kirk argues, for one, that the American Revolution was somehow a \\"conservative revolution\\"; but I think you could make a more convincing case that it was in fact an Enlightenment-Liberal revolution. Also, he has a tendency to lump all of the different Liberals and Leftists together into a single agglomeration of \\"Benthamites\\" (after the British utilitarian/socialist philosopher Jeremy Bentham).On the whole, however, I can recommend this one to any reader interested in understanding how people think politically."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"The book is a sort of intellectual history, each chapter summarizing the thought of one to three conservative thinkers, more or less chronologically beginning with Edmund Burke and running through poets of the mid twentieth century (T.S. Eliot and Robert Frost, among others). The thinkers discussed include intellectuals, clergymen, politicians and poets, all thinking, working and writing in the Anglo-American sphere (most are in fact British or American, but the exceptions -- Tocqueville and Santayana -- wrote in America or for American audiences). A good working knowledge of British and American history from the French Revolution through World War II is therefore a helpful prerequisite to understanding many of these thinkers.The summaries are interesting and informative as description. Many of them (the chapters on Burke and John Adams, for instance, or the section on John Henry Newman) make great introductions to figures whose work can't be read in comprehensive political treatises and many provide intriguing introductions to writers you have probably never heard of (Sir James Fitzjames Stephen) or to the thought of people whom you don't know as political thinkers (say, John Randolph or Arthur Balfour).Among the wealth of description, a little prescription creeps in. Kirk's heroes don't &quot;argue&quot; -- they &quot;know,&quot; they &quot;perceive,&quot; they &quot;realize,&quot; they &quot;understand.&quot; Kirk is highly sympathetic with the ideas he summarizes, and it is no coincidence that his final chapter, on twentieth century poets, is called &quot;Conservatives' Promise&quot; and contains some of the most hopeful writing in the book. &quot;If men of affairs can rise to the summons of the poets,&quot; he writes, &quot;the norms of culture and politics may endure despite the follies of the time.&quot; He ends upbeat, with a call to action of sorts.Not to be missed is Kirk's first chapter, &quot;The Idea of Conservatism,&quot; in which he spells out the fundamental tenets which unite the belief of the writers whose work he describes, as well as their photographic negative, the tenets of radicalism.The book dovetails perfectly with George Nash's _The Conservative Intellectual Movement in American after 1945_, which, of course, begins with Kirk himself and which carries on a similar discussion (though Nash omits from his narrative the British half and focuses on intellectual figures, to the exclusion of practical politicians like, say, Goldwater)."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Russell Kirk's The Conservative Mind is a catalog of the thoughts of men, both British and American, whom Kirk regarded as eminent (albeit sometimes obscure) conservatives. They range in historical sequence from Edmund Burke (1729-1797) to contemporary scholars. Although this book is not an instruction manual for conservative politicians and activists, it will provide conservatives with both a clear understanding of conservatism's basic principles and a cogent defense of those principles. One of the major insights that this book offered was the central role of religion in society: Revealed religion is the source of Western morality; law was created to enforce that morality; the state enforces the law, so the state is an instrument of religion. Another insight was the hubris of nineteenth and twentieth century reformers, who thought that they could legislate happiness and freedom, but who instead created industrial slums and domineering central governments. The overall tone of the work is pessimistic, often despairing: the repeated theme is that from an idyllic, aristocratic, agricultural society united under Christianity the world has decayed to a lonely, atomized, atheistic, cold-blooded industrial society. In the face of such decline, the conservative can only try to salvage or resurrect bits of traditional society -- manners, customs, faith in Providence, etc. Again, the book is of limited practical value: The author's aim is merely to define conservatism, which he does explicitly only in chapter one. He offers neither explicit criteria for distinguishing desirable from undesirable change, nor strategies for forestalling the latter. The book is difficult both because Kirk provides no biographical information about his subjects and because he assumes a detailed knowledge of history. The author's style is literary rather than academic. When he outlines another author's work, it's not always clear where the summary ceases and Kirk's comments begin. Despite these shortcomings, no one should call himself a conservative until he has read this book and understands the principles that he's defending."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Russell Kirk burst onto the scene in 1953 with the publication of THE CONSERVATIVE MIND, which helped set the course of conservative thought for years. (Murray Rothbard wrote somewhere that prior to this work, conservatives were generally called \\"the right.\\") This work went through several editions, and the final (seventh) edition came out in 1986.The focus of this book is Anglo-American conservatism, however Tocqueville does get some attention. Kirk starts with his hero, Edmund Burke (widely seen as the father of modern conservatism) and develops the principle conservative themes down to roughly present times. I found Kirk's discussion of American history quite interesting. He sees Jefferson as a conservative thinker and views Hamilton as a liberal.Kirk introduces you to a number of important authors who aren't generally mentioned by conservatives today. One such writer is the W.H. Mallock who wrote a number of important works attacking socialism and liberalism. Kirk's discussion of Mallock is important in that Mallock emphasized the importance of inequality. As Mallock noted, society advances when those of superior ability are permitted to utilize their talents as much as possible. The less able are in fact the principle beneficiaries of such a system. (This is what Ayn Rand called the \\"pyramid of ability\\" principle years later. Hence George Reismann, in CAPITALISM, appears incorrect in claiming that it was Rand who first identified the principle.)Russell Kirk was a member of the Old Right (other leading representatives being Robert Nisbet, Richard Weaver, and Donald Davidson). It's not quite accurate to label him a \\"paleoconservative\\" because paleoconservatism has a populist bent not present in the Old Right."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"An associate once said of Russell Kirk that he had the heart of a liberal which he kept in a jar on his desk. Yet \\"The Conservative Mind\\" is not stodgy nor is Kirk's view of the human condition stagnant. It is surprisingly both \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" in the traditional sense of the words. Kirk seeks to reconcile the conservative values of respect for tradition, custom, order, hierarchy, as well as awe of the divine (though he includes the freethinker Santayana in his analysis) with the liberal values of innovation, growth, and reform.Slow change is a means of conservation, Kirk explains. A conservative is never so noble as when he acquiesces to unwanted change for the sake of general conciliation. The great 18th century philosopher and statesman, Edmund Burke, is the locus of conservative philosophy, with whom Kirk opens his study and he repeatedly compares Burke's successors with the original lodestar.And it is noteworthy that the hidebound Tory was a staunch supporter of self-determination for the peoples of India, Ireland, and North America. This was not a break with conservatism; Burke simply felt that the same respect for liberty, as well as local tradition and custom, due British aristocracy was also due these peoples. As Kirk says, \\"Burke was liberal because he was conservative\\".And while American liberals like to claim the American Revolution as their own, Kirk shows that it was actually a conservative rebellion against royal hegemony, in accordance with precedents set by British nobles of earlier generations.Burke and most of his successors largely distrust democracy. Government by aristocracy is preferred, though the definition of an aristocrat is startlingly broad: anyone who can command the vote of another besides his own. It's confusing that any conservative would dignify the demagogue and the political boss with such a phrase. Kirk's yearning for aristocratic government seems to anticipate the restoration of an Adams dynasty; what he would later receive would be the enthronement of the Kennedys. Clearly, aristocracy is not always synonymous with conservative caretaking.The post-Burke history of conservatism is largely a gloomy one. In England, industrialization, technology, massive population movements, and increased literacy shake traditional landed aristocracies and old loyalties. Popular attacks on property rights are fueled, as Marx attempts to incite radical discord.Into the fray steps Benjamin Disraeli, whose conservative reforms alleviate material shortages and enlarge the franchise sufficient to stem the revolutionary tide while preserving as much as possible of old ties. But time marches on, and the American Civil War, in particular, does irreparable damage to the state of the nation and to the Southern half that is its repository of tradition. Kirk denounces slavery in ringing tones, acknowledging it to be a monstrous cause for the Confederacy to have based its own declaration of independence.But Kirk is still at his clumsiest when discussing Southern conservatism. He attempts to memorialize the eloquence of antebellum conservative, John Randolph, and the ice-cold zeal of his successor, John C. Calhoun on behalf of Southern independence, while distancing himself from their viewpoints on race. In so doing, he fails to adequately address the hypocrisy inherent in Southern agitation for minority rights on a federalist scale, even as the agitators were engaged in denial of same on a local scale.Still the Union victory produces a smug and interfering Puritan leadership class, as well as the era of the robber baron. As conservatives, Kirk and his sources are vigilant in defense of property ; yet he finds the 19th century capitalists unwholesome. The landed aristocrats that he admires, taking their wealth for granted, exercise it in a way beneficial to their rural communities. The capitalists simply engage in unlimited acquisitiveness for its own sake without regard to consequences. One can imagine how Kirk would regard today's CEO's and dot.com millionaires.As the book draws to a close in 1953, Kirk perceives two dangers to conservatism in general and to society at large: the expansion of the managerial state (borrowing from James Burnham) and a post-war era in which gratification of the physical senses without regard to moral context becomes the predominant ethic. He sees bases for optimism that these trends will reverse, but unabashed pessimism would have proved more prophetic.And Kirk, who lived until 1994 and never allowed a television set into his home, presumably came to realize this. If in 1953, he regarded jazz on the radio and comic books in the drugstore as cheap demoralizing sensations, one can imagine how he would regard hip-hop and unexpurgated raunch displayed in TV and movies, and their attendant consequences on human conduct.Few conservative candidates would dare attempt today, Adams-like, to affirm the moral nature of society, as Kirk urges; for that matter, few clerics attempt to do so, their theology having been annexed by this newer creed. So much for Kirk's faith in American religious institutions. The last politician to attempt to seriously discuss values was laughed out of office. Today Republicans compete with Democrats for the MTV vote.And the managerial state achieved its conquest with the advent of the Great Society, effectively declawing the conservative administrations which followed. The last presidential election featured the nominally conservative and liberal candidates debating over just how much the social security Ponzi scheme should expand, whose national prescription drug plan was the most efficacious, and how much wealth the state should appropriate from its subjects.Kirk seems to be as distrustful of counterrevolution as of revolution, and as a result, he fails to leave conservatives today with a blueprint on how to respond when the hammer has fallen and Sansculotte has fully taken over. But he would regard today's world in much the same way he regards, in the first chapter, the living Irish orators in Burke's birthplace of Dublin proclaiming through amplifiers their success in increasing widows' pensions. He would sadly shake his head and deliver the epitaph of the West, proclaiming, as Burke once did, \\"What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue!\\""},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"This is the finest extant one volume introduction to the conservative thread in English language political thought. This tradition is unjustly ignored in North America. About the only references to it in mainstream journalism are an occasional mention of Burke by George Will. If you want to know why Edmund Burke is one of the greatest political thinkers of all time and do not have the patience to read Burke himself, read the first 80 odd pages of this book. If you want to know what British humanistic luminaries such as Samuel Johnson, Coleridge, Disraeli and Macauley thought about politics and society, there is no better place to start than here.Kirk also rescued a number of dead American writers from oblivion, for which we should be grateful: John Randolph, the political writings of James Fenimore Cooper and Nathaniel Hawthorn, Orestes Brownson, Paul Elmer More, Irving Babbitt, to name some. While Henry Adams and Santayana are not in danger of neglect, Kirk helps keep the flame of their reputations alive.If the book has a flaw, it is because Kirk goes for breadth and insight rather than for a deeper analysis of any given figure. I also disagree with Kirk's assertion that the modern British Conservative Party embodies Kirk's conservatism. That party has not been conservative since at least 1918. Under Margaret Thatcher, it frankly became a 19th century liberal party. Finally, this book is VERY beautifully written.

Yet."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Probably most people reading this already know of this book's reputation and influence, so I'll skip over both the chapter-by-chapter analysis and the praise (I'd end up in what Kirk would call \\"overweening\\" praise, anyway). But I do want to respond to a typical liberal caricature offered by a previous reviewer. The caricature to which I refer is the idea that a conservative is anyone opposed to change. In fact, the reviewer even argued that the Soviet Union could have been seen as a \\"conservative\\" system (an argument endlessly repeated in contemporary media).Perhaps the reviewer missed or didn't understand Kirk's repeated references to conservatism as the \\"negation of ideology.\\" An ideologist is anyone who tries to rubber-stamp a system of premade ideas onto a society or culture. Think of the \\"New Soviet Man\\" in the Soviet Union. Think of the \\"Cultural Revolution\\" in China. For that matter, although it wasn't imposed militarily, think of the \\"Great Society\\" in America (it worked out about as well as the first two).The \\"negation of ideology,\\" then, is the conservative idea that one takes societies as one finds them, and then tries to work out change organically from within those societies, rather than imposing it on them from the top. (Think of the current liberal infatuation with attempting to rule America through the Supreme Court for a good example of the \\"imposing from the top\\" model.) Sometimes this change can be quite radical, radical in the sense of \\"getting to the roots\\" of something, as in the American Revolution (which Kirk discusses extensively). The colonists believed that the liberty they already knew was being circumscribed, and fought to extend it.The reviewer also slanders Kirk in implying he would be in favor of accepting slavery. No, our own Constitution details life and liberty for all, and the organic application of it (as we see in our subsequent history) extends that life and liberty to all. Even the writers of the Constitution, some of whom owned slaves themselves, knew that the Constitution's principles would lead to freedom for all. Lincoln (a Republican, let's never forget) certainly knew it.If you really want to know about the intellectual history of conservatism, this book is where to start.

Unfortunately, the reading is monotonous at times, as Kirk's narrative is limited to discussing conservatism in different contexts. A touch of Boorstin's flair is needed.

It is a book that should not be taken lightly. The very history and future direction of conservatism lies within its covers. A must have in every library. It is in mine."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Russell Kirk, an American political theorist and social critic, published this book in 1953. The first chapter is a succinct and almost eloquent statement of his political philosophy, and the remainder of the book is his account of the life, times, and political philosophies of great Anglo-American conservatives in the tradition of Edmund Burke, including John Adams (who supplied conservatism its theory of the naturality of ruling elites), Walter Scott, George Canning, Samuel Coleridge, John C. Calhoun, Fenimore Cooper, de Tocqueville, Santayana, and several others.I am not a liberal or a conservative, and generally (but not invariably) I find individuals who take on such labels to be unimaginative and opinionated. Nevertheless, it should be possible to put together a political philosophy that generally gives acceptable answers to political and policy questions without the need of going into intricate and detailed particularities of the issues. We certainly cannot expect the average voter, who is interested in being a good citizen but is otherwise not overly devoted to the study of social issues, to spend more than a small portion of his time in evaluating the alternatives. A hearty political philosophy may require that citizens spend some time becoming political and socially aware, but like a good financial investment, the cost should be borne early and the payout, in the form of simplified decision-making, should be valuable and enduring.I picked up Russell Kirk's book because it is a classic written in an era before the influence of Milton Friedman on conservative thought would become pervasive. I think it is valuable to become acquainted with these writings, if only to discover how alien some of the ideas now appear, as well as to find that some ancient truths remain truths today. There are two major conditions today that are very different from the period in which these men wrote. The first is that there is no longer a pretense that there is a viable alternative to liberal democratic capitalism for countries that have evolved in the Anglo-American tradition. Therefore, the emphasis on the value of tradition in conservative thought, and the characterization of \\"the enemy\\" as radicals attempting Utopian transformation of society on the basis of Reason and Science, no longer rings true. \\"The essence of of social conservatism is preservation of the ancient moral traditions of humanity,\\" says Kirk (p. 7). This may have some reverberation in the modern conservative notion of strict construction in the Supreme Court, but not elsewhere in the modern American conservative agenda.The second major change is that the United States, Britain, and most other liberal democratic capitalist countries no longer consist of a hegemonic ethnic/national group with either no significant minority/immigrant presence, or a situation in which minorities and immigrants are effectively disenfranchised and rendered powerless. \\"Belief that a divine intent rules society,\\" asserts Kirk, as well as conscience, forging an eternal chain of right and duty which links great and obscure, living and dead.\\" (p. 7) Appeal to the weight of tradition and the obligation of the living to the dead, Kirk alludes approvingly to Burke's \\"description of the state as a divinely ordained moral essence, a spiritual union of the dead, the living and those yet unborn.\\" (p. 9) This depiction of our government simply pulls no weight with most voters, who lived in Europe, Africa, or Asia when the Founding Fathers did their work, and patriots galore sacrificed and died to secure our freedom. We have a duty to recognize their sacrifices and recognize their contributions, but contemporary politics is, and always will be, rooted in the here and now.Some of Kirk's cherished principles appear to be true, but they are no longer widely contested. Kirk celebrates conservatives' \\"affection for the proliferating variety and mystery of traditional life, as distinguished from the narrowing uniformity and equalitarianism and utilitarian aims of most radical systems.\\" (p.8) We all now appreciate diversity and abhor uniformity, but it is worth recalling that this is a central aspect of freedom that people have fought and died for (and continue to fight and die for in contemporary despotic societies).Perhaps the strongest of classical conservative principle is the notion that \\"property and freedom are inseparably connected.\\" (p. 8) This connection was stressed by Milton Friedman, and is probably the most cogent point in the critique of socialism. Some have objected that if property is unequally distributed, which it ineluctably will be in capitalist market societies, that freedom will also be unequally distributed, in which case it is not truly freedom at all. This is, however, a specious critique. The fact that water and enjoyment of life are inseparably connected does not entail that the unequal distribution of water implies unequal enjoyment of life. However, it is reasonable to say that a certain level of material security is a prerequisite of freedom, so liberal democratic capitalism cannot be fully defended as long as there is real material poverty. Curiously, conservatives, who stress so strongly the link between property and freedom, are rarely concerned with the amelioration of poverty.I come away from The Conservative Mind with an appreciation of many conservative insights concerning the opposition to Utopian and state socialism, including Communism in all its forms. I would not be surprised if the time comes that these misgivings again become prominent in the face of some new onslaught upon liberal democratic society. But these concerns do not speak to the current situation either in the United States and other advanced technological societies, or in currently developing societies."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"Kirk starts off with 6 basic tendencies that define conservatism. Among them:Pessimism. Conservatives do not trust human beings to seek the good. We believe human beings are concupiscent, and that government, as an institution made up of concupiscent human beings, is untrustworthy and corrupt. A liberal believes human beings are essentially good. Modern \\"liberalism,\\" aka socialism, having failed to prove any of its theories as to where evil comes from, has turned cynical. There is a difference between healthy pessimism and cynicism.Anyway, Kirk begins by outlining 6 key points of conservative thought (which are forgotten by our current liberal Republican president). Then he discusses the major thinkers who defined conservatism from the late 18th to early 20th centuries."},{"Title":"The Conservative Mind, From Burke to Eliot","review":"The book is a very enlightening treatise on conservative thought and history.

We returned our 1st copy thinking it was missing pages. My husband loves it, though!"},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"Joseph and His Brothers was Thomas Mann's \\"Humane Comedy\\" of the 1930's and 1940's. As his European world was collapsing in ideological extremism and descending into chaos, Mann turned his imagination to the Semitic and Egyptian worlds of 1600 BCE and invested the prodigious gifts of his ironic imagination in the all-too-human desires and deities of that world. Though it is enormously long--over 1400 pages of smallish print--the Joseph Saga unfolds its treasures of humane perception to the patient reader who savors Mann's delicious comedy. Read it slowly for full effect.Formerly available in Lowe-Porter's impossibly stilted Biblical prose, John Woods continues his Mann-cycle of translations here in what must have been a labor of love. No doubt the audience for this work is only a tiny fraction of that for his earlier Mann translations--especially Magic Mountain and Buddenbrooks. Let's hope Woods is still game for Felix Krull or, perhaps, a large selection of the shorter works. Woods' English is smooth and agreeable most of the time (consistent with Mann's German) and tart and biting when Mann's irony deserves it."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"This is one of the most wonderfull books ever writen, no doubt. The story of the bible is the point of departure for a beautiful analysis of humanity, full of humour and grandeur. The book is big and one has to read it carefully to enjoy it completely. Every sentence is a jewel, every passage is full of simple life elements that wonder and links us to the past to a point were we conclude that being human is a universal experience, independent of time and space. This is all blended in with a carefull historical research, a detailed reading of the Bible and of the sacred texts. A masterpiece at its fully extent that is curiously not that popular in the english language."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"This is the third of Mann's long works that I've read, the first two being \\"The Magic Mountain\\" and \\"Buddenbrooks,\\" in that order, the former being one of my favorites. I'd once read a quote by Mann saying he considered \\"Joseph and His Brothers\\" to be his masterpiece. If so, I used to think, why wasn't it still in print? I suspected it may have been disingenuous on Mann's part. The two novels I just mentioned had already secured Mann's reputation as a master novelist and their staying power must have seemed all but assured at the time. Joseph, on the other hand, was a different story. Apparently, it never attracted near as much attention as those other creations of his. Whether or not Mann truly believed Joseph was worthy of being considered his best work, it was his longest and the one on which he spent his most strenuous effort. Its neglect clearly caused him anxiety. This is all discussed in the translator John E. Woods' introduction to this edition of Joseph, as well as in Mann's introduction from a much older edition which is also included here. Will this latest edition from Everyman help Joseph finally garner the critical acclaim Mann thought it deserved?A potential reader must seriously ponder at the outset the problem of deciding whether or not to read a 1500 page novel based on a quite familiar biblical story of about 40 pages in length. It would seem that the legend of Joseph has done just fine on its own in its inherited form. The main reason I would say to read this, if for no other, is that Mann demonstrates here that he is the consummate scholar-novelist. Beyond its novel aspect, Joseph is really an elaborate commentary and explication on the Book of Genesis and, in a most indirect manner, its impact on the Judeo-Christian heritage. The novel is rewarding in that regard, as well as for its magnificent historical set pieces. We are presented with vignette after vignette of how the people of this time lived and viewed the world, and particularly how myth blended with, indeed was synonymous with, their consciousness and how that determined their actions. Through Mann's glosses of the ancient myths of Egypt and Mesopotamia, one is able to trace the origins of many of the primary theological concepts of the Christian and Jewish faiths.If, however, the astounding scholarship is the novel's strength, then it is also its weakness, for it labors under it. There is too little mystery to the story - we all know what happens from the outset. Mann takes the biblical myth, blows it up, and refills the lacunae. Thus, one can get a better understanding of the motives of the players, and why things may have happened in the biblical myth as presented. To me this is all very interesting, yet academic. In reading a novel I desire the novel experience, and in this I look for characters not pre-determined. This would present quite a challenge to Mann were he not to alter the story. He is often successful in breathing new life into the players. For instance, his portrayal of Esau as the piping, uncouth goat-man and the disdain which Jacob feels for him in that regard; or Abraham as the shadowy figure who spurns the moon citadel of Ur and wanders Mesopotamia, forging a new religion along the way. Yet I feel the novel seldom becomes more than a presentation of exquisite detail, and the character Joseph is always as one would expect him to be. If you love Joseph already, as Mann clearly does, and feel he holds a special place in your faith or worldview, then this will be quite a delightful book. If not, if Joseph is looked upon only as a very important mythical figure with some basis in history, then it may not be so easy to share Mann's 1500 page enthusiasm for him."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"For all the great technological magic of our age we suffer the misfortune of living in a time where the depth of hyperbole rends the edge from language leaving us bereft when the time comes to describe something truly remarkable. Thus to say that John Woods' translation of Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers offers readers a gift of almost indescribable value may leave one wondering if I am making a literally true statement or simply wallowing in the common puff of our day. In this case the latter is the case for Mr. Woods' translation of Mann's great opus offers the reader an experience both challenging and sublime.Readers unfamiliar with Mann's work may feel a sense of vertigo beginning this even more than his other works. Much of the style of narration, unique with its perspective shifting through time, seems almost purposely designed to leave one doubting their footing. Increasing the sense of dread is the books sheer heft, with over 1500 pages of small type and weighing in at almost two and half pounds. Yet those brave souls who resist the temptation to lay down this load in favor of a more easily digested work will come to in the end appreciate the feast to come. Mann's work rests on its own unique rhythm, and once the reader grows acclimated they will surely appreciate both the work and the great skill of Mr. Wood as translator. This series of four novels expounding on the biblical tale of Jacob, his son of Joseph of the famous robe, as well as his brothers, often comes when people engage in the entertaining and fruitless parlor game of determining the greatest literary work of the 20th century. While no single work can claim such a title, the complexity of the work and the Herculean task of translation should be evident that this is only the second instance of its translation into English in the more than 60 years since it first appeared.Beyond simply outlining the work's subject matter, in many ways it seems written with the express intent of defying further description. With a complex web of interrelated stories, occasionally taking subjects that the bible reflects on for only a sentence and expanded on them for a hundred pages and at the same time seeking to place this seminal tale in its religious, historic, and cultural context, the work often leaves the reader gasping at the audacity of Man's enterprise. Yet almost every one of his efforts comes as a remarkable success, leaving one much to ponder. Indeed, any expectation that one can rush through this work will surely leave you with only a headache and little to show for the effort. Instead, one must take their time and slowly chew on Joseph and His Brother's digesting each piece in turn. Like many great works this one takes effort and diligence, but the reward comes as more than just bragging rights for having read it. Far more, it will offer an often eye opening new perspective and beckon from the book shelf to be taken down again so that you may reread this section or that.One last point: to end where I began, Mann's attention to detail and word choice often gives pause, making each of us consider the harm done when we rain down words on a subject when a mere drop would do."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"The philosophical meaning of the book as well as beauty of the language combined with encyclopedic knowledge and mastery of the author are outstanding, but certainly it is not an easy reading. The book has been banned for four decades in Soviet Russia."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"Having studied and been fascinated by the Bible story, I wanted a more in-depth treatment, and read this work, expecting insights from a modern perspective. Certainly, I got what I expected, but also something more: a gripping work of transcendent lyricism, and riveting reading for its many hundreds of pages. Mann gives his characters both monumental depth and thoroughly human qualities, so that you feel that you both know them and are in awe of them. You empathize at the recognizability of their situations, yet you gain so much insight and perspective into a past world and emerging religion. I found the book highly readable, but even for those who find it tough going at first, I recommend staying the course, for one of the most rewarding reading experiences I know."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"It has been a pleasure reading the reviews of others of this magisterial work. We form a kind of brotherhood across space and time in the task of praising to the outside world the grandeur of the work Mann himself considered his magnum opus. I once owned the previous Lowe-Porter translation and could get precisely nowhere with it. Now Mr. Woods has made it accessible to any literate spirit. I use the term \\"spirit\\" advisedly. For in the Prelude, entitled \\"The Descent into Hell,\\" Mann sets forth a cosmogony derived from Gnosticism apparently, in which God permitted the soul, at its urgent request, to descend to earth to intermix with matter and then, in order to redeem the soul from this entanglement sent out a second emissary, as it were, the spirit, from the heavenly realm. But the spirit also got itself overengaged with this earthly compound of soul-matter, losing sight, one might say, of its original mission of rescue, much as an ambassador to a foreign land, if he stays there too long, loses the sense of his original representation and instead becomes an advocate for the foreign country, as Mann points out with exquisite irony. But then, gentle reader, the bombshell explodes, and Mann cuts through all of his own thick and multilayered ironies to set forth what I, at least, consider the strongest sentence I have ever encountered, anywhere:[The spirit] remains, no matter how it presents itself, what it is: the messenger ofwarning, the principle of opposition, umbrage, and wandering, which stirs upwithin the breast of one individual, among all the great host of the lustilycomplacent, an uneasiness at our preternatural wretchedness, drives him outof the gates of the past and the given and into the extravagant adventure ofuncertainty, and makes him like the stone that, once it has broken away andbegins to roll, is destined to set in motion an ever-growing, rolling,incalculable cascade of events. [pp. 35-6]And from this immediately ensues the epic spiritual adventure of Abraham into the uncharted domain of grasping for an understanding of and relationship with the sole and ultimate source of sovereignty in the universe. And if this weren't enough, Mann then goes on to equate Abraham's adventure with the adventure of the storyteller (!) in daring to reach out to compose a tale such as this one.Obviously I could go on forever in this vein, but my sole object is to plant my flag with the other on-line reviewers here and perhaps by this to induce some innocent wandering passerby of a reader to get out there and buy the book and read it, and by that act of participation, under any view a daunting and time-consuming committment, to join in Mann's festival of life, of storytelling as high art, of recapitulating in himself or herself the tradition of absorbing one's own cultural roots at the deepest level of joy and satisfaction. So there.--Mark B.

Original editions are a little rare and expensive, but, like any treasure, it's rewards are transcendental, and once read, you can consider yourself part of the most esoteric world of the true literati.

It is a masterpiece full of excitment about history, respect to the reader and unsurmountable talent."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"In Doctor Faustus, Thomas Mann reached to the bottom of the German soul. In Joseph and his brothers he did the same in respect to the God and his chosen people - the Jews.Happily, the result is much brighter and more optimistic.Most delightfull of all T. Mann's books."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"In the book of Genesis, the story of Joseph is relatively short. It took Thomas Mann over 1,400 pages to retell the story just how he wanted it, and the result is one of the best long novels ever written. I'll say up front that I can't recommend this book enough. It's gorgeous, funny, heart-breaking, and intellectually stimulating. If you're like me, you'll want to read it all over again as soon as you finish. It's that good. What follows are some of the reasons why I think this is so.The story is fairly simple. Jacob's son Joseph is sold into slavery by his jealous brothers. Joseph ascends from slavery to the highest office in Egypt. Many years later, Joseph has mercy on his brothers when they come to Egypt because of a famine in their homeland, and the whole family is reunited. It's a little bit Count of Monte Cristo, a little bit of the Odyssey, a little bit Ben Hur, and a whole lot of ancient Near Eastern myth and religion. Anyone familiar with Mann's other novels can already see that this is an uncharacteristically happy subject for Mann's imagination to work its magic on. But after reading all of Mann's major fiction and much of his non-fiction writing, I am convinced that Joseph and His Brothers is his greatest achievement. This tetralogy has the sad warmth of Buddenbrooks, the intellectual play of The Magic Mountain, and the intense creativity of Doctor Faustus, and so much more.More than any other Mann novel, the characters are incredibly loveable and memorable. Jacob, Joseph, Reuben, Rachel, Benjamin, Gad and Asher, Bes and Dudu, Huya and Tuya, Behknakons, Potiphar, Akhenaton, and so many more! (Sorry if I misspelled any of those; my copy of Joseph is in another state at the moment.) As far as long novels go, the only other times I have become so attached to fictional characters were while reading David Copperfield, War and Peace, and The Brothers Karamazov. Mann is sometimes called a novelist of ideas, and there are plenty of beautiful and complex ideas to think about here for years to come, but in Joseph and His Brothers Mann seems more interested than ever before in appealing to the heart.Another reason I think this is Mann's best is the narrative voice. The narrator is incredibly knowledgeable, but also good humored. He teases and hints, constantly winking and pretending that he's just as mystified as the reader is and then summing up several pages of difficult text in a single, perfect sentence. It's a welcoming, friendly voice, and you never feel like you're being talked down to even though you're always being catered to; in other words, it's the voice of a great storyteller.I've run on too much. My enthusiasm when talking about this book always spills over. But I have to say that this hardcover edition from Everyman's Library is THE edition to get. Not only is the type and size and everything about the book itself just perfect, but John E. Woods' translation is an absolute miracle. At no point does the text feel like a translation. If you aren't obliged to read this book in a rush, then read it aloud slowly so you can appreciate Woods' craftsmanship. Overall, just enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"Labor of love indeed, I finally finished this book. 1,492 pages of dense text. It took me 4 months.The book is in serious need of editing: Mann repeats himself often, and not always to good effect.But that said, I kept reading it for a reason: It's good.I can honestly say that I have never read a book using the voice that Mann employed here: Pedantic yet charming, it feels like you are being told a story by a kind hearted professor who sometimes rambles and repeats himself.Of the books by Mann that I have read, this is my favorite, followed by Faustus."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"This isn't really about Joseph and his brothers, but about his father, Jacob. An amazing achievement, taking the bare bones of the biblical story and adding research from Judaism and Egyptian and Near East mythologies and oral histories. Plus Mann went to the land covered in these histories to see it for himself. There is an ironic, slightly satirical tone which surprised me - I thought it would be so religious - not at all. He made everything matter-of-fact and plausible and made the biblical characters come alive as real people, always adding the small details of their way of life then. Jacob seems such a sympathetic man, as Rachel does a woman, but Joseph comes off as a tattle tale, and there is the one line in the bible to support this as in everything of which Mann writes. Such a sad and touching ending to this first book."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"I immediately bought the four volumes in a single hard cover book after hearing a Joseph Campbell lecture on this work.

History and critical opinion have begged otherwise. But could Mann maybe have been right? Part of the problem, at least for English speakers, was the lack of a suitable translation. (The only other translation I know of, by Helen Lowe-Porter, was senselessly rendered into stilted King James English. I find it incredible that Mann actually lent his blessing to that translation.) A few years ago, Woods solved that problem brilliantly, rendering Joseph into clear flowing English. To my surprise and delight, Joseph and his Brothers is actually compelling and entertaining reading, and really a far easier read than, say, Doktor Faustus. So, don't let its size scare you off. If you like Mann's other work even a little, try this one."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"Anyone who has read my Listmania \\"Escape Mass Market Fiction\\" knows that I touted this novel (tertrology actually) as having \\".... the most exquisite language since Shakespeare\\".

What's icing on the cake as to this book's sheer power and unforgettableness is its comic charm. I did not know I was going to be reading what is pretty much a comedy when being pulled into this marvelous Old Testament narrative.If you have read the biblical account of Jacob and Esau on down to Joseph in Egypt and are worried that its contents couldn't stay intriguing for this many pages, there is good news, because it, for the most part, very much is.In the preface, translator John E. Woods accurately proposes he thinks that \\"Mann ... wanted to make sure he had readers worthy of him\\" while explaining that some portions of this interweaving jewel are prone to be more difficult to read than what is, thankfully, the majority. And it is this truth, in which I agree with this stirling translator, that I breifly dwell upon.In several used bookstores I've been to, the only part of this story that I ever saw available, and in a volume all its own, was H.T. Porter's translation of \\"Joseph in Egypt.\\" Given its apparent availability over the other three parts, I suspected it would be the best - which Mann himself thought to be true. But, solely from the perspective of, as Virginia Woolf would aptly call me, a 'common reader,' I bring forth that those trickier 'riddles' that Woods forwarns, or maybe just mentions, occur most often in this third volume. The feel of being sidetracked a little too much continues on into the beginning segments of \\"Joseph the Provider.\\"Do these, I will dare to say, overly descriptive, meandering pages that include some repitition detract all that much from the sheer pleasure that dominates most of what is nothing short of this literary feast and party? Hardly not. For outside of this minor qualm over the author perhaps going a little too far about content that probably didn't require as much attention, there is no book I have read up until now that has offered more to a reader than this. I guess \\"sublime\\" is not a bad word to use when measuring the result of Mann's cataclysmic efforts that encompassed a time span of 16 years, no less, including a 5-year absence between the third and fourth stories.He touches on such juicy, delicious insights about mankind, helping to devour the notion that life is different now compared to then. And while it is entirely varied in custom, how could our experiences be all that different due to the fact that we all have one monstrous thing in common, our humanity.Mann had me wondering if he wasn't something more than human, though, his elegance, wisdom, humor and charm are in such top form. And while it could have been one of the great many gods of Baal that Mann includes throughout who could have helped guide his pen, I'm more prone to believe it was the God of the wanderer who possessed his wrist on occasion."},{"Title":"Joseph and his brothers","review":"A good book but too heavy:This letter is to the publisher of Joseph & his brothers by Thomas man.

I guarantee you'll learn something new if you read this one!"},{"Title":"Optical Network Control: Architecture, Protocols, and Standards","review":"This was a book I wanted to read but could not convince myself to start on, primarily because its title was rather &quot;ominous&quot; given the range of topics it seemed to span. I was afraid that I would actually have to essentially go through what would mostly be a series of back to back RFCs, which is certainly not the most pleasant way of getting introduced to a topic.However, I ultimately got started and was very pleasantly surprised. The book does indeed cover all those topics, and they are all important to a good comprehension of network control issues in optical networks. However, it does so in a logical and progressive way that introduces the key concepts and provides the appropriate level of details without overwhelming the reader. The three authors clearly have both an extensive practical knowledge of the topics and a deep understanding of the underlying technologies and analytical tools. This is reflected in the exposition of the different topics that the book cover, as well as the flow and organization of the material.The end result is a concise yet complete book that walks you effectively through the concepts, protocols and technologies used to control modern optical networks.Definitely a book to read if you are interested in the domain."},{"Title":"Optical Network Control: Architecture, Protocols, and Standards","review":"Optical networks have long had very advanced physical layer management, but have been manually planned and provisioned at extremely high operational cost. Applying technology derived from IP routing to the optical network control plane is the most exciting new development in the optical systems field since the 1970's. The authors are early pioneers that first brought this technology to market about 3 years ago. They have done the industry a great favor by laying out a concise and well architected roadmap for others to follow. This will be the standard reference work on the optical control plane for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Book of Eleanor","review":"The Book of Eleanor is a well written, captivating story about learning some of life's most important lessons, and how our families and our youth shape who we are.

One can imagine themselves living at Stillmeadow in the quiet, country atmosphere.Throughout the book, Taber muses on different subjects such as wildlife, cooking, bird watching, pets, flower arranging, weather, and other country items of interest.This is a book for anyone who enjoys living in the country or who desires to live in the country. It is a book to read at leisure so that you can savor it page by page.As a former country dweller and a now-reluctant city dweller, it brings back many fond memories of my childhood growing up in the country."},{"Title":"Stillmeadow Daybook","review":"The Stillmeadow books are not primers on how to live in the country. They are not truly biographies, nor are they meant to be political treatises, which I appreciate because it means they are not as dated as they could be.They are journals, well written, contemplative, and meditative. They bring a quiet sense of peace and rest in a busy day. The writing is lovely. The author has a gentle way with words and descriptions. These are books you can read a few pages here, and a few pages there, as you have time, without losing a thread of plot or missing vital details to a story.Those who enjoy nature writing, descriptions of country-life and a writer's inner thought processes will enjoy these books. I love sitting down in a busy day and spending a few minutes reading passages like \\"I look out past the great sugar maples that overshadow the little house, and on to the meadow and the hill where we planted the Christmas trees. The bottom of the meadow is a wild tangled thicket, half swampy, and there grow the wild cranberries and the dark wild iris and at the edge the wild red grapes with their sweet musky flavor.\\"If this sort of thing makes you impatient, the Stillmeadow books are not for you.

Gladys was a gifted writer who shared warm personal anecdotes of home and family and friends, making you feel like you're right there with her. She wasn't a pollyanna, however; she wrote about difficult times, too, all with grace and humor. She has always seemed to me to be a gentle soul, someone I would have loved to have known in person - but since that wasn't and isn't possible, her Stillmeadow books are the next best thing. I highly recommend them all."},{"Title":"Stillmeadow Daybook","review":"After 45 years of dusting and reshelving Glydes Taber's books on my mother's livingroom bookshelf, I finally pulled one out to see what made them so great. After reading Stillmeadow Daybook, I have to say, I am not impressed. I give Mrs. Taber a lot of credit for being a selling author and bringing home an income I hope led to continued support of her country lifestyle, but that lifestyle is not enough to carry a reader.Time wise, a daybook it is not; it is more of a glorified, condensed monthly organizer of random impressions of her old house, growing vegtables and show dogs, her parents and children, neighbors, friends, and co-habitant Jill. Jill leaks through the pages like a shadow yet it is only with Jill that the author seems to do anything outside Stillmeadow. She never really explains who Jill is: a friend, yes, who once lived like her with a husband and kids in a New York City apartment, right, until one day a 40 acre farm in Connecticut captured their hearts, gotcha. Hearts bruised possibly due to the loss of their respective husbands about whom the reader learns nothing.What is interesting are the intermitent references to current events. Written in the fifties, Mrs. Taber adds thoughts of good will toward men in her commentaries about education for every child of every color, trust in our government and democracy, and ending the world's problems \\"if only we could persuade a few power-mad dictators....\\" All this against the growing dangers of comics, eminent domain, atom bombs, and dope rings. She even mentions the late, great radio host Mary Margaret McBride and popular books of the time, most notably Rachel Carson's The Sea Around Us.If Gladys Taber's \\"current events\\" were my current events maybe Stillmeadow Daybook would appeal to me as much as it did my mother and grandmother. They were drawn to the series by a love for dogs who received the same verbal affection and household designation as Mrs. Taber bestowed on her animals. I too like dogs, vegtable gardens, and changing skies, but the endless and aimless commentary that made Gladys Taber a prolific writer leads me back to the livingroom bookshelf, maybe this time to read Rachel Carson instead."},{"Title":"Future Interventions with Battered Women and Their Families (SAGE Series on Violence against Women)","review":"Future Interventions is a thoughtful collection of essays that address theory and practice with both victims and perpetrators of domestic violence, including children as victims by virtue of exposure. The book attempts to take a global perspective less successfully, since space constrains the extent to which the contributors can explain policy considerations, community context, and individual and couple behavior within one culture, let alone several. But the overall contribution is both a good overview of domestic violence issues and a comprehensive and directly applicable description of theory that encompasses intrapersonal, interpersonal, and social structural processes. I find that I refer back to Future Interventions time and time again in my work with community agencies and the structure of the Domestic Violence Response system in my community, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Particles, Sources, and Fields.

I used to think of Emerson and Thoreau interchangeably, as if they were merely conduits of the same fluid. I had already read and enjoyed Thoreau, but Thoreau hadn't changed my life the way I hoped he might. He pointed me into the woods, which I really appreciate, but he didn't pick me up by the lapels and communicate with me. So it took me a while for me to get to Emerson. After all, I had already read Thoreau.Man, what a shame.Reading Emerson is like meditating on the wind that whistles through the reeds of a universal lake. He creates an existential sanctuary for the seekers among us, a place where we can strip down to our barest questions and be at peace with not knowing their answers. Emerson strokes our &quot;need to become&quot; like a kind father who understands the hurt but cannot make it disappear. His universal truths of the heart do as much to soothe as to educate. Emerson thought for himself at a time when it was literally dangerous to do so. He excavated his heart, mind, soul, and body for nuggets of wisdom and offered them freely to anyone brave enough to partake.The Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson is a book of vision. We could do well to wallpaper our home with Emerson's quotes and use them as stepping stones in our own life's journey. Emerson has instituted a category of human aspiration that I will call existential, transcendental individualism. His is a rebellious spirit. Not rebellious in the sense that a teenager is rebellious, being unconsciously contrary to any matter of public opinion, but rebellious in a more directed fashion. Emerson looked out and saw a societal charade that seemed to hinder our human potential. Emerson rebelled against the fear and dogma that have always run the masses in favor of a more honest religion, one that allows the spirit of God to &quot;enter by a private door into every individual&quot; (p. 194). Emerson awoke in me a latent skill for independent thinking, a method of dialog that encourages me to question and think even as I find God in every moment. I received from this book everything I had hoped to receive from Thoreau... the Bible... and my endless quest for direction through literature. I discovered that if ever I was going to be an &quot;-ist,&quot; I would be an existentialist.Quotes.Yes, we need quotes. Here is a handful of the countless passages that I underlined in my own copy of the book. I will not introduce these quotes because Emerson can write for himself. Man, can he write for himself...A mind might ponder its thought for ages, and not gain so much self-knowledge as the passion of love shall teach it in a day.No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature. To be great is to be misunderstood.It is only as a man puts off all foreign support, and stands alone, that I see him to be strong and to prevail.No man had ever a defect that was not somewhere made useful to him.The fact that I am here certainly shows me that the soul had need of an organ here. Shall I not assume the post?To stand in true relations with men in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not?We must be our own, before we can be another's.The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough.That which we are, we shall teach, not voluntarily, but involuntarily.God enters by a private door into every individual.The angels are so enamored of the language that is spoken in heaven that they will not distort their lips with the hissing and unmusical dialects of men, but speak their own, whether there any who understand it or not.Emerson was rebuked by clergymen who felt threatened by his air of self-reliance. A once-ordained Unitarian minister, Emerson left his pastorate due to doctrinal disputes. This Emerson fellow was actually applying himself to the principles on which the Church convened, not merely going through the motions with the rest of them. Such a man was dangerous. Just as Jesus was dangerous. A man like Emerson might upset the political order,perhaps even ruin the whole tithe racquet. Today Emerson is sometimes rebuked by those who are offended by his &quot;sexist language.&quot; Emerson wrote at a time when it was common to use the universal masculine &quot;he,&quot; &quot;his,&quot; and &quot;him.&quot; And again his wisdom is lost on those who cannot see past their political hang-ups. If we can get beyond our egos, however, we'll see that Emerson has as much to offer the literate community as any scholar, pastor,or messiah in history. And he doesn't hide his message in the space between the lines of a story; he shares his message with the same open, honest spirit that bleeds from every page of this book."},{"Title":"Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson","review":"This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. I know that many people don't like to read essays of any kind, but all I can say is that Ralph Waldo Emerson is simply different! Nobody has the gift to write essays and analyze life like him.His words and ideas are so powerful and deep that we soon realize that they didn't come only from a brilliant mind, but also from a warm-hearted soul!That's exactly what this book is about: Its sentences break through your brain and penetrate right into your soul! Emerson's optimistic view on human beings and life can only reinforce our courage in mankind and, especially, in ourselves!What else can I say? His speech is direct, he defends all the good values, tell us to have confidence in ourselves and show us that passing through life with dignity is a matter of choice and courage, and that it simply doesn't change with time. It was like this a thousand years ago, it will probably follow the same rules a thousand years f! ! rom now.This is the book I grab to comfort my spirit when I'm having difficult times... :) It is a guide that make us believe that anything is possible when we really want it! &quot; Self-Reliance &quot;, one of the essays inside this book, is a masterpiece in its own and I believe it should be studied in every high school, instead some of the crap we are usually obliged to read!This book can shape your spirit and your mind. It is also possibly THE BEST self-help book you could ever own and, yet, a great literary work.I would rate this book as ageless and I'm sure the future generations will be still interested in it, in the same way we are in those ancient Greek and Roman texts.This is precious culture and food for your soul as a bargain!

If ever an author is to have a positive effect on one's life, this man is certainly the foremost candidate. Emerson's essays radiate optimism and preach self-confidence; his works contain some of the best lessons one could ever hope to learn and, at the same time, are some of the greatest pieces of literature ever written. Like Tombstone's Doc Holiday, every sentence Emerson offers is quotable. Make no mistake, though, Emerson's words are of a completely different brand than those echoing quotes that decorate hollow speeches; an Emerson quote has meat. In every sentence one can find his complete philosophy, much like, as he writes in The Over-Soul, \\"One blood rolls uninterruptedly, an endless circulation through all.\\" One's memory of Emerson's entire teachings can be refreshed in a single phrase, but one can never see the genius in his writing without having grasped it in the first place. That is precisely why I would consider offering a Cliff's Notes-type summary of any of Emerson's works one of the gravest literary crimes. Apart from the impossibility of the task, any so-called shortcut would rob the reader of those self-revelations - which are the essence of the Emerson experience - that can only be reached by trudging alone through the depths of the material. The reading is challenging. Each sentence takes on a different meaning upon re-examinations, be they consecutive or periodic. In the first reading, one may be struck by a certain passage's theme or imagery. Upon reading over it seconds later, one may discover a subtle metaphor, and a third reading my suggest another, even-deeper meaning, all of which may be replaced by the impressions of a fourth glance some two or three weeks later. The material is timeless, accommodating the evolving individual as well as the ever-changing human race. We must be careful, though, not to be lulled into the cult-mentality of using Emerson's writings as an instruction manual for our own lives. To do so would be to undermine his entire message. The fruit of the Emerson experience is gaining the self-trust, or Self-Reliance, necessary to follow our own hearts, make our own decisions, and say, with confidence, \\"Hey, I know what I'm doing.\\""},{"Title":"Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson","review":"Although he was considered during his lifetime to be a profoundly radical thinker, Emerson, the Transcendentalist chief, after his death, was soon reinterpreted as a bland Bostonian Brahmin, a mystic anarchist who was only brave on paper. It cannot be denied that his philosophy of a joyful and affirmationist acceptance of life, and of nature, his anti-slavery activities, his attacks on the state and on the sensualism of bourgeois society, could have easily provided the formula for a complete overthrow of the moral order of his time. His libertarian thrust, his serene integrity, his indefatiguable optimism and common sense, however, will continue to find admirers, notwithstanding the fact that political identifications have changed and emphases have shifted, or otherwise one can simply enjoy the polished beauty of his prose style. Though by no means a deep thinker, Emerson's brilliantly epigrammatic, allusive, declamatory, pithy style provides instances where the reader may extrapolate a number of meanings from even the shortest utterances, and it is due to this quality, perhaps, that the Emerson enigma came into being, enabling him to appeal to such numerous and diverse temperaments. His best essays include &quot;The Over-Soul&quot;, &quot;Compensation&quot;, &quot;Self-Reliance&quot; and &quot;Manners&quot;, in which he preaches, in the rhetorical manner reminiscent of his background as a Unitarian minister, his ideals of contenment, joy, independence and self-confidence -- tonics of the soul."},{"Title":"Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson","review":"If I could create my ideal afterlife or heaven, I would wish to be forever cradled in the gentle arms and soothing prose of Emerson.

He paints a vivid and honest picture of life. Always thought provoking, his style may be a little bit wordy for some but the message is inspiring and timeless."},{"Title":"Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson","review":"Ralph Waldo Emerson was a transcendentalist (someone who espouses a philosophy emphasizing the intuitive and spiritual above the empirical), and a Christian minister, who was also steeped in the rich philosophical tradition of the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Bhagavad-Gita. His essays are classic literature at its finest, with a rhythm and cadence that are, even in prose, poetic and musical. The beauty of this prose, in my opinion, is unparalleled.What Emerson has to say is every bit as important as how he says it. He was a genius with \\"rough edges\\" who challenged society to question many of its unexamined assumptions. He did get into trouble for this, and was forced to resign as minister of his church, but Emerson refused to compromise on truth. A rugged individualism and stalwart non-conformity were the cornerstones of his personal philosophy. Emerson was well ahead of his time (1803-1882) and remains so to this day.Emerson was a far more prominent voice in America than many people today might realize. If you decide to read Emerson, you may very well find yourself repeatedly saying, \\"so that's who said that.\\" Many profound and moving quotes are attributed to him. His essays, \\"The Over-Soul\\" and \\"Self-Reliance\\" are justifiably considered among some of the best writing by an American author.Emerson's voice will certainly not be to everyone's liking, and that is as true today as it was in his time. Because of the style of his prose and the nature of what he wrote about, there will be many who read him and who simply put him aside. On the other hand, don't be surprised if reading Emerson sends shock waves through your central nervous system. For those who really get hooked on Emerson, as I did 32 years ago, he will remain a lifetime companion offering a wealth of insight into the eternal verities of the soul and man's quest for the divine. For my money, there is no finer essayist or \\"philosopher\\" than Ralph Waldo Emerson."},{"Title":"Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson","review":"Once in a while, there comes a writer with the rare ability to make one feel as if they never really understood the world in the first place. Ralph Waldo Emerson was one such writer.A philosopher, lecturer and poet all wrapped up in one, Emerson displays the power of this unique blend in his immortal essays. Emerson combines his incredible understanding of life with his equally strong command of the English language in order to delineate the various topics discussed in his work.Without going into too much detail (as it would greatly deprive prospective readers the pleasure of reading these essays for themselves), I would like to share a few pearls of wisdom taken from this book.In one of his most famed essays, Self-Reliance, Emerson states:\\"He who knows that power is inborn, that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so perceiving throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly rights himself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs, works miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head.\\"In Compensation, Emerson states:\\"Our strength grows out of our weakness. The indignation which arms itself with secret forces does not awaken until we are pricked and stung and sorely assailed. A great man is always willing to be little. While he sits on the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep. When he is pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; he has been put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts; learns his ignorance; is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got moderation and real skill...\\"And in The Over-Soul, Emerson writes:\\"The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know truth when we see it, let skeptic and scoffer say what they choose. Foolish people ask you, when you have spoken what they do not wish to hear, 'How do you know it is truth and not an error of your own?' We know truth when we see it, from opinion, as we know when we are awake that we are awake...\\"I could go on and on about the many other great statements in this book, but the message is clear. This is highly recommended reading for anyone with an interest in philosophy and spirituality."},{"Title":"Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson","review":"There is a tendency for moderns to credit Ralph Waldo Emerson not only as the leading Transcendentalist of his day but also as its sole originator. Such an opinion is an oversimplification which even in Emerson's day was hotly debated. Emerson was certainly one of the movement's luminaries but he was ably assisted by a myriad of lesser known contemporaries, including William Ellery Channing, a leading Unitarian preacher; Amos Bronson Alcott, a controversial author whose books alienated the orthodox Trinitarian church; Margaret Fuller, who became editor of the Dial, the primary if short-lived official journal of the Transcendentalists; and later Henry David Thoreau, whose own contributions to Transcendentalism eventually surpassed those of Emerson.Transcendentalism did not appear one day from nowhere fully formed. It was an offshoot of Unitarianism, which itself evolved rather unwillingly from Trinitarianism. When Jonathan Edwards preached his fire and brimstone sermon Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God in 1741, he had been trying for years to revive the \\"man is depraved\\" basis of Calvinism. Trinitarians, like Edwards, believed that God was manifested in three parts: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Those in the pulpits who had been told endlessly that God was both nasty and unforgiving eventually tired of such hectoring and turned to a simpler creed, Unitarianism that holds that God is complete in only one incarnation, thus denying the need for the tri-part division of the Trinitarians. However, as soon as Unitarianism became established as the successor to the Trinitarian sect, it immediately ran afoul of a mixture of competing faiths and spiritual movements, most of which originated in England and Europe.Though the Unitarians based their faith on the concept of the oneness of God, they still retained the Puritan tendency to grasp the Mysteries of the Universe through man's rational understanding and sensory impressions. Overseas in Europe, a growing tide of thought emerged which rejected man's rationalism as the only key to unveiling these arcane Mysteries. This tide was an amalgam of the various strands of the Enlightenment. From Germany came the philosophy of Kant, whose definitions of \\"understanding\\" and \\"reason\\" were instrumental in nudging the future Transcendentalists into accepting the notion that truth transcends the sphere of man's physical senses. From England, came the Romanticism of Wordsworth and Coleridge, both of whom acknowledged that man's intuition rather than his cold logic were quite sufficient to apprehend nature. And from Sweden came the theories of Swedenborg, who demonstrated that the universe was based on a spiritual foundation that permitted man to discern the mystical essences of nature as readily as his physical senses could register their material correspondences.There were quite a few young pastors like Emerson who had been trained in the new Unitarian faith who now faced the unpleasant prospect of continuing to preach a religion whose central tenets were becoming increasingly difficult to justify or abandoning it for something else. Much of their collective discontent was based on the Unitarian insistence on the primacy of sensory impressions as the most efficient conduit between man and his apprehension of the external universe. This focus on the need of man to utilize his senses to apprehend a chaotic universe was the basis of the theories of John Locke, who suggested that there was no abstract or spiritual essence for man to contemplate since that essence was beyond the scope of his physical senses. According to Locke, the tabula rasa, the blank slate of the mind, could only be filled in by what was there right in front of man and if man could not physically connect himself to an essence, then that essence was held not to exist. Thus for Romanticism and later for Transcendentalism to work, man somehow had to acknowledge that there was indeed a way to bridge the Lockean chasm between that which was provably \\"real\\" and that which was arguably \\"unreal.\\" The first generation of Unitarians solved this dilemma by drawing a clear distinction between the physical \\"real\\" and the assumed \\"unreal.\\" This \\"real\\" they called the understanding. It was understood\\" that man's perception of the universe was based on his receiving sensory impressions directly from the world around him. If man could touch, hear, smell, taste, or see an object, then that object was proven to exist in reality. That which was \\"unreal\\" could be discerned only by what they called reason. It was reasonable to assume that somewhere beyond the level of man's physical senses lay a higher, more ethereal world of the unreal that could be apprehended only via man's intuition and observance of truth beyond sense.By the time that Emerson had renounced his Unitarian beliefs, American style Transcendentalism had already begun to take recognizable shape. What we today call Transcendentalism is a cobbled fabric of like minded individuals, all of whom shared common beliefs. The ability of man to reason a higher form of existence had for too long been overshadowed by his understanding, however false, that reality was limited to the provable here and now. In order to reach this spiritual phase of existence, man had to trust that it was there to be found and that he could use his intuition to find it. As a corollary to trusting oneself in all things it followed that the accepted and revealed dogma of the church had to be rejected. All of the long-established rites of the church were to be discouraged and ultimately discarded. Further, the bible as the Revealed Word of God, had to be similarly discounted as a barrier between Man Thinking and the sought after higher realm of spiritual existence. There would be no need, then, for the church to explain miracles since the ordinary man could perceive them unaided. Indeed, a Transcendentalist would see nature in its entirety as replete with an infinity of miracles, any one of which could render insignificant church-sanctioned miracles. The major figures of orthodox theology--Christ and his apostles--were now to be reduced to human status, untouched by divinity. Ultimately, what began in Europe and culminated in New England as a generalized mixture of philosophy, religion, and the arts morphed into the transcendental literature that became known as the hallmark of Emerson and Thoreau."},{"Title":"Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson","review":"You don't have to be a 19th Century New England transcendentalist to appreciate Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Anyone that says you can \\"get it\\" from a single read doesn't understand the man or the truths he reveals about life and the universe. To call Emerson a transcendentalist is a cliche and the one calling him this doesn't understand that Emerson was about the here and now.His best works for a truth seeker are Self-Reliance, Compensation and the Over-Soul. I suggest reading Compensation at least every night for three weeks. The world changes once you do.To put Emerson in the same category as literary writers like those other reviewers have done is an injustice.

The first movie of his I saw was &quot;Daddy Long Legs.&quot; I was fasinated with the way he danced. When I found out that he had a biography I snatched a copy up. What I like about this book is that Fred Astaire wrote it himself. I found myself laughing at times, and after reading the book I felt as if I knew him personally. The best thing about this book is that it has 47 black and white photos. This book is a must for true fans of one of the greatest dancers who ever graced the big screen."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"I am a big fan of Fred Astaire and this was the first book I was able to read about him. The fact that it is also written by him is a big plus. Fred is a shy and humble man, and his book gives that impression but it is a great account of a man that met everyone, from English and Hollywood royalty to bookmakers and bell hops (in fact, he made a point of knowing bell hops, they knew all the right places to go and the juicy stories). Fred was a private man and he never delves into much detail about his personal feelings. He's quick to acknowledge someone he likes, but you get the feeling that he holds back on people he might not have liked. He never puts down a film partner so if you're looking for an autobio that tells it all, this isn't it. However, Fred's story is still chock full of interesting tales. It doesn't just appeal to Astaire fans, it also appeals to vaudeville, theater, and history fans as Fred was born in 1899 and lived through some amazing times. The Roaring '20s were spent in New York and London (visiting with royalty and the upper class), the '30s in Hollywood where he and Ginger Rogers made people forget the Depression for a while with their movies, and he dedicates a chapter to rehashing his overseas experience in the '40s when he toured on a USO show during WWII. So if you want an easy read of an important movie and dance icon, I highly recommend &quot;Steps In Time&quot;. Don't worry about being bored, Fred has a nice sense of humor and there are no lulls in his story. He wrote this book in the late '50s and still had decades of work in front of him, but unfortunately, he never wrote a follow up book chronicling what was still an exciting and glamorous life. Read this book and watch the movies!"},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"Fred Astaire (1899-1987) was, quite simply, a dance genius. He appeared on stage, often with his sister Adele, in such landmark musicals as LADY BE GOOD and FUNNY FACE; he graced at least 43 films, 31 one of which were musicals; he is, for all practical intents and purpose, American dance, and he worked with artists no less legendary than he. But for all this, his 1959 autobiography is most notable for being, well, utterly mundane.STEPS IN TIME is essentially a catalogue of the various shows in which Astaire performed, ranging from Vaudeville (with sister Adele) to SILK STOCKINGS with Cyd Charisse. He always loves his leading lady; he always likes his director; even when the show was not as good as it could have been he finds something nice to say about it; and he never, ever offers the least bit of insight into his private life, his work, or the many with whom he worked over the years. Indeed, Astaire actually has more to say about his love of the racetrack than he does about any of his films or specific dance routines.Fans of Astaire and the Hollywood musical will certainly want to read STEPS IN TIME, but even the most ardent fan will likely be disappointed by the superficial quality of the work. One can only hope that a future biographer will give Astaire the full portrait that he himself could not.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"After finding this book in a New York bookstore, I eagerly began reading about my all-time favorite actor. Some of the personal stories about his life and work are interesting and it is fun to hear what he has to say about his success, but that is all. Astaire tells a quick story and then jumps to the next. He does not analyze much about his life, nor does he really get to the root of his personality. But it is hard to criticize such a brilliant man, so I will leave it as that. You will only enjoy this book if you love Fred Astaire as much as I do. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"This book reveals as much about Fred Astaire in what it doesn't say as in what it tells. He was a shy man, of Austrian descent, very little formal education, and was eclipsed by his funny and attractive older sister in his days on the stage. These things shaped him into the perfectionist we saw on film. He had an incredible work ethic and was always looking for a new gimmick or dance style because he was not confident the audiences would keep on coming. He is not a natural story teller and sometimes leaves us wanting to hear more (e.g.can tell you he and a famous person had a lot of laughs together but not what they did or said that was funny). Still it is a good companion to the TV biography the BBC did about him a few years ago. All the best American composers of the day wanted to write for him (He and Gershwin were young unknowns together) and his evolution from vaudeville to Broadway to film happened during key times of all of those media. I do recommend the book if you want to know more about Fred Astaire, but not as a stand-alone source."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"I read this book with the hope of getting some insight into Astaire's personality and non-showbiz life, but was disappointed. I found nothing other than a Wikipedia-type recreating of the highpoints (and occasional lowpoints) of his career. Perhaps this was not a suprise, given that it was an autobiography. However, some autobiographies provide this material. Try reading Oscar Levant's Memoirs of an Amnesiac for a better read. Hopefully, a more complete book on Astaire's life and career will follow."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"It was less than a year ago that STEPS IN TIME was re-published after a long period of being out-of-print. Nobody should be deterred from reading this autobiography of Fred Astaire, if for no other reason that we get the goods from the star himself, written in good plain prose.Having said that, there are some drawbacks to this book. (1) It was published in 1960 and was never amended, even though Astaire lived another twenty-seven years; this was just after Astaire had completed the second of two TV specials for NBC, with dancer Barrie Chase. That leaves almost three decades of Astaire's life undocumented, including his playing in movies and on TV in non-musical roles, his continual coming out of retirement, and his surprising marriage in late life to a horse-jockey-turned-pilot (Robin Astaire).(2) In terms of his basic motivations or what made Fred tick, the reader will come away from this book almost completely baffled. One reason for this is that autobiographies from older stars (and recall that Fred was a vaudeville star of the Twenties) were not written in a confessional mode as they so often are today. As a result, the Fred Astaire who wrote this volume about his life comes very close to the \\"nice guy\\" Astaire of his musicals and other entertainments.(3) For those expecting suspense or drama, a further reason that STEPS IN TIME comes off as bland and uninsightful is that Astaire's life really does seem to be remarkably free of trauma, except for the loss of his sister (and former dance partner) Adele during childbirth and the death of his wife Phyllis to cancer in 1954. Astaire admits to being anguished about his wife's painful and relatively sudden death, but as usual in STEPS IN TIME he puts himself rather quickly into rehearsals for DADDY LONG LEGS(Fox, 1955). However, a quick look at Peter J. Levinson's recent bio PUTTIN' ON THE RITZ reveals co-star Leslie Caron's memory of his crying into a towel during DADDY's production.It appears that Astaire has committed a kind of sin of omission with regard to his emotions. And of course he perpetuated his generation's credo of \\"never complain, never explain\\" or what Astaire, ever the Anglophile, might have called a \\"stiff upper lip.\\" Astaire does admit that he could be grumpy during rehearsals and that, to use today's language, he was a workaholic's workaholic. In STEPS IN TIME he writes frankly about his perfectionism, but (a nice guy to the end) deals with the long, long rehearsal time he insisted on for each role without sounding arrogant or condescending.A useful alternative or companion volume to STEPS IN TIME is Peter J. Levinson's comprehensive PUTTIN' ON THE RITZ, recently published (Spring 2009). Not only do we get the full sweep of Fred Astaire's life, we get honest inquiry into Fred's emotional makeup, or about as much as Fred would allow. Or get the proof straight from the movies: the nine-DVD boxed set with all the Astaire-Rogers RKO musicals of the Thirties is a good place to start. For less money, Astaire's genius is also much on display in EASTER PARADE(1948) or THE BAND WAGON(1953), both out of MGM. These are only a beginning."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"An amazing story told by the man himself!! What an incredible life he led! A must have for any fan! I could not put it down.

This book is Fred-direct: the importance of his personal life, even over career, is paramount. As a read, it's a must for all interested a private man's life in filmed dance. It's completely enjoyable...if not particularly revealing about his art.At the end of the book, Fred mildly mocks the idea of over intellectualizing dance. Other than \\"maintaining the basic principles of balance and grace\\", he even questions a commitment to a particular style. He ends his story simply: \\"I just dance.\\".That's Fred...but all the intensity, work, and preparation, and in his case, worry, that went into the creation of some of the greatest dance of the century...is sublimated in this wonderful book. Fred hardly even notes all the sweat that went into his art. That's Fred too.In the revealing introduction by the lovable, ever feisty, Ginger Rogers, he acknowledges her special, and highly reciprocal role in his career...and he in hers. And, in fact, as in her autobiography, neither of them were ever highly articulate about their art. Who cares?Today we know them from their films...and their artistry will be available to all the generations ahead. In this, their eternal realm, they were, and are, highly articulate...to say the least. \\"Steps in Time\\" and \\"Ginger: My Story\\", just whet the appetite to see the films...and in their chosen milieu...which for both of them...and especially for the solo-Fred...in spite of their considerable acting talents, meant one word...PERFORMANCE."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"Good book by Fred Astair on his life and time.

I remember how he was in London and he had a starring role in a play in 1931--his sister Adele's last year as one half of the duo--and he has to star with Tilly Losch, and other great Astaire stories that make him the Hollywood--and also I'm sure world famous--iconic dancer, actor, and entrepeneur he was. I remember that he opened up the Fred Astaire Dancing School in 1959 in New York an branched out across the country. I live in Freehold, New Jersey--an hour's drive to and/or from NYC--but there just so happens to BE a FADS not ten minutes from my apartment right on Main Street.I'd wanted to try out being a member of the School but a friend convinced me not to do it.Anyway, Fred Astaire, as I found out through this timeless bestseller, knows way more than he does in his movies.

It was really interesting to read about his life, stage, and film career."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"I have been a fan of Fred Astaire since the early 1970s when I stumbled upon \\"Follow the Fleet\\" on television. I saw just about every movie he had made, over the next year or two, and that was before videotapes and dvds or cable television, so I had to catch them whenever they just happened to show up on the few channels we had.I bought a few record albums and books, but I don't remember seeing his autobiography, perhaps it was out of print at that time.When I recently saw that it was available, I couldn't resist. It originally came out in 1959. I'm sure he thought he was finished making musicals by then, but he did make one more, \\"Finian's Rainbow\\" in 1968, plus some non-musicals up to 1981.The book covers all those fascinating decades after the turn of the century (he was born in 1899) including vaudeville, Broadway, and the films of the art deco era.Astaire was lauded as being the greatest dancer, most influential, one-of-a-kind, a perfectionist.The great songwriters of his time preferred for him to introduce their new songs in his films.He was an innovator in American men's fashion.And, most endearing, his life was free from scandal; he was described as kind, gentle, shy and self-effacing. I have never heard of anyone saying a bad thing about him.The reader gets a feeling of this down-to-earth personality in the pages of his book.One warning, however, after reading this autobiography I had the urge to see all the films again and ended up purchasing every single Astaire musical, including several which I had to settle for on VHS tape.There is a great boxed set available of the Fred and Ginger movies. I wish someone would do the same with the complete collection of Astaire musicals. It would be better than a bottle of Prozac. Whenever I watch Fred Astaire I just can't stop smiling. And this book had the same effect."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"I polished off this book in a matter of a week! Astaire's style in enjoyable, quick-witted and an overall delight.

Now that movie musicals are dead, proven by the born-dead &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; no one is ever likely to surpass Astaire or even come close. Astaire tells his story in a disarmingly modest and self-deprecating way. He never says an unkind word about anyone. Does this make for a boring book? On the contrary, what you see on the screen is what you get in this book. You can hear his very voice telling the story."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"This book is actually one big anecdote, peppered with little things like Mr. A's first punch, trying to figure out a title for the book, and meeting his wife, Phyllis.However, Fred Astaire does not offer much insight on how he got from point A to Z, or what made him do this and that. In other words, people who want the whys (and plan to psychoanalyze Mr. A's actions) will not find what they are looking for.It's still a great read though, and real entertaining."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"I enjoyed reading this book immensely. I've been a huge fan of Fred Astaire since my childhood years. His movies were on TV lots back then in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He even had his own TV show for a time. In later years, as my daughter grew up, I shared Astaire's movies with her and she became a big fan as well. It cemented our relationship for many years as I collected videos of all his movies and she checked them off a comprehensive list I had created for her. As a matter of fact, she just gave me this book for my 62nd birthday. I had no idea that Fred had written an autobiography.So, what is great about this book? It is written by Fred himself, without a ghost writer. As you are reading it, you can easily envision Fred talking about himself. I've seen interviews of him on TV, and the book vividly emulates how he spoke in those interviews. His warm personality, humility, desire to stay out of the limelight, and tendency to say the best he can about everyone he encounters shines through the book. If you are looking for a book where celebrities are slammed, this isn't it; not even close. I did read the other reviews and noted that some complained that he gave no insight into his feelings about others and skimmed over unpleasant details. I felt more like the book mirrored his philosophy of life; sure, sometimes things don't go as you would have liked them to, but there is much to be thankful for and much to appreciate. I view his autobiography as a celebration of his experiences and the good things he has lived to enjoy.He deals head on with Phyllis' death, Adele's children lost in childhood, his close relationship with his mother, sister, wife, and many others in his life. Let's look at how he closes the book for a glimpse of how he writes and of the man:\\"When you come to the evolution of the dance, its history and philosophy, I know as much about that as I do a about how a television tube produces a picture -- which is absolutely nothing. I don't know how it all started and I don't want to know. I have no desire to prove anything by it. I have never used it as an outlet or as a means of expressing myself.I just dance.\\"If you are much younger than me or have had no awareness of Fred Astaire, this book would most likely be a total bore for you. I can fully understand that reality. The book is more precisely targeted for people of my generation and older. But if you like his movies and appreciate his many talents, then I heartily recommend the book to you without hesitation. It is frustrating that it was written in 1959 and, by necessity, has nothing of the last 28 years of his life. But, it does contain a forward written by Ginger Rogers in 1980. Finally, as a special bonus for me, he dedicates the book to his cousin and to Omaha, Nebraska, my home for 28 of my 62 years and his home for the first four and a half years of his life."},{"Title":"Steps in time","review":"When I read an autobiography of a great person I look for insights into: What makes this person great? What specifically has he done, and what experiences and thought processes has he undergone, that shaped him to be the master of his domain? This is what makes a great autobiography fascinating. You search not only for WHAT he's saying, but also HOW is he saying it. Not only what he's done, but how he got there and his thoughts about it.Unfortunately, in this book Fred Astaire offers no such insights. This book is filled with facts that are largely uninteresting to me - on this and that date he met Mr. So and So and did such and such movie with such and such lovely star with such and such lovely songs by such and such great composer through such and such studio.... Brief, factual stories.These facts have their value, and his fans might want to know them, but when they make up an entire book without offering any further depth, I cannot but end up feeling dissatisfied and wanting for more.He does offer one clue though, on the final page. In it he tells us that he wanted to keep the \\"basic principles of balance and grace\\" of ballet, but felt \\"there should be no limitations\\".

It was originally published in 1981 in Chinese, and was translated into English, and presumably updated, in 1994. I will review this book as someone with a personal rather than academic interest in the topic. I adopted a second daughter from China. While we were in China, the Han Chinese took great pains to point out that my daughter was not Han, but a member of one of China's recognized 55 ethnic minorities.This was based on her appearance, and they did not know to what group she belonged. I have been attempting to find information on this topic ever since, and it is sparse. This book is really a survey of all 55 recognized ethnic groups by a group of social scientists.Each ethnic group got four or five pages to discuss their general location and distribution within China, their language(s) and language groups, customs and traditions, costume descriptions, socioeconomic situation and history. The history sections were somewhat marred by the occasional jarring lapse into Communist propaganda language, and the use of the Communist model to describe their situation today (post liberation) and to describe religious practices. This made me suspicious of some of the modern statistics re: their current health, education and wealth which are in direct contradiction to less biased sources.However, compared to many Chinese publications, the language was pretty tame. They had 33 glossy color photos which were nice, but incomplete, and a map with the groups distribution which was again incomplete, and a chart which compared each group with their language family, location and date of establishment(?).All in all, a helpful, interesting but somewhat out-of-date, biased and incomplete resource."},{"Title":"The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology - Soprano Book only (Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology (Songbooks))","review":"Just to clarify, each of these volumes is for a different voice type.

O'Murchu has clarified in writing what I have instinctively, intuitively felt for decades but could not express as eloquently as he. Quantum Theology has resurrected what I thought was my spiritually dead self.It is difficult reading, but well worth the effort. I find myself looking at the universe and life from a new and refreshing perspective.Randy Herring's review must have been written by an intellectual show-off. One of the major premises of the book is not how one deals with the world, but rather, how the world deals with us. Our control is imaginary and our understanding ridiculously lacking, and that was one of O'Murchu's major points."},{"Title":"Evolutionary Faith: Rediscovering God in Our Great Story","review":"This is an excellent wedding of science and theology. Far too long have we seen the struggle between the two for gaining real insights to understand more clearly our lifelong responsibilities to ourselves and our environment. The author clearly puts this before us giving us a more complete story that is both current and credible. As he states \\"it is time to embrace the cosmic and planetary context within which our life story and the story of all life unfolds. We belong to a reality greater than ourselves, and it is within that enlarged context that we will rediscover the benign mystery within which everything is endowed with purpose and meaning.\\" This book will give you the satisfaction that comes with understanding how everything is connected. This is a short book that is worth more than many volumes."},{"Title":"Evolutionary Faith: Rediscovering God in Our Great Story","review":"This is a very informative book, since the author spreads his net far and wide as is obvious from the biliography. His views are novel and interesting, but definitely part company with Teilhard de Chardin and traditional theism. Pere Teilhard's vision is convergent; O'Murchu's is divergent. He presents us with a universe having no beginning and no end. Also, God exists within this universe, but not outside it. These two concepts are consistent with pantheism. A more traditional and more awe-inspiring view is that the universe exists within God.Pere Teilhard's system focuses on the Omega point as the point of convergence for all evolution and all space-time. This is really missing from O'Murchu, since his universe never really gets to Omega."},{"Title":"Evolutionary Faith: Rediscovering God in Our Great Story","review":"O'Murchu's 'Evolutionary Faith' is not an easy read in that it requires a fully attentive mind to assimilate the full extent and depth of its message. And that message, conveyed through the medium of unfolding story, is that we belong and can only authentically live out our lives, in the context of our planetary and cosmic home. Unless or until we make a spiritual homecoming to this mystical 'place' of belonging at the heart of creation, and learn to listen, love and grow in congruence with its meaning for our lives (God's primary and ultimate revelation), we will forever flounder in our misguided will to power, arrogance, control and domination. From his seminal work, \\"Quantum Theology\\" to his most recent, \\"Christianity's Dangerous Memory\\", O'Murchu's writing has the quality of a profound quest . . and what this cutting-edge thinker has to say, he says exquisitely, compellingly and prophetically. Highly recommended for the discerning reader who has an interest in evolutionary theology's interface with science."},{"Title":"Evolutionary Faith: Rediscovering God in Our Great Story","review":"This is just a note to acknowledge that the review entitled \\"Non-Teilhardian and pantheistic\\" was submitted by me before I became Amazon's Maltese Falcon."},{"Title":"Evolutionary Faith: Rediscovering God in Our Great Story","review":"This book reads more like Thus Spoke O'Murchu with a flavor of a romantic Hegelian collective Spirit of optimism. O'Murchu is his own sage with a message addressed to the mystics of a &quot;new cosmology&quot; who are sufferers in this crisis of nihilism that &quot;globalization&quot; has created. O'Murchu's greatest trouble is his &quot;relational matrix&quot; and his greatest weight his &quot;powerful archetypes.&quot; The ideas of &quot;relational matrix&quot; and &quot;powerful archetypes&quot; complicate the &quot;great story&quot; turning it upside down by not being able to reconcile this contradiction he advances as &quot;evolutionary faith.&quot;O'Murchu fails to define what he means by 'matrix.' Thus, arises O'Murchu's three gravest flaws: 1) failing to define 'matrix,' 2) failing by assuming one knows what the conventional definition of 'matrix' entails, and 3) failing to clarify his meaning of intentionality, except within his symbolism of &quot;Divine relationality.&quot; O'Murchu stupidly leaves the definition of 'matrix' open-ended, which allows the reader to pursue for further investigation. A 'matrix,' to this reviewer, is a system and a closure that &quot;out of the womb within&quot; encircles the relationality of the development of a &quot;stereotype!&quot; Words develop with a purpose: for use and relationality. It is out of the womb that one sees things from within one's own perimeters, i.e., a system, a closure of how one &quot;deals&quot; with the world.O'Murchu's &quot;relational matrix&quot; adds to the &quot;great deal of baggage&quot; that he admonishes we ought &quot;to shed!&quot; If evolutionary faith is faith directed by the drive of evolutionary process of 'becoming' then a matrix makes evolutionary faith incapable of possessing that drive of intoxicating energy for becoming. Without a matrix, one's consciousness is strong because it is free from any kind of relational comparison, and thus, extols one's capacity and need for communication relating with others! The weakness of consciousness vis-&agrave;-vis a matrix only increases the greatest weight of nihilistic &quot;globalization&quot; that O'Murchu opposes. Thus, the &quot;archetype&quot; (below) of a &quot;new cosmology&quot; to thwart the furtherance of &quot;globalization&quot; is of no consequence.O'Murchu carries more baggage (his greatest trouble) than he can handle (his greatest weight). Contrary to his own intentions O'Murchu posits his antithesis: another form of &quot;globalization&quot; masked by &quot;evolutionary faith.&quot; The &quot;relational matrix&quot; is &quot;globalization&quot; because both are systems of oppression of adding to the baggage O'Murchu admits he does not want. O'Murchu's relational matrix does not come full circle of embracing the mysticism of a &quot;new cosmology&quot; and thus, does not toss &quot;globalization&quot; to the wayside.O'Murchu crushes under his own weight trying to convince us he seeks to eradicate the dualistic religion and science futuristic tendencies of &quot;gloom and doom.&quot; It is in fact the same tendencies he embraces by introducing his &quot;new cosmology&quot; of light as an &quot;archetype&quot; that opposes the &quot;globalization&quot; of darkness, that is, the recurrence of the same dualistic notion of good versus evil! O'Murchu is more religious and Christian he gives himself credit for. Thus Spoke O'Murchu!O'Murchu digs his own crevasse, falls into it and becomes wedged in his story of evolutionary faith. O'Murchu brings man down with his own god and goes under himself! This 'O'Murchu event' triggers a cataclysmic recurrence of the same yet to be reconciled under its own crushing weight (the &quot;great story&quot;). O'Murchu leaves us confronted with a yet undiscovered country whose boundaries nobody has surveyed. It is an undiscovered country beyond all the lands and nooks of Thus Spoke O'Murchu. It is a world so overrich in what is beautiful, strange, questionable, terrible, and divine.The &quot;new cosmology&quot; is more daring perhaps than is prudent. Thus, O'Murchu's greatest weight of recurrence is turned upside down repeatedly in the same succession and sequence. O'Murchu desires nothing new but every pain and every joy and every thought to add to the greatest trouble in reconciling the greatest weight with the &quot;great story&quot; he calls evolutionary faith. Thus Spoke O'Murchu!"},{"Title":"God and the cosmologists","review":"In God and the Cosmologists (Washington: Regnery Gateway, c. 1989), Stanley L. Jaki continues his quest to tie together contemporary physics and traditional theology, insisting that \\"All great philosophical systems have been cosmologies\\" (p. ix). In his judgment, modern science facilitates the articulation of classical metaphysics. \\"True metaphysics implies series of assertions about a Reality beyond the universe, as the cause of the reality of the universe itself\\" (p. 84).To do this, the reigning ideology of the past few centuries, loosely waving the Enlightenment flag, must be suitably buried. This means, especially, the final internment of Immanuel Kant, who exacted from his followers \\"the highest price that any rationalist philosopher can demand. The price was the universe\\" (p. 11). Kant did so in order to construct a universe in his own mind. Amazingly, he was \\"so self-centered as to write repeatedly, 'I am God,' in his last great work, the Opus postumum\\" (p. 12).Repudiating Kant, Jaki obviously aligns himself with philosophical realism, a stance he contends science dictates. Furthermore--coming to the thesis of the book--the universe, inescapably and objectively real, also points \\"beyond its specific phases to an origin which has to be a factor metaphysically beyond the universe\\" (p. 52). Given the specificity and contingency of the universe, cosmological analyses and hypotheses and assertions are necessary.There are those, of course, who fault any effort to make sense of the universe. One logical positivist, H. Reichenbach, insisted: \\"'We have no absolutely conclusive evidence that there is a physical world, and we have no absolutely conclusive evidence either that we exist'\\" (p. 224). Such allegedly \\"scientific\\" notions are easily popularized, so that M. Esslin, describing our era, can say: \\"'Suddenly man sees himself faced with a universe that is both frightening and illogical--in a word, absurd. All assurances of hope, all explanations of ultimate meaning have suddenly been unmasked as nonsensical illusions, empty chatter, whistling in the dark'\\" (p. 215).Standing against such cosmic anguish, Jaki insists that we take common, ordinary events and experiences as realities which, rightly understood, point toward eternal realities. Thus, with the poet Robert Browning, we can declare: \\"This world's no blot for us, / Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good: / To find its meaning is my meat and drink\\" (p. 201).The essays collected in this volume help us do precisely that."},{"Title":"The science of being","review":"This book is inspiring.

Drawing on strains of thought from philosophy, psychology, poetry and a little dose of humor from pop-culture icons in the Simpson's TV series he weaves together a fine vision of what Unitarian Universalism strives for: a grand synthesis of religious ideas from the diversity of human culture. Grigg even includes a chapter for \\"A Contrarian Interlude\\" where he critiques his own book and answers possible objections.In 100 pages, including informative footnotes on sources, Richard Grigg has given us a wonderfully compact, yet substantive book on contemporary UU thought."},{"Title":"To Re-Enchant the World: A Philosophy of Unitarian Universalism","review":"Unitarian Universalism is a small but influential religious movement in the United States and Europe. However, Griggs convincingly argues that given the desecularizationof the U.S., Unitarian Universalism - with its emphasis on an individual's right to determine her own religious beliefs and the belief that we can all view the sacred - provides a powerful religious vision for this culture. While not explicitly arguing from a Universalist perspective, I believe Grigg's book is a contemporary call to return to a more Universalist philosophy - that all religious communities can provide insight to the sacred and that we can create sacred spaces in our community for others to share - though the space may be sacred for different reasons.

The author makes a point of balancing the historical homophobic rhetoric with some wonderful surviving odes to male-male love. I felt informed and empowered. While I can't debate this book on scholarly terms, I can tell you how good it feels to know that some of the most homophobic of early Christian writers also thought rabbits pooped once a year and that hyenas changed sexes. They know not of what they speak! This book doesn't get into the why's of homophobia, but the context and history of it are well presented.

In a way, of course, what the ancients thought is truly irrelvant today. Our world is so unlike theirs, one of them transported by time machine into the year 2001would hardly recognize he was still on earth and that these current day creatures were descendants of his. And yet interest in the ancients has survived, perhaps for that very reason. For one of the big differences is how sexuality and homosexuality are viewed. That the ancients had different ideas is a reminder that the notions conventional culture takes are time-bound and arbitrary. And that's good news for people dealing with the misunderstandings of modern, Christian-influenced society. Puterbaugh presents a wealth of quotes and references and does a creditable job of explaining them in context. That homosexuality isn't such a new thing is not surprising. But understanding what that means in context often remains elusive. Things were just so different back then.Geoff Puterbaugh helps make it all make sense. The book is interesting, informative, and readable. And it's a nice addition to the library of books about the historical bases of gay consciousness.This review originally appeared in White Crane Journal..."},{"Title":"The Crucifixion of Hyacinth: Jews, Christians, and Homosexuals from Classical Greece to Late Antiquity","review":"Most of the books I have read on the subject of antique sexuality were written under the aspect of socioeconomic analysis. There is an undeniable connection between, say, dowry customs and liberality in the practice of sexual orientations, or between inheritable land and the required virginity of a bride. Matriarchal societies don't allow the male to inherit land, his wife is subject to visits from her husband on the premises of her own clan, but the couple never moves in together, and the bride's clan pays a recompense for the time of his absence from his own people. There is an incentive here, to look for more than one sexual outlet and it is generally accepted. Systems of this kind seem to have evolved from prehistoric agriculture and matrilinear bronze-age dynasties. Evidence for a &quot;patriarchal revolution&quot; that finally overturned the old establishment has left traces not only in classic literature and the Bible: the Amarna tablets testify to upheavals among pastoral Canaanites who are depicted more like social outcasts than a separate tribe or invading nation. The movement finally carried the day against their urban masters -- or rather mistresses -- and that may explain the fanaticism and retentive taboos of the early Hebraic religion, when grumpy old Yahweh still had many peers. The Bible can be read in many ways, it also is a warcry for male dominance (Gen. 2:21), and yes, in many places it is a testimony to homophobia. In Greece and Italy the situation was not very much different from Palestine. Patriarchs took the helm and remodelled the economy and their sex-life, but with a significant difference: in Palestine the Jews had always been a minority surrounded by matriarchs; in Italy and Greece only two matriarchal enclaves survived the early iron-age: the Etruscans and the Spartans. Both were feared by their neighbors for their warlike prowess and very little understood socially. In Palestine the pressure created a need for fanaticism and monotheistic unity. In Greece and Rome fanatic asceticism was confined to the mystery cults -- the official line was a laid back polytheism. Therefore I was surprised that the author had missed his most important link in his presentation of pagan asceticism: the Orphic cult, which at Europe's Mediterranean shores was the first to introduce the ideals of chastity, asceticism and taboos on homosexuality. It was a widespread undercurrent of classical culture, much more popular and influential than any single philosopher. Mr. Puterbaugh's assessment of Plato and Socrates, is, by and large, based on Popper, but I think Plato was too much of an aristocrat ever to leave the boys alone. Only after Viagra couldn't have done its thing anymore he wrote the &quot;Laws&quot; and turned completely into a fascist prig, who not only frowned on homosexuality, but recommended inquisitions, star chambers, secret trials, censorship and euthanasia. And this is a connection which should concern everyone of us: A sexually intolerant legislation ALWAYS comes with some sort of totalitarian agenda. How the historical Socrates fits into this picture is a matter of opinion. This smug enemy of Athens' democracy has never been my favorite saint, and on his trial the court jester and protege of the 30 tyrants had it coming. (Just imagine, with nothing on your mind but minding your own business, you suddenly find yourself cornered by Socrates and his aristocratic companions who jeer him on to humiliate you in a dialectical cat-and-mouse game of leading questions. Who would not be fed up and pay back?) On the whole Mr. Puterbaugh's exposition of pederasty and homosexuality as an accepted practise from Homer's time up to the closing of Roman male-brothels is accurate, very true -- and nothing new. Which is a shame: after two centuries of competent scholarship on the subject, the facts still need to reach a wider audience, and this is what the author had set out to do, before he could move on to his indictment of the one agent who has caused the modern homophobia in legislation and public perception. So Puterbaugh's attack on Philo and Clement struck me first as unfairly hostile. The reason is something, I should be ashamed of: I have read of Philo only &quot;De Legatione&quot; and of Clement only a few Gnostic bits and pieces of a more benign nature. So it is easy to be tolerant simply out of ignorance. Things look different if you speak for a mistreated minority.But the last quarter of the book really wraps it up. The evidence from late Roman legislation and its enforcement is the darkest thing I have read for a long time. Of course it was part of my job description to know these things, but they use to come in a more diluted form, as dissipated details of a wider picture, easily lost in a flood of trivia. And after all, empires don't fall for simple causes, or do they? Laws and regulations tell us what people think and fear, and sometimes it is good to remember what &quot;history&quot; meant for a Roman: the &quot;custom of nations.&quot; When bundled up in this concentrated form as presented here, I really wonder how anybody can propose that history would have taken a similar turn if there had been no Church and no Christian religion. This was more than an instrumental coincidence, this was the ecclesiastical impact on actual legislation, for crying out loud; it motivated perfectly decent people to commit atrocities on a colossal scale and then successfully anesthetized the conscience of the perpetrators. Times were different then, true enough, but what we see here is a deliberate effort to switch off the lights, and from the result, one must say, they succeeded. Ancient civilization may have ended anyway, but not like this. If you expected a quick review on ancient sexual practices and what changed it, prepare yourself for more than you had bargained for -- 177 pages brimming full of facts.

It's a &quot;can't put it down&quot; novel. Great job Gladys."},{"Title":"River of Our Return","review":"Though this is an historical novel, its themes are timeless. The simple search for human connectedness is beautifully drawn here. Smith is a gifted writer with a real ear for language. I hope she writes many more wonderful stories! It was especially great to meet such a strong female character as Hattie. The wilderness settings really came alive for me too. I hated to see it end!"},{"Title":"Ancestors in Search of Human Origins","review":"Although this book is the \\"companion\\" to the Nova TV series it stands well on its own, in a conversational style. The book does a good job of introducing human ancestors, starting with Lucy - the female Australophitcus afarensis, that launched Dr. Johanson's career and fame. Perhaps what the book does best, is introduce the study of paleoanthropology and archeology by presenting both sides of topics. For example: did modern humans all came out of Africa or evolve in separate places throughout Europe and China?; when and why did hominids first walk on two legs (scavenger or hunter)?; are Neanderthal's our ancestors? He presents how studying anatomy helps understand the physical changes needed to walk on two feet and to give birth to a large brained baby. He also introduces the recent idea of \\"experimental archeology\\" that conducts trials on current landscapes or prey to see how early hominids may have lived. At the time of the book were the beginnings of studies with mitochondrial DNA. His conclusion about the birth of art, may be tentative, but should provoke interesting thoughts. If you can see the TV special, it also includes conveys a better feel of the conditions the archeologists are working under, and also vintage film of some of the finds."},{"Title":"Ancestors in Search of Human Origins","review":"As a companion book to a NOVA is was well made. Wonderful cover, tons of photos, many in color, good paper, and Donald Johanson and Lenora Johanson, with help from Blake Edgar, are wonderful authors. They know how to bring a story to life, to make you feel the heat, the sand in your shoes, the people they meet.The only real problem with it all is it was published in 1994 right on the edge of the next stage of revolutionary discoveries that will rock the very foundations of anthropology. The information collected since then, the ideas that have been born, lived, and died. Our knowledge about Neanderthals alone has shot off like a rocket. Just this YEAR alone, we have learned about the DNA within ourselves that came from them. And also found artwork by them in Spain!So, it you wish to bring yourself up to date here is some books I would suggest.First, a old one to read isThe Hunters or the Hunted?: An Introduction to African Cave Taphonomywhich is also cited in the book. I would also readFrom Lucy To Languagewhich is a wonderful book that allows you to see the fossils themselves. For the DNA side of the history of humankind I would suggest bothThe Journey of Man: A Genetic OdysseyandThe Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry. To round it out, to fill in the details, I would also suggestExtinct Humans, along withThe Mind in the Cave: Consciousness and the Origins of Artand the newestWhat Does It Mean to Be Human?. Funny enough, even they are outdated by this year's discoveries."},{"Title":"We have met the enemy, and they are partly right","review":"So why did Tony Campolo write this book? One could infer it was to point out that Christians are wrong and materialists are valid in their criticisms. I couldn't decide whether to give this book a 2 or 3 star rating because the conclusion of his book is not really valid and he credits the critics more than he does the saints. I rated it slightly higher due to the historical data he presents. It's the analysis with which I disagree.The strongest part of the book is the beginning. He paints the scene of how radically the Protestant Reformation changed European culture. &quot;Protestantism left no room for superstition or magic, but rather made reasonableness virtue,&quot; he writes. He goes on to point out that the Reformers viewed all work as a holy calling, i.e., the &quot;priesthood of the believer.&quot; It's toward the end where his argument breaks down. He fails to make a successful case."},{"Title":"Wings","review":"This rendition of Daedalus and Icarus cemented this tale as one of my favorites in mythology. Yolen, as always, tells the story for young and old so all may enjoy it. Nolan's illustrations help me understand why Icarus wants to fly so high into the beautiful sky. I recommend this book for anyone wanting a good story, especially if you are fascinated by mythology."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"I only paid a few dollars for this book but was led to believe it was in \\"gently used\\" condition, instead it had many pages ripped out as well as all the Maps. I suppose it was a fan price but sure would have been nice to have been told so much was missing out of the book, the maps I now will have to buy again."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"I've used this guide for three PR vacations, and each time I want to throw it across the hotel room. But I can't because the other guides are even worse or even less comprehensive. What's the problem with this one? The lack of description: it gives you no feel as to what makes each beach/hotel unique. Invariably every second beach is summed up vaguely as 'one of the best beaches on the island,' even if one has brownish sand and no snorkling while another &quot;best&quot; beach is pristine white, loaded with fish, and secluded. It's the same with hotels, too, except there's no explanation of what the mood is like there, what kind of people stay there, what the view is like, what the rooms are like, if there's a bar to hang out in after dinner, how close the beach is.... It's almost comic, except when you're trying to figure out where to spend your precious time and money.Another frustrating problem is that no one took the time to edit this guide. One beach or hotel will be mentioned in two (or three) places in entirely different tones, so it's hard to guess whether a place is just wacky or dirty (or, in the instance of La Parguera, too polluted to swim in one mention; just fine in another). Also, uninspired writing means a breathtaking mountain retreat like the Casa Grande Hotel in Utuado comes across as completely unremarkable and possibly worth skipping. Can't the writers come out and say &quot;This place is great&quot; or, if necessary, &quot;This place is a dump?&quot; A reader might wonder if these guys visited anything but bloated resorts at all. PR deserves better and I certainly expected better from Frommer's."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"My husband and I purchased this book to go on our honeymoon and were sorely disappointed. The descriptions were vague and often downright incorrect. Luquillo beach, which the authors described as one of the best beaches in the Carribean, had dingy grey water and was filled with garbage. This is only one example of many many misrepresentations. The guide leaned almost exclusively to very expensive restaurants, and even these were nothing to write home about. We had more luck after we ditched the guide and started exploring on our own. Its one good point was some interesting background on the history of Puerto Rico. However, this was not enough to make me buy another Frommer's guide."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"This is a good guide for seeing the cultural sights of Puerto Rico, especially in San Juan. The book is geared towards travellers only moderately concerned with budget. A few pieces of information are outdated, such as bus numbers and changes in price, but the numbering system (up to three stars) is useful for the first-time traveller with little knowledge of the country. Detailed descriptions of the sights in San Juan help visitors get a sense of the city's history while the walking tour takes them around to key spots. There is a comparable walking tour of Ponce, along with a description of the Museo de Arte de Ponce which prevented me from missing out on this fine museum. Ponce is the only place where we tried one of the listed hotels. Although the book described Hotel Belgica as \\"roughing it,\\" we thought the accommodations were fine and enjoyed the unusual atmosphere of an old-style hotel. The book is full of useful tidbits. For example, en route to Parguera (which should get two stars, not one), the name of the road changes several times along the way (101, 116, 315, 305, 304). No wonder people get confused. Additional information: The book should include a warning that the $5 boat trip to the Phosphorescent Bay near Parguera doesn't let you see much, so it's best to go with the friendly folks at Paradise Scuba Center (the address is listed). Additionally, the Rio Camuy Cave Park sometimes sells out of tickets by 9am (especially on weekends), so it's best to get there early. Finally, good snorkeling is available in San Juan on the west side of the Wyndham Hotel (Condado)."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"I keep forgetting how much I don't care for Frommer's guides and wind up buying another one.1. Frommer's has next to no pictures.2. I think somebody went to a couple of random restaurants and beaches and decided to call them the \\"Best of\\".For example, Frommer's says there is snorkeling at Luqillo beach, but there is none (unless all you want to see is sand). Luquillo is a great beach for swimming, but the snorkeling sucks.Another example is the restaurant in the southeast part of the island called Tulio's. While it is a nice restaurant and our food was good, it is not cheap. At least I don't consider $20 a plate cheap."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"Some maps in the guide don't reflect current reality eg the pull out map shows a major highway on the SE coast. However construction projects for many sections of that highway (Rt 53) have not yet commenced.In general we had problems navigating because every map we picked up from guidebooks and tourist brochures was wrong, each in its own special way! If driving, do yourself a favor and buy a very detailed and up-to-date map before you head out."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"This book is unbelievably useless. The descriptions are vague or plain wrong, beaches described as great for snorkeling are shallow, murky, full of sea weed and almost fish-free, whereas quaint fishing villages are hideously cramped tourist traps. Restaurants with bad, expensive food are considered good value and derelict hotels are deemed luxurious and comfortable. One of the weirdest descriptions is that of the Blue Marlin Bar and Restaurant in Guanica ,which serves nasty, greasy snacks and remarkably tasteless fish, while facing a bay marred by an ugly and gigantic industrial structure : \\"excellent local meals\\", \\"overlooking the pretty bay\\", \\"tasty snacks\\", etc. But the most surreal is the one of the pool at the Casa Islena Inn, a very nice hotel in Rincon, as \\"Olympic-size\\". The pool is very pretty and has a gorgeous view, but it is much smaller than an Olympic pool or even the one at my home in the US. Check this photo of it:[...]Based on these and other glaring errors, I can only conclude that Mr. Marino has never been to most places listed in the book. Or to Puerto Rico. This book is a rip-off. Shame on Frommer's."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"We travelled all over the island for 13 days and found that Frommer's information is wrong way too often. Luquillo Beach is very comfortable for swimming, but, like most (or may be all) public beaches in PR closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Parador Guajataca is a terrible place, except for the view. Some beaches described as \\"one of the best\\" are hardly accessible by 4WD. Many restaurants mentioned in the book are overpriced and many hotels overrated. The book does not mention that El Yunque forest is awfully crowded at the height of the season. I was surprised to find out that the book has been written by someone who lives in PR. The book seems to escape any editing, some sentences are repeated twice on the same pages. Unfortunately, I can't recommend anything better."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"I was very disappointed with this book and agree with many of the other reviewers. The lack of descriptions led to much confusion, and I also wonder if the author visited any of the places written or just made it up. Luckily, prior to visiting Puerto Rico, I had checked Tripadvisor reviews, asked friends from Puerto Rico for advice, and used travel websites for reviews and more information. It seemed that virtually every restaurant recommended in the book had horrible reviews at Tripadvisor. Not mediocre, but, downright terrible in many cases. The same was true for the hotels recommended. Overpriced, lousy service, mediocre food for restaurants recommended and these places are not inexpensive.I understand that things can change, such as management etc from the time the book is written to publication time, however, there are so many poor recommendations that just don't agree at all with what the general public has to say, it makes you wonder just how old his information is or if it's valid at all.Not trustworthy!"},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"I was very disappointed in the amount of detail offered in this travel guide. We stayed in Luquillo Beach and the review offered a description of two local restaurants but omitted an entire mall of about twenty restaurants. We didn't \\"discover\\" them until the lasts night of our trip. The pull out map is so vague in detail that it adds to a traveler's confusion. It offers a nice perspective before you go but it should not be used for actual navigation. I also found the layout of the area description non-intuitive. I often read a description of an activity or restaurant only to find that it was two hours away. I think perhaps they tried to cover too much in one book and thus the lack of any useful detail."},{"Title":"Frommer's Puerto Rico","review":"very infomative! Great travel tips.

It's excellent researched and good writen - the author has viewed most of them personally. There is also a included list of poe-inspired films, poe-films by country of origin, poe titles and films adapted from them and a bibliography. In one word: a reference source book. The only negative point is perhaps the only small amount of pictures."},{"Title":"R.S.V.P.","review":"This short story collection starts off great. The first story by Dominique Adair has it all -- it's hot, sexy, great characters (Blue - sigh), sensual, realistic plot obstacle and credible reactions to the obstacle. The second story, \\"Love and Kinks\\" by Madeline Oh, didn't fare as well in my opinion. It's the first story I've read by Ms. Oh so I can't tell if the writing style for this story is her usual one or if it was part of the overall package. It makes a difference because the story felt too oh-so-polite-but-naughty British mannered. If that's the style she's going for in this particular story, that's fine, though the characters felt more like a naughty parody of sexy Brits than real people. If this is her normal writing style, it's not my cup of tea. The third story, South Beach Submissive, was much better than I initially anticipated. I can't quite tell you why I thought the story was going to be a disappointment -- the premise was perfectly fine and there were no warning bells in the characters -- but I was very happy just the same to find that the story held together well, the sex was great and the hero is yummy. I'm definitely putting their other compilations on my Amazon wish list. I only hope I like Oh's stories better next time."},{"Title":"R.S.V.P.","review":"Hard to put down!!!

A surprising aspect of the book is the hand written style of the content. It makes you feel like you are reading the author's notes on the subject. The charts and descriptions are exacting and indispensable when trying to determine the variations and rarity of these coins."},{"Title":"United States copper cents, 1816-1857","review":"This is an important book for collectors with a particular interest in large cents. It is very likely that such collectors will have the book before they find it on Amazon. If you have only a casual interest in these coins, this book is probably not for you. Having said that I can report that I do not have a special interest in these particular coins, but I have a copy of the book and enjoy it. Of course I have had it for more than 30 years and, frankly, I often like the books as well (or better) than the coins. I guess that defines another category of person who might like this book! After writing the above, I picked up my copy of the classic Penny Whimsy and learned that the Newcomb book was first published in 1944. That is very interesting to me. There cannot have been very many numismatic books published in the heart of World War II! This also brings up the point that if you want to have an historic reference on large cents, start with Penny Whimsy. Not only is it a classic, it can be found at much lower prices than Newcomb (get Newcomb too if you like of course, but start with Sheldon (Penny Whimsey)."},{"Title":"United States copper cents, 1816-1857","review":"This volume picks up where Whimsy leaves off.

Classics are VERY hard to find in the world of pet care books, because usually the information is out of date by the time the book is published, or it's just written very dryly. However, this book--originally published in 1972 and reprinted in 1980--still stands up over the course of the years. Housing, Feeding, Habits are especially well done. What is really impressive is a small course on genetics that made more sense than any biology class I've ever taken! One of the few books on guinea pigs written by an American--which means more space devoted to cavy care than cavy shows, since shows are far more poular in Engalnd than in the US. No, it's not a comphrehensive book by any means and the photographs are of average quality for the most part, but still a good book to add to your library if you keep guinea pigs, even after all these years."},{"Title":"Horace Greeley: Champion of American Freedom","review":"Robert C. Williams' \\"Horace Greeley\\" is an engaging and very readable historical narrative that is as much about the times and tribulations of mid-nineteenth century America as it is about its underappreciated subject, Horace Greeley. This book will appeal to anyone interested in pre-Civil War America. The decades culminating in the Civil War were extremely turbulent as the nation searched its soul for a consensus on the vaguely- defined \\"freedoms\\" promised by our Founding Fathers. Greeley was in the thick of this volatile political and moral debate, earnestly seeking ways to avoid the coming \\"irrepressible conflict.\\"Horace Greeley was a kind of 19th century \\"zelig,\\" an opinion-leader who played an influential role in virtually every political and social movement of the mid-1800s. But Greeley was more than a bit player to the leading actors of his day. He was a bold and innovative journalist who molded the modern newspaper. While considered one of the founders of the Republican Party and a political kingmaker, he ran for president against Grant in 1872 in perhaps one of the most unusual and fascinating presidential elections in American history.The author deserves high praise for debunking many myths surrounding Greeley's alleged eccentricities, stereotypes that often originated from the distortions of his mudslinging rivals. The author's dispassionate analysis, rooted in a deep understanding of the political and social crosscurrents of the era, succeeds in putting Greeley's seemingly contradictory stances and actions in an understandable context.This is a very accessible and enjoyable read, betraying none of the dry or plodding style of some specialized history. The author's depth of knowledge and scrupulous research is evident on every page."},{"Title":"Horace Greeley: Champion of American Freedom","review":"A fine life of a fascinating and, it seems, often infuriating man.

Many sentences and ideas are repeated. Overall, I was not impressed. The author often tells things in a bizarre order. Introducing someone and in the same sentence telling you how and when they die. Reading this you appreciate the abilities of authors like Goodwin and McCullough etc. Greeley's life comes across as boring for much of the book. I wish there was a better book on him"},{"Title":"Ruling Passions: Political Offices and Democratic Ethics","review":"Andrew Sabl has written that most unusual of documents: a book on political theory that will be of real use to those who actually practice politics, including those of us who exercise the supreme office of citizen and voter. Facing squarely the problems set by the existence of real moral disagreements and the real contention of interests, he asks how the holders of what he calls \\"offices\\" (which others of a more sociological turn might call \\"roles\\") ought to act if the project of democratic self-rule is to be carried through. He argues -- convicingly, at least to me -- that different offices imply different sets of moral guidelines: that a good senator and a good community organizer are good in different ways, and that neither one can fulfill his office simply by acting out in public some version (any version) of what private ethics defines as a good person.As a bonus, Sabl writes clearly and elegantly; Ruling Passions is a pleasure to read. A must for the scholar, the book is completely accessible to the general reader who is willing to stretch his mind just a little."},{"Title":"Quantum Mechanics: A First Course","review":"This particular text is really a wonder - good explanations, great problems, references to other texts for any rigorous points being glossed over (rare, but refreshing to see an author explictly say as much and provide resources). The mathematics are straightforward, any notational issues/changes are directly accounted for an explained. It is perhaps not as high-level as some, but it is a near-perfect undegradute text. It is entirely possible to teach yourself quantum mechanics from this text with a basic knowledge of calulus and differential equations, even if you are rusty. Diagrams and illustrations are enough to make points clear but far from being used as \\"filler\\" or for the mere appearance of student-friendliness. In short, you'd have to look far to find a text that bridges so well the gap between appealing to laypersons with mathematical knowledge and rigorous academic physics. I suggest you look no further unless you need a graduate-level text!"},{"Title":"Quantum Mechanics: A First Course","review":"Reed's text, Quantum Mechanics, brings a comprehensive yet beginner-friendly introduction to the subject. All the major themes of a good first-year course in quantum mechanics are covered in detail, and in a thorough and understandable fashion. The prose is distinctive (but not too stylized), engaging, and best of all accessible; Cameron's style is more geared towards the beginner.After studying Griffiths text in detail, i appreciate Cameron as a good reference. While Griffiths' book champions a no-nonsense, bare-bone and seminar-like approach, Cameron eases into each of his topics in a more amiable way -- many times Reed expresses explicitly an important nuance or insight into quantum that might be lost on a beginning student studying only Griffiths. Overall Reeds book is a good one that may possibly stand alone for some, but that i recommend in conjunction with Griffiths for full comprehension."},{"Title":"Quantum Mechanics: A First Course","review":"Reed is a great book for problem applications and \\"working\\" your way through Quantum Mechanics.

He has no citation of this anywhere, and no such phrase exists as far as I can find, in any of Marx's work.He's re-writing history to give right-wingers \\"knowledge\\". Very few citations.

Goldberg's signal achievement in Liberal Fascism may be that he has produced one of the most complete and thorough practical demonstrations of Orwell's argument that can be found in print today.

The bottom line is that Fascism is based on the Latin word fasces. A fasces was a Roman weapon comprised of a bundle of sticks and a blade sticking out of the side. The concept of fascism is that the more sticks you hold closer together, the stronger your weapon is. This is why Hitler stressed the importance of youth groups and connecting the country as one. Everyone was supposed to be the same, Blue eyed, blonde haired, and \\"anglo-Saxon\\". Liberalism is actually the opposite side of the spectrum. The concept is individuality and liberty. As a conservative I am embarrassed to associate my self with someone like Jonah Goldberg who doesn't even know that Fascism is the hard right. Liberalism is the center left, and communism is the hard left.However, I must add that Jonah is an excellent writer and it was a well researched book, his thesis was based on inaccurate assumptions and foundationless opinions.

The book started well, accurately describing Mussolini's drift from left to right, and his masterly use of left-wing rhetoric to rally the masses around the fascist banner. After Mussolini, though, the book simply slimes its way into facile comparisons and liberal baiting. I should have skipped to the end of the book and read Goldberg's defense of Bush, and his adulation of Patrick Buchanan to see where the author was really coming from before purchasing it into my Kindle.There is a LOT to be said against liberal identity politics, and a LOT to be said about many liberals' blind support of policies and politicians who have turned out to be right wing or fascist, but you won't find it in this book.The worst part of it all is, if this book were in my library, I would simply toss it, or use its paper for dog-training. Alas, with the Kindle, I can only put it in my \\"Archives\\", where I have to see the damn thing every time I go there to retrieve other, ever more worthy books.

Notably, Prescott Bush's attempt to launch a Nazi coup in 1930's America with other Right-Wing Conservatives of the day, a true historical fact.Popularized by Karl Rove, the Right attacks the Left for the very things they themselves are actively implementing and denying. The trick of this kind of propaganda is to accuse your opponent of what is in fact your actual goals, aims, and shortcomings.Since 9/11 we have seen the Right boldly legislating restrictions to basic freedoms.

I a radical capitalist, or classical libertarian found myself waiting for a one two punch where Goldberg would then sum up why or why not neo conservative fit certain fascist tendencies as well. This could easily have been included starting with Nixon and included a history of the religious right. I understand why the author did not include this as his definition required consistent alignment with fascist ideology, rhetoric, or action, and most often the neo conservatives are only fascistic in upholding policy and not creating new policy(except of course a state based religious morality).Aside from that singular complaint, and since the author and I likely disagree on that complaint, I found the book enlightening, interesting, and slightly redundant, but likely a requirement to ensure the book had some clout."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Liberal Fascism is a book you don't read overnight.

It is ironic that the very people who call those who disagree with them fascists, are themselves pathetic examples of fascism. It is the white liberal's equivalent to the race card.

My only gripe is that he's too apologetic. He should limit the idea that contemporary liberals are NOT Nazis to an introductory paragraph, perhaps a reiteration in the middle somewhere and then hit it again in the conclusion.

Next to Ann Coulter this is possibly the most outrageous book capitalizing on the agnostic nature of the american public when it comes to politics and to mislead them into thinking left is right right is left and upside down is sideways. Put bluntly, this book is all lies.To propagate an effective lie you must create the right setting. You must make people question what they think they know. Liberal Fascism, as defined in this book is real. But the first thing the book does in the opening is change the definition of fascism. Lets not have fascism be militancy, radical nationalism, racism, or anything that relates to the modern established right wing movements. Lets have it be something generally defined as \\"big government\\", but even the author admits that most people don't know what it means. For a book called 'Liberal Fascism' the definition of fascism seems pretty crucial to be academically correct and historically correct.After altering the definition of Fascism to relate to anything that gets in the way of the free market, social security, public education, universal healthcare are all implied to be fascist. If militarism is a key role in fascism, then the entire chapters devoted to Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt may initially make sense since they let the US into two of the most devastating wars the world has ever seen. Heres the problem, those were wars of liberation and peacekeeping; we were fighting assured fascists with Imperial ambitions. They were the aggressors. So militancy cannot be applied when calling FDR and Wilson. The next argument would be that they increased government intervention, when in actuality that is a key aspect of Socialism and not Fascism. Most people love to criticize both but they do not know the difference. Bernie, is a well educated Fox spin doctor so he surely knows this. According to him, responses of the US government to create social welfare programs during the great depression are \\"Fascism\\". Progressivism actually has proven roots in socialism, but not communism. I assume that \\"Liberal Socialism\\" would not have sold as many copies since that is actually what political parties in Western Europe, Canada and Japan have been practicing for decades.

Therefore, argues Goldberg, (d) progressive liberals are fascists.This type of argument is known as a \\"non sequitor\\": \\"it does not follow\\". Goldberg's premises *are* true, of course, but the conclusion still isn't true. The reason is obvious: agreeing with Mussolini, or even with Hitler, on *some* things doesn't mean one agrees with them about *everything*. It surely does not mean one agrees with them on those issues that made really makes them fascists.For example, Mussolini and modern liberals both agree a strong intervention of the government in the economy is a good idea. But they disagree on the need for a one-party state or the supression of the press. Hitler and modern liberals both agree that free-market capitalism has a downside; but they disagree on whether or not such capitalism is a jewish plot, to say nothing of the need to kill all jews to stop it.Using Goldberg's \\"logic\\", one could just as easily prove that conservatives are all racists. Conservatives want a strong military; the Ku Klux Klan wants a strong military; therefore, the conservatives agree with the Ku Klux Klan. This, of course ignores conservatives *disagree* with the Klan precisely on the issue that *makes* the Klan racist--most conservatives don't think blacks are subhuman.Because Goldberg's non-sequitors allows him to \\"prove\\" essentially anyone he dislikes is a \\"fascist\\", it is not surprising his list of \\"liberal fascists\\" is a mile long. The problem is, the list includes Woodrow Wilson, FDR (who saved the free world from Fascism in WWII), Bill Clinton, and others. Whatever their faults, if *these* people are \\"fascists\\", then the term loses all meaning.Due to this central flaw, the book cannot be recommended. Still, it is not totally worthless. It *does* do some basic research reasonably well and *does* note that liberal progressive may *become* fascists if they take their views to extremes--though that is, of course, just as true for conservatives who take their views to extreme. But there are many other books that show this without falling for Golberg's preposterous thesis."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I have not read this book, so cannot comment on it's content, however I must disagree with Samir Quntar al-Muti's review on one point. I agree that Fascism is not as the left describes it as the assumption of government powers by privately owned corporations, however neither is it state ownership and control of corporations. Fascism is state control of private corporations, not ownership. In this it is distinguished from the later manifestations of socialism in the nationalization of major businesses (power companies, aircraft manufacturers, auto companies, shipbuilders, banks etc.) in Europe. Under Fascism ownership and profits remain in the hands of private owners of both small and large enterprise, while the state exerts varying degrees of control over the operations of the enterprise, particularly over those it sees as economically or strategically important. R & D and production is approved and directed by the state to achieve the goals of the ruling party--chiefly, but not exclusively, economic growth and full employment. In this it is most closely replicated by the state control of capitalism in modern China. While state ownership and control by career bureaucrats is still a major element, private enterprise is allowed, but under state direction. Investment decisions of both government, private and even foreign-owned enterprises are controlled and directed by the state. As in Fascist Italy and Germany, even product identification codes are assigned by the state. By allowing the individual to be rewarded for hard work and innovation it has proven more economically successful than the classic socialist model striving for equality of benefits, but it suffers the same perils in allowing ill-thought-out political considerations to over-ride market demands (e.g. demanding that corporations build certain products without adopting policies to foster their demand).Such state control of private corporations is now the common demand of the so-called anti-globalization movement, indeed for many of the same reasons as the fascist regimes of the Germany and Italy, and the Neo-fascism of China. This kind of fascism could yet appear in the form of the Obama administration's automotive industry oversight committee should they, as many in the congress and senate demand, dictate the investment and production decisions made by the American auto industry. In this fascism merely replaces one impaired and ignorant arbiter of investment (bankers) with another (bureaucrats)."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Book arrived quickly and in Excellent condition as advertised. I will look to do business with with this seller again."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The author, who is a frequent contributor to National Review, both online and in print, had a truly extraordinary insight one day.His insight was that the forces on the American and European left that want to ban smoking, ban high fat snacks, ban cosmetic use of animal products, force people to lower the thermostat in winter, etc. have a similar agenda to famous people of the past, namely Hitler and Mussolini and those people are called fascist. This similarity allows the author to create a very persuasive (and for conservatives, a very useful) product. There is absolutely no credible doubt that Hitler was anti coffee, was a vegetarian, was anti capitalist, etc. There is also no doubt that Putin considers FDR his model. There is no doubt that Woodrow Wilson and WEB DuBois admired portions of what would become the Mussolini agenda. Left wing critics of the author, although initially denying these facts are coming around to admitting them.Let's go to some problems,1. the word 'secret' in the title of the book is an oddity because the history that the author cites is not secret (maybe suppressed would have been a better choice).2. the word 'liberal' in the title is a problem - the American and European 'left' is not uniformly 'liberal'. They mostly support such things as the legality of abortion, the legalization of gay marriage, and lenient sentencing of drug offenders for example (which would be arguably 'liberal'). However, as noted they mostly also support government regulation (or prevention) of a number of private activities (which is hard to square with 'liberal').3. the word 'fascism' in the title is also a problem. There is such a wide disparity between what could be called 'National expansionist fascism' (the Hitler variety) and 'National behavior propaganda generation fascism' that they probably should have been called different terms. The author is not to blame for this and, as he has pointed out, the left frequently calls opponents 'fascist' for no reason but that they disagree on policy.So here is what I would call the book.\\"Quasi-fascism among self identified liberals: the repressed history of the American (and Euro) left's adoption of aspects of Mussolini and Hitler's agenda\\""},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"this book is extremely well written and eye opening, it is very well researched and supports its claim with facts.

The most amazing is the reaction it is generating. I for one have never commented before. However, now I must. First off, the whole pretext that fascism in nazi Germany came from the left is preposterous. I'll cite this: &lt;...>, which is an historical account of the period from a reputable source as just one example. In it you will find: \\"In April, 1920, Hitler advocated that the party should change its name to the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP). Hitler had always been hostile to socialist ideas, especially those that involved racial or sexual equality. However, socialism was a popular political philosophy in Germany\\". This fits very well with the repugnican propaganda in this country. Just like calling the \\"fairness doctrine\\" abolished in the late 80s under reagan the \\"unfairness doctrine\\". The wrong wing must come up with such methods of propaganda, otherwise, only fascists would vote for them. But, I digress. To be fair, if someone who actually thinks the premise is based on fact wishes to cite a contrary example, it would make interesting reading, and I'd enjoy proving it wrong (easy to do because the historical facts are a matter of public record). Anyway, if you are to read this knowing that the pretext it is built on is false, then you deserve to waste your money on it.The next most amazing thing is people will actually believe the pretext that liberalism leads to fascism. Now, one might claim that intolerance leads to fascism, and they'd be correct. Now, I ask you, which part of the political spectrum leads to intolerance: conservatism or liberalism. Can you say: the religious right? Anyway, this is quickly turning too political, and we are all entitled to our own opinions. But, let's not disguise and twist the historical basis for fascism. That would open the door to the rise of fascism in the US dangerously wide. And it will come from the wrong wing. Beware of how you vote. And do VOTE!Another thing I find somewhat amazing and amusing in a sick kind of way. The tags for this item include: \\"Censored by the left wing\\" and \\"Censored by liberals\\". When is the last time that has happened? Can anyone point to something liberals censor? (don't confuse the far left with liberals, extremes on both sides can be intolerant, but in the US there is no far-left. McCarthy purged them. Can you say: fascist? And, the socialists are anything but liberal, by the way.)Anyway, WAKE UP! Do your own thinking! Do your OWN research! Look at history!

Yet despite his often keen sense of humor, Goldberg fails to recognize that the joke is on him, as his whole book looks bizarrely like those he wishes to attack.In his initial thesis, that many on the left hurl the term fascist with such ease and frequency as to render it meaningless - though he offers little evidence of the second half of his point that those on the left use it to \\"silence\\" those on the right, the only political effect the term having had on politics in the last 20 years its jujitsu like use by Senator Al D'Amato to defeat Bob Abrams in NY's '92 Senate race - and then just as quickly uses the word in ways that render it equally fascist. Indeed, Goldberg's logic is often so flawed as to wonder how his editors read his manuscript without giggling.Take Goldberg's efforts to rebrand the European Fascist states as \\"liberal.\\" Ignoring the occasional mistakes of facts committed - such as his claim that the Nazi's supported abortion, a strange point since the idea of \\"choice\\" was anathema in the Nazi State, abortion being a severely punished crime in most cases - but let us look at the places where he gets his facts correct. Goldberg points out that Nazi Germany offered free healthcare and generous old age pensions, and was therefore liberal, and therefore all liberals are Fascists. Take a moment to consider this - under Goldberg's definition pretty much every state in Western Europe, even those whose leaders he might approve, are thus Fascists (a shock to Lady Thatcher to be sure). Likewise folks like Otto von Bismarck, the 19th Century statesman and conservative by any definition, is transmogrified into a liberal in Goldberg's odd world view. That Hitler, Hirohito, Franco and their ilk more often than not imagined themselves as reactionaries and would be appalled at the liberal label (in WWII the Liberals were the good guys) is another bit of irony which Goldberg chooses to miss.Part of the problem results from Goldberg committing the same mistake to which he rightly accuses people on the left, misusing language and rendering a term meaningless. While it is true that Fascism is a statist ideology, that does not mean that all statists are Fascists (remember Logic 101, \\"all beagles are dogs, but not all dogs are beagles\\"). As an ideology Fascism seeks to dismantle democratic institutions and use the instruments of the state to suppress dissent and is generally militaristic. Thus while Goldberg might correctly point to Woodrow Wilson's imprisonment of those who opposed WWI as Fascist act, Wilson fails in the second test; the Reichstag, not Congress went up in flames. Likewise FDR's internment of the Japanese, while both despicable and racist, hardly counts as Fascist, since the basis was hardly to suppress dissent. Indeed, one might look at FDR as one of histories great anti-Fascists, a man elected in time of national crisis when many, perhaps even a majority, favored some form of authoritarian rule, but who refused such suggestions working instead through the democratic process.That in turn brings us to the point of Goldberg's book which is the most polemic and absurd. As he seeks to paint every Democrat from Wilson to Clinton with his Fascist brush he skips the Republicans, even as they commit many of the acts which he imagines Fascist under Democrats. Thus JFK's brinksmanship and calls for confrontation with the Soviets fit his definition, but Reagan's like behavior does not. Wilson's suppression of dissent likewise, but dismisses McCarthyism, with the full force of the state used to destroy the lives of American citizens who were deprived of their liberty with a smirk. And of course, George Bush, with his imagined imperium of the \\"unitary executive\\" with a right to ignore the democratic will expressed through the legislature, spy on American citizens, and hold them in indefinite detention without access to the courts, is likewise spared criticism.As I mentioned at the beginning, \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is on occasion amusing, even funny. But if Goldberg expects to be taken seriously as a thinker, he has a long way to go. Perhaps the next time he complains about someone calling the National Review a \\"Fascist rag\\" that the term in this context is absurd and meaningless as it is through much of his book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg's Liberal Fascism is a disgrace to political and historical literature, an insult to the maturity and intelligence of readers, and most importantly, a danger to the historical record of American politics. Although his theory that modern-day American liberals are modern-day American fascists is one worth considering, it should not be considered on the basis of Goldberg's terribly fabricated argument.Goldberg's intentions alone reveal the irrelevance of his claim. He openly and proudly maintains that his main motivation for writing Liberal Fascism was to right a historical wrong. This goal is seemingly admirable until the heart of the argument is reached where it becomes evident that Goldberg is not so much the noble savior from ignorance as he is the political blogger's equivalent of a little schoolboy whining because another boy called him a mean name. Goldberg's aim was not to right a historical wrong; it was to right a personal wrong. Conservatives are often called fascists by liberals, so as a conservative, Goldberg has taken it upon himself to turn the tables on liberals and argue that liberals are the true fascists. Acknowledging the frivolity of his own literary undertaking, Goldberg writes, \\"One objection to all this might be: So what?\\" His answer: \\"Conservatives in America must carry their intellectual history - real and alleged - around their necks like an albatross... Why, then, is it so trivial to point out that the liberal closet has its own skeletons...?\\" Poor Mr. Goldberg is tired of liberals calling him a fascist so he's gonna call them fascists right back, bringing around the old elementary school comeback, \\"I know you are but what am I.\\"Which brings us to the hollowness of Goldberg's work. His thesis isn't derived from extensive historical research; it's derived from his personal view of politics, arrived at through his frustration with the liberal tendency to refer to conservatives as fascists. A good researcher carefully studies the data set before him, and then comes to a conclusion inferred from that data. A good researcher does not first form a conclusion, and then pick and choose the data that supports it, as Goldberg has done. History can tell us whatever we want it to tell us if we're cherry-picking evidence.Goldberg's secondary objective is as grossly obvious as the primary, and even more so with a little background information. After spending a small time researching the origin of his scholarly endeavor I found that the cover, a smiley face with a Hitler-esque moustache, came three years before the book. Not only does this further prove that the \\"truth\\" was discovered before the supporting evidence, it also reveals Goldberg's aim to profit through cheap publicity. Without delay, Goldberg expresses in the introduction his anticipation for controversy, and he speculates that his argument will be \\"distorted by hostile critics.\\" Debate regarding the concept's credibility began long before the book was available for purchase just because of the title and cover. Goldberg didn't want to correct history; he wanted to make a quick buck off his petty defense of conservatism.Admittedly, Goldberg's thesis is not entirely absurd. I bought the book ready to agree with his claim that modern-day liberals are, in fact, modern-day fascists, because there is a credible basis for his theory. The problem is not that Goldberg's conclusion is far-fetched; it is that his evidence is so contrived, and, I might add, poorly compiled, that it borders on, if not reaches, falsehood. If Goldberg had researched his theory from a purely scholarly perspective, he might have been able to form a convincing argument worthy of consideration, publication, and half the uproar caused by that which he presents in Liberal Fascism. But because the argument is contrived, Goldberg's work cannot be taken seriously. I would hope that the readers of books like Liberal Fascism would have the sense to see the fallacies themselves, but because this book is being presented as a scholarly work, the risk of misleading Americans should not be taken. If a book as insignificant as James Frey's memoir can so desperately warrant a meticulous warning regarding its falsehood, I doubt anyone will disagree that a work as potentially consequential as Liberal Fascism warrants nothing less."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"It took me a long time to finish this book. While it has many good points and arguments, Goldberg has a fascination with not staying on topic. Why the book is broken down into chapters is beyond me as he doesn't stay on the topic of the chapter.I almost stopped reading it, but I am a completist and wanted to finish it to understand his whole argument. It is a good argument, however it took until page 394 (of the hardcover edition) to finally see, that while he finds principle in showing liberals have fascist tendencies, he states that he supports Bush's democracy agenda. Now this democracy agenda, by spreading democracy around the world, can and should be seen as fascistic in itself. Complaining about liberals forcing their views on the rest of society for the citizenry's own good is IDENTICAL to forcing democracy on other countries for their own good.For Goldberg, and many other interventionist \\"conservatives\\", the basic question that should be asked in the beginning is, \\"Do you believe that the United States should fully support and defend Israel?\\" It all comes down to this folks - interventionist conservatives want to see democracy in the Middle East to make it a \\"stable\\" region for Israel.While his argument about liberals is excellent (although scattered all throughout the unorganized book), it completely erupts on page 394 to show that it only applies to everything but spreading democracy around the world. What our leaders and our government should do is lead by example. If democracy is so appealing to other countries, let them want it by our example, not by force.Do not buy this book - I summarized most of it here on one page instead of you having to torture yourself with poorly organized, albeit good arguments about liberalism being fascist."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I do not believe I have ever read a book where the author was unable to maintain a definition concerning his topic.

Look at American corporations today.Therefore, according to Goldberg, the so-called Right-wing supportersof Big Business are Fascists, as well as the Left.The political terms \\"Left\\" and \\"Right\\" are archaic misnomers and havebeen outdated since the late 1970s in the USA.It is a fact that there is basically no American Left. Perhaps ahandful of Congressional representatives are on the Left. The onlyDemocratic Socialist is Bernie Sanders, (I) Senator, Vermont. Hiscommittee assignments list him with the Democratic party. Sandersvotes with the Democrats, a primarily right-wing political party inthe United States.Again, there is no Left in the United States.Liberals in the USA are not on the left. They are Center.The cover in itself is also disingenuous. The mustache on the smileyface evokes the image of Adolf Hitler and National Socialism.Holland and Sweden for example, are one of the most Left-WingSocialist countries on Earth. You will find the Dutch and Swedish tobe strongly against and opposed to National Socialism, Fascism, andMarxism, Communism, Leninism, and Stalinism. Similar polling data exists in the United States.Why are these two words in the title? To evoke false comparisons.The \\"Left\\" has no relation to the current United States terms of\\"Liberal, Liberalism, Conservatism, Neo-Conservatism, orNeo-Liberalism.\\"Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were/are both Neo-Liberals.Franklin D. Roosevelt in an April 29, 1938 message to Congress warnedthat the growth of private power could lead to fascism:The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if thepeople tolerate the growth of private power to a point where itbecomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in itsessence, is fascism--ownership of government by an individual, by agroup, or by any other controlling private power.As a Libertarian I see the author is really noting the historicalbeliefs of \\"Collective\\" vs. \\"Individualist.\\"As a leaning Libertarian, I'm an Individualist."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg's book \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is long overdue. This should be evident to anyone who rejects the party line of the reigning collectivist orthodoxy in America. Such a person will have had the experience of being labeled a \\"reactionary\\" or an \\"ultra-conservative\\" and of being informed that his opinions, if taken a bit further, would make him a fascist.This charge, as inevitable as death and taxes in a debate with a hard-core Leftist, leaves its victim stunned and confused, like the proverbial deer in the headlights. \\"But, wait...\\" stammers the besieged advocate of free markets and limited government. He replays in his mind the famous film clips of Hitler addressing the Nazi mass rallies, and thinks, such a thing could not be further from my heart. Yet he fails to utter a satisfactory rejoinder to his accusers.Along comes Goldberg and unravels the myth of the \\"conservative fascist,\\" one of the pre-eminent Big Lies of the post-War era. Not content to debunk it, he turns the tables, offering conclusive evidence that the contemporary American \\"liberal\\" (as opposed to the classic liberal of yesteryear) subscribes to an ideology that is a patchwork of the twentieth century's anti-democratic experiments: statism, collectivism, racialism, and nihilism--in a word, fascism. Today, it is a \\"feel-good\\" fascism; fascism with a caring face. But it is the same road to serfdom (to borrow Hayek's phrase), and it leads to a place where freedom, liberty, and the human spirit have been eliminated.The book takes us on a journey through the ideological swamps of the American Left, featuring such highlights as pre-WWI Progressivism; Woodrow Wilson; the New Deal; the radicals of the 1960s; the Clintons; and Al Gore. In each case, Goldberg shows us the uncanny resemblance between the icons of the Left and the ideology and/or methods of the self-declared fascists--be they German, Italian, or some other variety.We learn how Mussolini and the Nazis were first and foremost socialists, pure creations of the Left. Goldberg presents reams of testimony to highlight this seldom-discussed fact. For example:\\"The Nazi ideologist--and Hitler rival--Gregor Strasser put it quite succinctly: 'We are socialists. We are enemies, deadly enemies, of today's capitalist economic system with its exploitation of the economically weak, its unfair wage system, its immoral way of judging the worth of human beings in terms of their wealth and their money, instead of their responsibility and their performance, and we are determined to destroy this system whatever happens!'\\"Likewise, the original Nazi Party platform of 1920 was nothing if not a description of a Leftist nirvana. Explains Goldberg:\\"The most striking thing about the platform was its concerted appeal to socialistic and populist economics, including providing a livelihood for citizens; abolition of income from interest; the total confiscation of war profits; the nationalization of trusts; shared profits with labor; expanded old-age pensions; 'communalization of department stores'; the execution of 'usurers' regardless of race; and the outlawing of child labor.\\"The similarities between the Nazi belief system and much of our own political correctness is chilling. Hitler and his cohorts were super-environmentalists, obsessed with animal rights and organic food. They had a well-developed cult of Mother Earth, which fed into their fantasies of a pagan, pre-Christian Germanic race. They waged fanatical anti-smoking campaigns, part of an overall focus on public health and care for the body. Sound familiar?Mussolini and his followers were cut from the same Leftist cloth. We read that Mussolini's\\"reputation as a radical grew slowly and steadily until 1911. He became the editor of La lotta di classe (Class War), which served as the megaphone of the extremist wing of the Italian Socialist Party...in a speech in Forli he called on the Italian people to declare a general strike, block the streets, and blow up the trains...He emerged from prison as a socialist star. At his welcoming banquet a leading socialist, Olindo Vernocchi, declared: 'From today you, Benito, are not only the representative of the Romagna Socialists but the Duce of all revolutionary socialists in Italy.' ... Mussolini joined the formal leadership of the party and four months later took over the editorship of its national newspaper, Avanti!, one of the most plum posts in all of European radicalism.\\"Mussolini enjoyed an immense popularity among the Leftist intelligentsia in Europe and the U.S. (and in many other sectors, as well). His long list of admirers included the New York Times, Lincoln Steffens, Columbia University, the Saturday Evening Post, and Sigmund Freud. How could they all support one of the world's premiere fascist dictators?\\"The answer resides in the fact that Fascism was born of a 'fascist moment' in Western civilization, when a coalition of intellectuals going by various labels--progressive, communist, socialist, and so forth--believed the era of liberal democracy was drawing to a close. It was time for man to lay aside the anachronisms of natural law, traditional religion, constitutional liberty, capitalism...This was in every significant way a project of the left as we understand the term today, a fact understood by Mussolini, his admirers, and his detractors.\\"Another misconception that Goldberg deconstructs (if I may borrow a term invented by the Nazis), is that fascism is a derivative, or extreme version, of capitalism. Related to this is the myth that Hitler was catapulted into power by \\"big business,\\" just as the big, bad corporations of today allegedly salivate at the thought of enslaving the masses and putting dissidents into concentration camps. This fabrication was as preposterous then as it is today. Fascism is virulently anti-capitalist, and the contemporary large corporation in America tends, if anything, to be aligned with the Left.\\"If big business is so right-wing, why do huge banks fund liberal and left-wing charities, activists, and advocacy groups, then brag about it in commercials and publicity campaigns? How to explain that there's virtually no major issue in the culture wars--from abortion to gay marriage to affirmative action--where big business has played a major role on the American right while there are dozens of examples of corporations supporting the liberal side? Indeed, the myth of the right-wing corporation allows the media to tighten liberalism's grip on both corporations and the culture.\\"Today we face what Goldberg calls a \\"liberal fascist kulturkampf.\\" Our own fascistic Left seeks to overturn the classic liberal democratic society. We are confronted by many of the same sentiments that propelled the Nazis to power: disenchantment with Western culture; the morbid fascination with race; the hatred of Judeo-Christian morality; the expectation that the realm of politics provide \\"meaning\\"; worship of the environment; attraction to paganism; and a puritanical spirit that is manifest in the obsession with public health.The parallels do not end there. \\"The white male,\\" says Goldberg,\\"is the Jew of liberal fascism. The 'key to solving the social problems of our age is to abolish the white race,' writes the whiteness studies scholar and historian Noel Ignatiev. Whiteness studies is a cutting-edge academic discipline sweeping American higher education. Some thirty universities have WS departments, but many more schools teach the essentials of whiteness studies in other courses...The journal Race Traitor (ironically, a Nazi term) is dedicated 'to serve as an intellectual center for those seeking to abolish the white race'.\\"\\"Liberal Fascism\\" is an excellent work, but unfortunately it suffers from two defects. The first is an exaggeration of the fascistic tendencies of certain American leaders. In the case of Hillary Clinton, the argument is airtight. But when it comes to President Lyndon Johnson, I do not believe that the evidence presented supports Goldberg's assertion that the Great Society was \\"LBJ's fascist utopia.\\"The second defect is the organization and flow of the book, which is a bit erratic. In a few spots, the subject matter jumps back and forth chronologically and substantively, causing one to lose the thread of the argument.Despite these shortcomings, Liberal Fascism is a devastating, meticulously documented indictment of the American Left: its methods, its ideology, and the myths it has manufactured to disguise its true nature and intentions. The book is a call to action for all concerned with the systematic destruction of our culture, perpetrated using the tools of feel-good totalitarianism."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a perfect airplane book. The cover will insure that you have an empty seat next to you to stretch out, the content will keep you entertained even during the inevitable delays, and the bright red cover makes it hard to lose. What more can you ask for in a book?As for the negative criticism? Goldberg has committed the unpardonable sin of our modern culture. He deigns to use actual history to support his arguments. The fact that he uses lots of it and uses it accurately only compounds the faux pas. It puts his critics in the uncomfortable position of having to do actual research of their own if they wish to engage him.I've read the book. It has it's weak spots and reaches too far in places, but overall Goldberg makes a sustained and coherent case for his premise, and critics will have to do more than feel hurt and sling mud if they want to refute him.This is more than the standard --\\"first chapter/last chapter/ back cover/ with filler\\" --offering that dominates this genre."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book is well researched and written. It is not for the quick read crowd due to its in depth analysis of the progressive movement here in America and in Europe. This is a must read for all thinking Americans because it presents a road map to where we can expect America to be if Obama and his ilk get their way. I found this book a page turner that I was not able to put down. I found myself asking for more when I finished reading this fantastic book.Jonah Goldberg has opened the door and shinned a light on the future of America and I would recommend that those concerned with the direction of their country read and pass on this book....While there is still time."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"In contrast to my usual practice of giving a book 100 pages before I put it down if it is a clunker,,this is the first time I felt compelled to comment positively after only 24 pages(chapter one).Every paragraph,indeed,almost every sentence is a gem of sweeping historical nexus and connection politically,culturally,economically and intellectually to the extent that I had to put my yellow marker down. The author has turned the classic liberal labeling sleight of hand upon itself and provided historically an accurate mapping of the convergence of currents now cresting with Obamaism.Having read extensively and with fascination the historical riseto power of Mussolini,Hitler,Mao and Stalin and the parallels with the rhetoric,philosophy,mindless mass adulation aided by a supine and cheering press,the supression of dissent and the statist absolutism espoused by Obama,the democrats and the MSM,the links were evident immediately,as were the link of the French revolution, the progressives etc.I am curious to see if this is further developed with the links to the American Transcendentalist movement. I will not go into a long review as so many of the 5 stars do so ably but will note with glee the howls from the left of the one stars as the author hits the mark. The Amazon reviews are typical, one \\"sort of\\" non ideological the other nothing but a sneering screed from WAPO as another reviewer already noted.BUY this book,give it to your friends. It is superb."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"If any book has the potential of changing the course of America over the next decade, Liberal Fascism is that book. While Mr. Goldberg might have strong views on the various left/right topics of the day, the virtue of those left/right positions is not what this book is about. Instead, it's about whether the power of the State should be used to impose any views on us; and more importantly, on our children.Just reading Liberal Fascism makes you aware of the smothering effect of the nanny state. The velvet fascism of the U.S. is still fascism. And while we might not have the literal suffocating of Nazi German, it never-the-less does smother our freedoms.Reading Liberal Fascism should make everyone on the political spectrum concerned about various groups wielding the State to enforce their agendas."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"As a conservative, I have always heard that the far right was like Hitlars Germany. In my own ignroance, I never bothered to dispute the notion as it was the accepted norm.However as I became more interested in Politics, it began to really concern me as to why the supposed link to Fascism was there. As I read more and more about Fascism, I could see not a single link to conservatives or anything \\"right wing\\". In fact, it was the opposite and I saw much of the modern day DNC party positions aligned with that of Nazi Germany.This book built on what I was learning with far more details than I had dug up. It also helped explain more into WHY the Fascist were labeled as \\"right wing\\" to really help me put Fascism in context with Socialism and Communism.If you are not convinced that Fascism is on the far left, then please take a look at the policy. In fact just look at Obama and the plans he has... it is almost mirrored of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg makes his case very well. Connections between progressive thought in America and fascism in Europe are shown on several levels, to include (but not limited to) the following: state welfare programs, wars on smoking, radical environmentalism, attacks on the family, and attempts to subvert traditional Christianity. As an alternative to fascism, Goldberg suggest a return to what he terms \\"classical liberalism\\" -- the intellectual tradition of individual liberty found in America's founding ideas and in thinkers such as Burke and Adam Smith.While Goldberg presents his case well, it would have been helpful to include more of an affirmative case for classical liberalism and to explore its origins more fully. Dinesh D'Souza has noted in his book 'What's So Great About Christianity' that the Declaration of Independence idea that it's \\"self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\\" can't be understood outside of a Christian context, because \\"there's no other source for such rights,\\" D'Souza notes. It would have been helpful to include a discussion such as this.Overall though, Goldberg's book succeeds well and prompts you to want to think and read more. He cites Lutheran Scholar Gene Edward Veith's book 'Modern Fascism: The Threat to the Judeo-Christian Worldview' a couple of times. That's now on my list of books to buy."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"What an Opus Magnum! I promise you will never look at the left the same again and you will never be lied to again that fascism is right wing.

It crucially sets the record straight on one of the Left's most successful, enduring and harmful feats of taxonomical \\"disinformation\\" in the history of modern political science.To the abiding embarrassment and discomfiture of the Left, Goldberg highlights the common philosophical ancestry that the various strands of leftism share with fascism. (At the calumnious expense of conservatives and the political \\"right\\"). Not surprisingly, the truth hurts those it unmasks, and this book has American (and British) liberals all tied up in an indignant spluttering snit. Well, good.A minor and incidental reflection of the truth of Goldberg's thesis is that both Goebbels and Lenin have been credited with the same quote that \\"A lie told often enough becomes the truth.\\" Well, with this book, Jonah Goldberg renders a huge service in debunking many of those lies.The fact that it is also engagingly and wittily written is just a bonus, but a no less welcome one for that."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg has written an outstanding book. In Liberal Fascism, Goldberg seeks to illuminate for the readers the connections between fascism and the modern American progressive (or liberal) agenda.Goldberg explains the intellectual origins of the European Fascists and shows how they share the same origins as much of the modern liberal intellectual movement. He traces the origins of political commentators referring to fascism as a right wing phenomenon and shows the errors and distortions behind these claims. He warns conservatives of actual fascistic tendencies amongst the so called \\"compassionate conservatives\\" and he provides a fascinating analysis of the 20th century (Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, Roosevelt's New Deal, etc). There is a wealth of information within this book.My only problem with this book are the constant disclaimers peppered throughout the text. Again and again Goldberg takes the time to reiterate that he isn't saying that modern liberals are evil, or that they are genocidal, etc. The point only needed to be made once; once he makes his disclaimers in the introduction that should be it. A good editor would have stripped the frequent disclaimers out of every other section of the book. There is no point in trying to prevent unfair criticisms of the book with constant disclaimers. The liberals who will make unfair characterizations of the book will do so no matter what you write. It distracts the reader when he has to read the same disclaimer for the hundredth time, and it doesn't prevent the sort of negative lazy reviews that pop up in major publications and on websites like Amazon.Overall though, the book is fantastic; it may well turn out to be the best conservative book of 2008, and it will at least be the most informative and the best researched."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I picked this book up on a trip to NYC after reading about it online. I first realized this book might be controversial when trying to find this book in a NYC bookstore. Someone had hidden this book behind several larger books.This book was an enjoyable read. Well documented, it chronicles the heritage of the left in the US and properly aligns fascism as a phenom of the left. For my progressive friends who have actually read this book, it has been an eye opener. While I have heard many rail against this book as nothing more than conservative propaganda, I have yet to read a reputable refutation of the author's thesis nor his sources.

Why? Because it was well hidden by the major book stores that typically hide anything conservative on the bottom shelf of some sociology section in the back of the store. If this were a fascist-liberal tome like Al Frankens \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\", there would have been 500 copies stacked at the front of every store. Meanwhile, even the \\"mainstream media\\" reviews chosen by Amazon were dismissive. What Mr. Goldberg has attempted to do is tell liberals that if you want to uproot fascism in our midst, you best start by looking in the mirror and studying your own history on Eugenics, Abortion, Racism, Class Warfare, Political Correctness, etc. What is more fascist than getting wayward blacks to step back into line by threatening them with Sexual Harassment lawsuits (ie, Clarance Thomas, Juan Williams, and Bill Cosby!!!). To Mr. Thomas' credit, it didn't work on him but it sure seemed to work on Mr. Williams, formerly of the Washington Post, who hasn't said a kind word about conservatives since and on Mr. Cosby who has muted his community responsibility comments. While liberals have educated us all that WWII was a just war for freedom over fascism, what it really was as proven (but perhaps left unsaid), was a struggle for the ideological heart of socialism. As Mr. Goldberg did say, the Soviet propaganda machine (a fascistic organ if ever there was one) successfully painted Hitlerism and Mussolini Fascism as \\"right wing\\" and pro-capitalist when they were only such in comparison to Communism. Drawn to its logical conclusion, todays liberals who yell \\"fascist\\" at every turn relative to conservatism (ie, \\"classical liberalism\\") are in fact, communists. Three cheers for Mr. Goldberg. Its unfortunate that the liberal response to challenges of their orthodoxy is to stick their fingers in their ears and yell \\"nyah nyah nyah....\\"."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Folks, it's already here. Goldberg writes that when fascism comes to America it won't be with jack booted thugs. It will be lawyers and social workers knocking on the door saying, \\"We're here to help.\\" I am a small town prosecuting attorney and I work with social workers regularly. And I know what Goldberg is talking about. We have so intruded into people's lives in the name of helping them or saving them from themselves that we don't realize the harm we do. Goldberg analyzes fascism in its origins, what it truly means. And he points out that when anyone on the left calls a conservative a \\"fascist\\" that they think it is the worst epithet that they can use. But the fascists in Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany were not right wingers. They were socialists. They believed in re-distribution of wealth. They beleived that government should run the corporations. They believed in taking children from parents at the earliest possible age and having them raised by the state so that they could become \\"good\\" members of the culture. They also believed in eugenics, weeding out those who were not wanted, who were not productive, who were a drain on the community. Does any of that sound familiar. I am amused when I hear commentators like Joe Scarborough use the term \\"progressives\\" when he probably doesn't even realize how perjorative that term really is. If you read Goldberg's book and look at the Progessive Movement in this country that led to such excesses under Woodrow Wilson, FDR, LBJ and others you will realize that Progressive, Modern Liberal and Fascist all spring from the same root. And once you have absorbed all this, Hillary Clinton's idea that \\"It Takes a Village\\" and her ideals for socialized medicine should scare the hell out of you. The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is that it is pretty dry and repetitive. But if you want to understand what fascism truly is and why we are almost there now, read this book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg starts with Mussolini and follows with chapters on Hitler, Woodrow Wilson, FDR, JFK, LBJ and on to current times. Obviously, Hitler was infinitely more violent than the others on the list. What the author attempts to do is disassemble the common belief that fascists were typically right wing. He makes the case that fascists are usually socialist in their economic thinking and frame the debate as the individualist (bad) versus \\"the common good\\" (good). In reality, their interests were in naked power and were not altruistic.I did not realize how violent the 1960's were. Goldberg acknowledges that many fascists were sincere in their beliefs, however, they tended to want ACTION and were, thus, impatient with liberals and academics who did not advocate violence. This is why so many young people were key players. They wanted to tear down traditional mores and replace them with a Government that would eliminate all poverty and other social ills and do it NOW. In order to incite violence, fascists recruited the lower elements of society. Yet, many of them believed in eugenics, i.e., they wanted to weed out people they saw as inferior to create a more perfect race.In all, an intelligent read, and the book offers up many historical accounts that I was not previously aware of. The book was thoroughly researched. Certainly, 'Liberal Fascism' is not a quick read, but it is fascinating, if only as a means to opening up a discussion on some political topics that have seldom been covered in modern discourse."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"First, let me say that English Prof should avoid commenting on matters of political science. they should stick with diagramming sentences. I am a political science prof, and I must say that goldberg is right on the money. Fascism is a left-wing ideology. It is not a right-wing ideology. Those who argue that it is are simply minded ideologues. Look, right-wing ideologies can be traced to Edmund Burke. Burke stressed rights were bestowed upon citizens by virtue of their humanity, not because the government recognized these rights. Liberals and fascists both argue that rights must be created and enforced by government, not acknowledged aspects of the human condition. Also, fascists are nationalists, not patriots. They do not find value in tradition unless it provides power. That again is in direct contradiction to Burke. Goldberg is also correct in showing that FDR's brain trust loved Benito until he turned on Uncle Joe. That is true, and can't really be argued. So if you want truth for a change, get this book.

The women seem to be active, but the lone white male is labelled \\"Inactive Member.\\" Forgotten in all of this is the majority of pension contributions to that retirement system come from white males. If they showed an equal number of men and women on that web page, I would not be writing this today.2). Environmental fascism. Again, right on! Couldn't have said it better.

Everytime he even approaches that topic it is with two excuses: (1) YOU are as bad as WE are and (2) There have been other extensive studies of such things [none of which I'm going to cite to you]. In the latter respect he resembles the ACLU's attitude toward the Second Amendment.Fourth, the author's thesis that many of the founders of modern collectivist liberalism have been fascists or proto-fascists is correct. But instead of approaching that theme on the basis of an examination of ideological premises and doctrines, his approach is one all too familiar to viewers of Fox News. His interest is in tarring otherwise respected historical and contemporary individuals, and in only superficially examining their views. In this quest guilt by association is widely used. Emma Goldman, for instance, was a \\"eugenticist,\\" who he has just told us, were principally in favor of aborting Black babies.I would like to be impressed by this volume for the second point stated above. Fascism is not, as we are sometimes advised on the internet, irrelevant or merely a tar word. It was and is a very real presence across the present ideological spectrum. It is more of a presence everyday as hysterical appeals to the ignorant become more and more prevalent. It is difficult, however, to determine whether this volume is ultimately intended to clarify the nature, doctrines and danger of fascism or add to the confusion about it. Without reading it another several times, I would have to vote for the latter as the predominate impression received from a first read."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Please, read the book. Don't listen to the likes of \\"Drdaystrum\\" and \\"Carl Stoll.\\" I've no idea what their motivations might be but I suggest that you spend several hours with this very well constructed book and then refer back to what these \\"one-star\\" types have to say about Mr. Goldberg's work. This is a very important book and, again, once you've looked at it go over all of the denunciations, there's more than just these two, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I read this book when it was first published and just recently reread the paperback version. The right will like it because it fits nicely into their worldview and liberals who are not angry partisans should appreciate it because of it's a new take on an old idea so to speak. Additionally it meets my number on requirement for a non-fiction title: easy to follow along with Goldberg's arguments. It's well researched which is important because it takes a rather unconventional look at history. The only problem that I have with it is that at times it feels like Goldberg is just doing what he accuses his opponents of doing, yelling \\"[insert liberal politician] is a Nazi\\" and unless your already agree with him it can get a little worn. If nothing else borrow it from the library and read the first couple of chapters on Germany, Italy and the early 1920s."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Thoroughly documented, researched, and footnoted, this author finds the roots of the current wave of socialism that is trying to take over our country."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Don't get caught up in the title -- this book is not a polemic as much as a warning at the seeds of fascism in American public life. It warns of tendencies we see in Democrats as well as Republicans, plus movies, television, our whole culture. The American Left gets the worst of it, but the Big Warning is about how American exceptionalism -- our uniqueness -- means that our fascist impulse will look different. It will be (and is) a \\"kindler, gentler\\" fascism which grows alongside some of our ingrained institutions. We've already had our \\"revolution,\\" in 1776, and it was decidedly non-fascist, based on Enlightenment principles of laissez-fair \\"classical\\" liberalism. Our \\"fascist\\" impulse is to bring everything meaningful into the ambit of the state. In this sense \\"liberal fascism\\" is a name for just the kind we might usher in.Read it."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Have not read yet, only know what I will find out inside book by listening to the author in the interviews he has given. Looking forward to a good informational experience."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I got my copy of \\"Liberal Fascism\\" after hearing interviews with the author on talk radio. There was more than one interview and I bought more than one copy, as I wanted to compare my findings with a close friend's, after reding the book.Neither one of us has finished the book as yet, but that we will finish it is absolutely assured. The holdup? -checking out all the references mentioned in the first two chapters. Our conclusion so far? This author has finally been able to link for me a whole series of events and trends that have occurred in my 68 year lifespan that were heretofore disconnected and seemed random. Now, I can easily ascertain that they are connected as steps toward goals of seemingly random groups of self-interested people, all of which are measurable progress toward the intensifying of government control over minute aspects of individual lives.Write on!,Jonah. And I shall read."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Liberals will hate this book. That alone means it is grounded in the reality of history. It clearly delineates the origins of progressive/liberal thought and their need for control as long as they are the ones writing the rules. Liberal totalitarianism is good while conservative totalitarianism is bad. Liberal have the judgment to do the right thing while conservatives never would be trusted with such power. Only the liberal, enlightened mind can know what is best for humanity and we should be thankful they will share it with us. I am sure it is no accident that this book was published in an election year or that it targets Clinton specifically. However, it is clear that Obama is the Fascist through and through and only he can save us from destruction.Wake up America and kick this would be dictator to the curb where he belongs."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"First buy yourself a BIG dictionary if you want to experience the subtle nuances of this worth while book.

While Goldberg certainly takes some swipes at his opponents, his basic thesis is sound:Fascism has the same roots and fundamental principles as Soviet Communism (not as Nazism), and should be treated as a similar ideology.This straightens out a lot of confusion, and further makes it easier to identify just which groups in society today, making it trivial to counter their misinformation. It was, BTW, Stalin who launched the smear that Fascism is a right-wing ideology. Presumably to divert attention from the fascist nature of his own regime.While no book is perfect, this one is so groundbreaking that anyone (European or American) interested in the subject should pick up a copy and learn.There's a lot of ammunition here motivating to engage in the public debate, too. That's Good."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"\\"History is written by the winners.\\" So goes the discipline-denigrating clich&eacute;. A more accurate observation, as Jonah Goldberg's new book, Liberal Fascism, suggests, is that history is written by historians--and especially, in recent decades, by academics whose biases predispose them to serve as useful idiots for Joseph Stalin's defunct propaganda ministry. Though Goldberg's well-researched book doesn't focus minute attention on the culpability of leftist historians, it does provide convenient targets (Richard Hofstadter and William Shirer) who might be blamed for abetting the greatest intellectual ruse of the twentieth century--the absurd designation of fascism as an ideology of the political right.Anyone looking for Coulteresque theater in Goldberg's work (the product of four years' labor) will be disappointed. The book isn't meant to toss \\"f-bombs\\" at liberals the way liberals regularly toss that seven-letter epithet at conservatives. Indeed, Goldberg reiterates again and again that he doesn't employ the word \\"fascism\\" as a synonym for Nazism, racism, or \\"evil.\\" Rather, he uses the term to label a method of governing that expressed itself differently in different countries. Given that caveat, anyone who chooses to read this engrossing analysis of the origins of fascism will likely be rewarded with a paradigm-shifting experience that puts the history of the twentieth century in a new light--a history that places Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt in the same political neighborhood as Benito Mussolini.The story of fascism, Goldberg notes, begins with the \\"holistic\\" philosophy of Jean Jacques Rousseau and his revolutionary progeny--men whose boundless conception of national communion (via a general will) led to the odd idea that dissidents would be \\"forced to be free\\"--a fate more benign than the guillotine that \\"freed\\" enemies of the state from error during the French Reign of Terror. Hegel's philosophy, where the state incarnates God's work in history, provides another piece of the ancestral puzzle, while Nietzsche's romantic and relativistic \\"will to power\\" adds a third leg to fascism's Continental heritage. A fourth progenitor was Otto von Bismarck, whose comprehensive welfare package for the new German Empire provided Western intellectuals with a top-down model of social policy that they yearned to replicate.These historical connections aren't exceptionally novel, but the American branches of fascism's genealogical tree are unexpected--limbs that include the pragmatic philosophers William James and John Dewey as well as political writers like Henry George (Progress and Poverty), Edward Bellamy (Looking Backward), and Herbert Croly (The Promise of American Life). Drawing on these and other sources, Goldberg not only shows that European fascism is a product of the political left, he also argues persuasively that America's version of that system is rooted in the Progressive movement and was first given national expression in the war socialism of Woodrow Wilson.Not surprisingly, Goldberg's first two chapters are devoted to Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. But contrary to the impression given by pop-history, Mussolini isn't relegated to the status of an absurd fifth wheel. Instead, Il Duce's role as the \\"Father of Fascism\\" is clearly laid out. The portrait of his rise to power in 1922--more than a decade before Hitler became Chancellor of Germany--is the story of an intellectual whose communist sympathies were developed from infancy. (Even his given names, Benito Amilcare Andrea, conjured up leftist heroes from the past.) Those socialist sentiments remained with Mussolini to the day of his death--alongside his obsession with sexual conquest and his contempt for Christianity.As Goldberg notes, Mussolini's state-centered, anti-capitalist rhetoric could only be declared \\"right-wing\\" by ideologues who were fighting over the same political bone. In other words, it was the internecine struggle between fascists and communists that gave birth to the longstanding practice of separating the terms \\"fascist\\" and \\"socialist.\\" This linguistic divorce was mandated by Stalin to stigmatize the socialist heresy Mussolini promoted in light of his comrades' nationalistic response to World War I.Goldberg also emphasizes that fascism itself varied from nation to nation. Most significantly, the Jew-hatred that characterized Hitler's regime wasn't integral to Italian Fascism--a movement that included a disproportionate number of Jews. Indeed, Mussolini scoffed at the Aryan myth that animated German Nazism, preferring for his part to play the role of a latter-day Caesar who was destined to resurrect Rome's ancient greatness.The most unexpected part of Goldberg's Mussolini portrait is the way the Italian leader was hailed in American Progressive circles (e.g. in issues of Herbert Croly's New Republic) and in American pop-culture. Even as late as 1934, Cole Porter's song, \\"You're the Top,\\" exhibited this adulatory attitude toward the Italian idol. Only after Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935 did this admiration begin to wane. Significantly, the American President that Mussolini praised effusively in 1919, three years before his march on Rome, was Woodrow Wilson.As far as Hitler's left-wing credentials are concerned, Goldberg's discussion of the Nazi Party Platform does a good job of demonstrating that the word \\"socialist\\" in National Socialist wasn't mere window dressing. After summarizing that ambitious document, Goldberg offers this sarcastic conclusion:\\"Ah, yes. Those anti-elitist, stock-market-abolishing, child-labor-ending, public-health-promoting, wealth-confiscating, draft-ending, secularist right-wingers!\\"Analysis of the groups from which Nazism drew its support also shows that corporations weren't (as Moscow insisted) pulling strings behind the scene. Rather, Nazism emerged as a populist movement that was so cash-strapped Hitler frequently rode to rallies \\"in the back of an old pickup.\\" As the historian Henry Ashby Turner concludes, corporate funding of the Nazi party was \\"at best\\" of \\"marginal significance.\\" Were it not for decades of leftist disinformation, that conclusion would have been a foregone conclusion, given the virulently anti-capitalist language of Mein Kampf--language Hitler still employed in 1941. In short, Goldberg provides extensive evidence that Hitler's political program was just as \\"right-wing\\" as the politics of Leon Trotsky--whom Stalin also labeled a \\"fascist.\\"It is one thing to assert that fascism is a product of the political left--one of the \\"heresies of socialism\\" according to Harvard Professor Richard Pipes. It is something else to argue that fascism has its own American expression that grew out of the Progressive political tradition and that \\"Woodrow Wilson was the twentieth century's first fascist dictator.\\" That, however, is precisely the proposition put forward in Goldberg's third chapter: Woodrow Wilson and the Birth of Liberal Fascism.To bolster this hypothesis, Goldberg highlights connections between the intellectual milieu that fostered fascism in Europe and the milieu that begat American Progressivism. Henry George's Progress and Poverty, for example, was received enthusiastically in Europe where it helped to shape populist and socialist economic theory. Similarly, Edward Bellamy's utopian vision in Looking Backward (where a single municipal umbrella would one day shield all Bostonians from the rain) drew inspiration from Bismarck's top-down political example in Germany. These and other \\"holistic\\" visions of society fed into an American Progressive movement whose moral energy was derived largely from legions of Social Gospelers. As Goldberg notes, the party's 1912 presidential convention was described in the New York Times as a \\"convention of fanatics\\" and \\"religious enthusiasts.\\" This fusion of social reform and religious fervor is central to what Goldberg calls \\"liberal fascism.\\"On the philosophical side of the ledger, American Progressivism looked to William James, John Dewey, and Charles Darwin. The former duo provided a relativistic and pragmatic outlook that coincided nicely with bold social experimentation. Dewey, in particular, advocated an \\"organic\\" Darwinian approach to society that consigned American individualism to the dustbin of evolutionary history. Darwinism also brought to the Progressive project a focus on racist genetics that (alongside the movement's militant imperialism) subsequent historians have been eager to forget. Furthermore, the polite moral relativism of James and Dewey echoed the unequivocal relativism expressed by Nietzsche (whose philosophy, according to H. L. Mencken, Theodore Roosevelt had swallowed whole). Finally, the attachment of elite progressives to Hegel's political philosophy (Goldberg notes that Woodrow Wilson \\"even invoked Hegel in a love letter to his wife.\\") reinforced the idea that society is an organic whole and that reformers are, quite literally, God's instruments on earth.Woodrow Wilson is the unexpected villain of Liberal Fascism. Based on a review of his academic writings, Goldberg demonstrates that Wilson was a devotee of power--power utilized according to the pragmatic lights of John Dewey. Consequently, the twenty-eighth president denigrated, with the confidence of a divinely anointed leader, those constitutional provisions that limited his ability to mold the nation into a healthy organism that worked for the good of all. This \\"evolutionary\\" vision of history provided the intellectual justification for that modern legal theory that dissolves all governmental boundaries--the living Constitution. It also paved the way for an approach to education that transferred the locus of pedagogical authority from parents to the state. In Professor Wilson's words: \\"Our problem is not merely to help the students to adjust themselves to world life...[but] to make them as unlike their fathers as we can.\\"World War I gave President Wilson the crisis he needed to implement the top-down vision of social coordination he had written about for decades. Government instruments employed in this massive effort (whose only near precedent was Lincoln's response to the Civil War) included the War Industries Board, a vigorous and widespread propaganda ministry, and a justice department that, Goldberg notes, presided over the arrest and jailing of more dissidents than Mussolini incarcerated during the entire 1920s. From censorship, to price-fixing, to Palmer raids, to patriotic nursery rhymes designed for toddlers, mobilization gave Wilson's government unprecedented access to and control over people's lives. This whipping of individualistic Americans into collective shape was cheered by progressives like Walter Lippmann who saw in the war an opportunity to bring about a Nietzschean \\"transvaluation of values as radical as anything in the history of intellect.\\" No wonder Warren Harding won the presidency in 1920 with a campaign that promised a return to \\"normalcy.\\"With the advent of the Great Depression, Progressives were given an opportunity to reprise the coordination achieved under Wilson's war socialism. The British journalist Alistair Cooke doubtless turned many heads when, in the 1970s, he announced on his popular PBS history series that America under FDR \\"flirted with National Socialism.\\" Goldberg argues that the amorous relationship was a good deal more intimate--a relationship fanned by the populist hot air that emanated from Father Coughlin and Senator Huey Long and consummated by many of the individuals that ran Wilson's war agencies. A prime example of these fascist retreads was Hugh \\"Iron Pants\\" Johnson, whose \\"sock in the nose\\" style at the National Recovery Administration doubtless drew positive reviews from one of FDR's early admirers, Benito Mussolini. Even Germany's new Fuhrer had words of praise for the government-business partnerships that typified Roosevelt's New Deal.The expansion of government under Franklin Roosevelt is well known. What isn't acknowledged in polite historical circles, as Goldberg notes, is how \\"the fascist flavor of the New Deal was not only regularly discussed\\" but even \\"cited in Roosevelt's favor.\\" Why this inconvenient fact was dropped down the historical memory hole is clear. Leftist historians had no desire to link the paragon of modern \\"liberalism\\" with \\"right-wing\\" fascism. Stated more honestly, they didn't want to acknowledge that fascism was a left- wing philosophy and expose the ongoing historical ruse that kept conservatives (i.e. classical liberals) off balance.The remainder of Goldberg's book (more than half) discusses progressivism's third wave of influence on American life in the 1960s and explains how its fascist traits have been incorporated into modern \\"liberalism.\\" While not as narrowly focused as his first four chapters, these materials do give further definition to the concept of \\"liberal fascism\\"--a phrase coined in 1932 by H. G. Wells to promote an ambitious \\"liberal\\" variant of Europe's burgeoning political system.Among the concepts that Goldberg identifies as integral to sixties radicalism are these: the romantic embrace of youthful impulsiveness and sexuality, the denigration of reason and tradition, the extension of politics into all areas of life, the exaltation of identity politics (initially in terms of race and gender), and the justification of violence committed by revolutionaries intent on creating a mythical heaven on earth (e.g. the Black Panthers). All these themes, Goldberg notes, have significant corollaries in the fascist regimes of Italy and Germany.What separates these 60s street radicals from Great Society and contemporary progressives, however, is the smothering maternalism that characterizes the latter groups. Today's \\"liberal fascists,\\" unlike their European and turn-of-the-century American forebears, promote a religion of the state that is non-militaristic. As such, it resembles Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, not George Orwell's 1984. No better example of this smothering maternalism exists than Hillary Clinton's magnum opus, It Takes A Village--a mythical world where helpful government programs cover the social landscape and where repetitive video messages inculcate useful parenting tips \\"any place where people gather and have to wait.\\"Another Goldberg chapter, Liberal Racism: The Eugenic Ghost in the Fascist Machine, shows how \\"eugenics lay at the heart of the progressive enterprise\\"--an assertion backed by historian Edwin Black, who noted that the eugenic crusade was \\"created in the publications and academic research rooms of the Carnegie Institution, verified by the research grants of the Rockefeller Foundation, validated by leading scholars from the best Ivy League universities, and financed by the special efforts of the Harriman railroad fortune.\\" This embarrassing skeleton in the Progressive closet is compared with the implicit pro-abortion subtext in the best-selling book, Freakonomics--namely, \\"fewer blacks, less crime.\\"Regrettably, Goldberg's final chapter, The New Age: We're All Fascists Now, begins to treat fascist traits so eclectically that the precision and focus of earlier chapters is lost. Looking for fascist themes in Dirty Harry and Whole Foods Market is a bit like searching for grandmother's features in little Ricky's newborn mug. One is bound to find something, but isolated traits don't amount to a close likeness. A similar critique applies to Goldberg's afterword, The Tempting of Conservatism, where playing (perhaps badly) at the only governmental game in town seems to be confused with religious devotion to the political Weltanschauung exhibited in It Takes A Village.Despite these end-of-book drawbacks, Goldberg has produced a popular book of rare historical depth and quality--a book that promises to scrap those ridiculous history-class charts that put democracy midway between \\"socialism\\" on the left and \\"fascism\\" on the right, then justify their totalitarian extremes by bending the linear ends into a globe where left and right magically \\"meet.\\"An old Soviet joke asserted that loyal comrades know the future; it's only the past that keeps changing. With Goldberg's assistance, Americans can begin to rewrite their own political history, this time putting the \\"fascist\\" label where it belongs. That single alteration would be a momentous accomplishment--one that would make the architects of democracy's future more sure-handed.Review by Richard KirkRichard Kirk is a freelance writer and a regular columnist for San Diego's North County Times.

His emphasis on the political and occupational ideologies surrounding fascism rather than its institutional basis can be distorting.By pairing the ruthless militaristic version of fascism a la Hitler and Mussolini with the \\"smiley face\\" social welfare version of Franklin Roosevelt, Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama he provokes and alienates the political Left from understanding what fascism is. In so doing, his book could be viewed as a polemic rather than a value free scholarly work that can help both conservatives and liberals better understand the phenomenon of fascism. In sum, Goldberg's definition of \\"fascism\\" could be seen as an equally \\"fascist\\" attempt to define fascism - as a form of counter-fascist fascism.What Goldberg seems to be getting at, however imprecisely, is what German sociologist Max Weber once described as the \\"iron cage\\" of bureaucracy. Weber saw a highly rationalistic and bureaucratic social order as an \\"iron cage\\" in which people become trapped. \\"Iron cage\\" is a metaphor for the increasing rationalization of human life, which traps individuals in a cage of rule-based control. It is probably no coincidence that what Weber saw as the historical expansion of bureaucracy in Germany eventuated in Nazism.We mostly live in oligarchies at both the national and local levels as Weber accurately prophesized. Our lives are controlled by one percent elite of the population even at the community level. Our schools have become impersonal assembly lines which produce politically correct dunces. People are coerced to get professional licenses or credentials for work that does not necessarily need to be regulated by the state and which does not protect the public from harm. Smokers have been pushed out of office buildings and restaurants and even residential apartments by phony second-hand smoke regulations that cover up the fact that it is air tight energy-efficient building regulations that created such fascism. Conversely, liberals view neo-conservatives as \\"fascists.\\"I believe this is why fascism has been mostly undefinable - because the paradigm for understanding it has been flawed. I may be wrong but that is how I see Goldberg's important but possibly flawed book which I nonetheless give a five score for precipitating a much-needed discussion."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"As a history teacher, I've always struggled to explain fascism to my students, and I have been guilty of the old \\"liberal = left, fascism = right\\" mantra, even though it seemed to be a strange fit.

Highly recommended for anyone interested in politics or history."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book might put liberals to the defensive, but it does clarify a lot of issues revolving around the rise of fascism in Europe and how its ideals are still alive in today's most powerful democracy. The role of the State, the need for unity, the permanent need for a crisis are questions still present in today's politics and liberal views sometimes do not go too far away from those exposed by European fascists in the early 20th century.

In fact they prove a point of Goldberg's when he says that today fascism is mainly identifed with Nazism. And so it proves true with these government educated libs.

A worthy supplement to the names, dates, and one sentence summaries you remember from school.

A great book, i highly reccommend it, thanks buddy"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Liberal Fascism is a book with one insight to peddle and many parallels to illustrate. The insight: fascism has more in common with socialism than it does classical liberalism. How can this be the case? The answer lies in the numerous parallels between twentieth century Progressive thought and the fascist regimes that emerged at the turn of the century, and then grew prominent until the end of World War II. To say the resulting image is provocative is an understatement. To say the image is clearly illustrated is not.Admittedly, Goldberg's parallels between modern liberalism and the fascisms of yesteryear are glaring, but many of these same parallels can be drawn between fascism and modern conservatives. To his credit, Goldberg devotes the last chapter of his book to making this point. The many chapters before, though, are stacked with comparison on comparison of modern day liberal with yesterday's fascist. These numerous comparisons quickly undermine the persuasiveness of Goldberg's theme, mostly by obscuring the forest for the sake of the trees. The resulting effect leaves one wondering if the book could have been better organized. Even so, a few parallels do stand out.Most glaring in my opinion is the common reliance of modern liberals and selected fascists on socialist thoughts and paradigms. Their aims may be different, but both have used socialist sophistry to undermine the democratic controls and public institutions championed by classical liberals. Goldberg subtly makes this point several times, but individual chapters devoted to recounting actual assaults on specific institutions and practices may have been more compelling to my sometimes dull-witted mind.Nevertheless, although Goldberg's primary insight may be a little fuzzy, he does make clear what could be the most prevalent currents in the larger sea of human vulnerabilities. Politicians of both stripes tend to swim these currents, herding selected schools of voters to this net or that. If there is one thing to take away from Goldberg's book, it is how to recognize these patterns, how to trace them to their roots, and how to stay on guard so that what happened in Italy and Germany \\"can't happen here.\\"For some readers, a good follow up to Liberal Fascism would be Amity Shlaes'The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg has finally confirmed my life long suspicions about the position of fascism on the political reference scale. Liberal Fascism is a well researched, erudite discussion of the history of world wide fascism from Benito Mussolini to Adolf Hitler and the American presidents on both sides of the political divide. Only through a detailed discussion of the elements of fascism can one fully comprehend the breadth and scope of the insidious spread of the various totalitarian regimes on both sides of the Atlantic and through the mysterious arab middle east. Goldberg's Liberal Fascism is just such a work. The reader might want to keep a dictionary nearby while reading this illuminating revelation because Mr. Goldberg is a scholar and the book is a scholarly study of Italian Fascism, German Naziism, Russian Communism and the various American spinoffs of those early forms of government regulation.To attempt to compare modern liberals with the discipline called \\"classical liberalism\\" by Mr. Goldberg would be fruitless without fully understanding what those belief venues actually were. But by doing so, the reader suddenly realizes that times change and political name tags change with them. And it is simply incorrect to think of the American colonists and the founding fathers of the United States of America who evolved out of that colonization as 'liberals' such as those who often dominate the American political scene today.

Was it just another Glenn Beck like rant manufactured to besmirch anyone not a steadfast Republican trooper?While Goldberg offers some compelling evidence linking a variance of socialist philosophy to the fascist creed, he provides little if any balance in his erudition, failing even to mention the role played by England's moderate egalitarian Fabian Socialists---indeed, the precursors to that country's Labour Party. Ultimately he comes across as someone with a Paul Bunyan sized axe to grind instead of having created a vetted historical piece of scholarship. The greatness of our democracy lies not in the ranks of political pundits who robotically jabber out their doctrinaire talking points, but rather in those who have the courage and innovative spirit to face the tough problems and work with people of opposing points of view to develop legislation and policies that meet the pressing demands of the people. The fight against totalitarianism is an excellent example of this, as was shown by the 'liberal' Roosevelt and the 'conservative' Churchill during WWII. Goldberg just strengthens the idiotic, ratings driven, red/blue divide!I am no apologist for the excesses of the left, however, and I continue to fear the totalitarian state brought to life in the book 1984. But could we not turn the Orwellian nightmare on its edge and find a strain of totalitarianism in the smiley faced corporate culture with mandated blood tests, state of the art psychological testing, and where the public discourse is held sway by influential and much quoted Sunday morning TV news talk underwritten by defense contractors? Now, from my recollections the 1960s was a rather anti-ideological era; the 'liberal left,' with the exception of a few who joined Hari Krishna cults or held to the Marxist line, was, if anything, an ubiquitous cultural rebellion against the conformity of the 1950's \\"corporate man in the grey flannel suit.\\" It seems, therefore, that one could easily reconfigure the evidence to suggest that corporate conformity did more to deny individual freedom than any increasingly irrelevant liberal state? Let's look at Bill Clinton, the fellow who did away with much of our welfare system as we knew it; far from a New Deal liberal, President Clinton followed more in the ideological traditions of a Rockefeller, Nixon, or a Dewey; he simply outwitted Republicans at their own game! The essence of liberalism for me is found in the philosophical writings of John Stuart Mill, a pragmatist with a deep hummanist bent--a far cry from the hateful diatribes of a Mussolini or a Hitler! Yet somehow a growing number of people have come to the conclusion that liberty is defined in doing away with all government, with the exception of the military, of course! Yet our most recent experiment with the old trusty invisible hand---Bernie Madoff style---resulted in pick pocketeing Americans out of nearly 60 billion dollars.Sorry for spoiling the 'tea party' folks, but the progressive movement's greatest regultory legacy arrived in the passage of the Sherman and Clayton Anti-trust Laws: establishing a critically needed governmental authority which fueled the world's most dynamically competitive economy for nearly a century. And, after all, wasn't it ironically a form of corporate socialism which necessitated such interventionist 'liberal' legislation to begin with?"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book as a one volume treatise shattering the myths about progressivism & putting political history into its proper perspective. However, I found that Goldberg's writing suffers from ADD. The author starts off on one topic, let's say Hillary Clinton & \\"It Takes a Village\\" for example, and then runs off to chase down the life story of a minor historical character/political influence -- and then never really return to the interesting premise he set-up. The whole book reads like a bunch of great false-starts in terms of story-telling and then gets distracted by its own copious research. The author would have been better suited to slowing down and writing several books covering this broad subject, or focusing one book on the most relevant historical incidents cited in the book. I now find myself creating a new reading list to go back and read about Woodrow Wilson & FDR's New Deal on their own rather than in the messy way he explored the topics in this book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The title of Mr Goldberg's book may be somewhat inflammatory and perhaps off-putting for some people.

Jonah Goldberg traces the roots of progressive philosophy and politics, including the well-documented mutual admiration between the Wilsonians and New Dealers and the architect of modern fascism, Benito Mussolini.

For those of us who study history, it is a well documented and researched study of anti-freedom forces and how they surreptitously erode our freedoms. Teachers especially show master this book before they teach American History or Government.,Having seen the actual fascist instructions organizations like SDS gave to their dupes to radicalize the young, I have always known that much of the left was fascist in nature, using outright Nazi tactics to shout down those who disagree, rather than face the oppressive nature of their ideas. Goldberg shows the intellectual and philosophical roots that underlie the left, ideas which really began to grow American government and steal away Americans rights and freedoms under the administration of Woodrow Wilson. Progressivism is fascist in nature, and brought us such things as loyalty oaths, involuntarily sterilization, eugenics, and internment under the Wilson and FDR administrations. Today it manifests itself in the seizure of private property by the wrong use of eminent domain (see Sandra Day O'Connor's scathing dissent on Kelo), nannystate government interference in private, individual and unalienable rights, and the enforcement of politically correct speech instead of academic freedom. Columbia University which once fawned over Mussolini, now fawns over the Iranian Islamo-Nazi.While written for a general audience, this book will require serious thought and study.

I see the main premise of the book is that people are free so long as they are good which is a common accepted premise. People are not free to be bad. It is the definition of good is what the liberals tend to define and that government should stamp out all they define as bad. It is that definition of good as liberals define it. You are free to run a business but we control who you hire. We you are free to run a business but as long as the government sees it in the public good. You can raise a family but to the liking of government. Many on the right accept the big government premises that it is the state that is to mold humans in some rational way. The problems is that as people are free to be good they are also free to be bad. The book goes into the way many of the accepted premises were at one time radical ideas. Freedom itself was a radical idea at one time. The book and forgotten past history is very relevant today.This is a great book but unfortunately most of the lessons of the book will be lost in liberals who will reject the premise of the book. I is pretty much written to the choir. It goes into depth to show many of the similarities of modern liberalism and fascists. The evidence is well documented and he is very explicit in the similarities and difference of the two movements. I see the book as further documentation of what I think but liberals will see the book a brow beating and that is no way to impart ideas. In many ways the book does brow beat liberals.In many ways, I think the book can be better organized. It seems to jump around a great deal. Too many times when Gold burg is trying to make a point about modern liberalism he goes into the philosophical discussion of past movements when they should have been done in that topic. It comes across and liberals are fascists and here is why. His explicit comparisons detract from the points because no one wants to think their ideas are fascist. It would have been better if he built a case of what fascism is and then just describe modern ideas and movements and let the reader make the connections. He needs to be more coherent what true liberalism is that we are free from government control.The book is a very difficult book to read, he introduces many great thinkers and a variety of ideas. Just the history and exposure of Woodrow Wilson who's history is explicitly anti-freedom. He makes very good points on the attitude of liberals as never being wrong. It is a good guide for conservatives to recognize the groupthink and trends in liberalism they may agree with or want to come together on. More important liberals need to take into consideration how many of their ideas have been anything but liberating in the past. The worst part of this book it will give liberals a visceral reaction to the way the book is written. In that important messages will be lost."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book is brilliant.

He does at times stretch a bit too far, but on the whole I think he makes a fair case.For far too many people, \\"fascism\\" has come to mean only it's German variant. Orianna Fallachi and others, however, correctly identified Soviet Communism, Italian Fascism and German Nazism as branches on the same family tree. American fascism is far less violent, but ultimately leads to the same goal: total domination of the state and those who control the state over everyone else.Goldberg's analysis is shrewd and perceptive. His dissection of Hillary Clinton's \\"It Takes A Village\\" is, at the same time, wryly humorous and very frightening. What it boils down to, opines Goldberg, is that Clinton wants the state to assume the role of parent. Goldber summarizes that \\"National Socialist educators had a similar mission in mind\\". So of course did Soviet and Italian Fascist educators and government bureaucrats.Particularly interesting is Goldberg's recounting of the interplay between Communism, Fascism, Nazism and the New Deal during the 1930s. Many people who are unfamiliar with find the information here new to them and will at first be inclined to say Goldberg has it wrong.No, Goldberg has it right. FDR's New Deal was greatly influenced by the \\"social experiments\\" of the Soviets, Italians and Germans. When you compare the programs of the Germans during that period with the social \\"do-goodism\\" of today in the United States and Western Europe, you can see the direct relationship.Goldberg is not a historian and doesn't claim to be. In fact, if Goldberg was an academic, he would probably be too frightened to publish this book. It is indeed a partisan book. Those on the left-wing will not like it, will not read it and even though they haven't read it, will disparage it.But every person with an open mind who is concerned for the future of the United States of America and its Constitution should read it. Sooner rather than later.Jerry"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Very interesting in defining terms such as Naziism, totalitarianism, fascism, etc. An interesting exploration of the history of the development of liberalism and some of its roots. The author could have been more persuasive by avoiding some obvious bias toward particular liberal groups--his facts were more compelling than some of his editorialization.Overall, I felt that when I finished reading this, I understood better the poor use of terms in our political landscape, that there is something to be said for a movement toward libertarianism; he makes an effective argument against the continued intervention of a progressive government and it's \\"religious\\"-like mentalities.Definitely a well-researched book; sometimes terminology and history placed without a good context for those not as well versed in political history; sometimes that author overexpresses his personal bias when his facts could have spoken for themselves. However, nonetheless a book worth reading to understand the U.S. political landscape, whether you agree with the author's political leanings or not."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg has written a very important book in \\"Liberal Fascism, the Secret History of the American Left, from Mussolini to the Politics of Change.\\"Goldberg carefully documents (there are hundreds of footnotes) the close ideological, tactical, and even linguistic connections between European fascists and the American Progressive movement of the late-1800s through Woodrow Wilson's \\"War Socialism\\" and Roosevelt's New Deal. That this is not well known today is largely due to the American left's selective amnesia and the Stalinist tactic of labeling as \\"fascist\\" any leftwing movement not under the direct control of Moscow. Hence, Moscow even labeled Leon Trotsky and Franklin Roosevelt \\"fascist.\\"In fact, Goldberg points out, that communism, socialism (including Hitler's Nazi Party, \\"Nazi\\" standing for the National Socialist German Worker's Party), fascism, the American Progressives, and modern American liberals, all stand for the same thing: control in the name of improving society. Mussolini himself, Goldberg reminds us, coined the term \\"Totalitarian.\\" At the time, \\"Totalitarian\\" wasn't the bad term it's come to mean. For Mussolini \\"Totalitarian\\" was defined as: \\"Everything inside the State, nothing outside the State.\\" A totalitarian world view meant that all is within the State's interest: religion, health, culture, and even people's private lives.In \\"Liberal Fascism\\" Goldberg asserts that Hitler's Nazis can't be defined solely by their irrational hatred of Jews that led to the Holocaust. Rather, if one strips away the uniquely German aspects of Nazism, or the uniquely Italian aspects of fascism, one is left with a core set of beliefs that elevate the State above the individual - for the supposed good of both.And what are those core beliefs that Goldberg so readily identifies? From the start, American Progressives and European fascist theorists admired each other and exchanged ideas. From William James to Georges Sorel, from eugenics to the militarization of society (\\"War on Poverty\\" anyone? It was William James who penned the \\"Moral Equivalent of War\\" in 1906), both the American left and European fascists sought to remake society using crises to urge action to justify bigger government at the expense of individual liberty.Ronald Reagan had it right in 1981, when he remarked that Roosevelt's New Deal had much in common with Mussolini's fascism, including frequent words of praise from Roosevelt's brain trust directed towards Italy in the 1930s.So, read \\"Liberal Fascism\\" and be confident that, if you're an American conservative (meaning that you're a classical liberal) and a modern-day liberal/progressive calls you a \\"fascist\\" that they truly have no clue of what they speak.Reviewer: Chuck DeVore is Vice President of Communications and a senior fellow for fiscal policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Close examination reveals, however, many connections between liberalism and fascism than modern liberals might care to admit. His stuff is fascinating, particularly on the roots of progressivism and on Mussolini, Wilson, Hitler and Roosevelt.Liberalism and fascism are cousins, descended from the same ancestor, progressivism, in the form represented by Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and developed by thinkers from the late 19th and early 20th century. All three:--Claim to be a middle way or third way, beyond capitalism on the right or communism on the left;--Claim to herald a new era where experts, empowered by government, apply rationality to solve every problem of human existence;--Seek to neutralize or eliminate independent power centers such as religion or family in favor of a dominating national government;--Use war imagery (the Peace Corps, the War on Poverty) to address domestic problems, to justify mobilizing the population but also to energize a young and arty base bored with average life;--Bash corporations in their rhetoric, but actually seek to rule through them. Big corporations end up colluding, because such regulation, while burdensome, puts their smaller competitors out of business; and--Claim to represent new energy transforming and changing a moribund society.Fascism developed differently country by country. In Germany it was racial and anti-Semitic, but Mussolini, who actually developed it and a more formidable intellectual than history remembers, made his in Italy mostly about nationalism and progress. In America, it's a kinder, gentler fascism, about big government and domestic programs. Mussolini and Hitler took many of the same approaches that the New Deal did.Liberal fascism in America, though, has been at times repressive, notably under Wilson during World War I. Wilson nationalized half of American industry and also sent 175,000 dissidents to jail. The Palmer Raids and Red Scare following the war were all under Wilson's administration, making it uncomfortable for liberal historians to write about; they can't admit these events were on his watch instead of those of his Republican successors.Mussolini, a prominent Socialist newspaper editor, created a new party during World War I which appealled to many Socialists supporting their country, rather than the international socialist \\"let the capitalists destroy themselves\\" line. After the war, his supporters were about \`getting this country moving again', as it were, moving out of the moribund prewar society into a new modern world where expertise, science and national will could accomplish anything. Mussolini and Hitler both had a lot of support on college campuses and among professors who saw them as a rebellion against the establishment. Both admired American progressivism, and American progressives and liberals admired them back. Progressives thought democracy and capitalism were dead. Futurism, a cool art movement of the Twenties, was about fascism.Hitler was anti-corporate, bashing big companies on behalf of the little guy, then essentially making them part of the state when he took power. Hitler's non-smoking, teetotaling vegetarianism and cultist ideas were widespread among the Nazis and much like the New Ageism far more common in liberal circles today than in conservative ones. Hitler fought smoking much as liberals today do. He sought to sweep away Christianity and religion in general; he dealt with the Roman Catholic Church just to neutralize it, but his long-term plans called for its extinction.I never understood FDR's National Recovery Act and its blue eagle until reading about it here. Companies were supposed to stamp the eagle on products to show their support of the New Deal. It was much like the swastika in this sense. This is what Rush Limbaugh and others in the right have been getting at in their comparisons of Obama's imagery to Hitler's. FDR's people were repressive their first couple of years in office.The 1960s student movement, campus-oriented like early Hitler supporters, violently intimidated opponents like the Black Shirts. Hillary Clinton and the \\"politics of meaning\\" get a turn, with a good look at the Social Gospel - left-wing Christianity - driving Hillary. She was the front-runner when this book was written. A second edition has a chapter about Obama. After reading even the first edition you'll have an utterly different perspective of Obama's sweeping plans. A good chapter is on eugenics, a creature of progressivism and Margaret Sanger's primary motive in pushing birth control. Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a recent interview said she thought the point of Roe v. Wade in legalizing abortion was to reduce the growth in populations \\"that we don't want to have too many of.\\" So it looks like these ideas are still around.Stalin created the fiction that fascism was the polar opposite of communism. This became the party line and \\"fascist\\" was hurled at their opponents, as it is to this day. The first one to get it applied to him, was Trotsky. Huh? Lenin, meanwhile, had had good things to say in the early 1920s about Mussolini, and was sorry international socialism had lost such a talented leader.Goldberg bends over backwards not to accuse liberals of wanting to send you to concentration camps. That's because, he says, American fascism is different - the kinder, gentler variety. It's about the control of your life by bureaucrats backed by experts who collectively know better than you, how to run it, and who want to mobilize your life for the good of the nation, or of the world. (As they see it.)This book is a victory for conservatives who get called fascists every day. They want to know: Why is conservatism - which preaches small government, which supports religion and your right to practice one of your choosing or none at all, and which seeks far less regulation of your behavior - constantly labelled fascist? Liberalism, fascism and communism all believe in big government. Conservatism doesn't."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Too many of us have lost sight of what government is supposed to be and are being sucked into the ideas of the media.

This is an eye opener."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Perhaps the most intriguing history of ideas which I've read in a long time. Mr Goldberg's thesis is that Italian fascism, German fascism (a much wider phenomenon than its anti-Semitism and the Holocaust), and American Progressivism all have common roots in the scientism, romanticism, and philosophy of the nineteenth century. His argument is that these roots, notably the American movement, are the source of what is now identified as liberalism in American politics and culture. He spends eight of his ten chapters making his case, and doing so largely in the words of Italian and German fascists and American progressives and modern liberals. The disturbing part of his book are the last two chapters and its afterword, which reveal, again in the words of political and cultural liberals, how the ideas which he has identified as fascism have so thoroughly permeated both our thinking that we are no longer aware of their presence or able to be self-critical regarding them. There are two things which I find annoying about the book. The first is that it requires me to re-think many of my own conclusions about the presuppositions of European and American culture these past several centuries, as a conflict between vacillating urges toward rationalsim and romanticism. The second is that Mr Goldberg ought really have spoken with someone in the field of classics before attempting to translate Greek words, and should have discovered the readily available information that the fasces were not a bundle of mutually reinforcing reeds but bundles of rods, sometimes with an ax bound into them, carried before certain Roman magistrates as a sign of their imperium (the power to command), which allowed them to punish (with the rods) and in specified circumstances to execute (with the ax) their fellow citizens.

You basically have a fascist state in its infancy; where every means of influence and force will be used to chastise, ridicule or compel \\"the people\\" to follow its dictates or face reprisals, revenge, and/or intimidation through one or all of those systems or means of influence and pressure. Every lie will be re-enforced, supported and defended by the puppets within them, who have betrayed their honor, their country and their countrymen to be a part of the \\"party\\".This is indicative of the current Democrat Party. It is no longer democratic to be a Democrat...it is more like being a storm trooper of the liberal fascist and socialist movements. \\"In other words\\" the Progressively Deviant Godless Liberal Fascist Party of America or the \\"Yes we can!\\", \\"Change is coming\\" and \\"Obama-nation\\" society we are currently living in.However, Obama does not shoulder all the blame.The Clinton's are culpable, the Kerry's, the Kennedy's and the Rangel's, the Dodd's, the Schumer's, Boxer's, Frank's, Byrd's, Pelosi's and Reed's are all hip deep in this Social Fascism being stuffed down the throats of the American People.Unfortunately too many young people are so brain-dead through mental manipulation by the teachers, entertainment and media...that they have no intellectual weapons (critical thinking skills) with which to fight back. The dream is fulfilled by the Marxist and Stalinist and Mussolini's of the left when an actress can directed how one votes.Equally culpable are the Chris Matthew's who sold his soul to partisanship, the Keith Dobermans' (sic), Larry King's, Rachel Maddox's, and that Dan Rather guy...who sold his honor to corruptly support the fascist of the left. Let's not forget the Chris Wallace's, Barbara Walter's, and Oprah Winfrey clones on the view who are so far left they have become the handmaidens of Stalin and Adolf...or the apologist Alan Comb's and Bob Beckel who point out with great zeal every crack in their opponents armor, while pretending to be fair and balanced...but make elaborate excuses for every flaw their party leaders exhibit or encountered.Along with countless others, especially actors and actresses who are so elitist they squeak when they walk...who feel it their duty to turn traitor to the true history of this nation, their countries glory and their honor and supported this anti-American revolution into American Fascism. Just like good little stomp-in-fuehrer drones.Add to that the great hypocrisy of our Liberal Theo-Phobic elitist aristocracy in the halls of congress...calling others the very names they are themselves...like liars, racist, sexist, hate mongers and fascist; and America is doomed to repeat the worst episodes in history. The inmates are indeed running the asylum.Conservatives and/or Republicans would be well advised to carry a hand mirror into any discussion, interview or debate and simply hold it up to the person asking questions and making charges or ridiculing them about an issue...so that person can see who they are really talking about.The most poignant statement of this book among the thousands of brilliant characterizations of the American Left's overwhelming success in causing the destruction of true American Principles, values, ideals and liberties is this.Only slightly adjusted by me...\\"Democrat operatives...in all walks of life...have initiated a deviant minority/special interest uprising, led and manipulated by an (self-aggrandizing, egotistical and hedonistic) intellectual vanguard of elitist determined to replace Christianity (and divine certainty), the Constitution, and 5,000 years of wisdom with a political religion that glorifies \\"their People\\" (mostly themselves) and who are anointed (by themselves) the Revolutionary Guard...or the priest...of this new WAY, with the singular power to give or take liberty, freedom and rights...to...or from...the individual.\\"American's of all colors, shapes and backgrounds have been manipulated over a half century of corrupted evil thinking and planning to walk blindly...like those young people (the Eloi) in that old version of \\"The Time Machine\\" into the clutches of the corrupted (Morlocks) to be devoured by the monsters below. In this case the unopposed liberal fascist and socialist of the left today.And it is tragic for the world, our nation and our people that like the two societies in this movie both parties today have lost sight of the intelligence and character of Man at its peak; and are sliding down the far side of greatness, morality, righteousness and divine blessing into a self-destructive phase of ignorance.America unfortunately is on the fast track to repeating history...the history of Italy, Russia and Germany.It may take another 25 years or a half century to get there fully...but we are on (with liberals in all places of power and influence) a monorail-like track...and if the left remains in power as they plan to, with all that misappropriated money they conned the simpleton left wingers into granting them, after this last election, we will arrive sooner than that.The three greatest criminals in this tragedy are:Bill and Hillary Clinton who made bitter enemies of the two partiesBarak Obama who is using race & fear to turn America into a weak communist, socialistic and Muslim indulging nationAnd Nancy Pelosi who could not open her mouth for eight years without degrading our last true president, George W.

Golberg connects all the arcane, hidden, obscured dots to give the reader a factual account of the rise of modern American liberalism, which he calls \\"smiley-face facism-'nice' facisism.\\"No, he does not call modern liberals Nazis or deny the Holocaust (with his Jewish roots this would be bizarre indeed). What he does do is to examine how the word fascism is used by people who have no idea what it actually means, then provides a working definition of the term. He then points out that, minus the death camps, gulags and racial predjudices, modern liberalism shares a lot of the same ideology with historic Fascism, Nazism and Communism, (I always thought this was obvious) further pointing out (what I also always thought was obvious) that these three are all decidedly left-wing ideologies. It was the leftist Stalin who, reinventing the terminology, accused any leftist not sharing all of his particular leftist views of being right-wing. However underneath the rhetoric all of these ideologies shared very similar basic assumptions. So one service Mr. Goldberg has done is to explode the myth that Fascism and Nazism were/are right-wing ideologies.Goldberg traces the rise of American liberal ideology from Benito Mussolini, through Adolf Hitler, and American Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy. Again, he doesn't argue that these American presidents were, or modern liberals are, genocidal racial purists, he simply points out that racial purity was merely one plank in the Nazis' liberal leftist platform, and that there are many other ideological similarities between modern liberalism and these historic ideologies.At 405 pages of text the book is fairly hefty, however it reads rather quickly (at least to me.) Further, the book also has 53 pages of footnotes, so Goldberg's references can be checked by skeptics. All-in-all its a fascinating history of the rise of fascism and modern liberalism's debt to this leftist ideology. Goldberg's book should act as a corrrective to a lot of sloppy scholarship, generalizations and misunderstandings.I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg's book is a tour de force of history and political philosophy that should remain relevant well after other contemporary political tomes have lost their punch.Many \\"official\\" reviewers have focused on the historical analysis, and the revelation (to the common reader) of the leftist characters of Hitler and Mussolini. One point that Goldberg makes, but (apparently) needs re-emphasizing over and over again, is that these men and their fascist or Nazi cohorts were never, ever right wing in the American sense of the term. Given that America's electorate has never really had a strong, popular, explicitly socialist component, the socialist mindset of the Italian Fascists and the German Nazis would absolutely have belonged on the historical left in this country. Indeed, Goldberg goes to great lengths to bring out the mutual admiration that the Fascists, in particular, and the American progressives shared. The initial chapters of the book, from Mussolini and Hitler through Wilson's \\"War Socialism\\" and FDR's revanchist progressives, are very enlightening and have generally been well-received.Where many reviewers, especially (though not exclusively) on the left, have tried to split the baby is in the later chapters, where Goldberg traces the fascist influence of the Progressive movement through modern liberalism. The natural progression of the argument is that if modern liberalism owes much to FDR (as many claim), and FDR's group were largely trying to recreate Wilson's progressive nirvana of a controlled war economy in peacetime, the fascist nature of the Progressive movement must have survived in some form to the present day. Indeed, he demonstrates this quite well, though far too many reviewers tendentiously ignore this logic.Far too many readers have incorrectly latched on to the discussion of certain lifestyles or (vegetarianism, for example), to mischaracterize the argument. Goldberg does NOT say that because Hitler was a vegetarian, vegetarians are a whisper away from being Nazis. He rather makes the point that much of what you'll find in the progressive, Nazi or fascist agendas had little to do with evil schemes to dominate or exterminate other people, and much more to do with attempts by the state to control or regulate personal or economic behavior in a way intended to make people better off. The craze for restricting trans fats in certain jurisdictions, for instance, makes more sense in a historical context when you realize that totalitarian regimes of the past really did believe in a holistic approach to the state's involvement in citizens' welfare. The cultish, coercive elements of the Nazi's social welfare views, therefore, are the focus of his argument, and many who would rather ignore these points feel the need to create straw men rather than engage the argument.The arguments put forth in this book are elegant and persuasive, even if you may find areas to disagree with here and there. However, if you're really interested in engaging with the philosophical skeletons in the closet of the American left in a serious and thought-provoking way, read this book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Expertly researched, conveyed in an accessible tone, and witty throughout, this diatribe is an excellent resource for those on the Right and Left. Providing a sound survey of what he believes to be fascist movements throughout the 20th century (by leader's name, the Mussolini, Hitler, Wilson, FDR, Kennedy, and Clinton movements), Goldberg successfully proves his case that the ones who are most vehemently opposed to fascism (modern liberals) have their very foundations in that political ideology and continue to espouse fascist thinking to this day. The only problem is that Goldberg forgets to mention that modern liberals aren't the only ones who perpetrate fascism--everyone does these days, including those who consider themselves to be on the Right.Goldberg does preempt this criticism in the afterword by pointing the finger at the likes of Pat Buchanan and George W. Bush, saying that, yes, fascist thinking does occur on the other side of the spectrum as well. But even still, Goldberg misses his opportunity to point out how severely fascist pretty much all politicians are these days, no matter what side they're on.Upon reflection, one might believe that all successful politics are based in fascist thinking--that's just what politics is all about these days. A glance at Goldberg's definition of fascism makes this clear. In an indistinct way, he describes fascism as having the following characteristics: creation of crises, calls to unity, celebration of martial values, blurring of lines between public and private, utilization of mass media to glamorize the state and its programs, invocations of post-partisanism, and a cult of personality. Noting that various modern liberal administrations have all mastered these techniques, Goldberg says that they're fascist. But Goldberg fails to note that all political administrations, whether they are modern liberal or self-proclaimed conservative, must have these characteristics to be successful these days; it's just a byproduct of a decadent culture--the voters are to blame--not any single given political party.One other contention I would make is with Goldberg's summary of William James' Pragmatism, which likens the theory to the notion that if you believe something, it's right. James was far too astute a thinker to make such a false claim that his followers (Mussolini) may have made. And though Goldberg never really pinpointed where in James' arguments he made this claim, he never really exonerated him either.This, to me, is no less deceptive and coercive than the politicians Goldberg rails against were and still are. Indeed, exaggeration and propagandistic tactics like this could be considered fascist in themselves. Pointing the finger is one fascistic tactic that Goldberg touched on as well. This is not to say that Goldberg is a fascist, but only that it goes to show that fascism is more prevalent than one might think these days--it thrives in those who denounce it, and even in those who denounce the denouncers of it.The intellectual gymnastics can be challenging when trying to sort out the claims in this book. But given the needed diligence, one will find this work full of insight, and will ultimately agree that \`Liberal Fascism' must be included in any well-rounded study of modern political thought."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg does us all a service by reminding us all of the failure of the libertarian / conservative factions to force the Left to own their history. I don't blame them for this, but the acknowledgment of the failure is important: as a reminder of where we are and how far we have to go to offer a true, powerful defense of freedom.BTW, the Kindle edition does not have the Hitler-stached happy face on it.

This book adds a fascinating wealth of information and context to the history of the \\"Progressive Movement\\" in America, (1900-1940). Examples include Prohibition, the Palmer Raids, eugenics, loyalty oaths, state capitalism, and the draft, among others -- in short, American fascism.The book challenges popular misconceptions with so many detailed examples that some time is required for reflection, at least for this reader. It is hardly the breezy read suggested by the smiley face on the cover. Nor is it the right-wing rant some portray it to be -- history speaks for itself here.I strongly recommendLiberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaningto anyone who seeks greater knowledge and understanding of the evolution of our political culture, past, present, and future."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Mr. Goldberg really did his homework here. He shows, as concisely as possible, the direct link between the ideas that birthed Fascism, Nazism, and Progressivism (the parent to modern Liberalism). When \\"fascist\\" ideals are examined honestly, and in their entirety, you can clearly see the direct relationship those ideals have to modern day liberal thought.Excellent job!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg's basic premise is that the major totalitarian movements of the last century, Communism and Fascism, share common roots in the utopian movements that began with the French Revolution, and that the Fascist/Communist split was not a right/left divide, but a civil war among leftists. This is a result of fascism's origin in the schism between those who sought to create an international order of socialism (the Bolshevik Revolution), and those who tied socialism to individual nations, creating a national socialist movement (the Nazis, Italian Fascists, etc.), resulting in two strains of totalitarian thought that were united by common assumptions in economic outlook (socialism/central planning), political thought (totalitarianism/state control of all aspects of public life) and means (militarism as a means to organize civil society, persecution of political dissidents, manipulation of public information through censorship and propaganda) but divided over superficial trappings.This is a meticulously researched book and if I have one complaint, it's that the subject matter really needed more space for the extensive documentation to come into play. The chapter on Woodrow Wilson's administration, for example, which the author argues was the introduction of fascism to America, could have been a book on its own. As it is, it's a great introduction to Wilson's ideological background and the extent to which the progressive era was rooted in the assumptions of the same philosophies (pragmatism, syndicalism, socialism) as the European fascist and communist movements.This is not a book that liberals will enjoy reading, but it is a book that they ought to read, if only to understand the origins of the arguments that they perpetuate. If the reviews of this book are any indication, however, they won't."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I've just finished \\"Liberal Fascism\\" and found it a fascinating history and exploration of the liberal movement. At times, it did make me squirm as I have liberal leanings and learning the origins of some of my political thinking was uncomfortable but so very worth it.Thank you so much for the education. It has inspired me not only to write this review but also has influenced, no solidified, my political thinking. The conservative movement by its very nature looks to the past to illuminate the future. The liberal movement has no such rear-view mirror and so often repeats histories mistakes. Many liberals in my life seem to rely more on \\"truthiness\\" than the Truth when conveying their opinions and beliefs. I can not tell you how often I have been shouted at simply because I asked for a concrete example, an historic fact or provable data. This is so frustrating because conservative arguments are nailed by their facts while liberal arguments are as slippery as water snakes.Which is why I keep by my computer a quote by Burke \\"A loosening of Morals leads to a hardening of hearts.\\"The liberal enshrinement of moral relativism has lead to a hardening of hearts - a closing of minds if you will - in America from the university to the science laboratory to the ghetto. I hope that everyone who reads your book sees as I do - a call for and a bulwark against this unthinking, non-reflective trend. It is a path that dumbs down intelligent debate on all our most pressing issues.Liberal Fascism points out that liberalism in its current form is not the ideological purity that its adherents believe it to be. This levels the playing field and perhaps will lead to better mutual understanding between the good folks on both sides of the political spectrum."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I thought it was a great book, and it added a carefully researched and reasoned point of view to the political spectrum. I anticipated an Ann Coulter-esque blah blah blah-type experience (I borrowed the book from the library, so there was no monetary investment on my part) and was really chastened and surprised. Although I see the elements of \\"I know you are but what am I,\\" Goldberg is careful to recognize it as well - admitting that what started the work off was his annoyance at being branded a \\"fascist\\" while suspecting that the moniker was more appropriate to those doing the branding. I don't have a problem with that. It is completely different than all the other conservative intellectual stuff out there right now and frames the current political debate in a completely new way. I was really impressed.I have read over 100,000 pages this summer - literally getting through entire library sections - and Liberal Fascism was one of the best. In my opinion, its a must-read for people looking for something a bit more academic, but imminently readible."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Through much of my life I was trained to believe that fascism was integral to right wing extremism, until I began to read, listen, and reason later in my life; it then became clear I was mislead. And then this very important book came along. The problem is fascism can be hard to define; and because the definition has been so warped over the years it becomes all the more difficult. We usually think of Nazi Germany and Italy, but we have now developed a form of \\"nice\\" fascism. I believe today a majority think that somehow the \\"far right\\" is just as destructive as the far left, and that we must seek some \\"middle\\" ground for the greater good; and it is if Left and Right is not on a straight line, but somehow curves around to finally meet upon its horrible self. If conservative and \\"right\\" are one in the same, then Right extremism is what we desire----show where it leads to fascism. Are we not exceptional because of our conservatism? We can look at the \\"25-points\\" Nazi platform and see how shockingly consistent it is with today's' liberalism. Let me make this clear, this is only a comparison; I am not saying the liberals are Nazis. \\"Fascism is a religion of the state\\"----the state becomes God.Goldberg sees clearly, and brilliantly traces the roots of fascism; and we will discover fascism is very much intellectual. While consuming pages I asked myself whether he would encompass a certain topic----he eventually did. This is a welcomed and timeless thesis. There are end notes with extensive resources.Who says America cannot be sucked into fascism. All it needs is a crisis and fresh packaging----a new guise; \\"the best of us are susceptible to the totalitarian temptation\\". But haven't we already? It has been marvelously disguised of course: first with Wilson, then FDR, and now the invention of Barrack Obama. And don't take the libertarian or conservative word for it; listen to the early progressives (whom Goldberg quotes liberally) and it becomes clear; it is frighteningly mirrored to what we see happening today in America. Liberal fascism can probably be traced back to Rousseau and the French revolution; and of course Darwin was also a major influence. With historical revisionism none of us are immune (including Republicans) to not seeing fascism for what it is, wherever it is----read your history! Liberalism, progressivism, or whatever you want to call it, is ideology driven----so the end justifies the means, whatever that may be. I believe few will admit that \\"progressivism was a sister movement of fascism, and today's liberalism is the daughter of progressivism\\".\\"Liberals are never responsible for historic misdeeds, because they feel no compulsion to defend the inherent goodness of America. Conservatives, meanwhile, not only take the blame for events not of their own making that they often worked the most assiduously against, but find themselves defending liberal misdeeds in order to defend America herself.\\"LORD BlessScott"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"If it weren't for using the actual words of the people involved and citing the references, Mr. Goldberg could easily be dismissed by popular culture commentators. The myths that he dispels are so numerous and so thoroughly obliterated that those who cry against our former president and fawn over our current president, were they to try to address his research, would be left looking like the shills for Marx, Mussolini, Hitler and Lenin that they truly are. Indeed, connecting these three, alone, IN A WELL DOCUMENTED FASHION, is entirely worth the price of admission. Throw in Wilson and Roosevelt, and you have really stirred the pot. This book really represents a paradigm shift from the things we learned in school, and what is accepted as 'conventional wisdom' in the excuse for true public discourse we have come to accept.Go, Jonah!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Warning: This book was very, very dense. It was not easy to read (though not uninteresting), and it must be taken in small bits (say, 1/2 of a chapter at a time). I can't imagine how long it must have taken to write this book, let alone get the reading background necessary to be able to develop the author's ideas.Just a few, very limited points (in the interest of brevity and readability of my review):1. One of the most valuable things that this book did was to clarify the original meanings \\"liberal\\" and \\"fascist.\\"2. In many ways, this book complements/ develops ideas that were introduced in other classic books, such as \\"Knowledge and Decisions\\" (Thomas Sowell) and \\"The True Believer\\" (Eric Hoffer).3. It is very insightful that Hitler was a person who was looking for a movment as a means by which to catapult himself to power and not the other way around (looking for power in order to carry out a movement). Anti-Semitism was (and is) just as likely to be a movement of the left as the right.4. The book could have been made a bit easier to read, but one senses Goldberg's passion for the topic and his trying to put in as much detail as he thought that reader would be able to bear in order to make his case.5. His discussion of the cult of personality VERY ACCURATELY foreshadowed the Obama administration and the dynamics that exist in present time. The chief of Staff, Rahm Emmanuel has said \\"Never let a crisis go to waste.\\" Apparently, this line of reasoning is common to people who want to remake the world-- a state of crisis is a good reason to bend the rules to \\"get things done.\\"6. The research and level of detail in this book is STUNNING. There is also some formal economic reasoning here when Goldberg talks about the incentives of governments to have smaller numbers of larger businesses (rather than larger numbers of smaller businesses) and the mutual benefits (to governments and big businesses) of high compliance costs (=it will drive people out of business who can't afford the compliance costs and eliminate the competitors for the bigger businesses).7. This book upgrades some ideas of \\"A Conflict of Visions\\" (Thomas Sowell) by actually dealing with the ideas of LIVING (or recently dead) intellectuals (Al Gore/ Susan Sontag) and giving us a step-by-step breakdown of the line of reasoning that goes into shaping their ideas."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This may be a little cliche, but this book is a quintessential example of, \\"When you draw a lot of flak, you know you're over the target\\". A good indicator of a great book is the number of 5-Star AND 1-Star ratings. If you look at the 1-Star ratings, the comments are mostly shallow, contain a lot of name-calling, and they seldom contain any examples to back up their flames. Either they haven't read the book or they've only read the introduction. The book itself is a well-documented history of Marxism / Socialism and its consequences. Goldberg convincingly argues that Fascism is leftist (Marxist, socialist). Corporations seldom backed Fascist leaders prior to their rise to power (remember, corporations are mostly amoral, profit is their primary goal).Up until I read this book, I thought that the term \\"progressive\\" was simply a euphemism for spending a lot of money on bad ideas. I never realized that it went back to the very beginnings of Marxism.Marxism is a vision of a utopia that can never be realized on earth. Marx developed his theories in the isolation of libraries, and were never tested in the real-world prior to publishing. The primary fallacy of Marxism is its neglect of the flaws of human nature. All utopias rely on the false hope of the emergence of a \\"New Man\\" where humans evolve to a higher level of behavior. The reality is that humanity will always fall short: humans are a greedy, self-centered, immoral, lazy, and ungrateful bunch of louts. When is the last time you heard someone say, \\"Thank You\\" after getting a government handout?The academics who are Marx's greatest cheerleaders are a sweet bunch of well-intentioned fools - or as Lenin put even better, \\"useful idiots\\". Brilliant fools are still fools. Academics have the great privilege of spending their entire lives living in Marxist Utopias paid for by capitalists. They live in an insular culture where they only associate with those who have beliefs similar to their own. The worth of their labor is judged solely by their peers. This leads to an increasingly abstracted set of ideas and beliefs that steadily diverge from reality.Marxism has slaughtered more people than any movement in history. Now they are saying, \\"let's give it one more try\\". And these are the same people who want to \\"save the polar bears\\" based on an abstract theory called \\"global warming\\".

I knew fascism is a term that has been used in so many ways as to make the term seem meaningless. But Mr. Goldberg is a very engaging writer so I decided read the book to its end. In fact Mr. Goldberg has written a very well written and informative historical work.Mr. Goldberg defines fascism as a quasi religious movement of \\"emotional or instinctual impulses, such as the quest for community, the urge to \`go beyond' politics, a faith in the perfectibility of man and the authority of experts, and an obsession with the aesthetics of youth, the cult of action, and the need for an all powerful state to coordinate society at the national or global level\\" (p. 14-15). Mr. Goldberg considers fascism as utopian and believing there are few areas of personal life outside the purview of the state. Thus fascism rejects the idea of natural rights enshrined in the American Declaration of Independence.In contrast to popular belief fascism does not need to be racist or aggressive in foreign policy. Mr. Goldberg considers much of the early nineteenth century Progressive Movement and present day liberalism in America as leaning to fascism. He points out that Mussolini's Italy started out without any anti Semitism and stayed without such an ideology until World War II. The Nazi identity politics is not critical to fascism.Mr. Goldberg provides a wealth of historical information about the statist \\"third way\\" movements of the Twentieth Century. He demonstrates how fascist tendencies reduced liberty in both America and Europe. He finds plenty of spots on the record of Woodrow Wilson who all too often a hero for historians.This very well written thought provoking book is must for consideration.

I hear fascism being used to mean Nazis. This book describes the lost history of why fascism was popular. It talks about Musselini, Hitler, and Woodrow Wilson. It talks about how communism and fascism are not opposites but very similar in action and ideas. It then describes how liberals fit into the whole fascist idea. Many are miseducated on how the progressives actually did thing. I was shocked by how much Franklin Roosevelt did that was not right. He was the American Dictor. I did always wonder why people liked him. He made what conservatives hate... welfare and more business regulation. He also did what liberals hate... made the CIA, increase presidental power(more than Bush ever did), and had plans for imperialism. He also did what everybody hates now... made the Japanese concentration camps. This guy is celebrated because of misconceptions. Of course, radical liberals have the tendency to fancy people like Castro and Stalin so no biggy if Roosevelt is a dicatior. This book is good to describe how dictatorship (not just fascism) is a temptation for liberals and conservative both.

How to use an overabundance of adverbs which are meant to sell you on an idea instead of having an actual merit. (Tech writers like myself call it marketing speak).2. Randomly throw out beliefs to persuade the reader, even though the points have little or no relevance to the topic that you are discussing.3.

I read a lot of pre-WWII fiction and was often surprised when I heard progressive-seeming characters utter fascist sounding viewpoints. Now I know why.What keeps this book from getting 5 stars is that, in his zeal, I don't think Goldberg always consistently keeps to his definition of fascism as a \\"religion of the state.\\" A few times Goldberg characterizes something as fascist because it displays an incidental quality of fascism rather than an essential one. For example, in one chapter he argues that certain films are fascist because they display Nietzschean themes, rather than because they advocate worship of and dependence on the state. While it could be argued that Nietzsch influenced fascism, he was not essential to it, or to state worship.Despite it's flaws, however, I found this to be an excellent book that really opened my eyes to the authoritarianism of many liberal leaders."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Liberal fascism?It's understandable why liberals get angry when they see this book displayed. When I saw its cover and title, my first reaction to Jonah Goldberg's LIBERAL FASCISM was to disregard it. It looked like another partisan hatchet job on liberal/progressive politics, and a tacky one at that. That impression soon disappeared, however, once I started browsing its pages. Don't let Hitler Smiley Face on the cover or its ostensibly oxymoronic title (which was actually coined by H.G. Wells back in the 1930s) fool you: LIBERAL FASCISM undoubtedly is a polemic, and not without flaws, but it's also a good book, with a startling and provocative perspective.To give a short version to the long story behind this controversial book, Los Angeles Times columnist and National Review contributing editor Jonah Goldberg argues that much of modern liberalism is actually the offspring of 20th century progressivism, which in turn shares intellectual roots with both Marxism and European fascism. Throughout much of Europe the communitarian impulse expressed itself in socio-political movements that were militarist, nationalist, and often racist. In the United States this same impulse took the form of progressivism which was better suited to American culture, but no less militant in its crusading spirit, and at times just as nationalist and as racist in expression, as its fascist counterpart. The ultimate goal of American progressivism was holistic society, similar to what the writer and social critic H.G. Wells approvingly dubbed \\"liberal fascism.\\" (People interested to further explore Wells' fascist/totalitarian tendencies, should read his THE SHAPE Of THINGS To COME, which speculates on a future course of world history from the 20th to the 22nd century.)Like I mentioned, the book does have its flaws, most of them due to Goldberg's static and often deliberately simplistic ideas for what constitutes \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative,\\" and his refusal to consider these terms ever as relative signifiers, or to use them outside a 21st century American context.Such a point brings me to Goldberg's habit of grouping all communitarianism/collectivism exclusively in the left corner. It's just not true. Goldberg ignores, for example, the fact that collectivism was at the heart of traditional Russian society, long predating Marxist and other forms of modern socialism. He makes no mention of the communistic aspirations at the heart of Christian millennialist sects like the Levellers and Diggers of mid-seventeenth century England, both groups being offshoots of Oliver Cromwell's Puritan New Model Army. Such historical phenomena don't fall neatly within the clearly drawn lines of contemporary America's liberal vs. conservative dichotomy. Neither does neopaganism, the occult or ethically-based vegetarianism, anti-vivisectionism or a host of other things which fascinated nineteenth and early twentieth century European society as a whole. Occult and neopagan beliefs, in fact, were prominent within certain elements of Europe's Right, not its Left.Closer to home, Goldberg does better work with the incipient fascism in 1930s American populism; correctly exposing, for instance, the left-wing roots of Louisiana governor Huey Long and radio commentator Fr. Charles Coughlin. On the other hand, the omission of William Dudley Pelley, George Lincoln Rockwell, or movements like the Silver Shirts and the Black Legion from a book focusing on fascist tendencies in American politics makes one suspicious. The aforementioned names and groups all were openly and proudly fascist--and all also shared origins in traditional American conservatism. By not mentioning any of these individuals or organizations it makes Goldberg look like he was cherry picking facts; ultimately this is more detrimental to the book's worth than either the title or the Smiley Hitler graphics of the cover.Nevertheless, Goldberg still would've been better off, in the long run, choosing Orwell's \\"Oligarchical Collectivism\\" for the title."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"If you are looking for a book that will challenge your understanding of recent history, then I recommend this book. If you want something that reconfirms your beliefs and understanding, then don't read it.

Even if you don't agree with the author, it will make you think.I've seen the negative comments. The book isn't \\"newspeak\\".

Nonsense; it's simple, well written, and straightforward. Its premise, though, is one very difficult to accept. Alas, the truth always is!P,S.: Kudos to the editor: the hitlerian Happy Face on the cover deserves a Reuben Editorial Cartoon Award!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Firstly, a word of advice to overworked professional reviewers, such as those from Slate, the UK Guardian, The New York Times, and especially The American Prospect's splenetic David Neiwert. Maybe you should start with short books, such as Naomi Wolf's recent bestseller on America's coming fascist society, written at a Monarch Notes level and appearing in excerpted form in the Guardian. Ms. Wolf summarizes the characteristics of fascism, all of which are materializing in Weimar America. Certainly she is not guilty of extremism or ranting; I don't think any major reviewer dismissed her as a crank. We are, she says, on the verge of a faccist dictatorship led by the Republican Party.By contrast, the Guardian's review of Goldberg's longer and more involved book couldn't seem to get past the title. Of course, the word \\"liberal\\" has a different meaning in European countries than here, and Goldberg sometimes shifts from one meaning to the other. The Guardian's Stuart Jeffries sniffily says that all this political posturing may make sense for Americans but not for Brits. And since the Guardian is one of the only major papers in London that doesn't have topless women in every issue, a few of the \\"chattering classes\\" surely took note.But even such witty responses mainly focused on the title of the book. American reviewers and high-profile bloggers typically mention Goldberg's points about Hitler's vegeterianism, which any reader knows are simply made in passing. Or, bypassing the specifics of Goldberg's argument, reviewers like Timothy Noah of Slate, after admitting that Goldberg once insulted him, weakly likens the book to an Ann Coulter diatribe. Again, journalists: stick with short and palatable books that reiterate received wisdom: maybe Malcolm Gladwell's Blink?For those of us who enjoy reading, Goldberg offers a lot to think about. He startles us by showing that in the 1920s dictators were not viewed as dangerous and Mussolini was held up as a model. He differentiates Hitler from Mussolini, showing that Hitler was no ideologue and certainly not fan of big business, but rather something of a Machiavellian showman. And while Hitler may have hated Bolsheviks, it was akin to a sibling rivalry. Goldberg builds on this with an account of the fascist-like tendencies of wartime America: Woodrow Wilson's belief in a controlled, state-centered society with strict restrictions on civil liberties; Roosevelt's similar inclinations to a dictatorship of the federal government. Is this fascism? No, but it is a form of socialism as it was understood at the time - the tendency to see society as a body with the government or a domineering figure as the head. Goldberg goes on to liken the fascist impulse to various versions of statism or collectivism, including Hillary Clinton's sense of a protective, benevolent government.This is where Goldberg runs into trouble, or well before this. And I think he would be well aware of the trouble. He often appears to be chafing under the implications of his provocative title and backpedaling by saying that he is not calling liberals Nazis. Like many interesting studies, Goldberg's book is more interesting than its thesis, although the point alluded to in the title does serve as a sort of maguffin that gets the whole thing going. Many of his Goldberg's comparisons (e.g. between Italian fascism and Wilsonian democracy) merely show that political labels are hard to pin down. Also, progressivism, or the tendency to plan the future of a society, is a phenomenon that knows no political stripe. Goldberg, like Karl Popper, has a gripe with \\"historicist\\" progressives - Hegel, Marx, Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, and so on - who try to script the unpredictable evolution of nations. (Those who scoff at the idea that Fascism and Communism may ever have had common cause should read up on the Hitler-Stalin pact and compare Nazi Propaganda with almost-identical Bolshevik imagery. They were not opposites or bitter enemies.) In addition, Goldberg complains about \\"pragmatists,\\" American philosophers who believe in a relativistic sense of moral values. (E.g. William James: \\"it's true if society at a given time thinks it's true.\\") It is here that he writes as a traditional conservative, not a classical liberal. The book ends up going too far by giving the impression that any social movement or attempt to address social problems may reek of fascism.That doesn't mean you shouldn't read it. Goldberg's account of Mussolini's American popularity, his reading of Mein Kampf, his retelling of the Wilson and Roosevelt years, and his comments about '60s radicalism - all these passages are interesting mainly because they come from an unaccustomed perspective. Far from being the lightweight polemicist cocktail party journalists have tagged him, Goldberg is an engaging popular historian, mixing anecdotes, biographical storytelling,and statistics into a messy but rich political picaresque.And if it stimulates discussion, great. I think that's what the ambush (started by Slate's Timothy Noah before the book was even released) was intended to prevent."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I'm not a great judge of vocal talent but I really enjoyed Johnny Heller's narration over these 16 hours (in two parts). His voice is very clear and his pauses and reading style are appropriately expressive. As for the work itself, it's outstanding! I read it last year and loved it. I was about to open it for a second time when I thought that maybe it would steep better in my mind via audiobook. The arguments are so important and essential that they're worth a second hearing. Conservatives like me get bashed with the bogus label of fascist all the time so it's quite helpful that Goldberg set the record straight here. This is a first class book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"\\"Liberal Fascism\\" speaks of the relationship between the Fascist intellectual tradition and practice and the Liberal-Progressive movement in Twentieth Century America. Author Jonah Goldberg draws comparisons between the practices of Progressives such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, FDR and modern liberals with those of fascists Benito Mussolini and Adolph Hitler. The section on the Wilson administration raises interesting facts about the numbers of people imprisoned for criticism of the government. Administration standards for loyalty were shocking by today's standards. The New Deal programs setting wages and prices fits into the fascist economic model.Goldberg makes the case that fascism is really a phenomena of the left that is identified with the right only because leftists wanted to distance themselves from what had become an unpopular movement and the fact that, where they competed, leftists and fascists hated each other.This book makes for some interesting thinking. I think that Goldberg makes a good case that fascism is close to liberalism in that both movements emphasize government direction and control of the economy and details of everyday life. This is in contrast to modern conservatism that finds its roots in classical liberalism which emphasizes freedom from government economic controls and intrusions into everyday life. I am somewhat skeptical of comparisons between the various regimes. Does it really follow that because Nazis and the modern liberals assert an obligation to be healthy and want to restrict unhealthy products and practices establishes that they are similar movements?Jonah Goldberg states that he wrote the book because he was tired, as a conservative, of being labeled a fascist. I think that the import of this book is what it tells us about labels. It tells us that anti-Semitism is not a characteristic of fascism, but is merely a practice of some, but not all, fascists. It tells us that modern conservatives are the heirs of classical liberals, not fascists who are really left wing, not right wing. It tells us that modern Progressives and liberals really do have something in common with fascist movements. As Goldberg says, that does not mean that Woodrow Wilson, Hughey Long, FDR, LBJ, and Hillary are fascists. It does mean that they share some values and tactics with fascists and that says as much or more about fascists than it does about American liberals."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Liberal Fascism is a book more frightening than any thriller. Woodrow Wilson was awful. I never heard about his abusive tactics in my history classes.Rugged cowboys and explorers are always thought of as \\"independent\\" type people and independent thought is associated with the right. People working \\"collectively\\" for each other and sharing is a left progressive view. Totalitarianism is part of the happy faced fascism (hence the cover of this book) because totally everything is done for \\"our\\" good. Again a LEFT idea. But the book bashes the so called Left and Right for both being Fascist which is correct. The Constitution is being buried.Liberal Fascism defines TOTALITARIAN \\"views EVERYTHING as POLITICAL and holds that ANY ACTION BY THE STATE is justified to achieve the common good. It takes responsibility for ALL ASPECTS of LIFE, including our health, and well-being and seeks to impose uniformity of thought and actions, whether by force or though regulation and social pressure. Everything, including the economy and religion, must be aligned with its objective. Any rival identity is part of the \\"problem\\" and therefore defined as the enemy.\\"So does the definition fit?The residential home foreclosure mess was caused by too much regulation by Congress and Presidents Jimmy Carter/HW Bush and Clinton) which interfered with \\"prudent home lending FINANCIAL qualifications\\". Residential homes became ARTIFICIALLY HIGH PRICED (a bubble) because millions of financially unqualified people (some single owner/some house flippers owning several and some buy and hold multiple home buyer speculators) were allowed into the buying pool causing a sellers market as there were too many buyers wanting homes than homes to sell. The government should not allow mortgage discrimination based on sex, race, where someone lives, etc. which is why the 1968 Fair Housing Act, 1974 Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the 1975 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA) were enacted. But government should allow mortgage FINANCIAL discrimination if a person cannot afford a home. Instead of bolstering one of the existing regulations if mortgage discrimination was still happening, in 1977 Jimmy Carter created the Community Reinvestment Act which snowballed into future presidential banking regulations by HW Bush and Clinton which resulted in lowering mortgage qualifications. The greed of ACORN groups picketing/suing banks to make unwise loans and forcing banks to give ACORN money to in effect stop picketing, the greed of banks (including Fannie/Freddie) in making loan fees, the greed of home owners using the resulting higher home home prices to take 2nd and 3rd mortgages to buy things they could not afford. Fannie/Freddie were flipping mortgages as fast as the private banks and taking in fees. At the first financial stress (2008 extremely high gas/oil prices/weakening economy) the marginal home buyers defaulted as did the multiple mortgage owners. Now the STATE wants more mortgage regulation because they know what is good for us. To counterbalance the untruthfulness and greed of homeowners was the untruthfulness and greed of banks. Politicians changed the banking rules enacted after the depression to prevent banks from gambling the money in the bank with risky derivatives and OTC trading, etc. The pigs were in the pigpen playing but the majority of Americans who didn't cheat have to eat the swill left behind because it is for the common good.Congress in an effort to please the executive state passes a TARP bill to buy toxic assets (bad housing loans) caused by Barney Frank/Chris Dodd/Maxine Waters refusing to rein in Freddie/Fannie and forced banks to make NINJA loans (no income/no job/ no assets) because EVERYONE should own a home. Banks had 2 choices to stop ACORN from picketing or suing them for racial bias - either make the risky NINJA loans OR pay money directly to ACORN to stop their picketing and/or lawsuits. Taxpayers now understand WHY financial institutions such as Bank of America give money to ACORN. Home buyers knowingly signed \\"liar loans\\" where they lied on how much they earned to qualify for a mortgage and some home flippers purchased multiple homes they could not afford in the hopes of selling again quickly before bills came due. When the defaults began EVERYONE \\"collectively\\" went down as the economy tanked instead of just the banks making the bad loans and the people who lied about their incomes to get the loans. Why? Because banks sold their bad mortgages overseas instead of keeping them on their books so they could care less if the NINJA loan defaulted. Why? Because Congress changed the rules to garner votes and everyone was flipping homes making lots of money inflating the real estate bubble. The taxpayer is then forced to pay back these foreign financial institutions funneling the money though AIG/Goldman Sachs under the guise of an American company bailout. Forget transparency-trust the State as they know what is best for us.The EXECUTIVE STATE branch then hires Tim Gietner to fix the banks. Gietner used to work for Goldman Sachs which helped bring about this mortgage mess and the derivative/speculative market mess. Geitner then hired all his Goldman Sachs buddies some of who still sat on Goldman Sacks board but the White House gave him a waiver. When Tim Gietner got to decide which banks lived or died, he used taxpayer money to bail out Goldman Sachs. Leyman Brothers was Goldman Sachs NUMBER #1 competitor so of course Geitner let it fail. AIG owed millions to Goldman Sachs so Tim Gietner used taxpayer money to bail out AIG and Goldman Sachs was first in line to get their millions back. Then Goldman buddy Gietner changed Goldman Sachs status from investment to \\"BANK\\" but in name only. No pesky unwashed masses (taxpayer) could actually open a bank account at Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs was called a BANK only to get access to these unwashed masses (taxpayers) money in the form of government interest free loans. Then Goldman Sachs used this taxpayer 0% bail out money to purchase smaller bank getting even BIGGER than its already \\"too big to fail\\" size. WORSE, the banks did refused to loan money to small businesses but instead put this government low interest rate loan money in oversea's banks which earn high interest rates (no Ben Bernanke there) and used the money on the interest to pay out big employee bonuses. And, of course, speculative/derivatives gambling never stopped so these banks are free to gamble even the taxpayer money. Timothy Gietner is doing what Timothy McVeigh could only dreamed of doing-destroying our Constitution/country.The STATE used this TARP (troubled Assets (bad mortgages) Relief Program) taxpayer borrowed money to actually BUY THE BANKS instead of just the toxic assets by bailing the banks out becoming controlling shareholders (converting preferred to common stock) and the banks who didn't need the money were ordered to take it so strings could be attached to these now puppet banks also. These bailouts were done over the majority of voter objections but it was done for our own economic good and it makes a good way to control the money though the banks. In one instance, the STATE threatened the Bank of America president and his board with dismissal if they don't play along and buy Merrill Lynch which was disastrous for their shareholders. What good is control if you don't use it? Let's give the Fed more control now says the STATE. The end justifies the means as it is done for our own good.Our auto industry is bailed out under the guise of preventing them from filing bankruptcy and losing all those jobs and taxpayers were promised they would make money on the loans. In reality, the STATE wanted to avoid a REAL bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler which would have allowed a judge to CHANGE union pay and contracts and the STATE could not allow that after all the election money the unions donated to elect the current STATE. Chrysler is bailed out and taxpayers told this was for our own economic good and then a forced marriage is made between Chrysler and Fiat and all taxpayer bailout money was FORGIVEN (not to be paid back) so a foreign country got an American company with a huge taxpayer funded boost. This loan forgiveness was never approved by Congress or the voters but it was for our own good.On paper after the tax payer bail out GM appears to be privately owned but in real life the STATE fires the GM president. The bail out was for saving jobs yet \\"randomly\\" auto dealers with fantastic sales were forced to close while politically connected not so good dealers were allowed to stay open and parts and dealer jobs bled all over the U.S. Ford didn't need any money because they build their cars in Mexico.The GM bail out was to avoid bankruptcy but GM goes bankrupt anyway but under STATE control so the union contracts are not affected. Again, the taxpayer is screwed because the bail out loans are forgiven in lieu of the STATE owning GM shares and becoming an owner. Again, the taxpayer and Congress was not asked as the STATE knows what is economically good for us.Contracts made with auto bond holders are broken in favor of unions when it is convenient for the State. Then the STATE turns around and justifies their bail out bill allowing the bank executive bonuses (Fed Reserve buddies) to stand because \\"the executives had a contract\\" which they did and they should have been upheld just as the bond holder contracts should have been upheld. Instead, public bad \\"feelings\\" swayed the state to break the executive contracts also. Constitution be damned.The above breaking of contracts for some is called \\"a feeling ruling\\" Like that female supreme court nominee who is a \\"feeling ruling judge\\". The law is fluid. One day a person goes to court and wins and the next day another person with the SAME concern goes to court and loses. Why? Because the judge's feeling was that one person needed a different ruling because he was disenfranchised, had a harder life, was the preferred race or sex or smiled prettier or was a union. Welcome to the world of the auto bondholders and executive bonus broken contracts. They were the wrong \\"flavor\\" of the day and \\"feelings\\" were against them. The Supreme Court just vindicated the firemen and repudiated this nominated judge's decision who has a 60% overturn rate by higher courts on her decisions. If anyone dared to criticize her, they were called a Hispanic racist and yet Judge Sonia Sotamayor discriminated against a Hispanic fireman also denying him his promotion along with the White fireman. Thanks to this fascist executive state this judge has no one above her to overturn her 60% fail rate record.Health reform is being jammed down our throats for our own good regardless of the fact most people are satisfied with their insurance and doctors and don't want to treat illegal aliens but this is for our collective good also. And to pay for it, a tax on Twinkies, more on cigarettes, a soda tax and a health benefits tax etc. etc. will be imposed on all of us by the State for the benefit of the common good and these things the State has deemed bad for the common people anyway. OCTOBER 2009 UPDATE- WORSE NEWS!!!!!!!!!!! Dick Morris told Bill O'Rielly (who was looking too SMUG because he will always be able to afford his private health insurance premiums) that the GOVERNMENT will dictate ALL PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY POLICIES so it doesn't matter if Bill Orielly still has his private insurance and everyone else is dumped into the government one. Bill ORielly appeared stunned. If this health plan passes, the mandates on cost will be imposed on ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES so if 99 year man (like Dick Morris' father) has a heart condition and needs surgery and this 99 year old has private health insurance - HE STILL WON'T be able to get it because the government controls what private insurance can do to keep down costs. WHY isn't anyone talking about this? I hope O'Reilly gets off his behind and gets his staff working on this.The State takes control of an entire television network for an hour to push a health care infomercial with no dissenting voices allowed in the interview room nor even any dissenting commercials. The state is doing another medical infomercial Wednesday on 8:00pm prime time AGAIN today. Even NBC, CNN and other State cheer leading networks are bulking at so much prime time being given to the State for its propaganda because it costs the networks money but they are afraid of what would happen if they refused. Retaliation is alive and well and that refused media outlet might find its reporter not allowed on the presidential plane (Like a Fox reporter) or not getting coveted rotated interviews, etc. SEPTEMBER 2009 UPDATE: Fox refused a Sunday interview when 5 networks were given interviews. Not to worry though because FCC Czar Mark Lloyd is on it. Lloyd wants government control of all media and plans on doing it under the guise of \\"diversity\\" so STATE opponents on radio and TV will have their ownership rights removed if they don't tow the STATE line. Google Mark Lloyd's video of him admiring how Chavez took control when his STATE took control of all the media. But don't worry, the STATE knows what you want to listen to.Iran's nationalized networks were shut down while they slaughtered their people and OUR networks voluntarily nationalized themselves rolling over freely for the STATE not only for this infomercial but for the pre and post election majority of the time. And the Executive State supports the Venezuela dictator Hugo Ch&aacute;vez so much the Executive State appointed an FCC Czar Frank Lloyd who is on tape admiring how Chavez took control over the media to win power. Contrast this with the Executive State standing against the Honduran people who kicked out their President Manuel Zelaya for attempting to change their constitution to stay president forever. Our executive branch wants that Honduran ex-president put back into power. The brave Honduran people defied U.S. Executive push and \\"Chants of \\"Yes we could! Yes we could!\\" bellowed from the crowd.\\"Tax and Trade is being rammed down our throats for our own collective \\"planet\\" good and EVERYTHING from food which is trucked in to our electric/gas bills will double. The majority of U.S. citizens do NOT believe in global warming but hey Al Gore and GE has too much invested now and are all set to grab up that tax money. GE owns NBC and has to be paid back for their Pro-State publicity. Forget that Cap and Tax hurt Europe and didn't work or that India and China won't do it and will continue to spew out garbage into the world to build the manufacturing base we let them take from us. Cap and tax is good for us.30 czars are hired into brand new Executive positions of powers giving them salaries/staff the taxpayers cannot afford, most of them radicals and no congressional approval for them or for the new positions. This is an end run around the Constitution and tilts power to the EXECUTIVE state. Congress approved secretaries of the different departments such as the head of the FDA, FTC, etc. are now potted plants because their control is given to unelected/congressional unapproved czars. Democratic Senator Byrd is the only one to call the Executive STATE on this power grab but he is ill and will die soon so the Executive state ignores him.UPDATE AUGUST 2009: Cash for Clunkers initiated scheme where U.S. taxpayers borrow $1 billion from the Chinese to give cash subsidies to buy a new car to everyone including the rich (don't need a subsidy) and poor (can't afford a new car). It also robs future months like September 2009 new car sales.UPDATE OCTOBER 2009. Cash For Clunkers total cost $3 BILLION and foreign cars came out ahead especially Hyundai which was #1 purchased car under CFC.program. 2 Oct 09, news reports came out that it cost EACH taxpayer $2000 a car and THAT does not include the years of interest paying back the loan. The report said the CFC program saved $500 in environmental costs. It also left a lot of used car dealers with no cars to sell because the CFC cars were destroyed. And new car sales for September Chrysler down 45% as was GM down in the 40's also and Ford down 5%.UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2009: While U.S. infrastructure crumbles and we go more into debt, the STATE authorized more auto jobs to go overseas backed by U.S. taxpayer loans - money borrowed from China. \\"A tiny car company backed by former Vice President Al Gore has just gotten a $529 million U.S. government loan to help build a hybrid sports car in Finland that will sell for about $89,000.\\" And U.S. taxpayer forked out another low cost loan for \\"$465 million dollars to Tesla Motors Inc., purveyors of a $109,000 British-built electric Roadster\\" to be built in England. The STATE says pollution is a global problem and U.S. taxpayer should not complain about a paltry billion dollars in loans for jobs going overseas as this is good for the planet.UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2009: ACORN is in trouble again and not just for voter fraud and the executive state does not announce an immediate state financial investigation. How could it? In 1995 the State Executive represented ACORN in forcing Illinois to accepting the Motor Voter driver license bill which definitely assists in voter fraud since many states have weak license requirements and illegal's and others not eligible use the license to vote. The State Executive taught ACORN classes and has them in his decision making process along with SEIU.UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2009: It was creepy enough for school children to be seen on video praising the STATE prior to the election but after the election 5 more creepy things occurred. 1) Children at Eagle Bay Elementary School in Farmington were shown a short video called \\"I pledge\\" on Aug. 28 2009 and 2) other children across the country are being forced to see \\"The Story of Stuff\\" video made by the Tides Foundation and 3) videos of children singing praise songs to the STATE leader under the guise of February Black History month are released and 4) the State leader himself gave a 'pep' talk to children (stay in school type things which is fine) but it didn't end there. The teachers were given \\"instructional material to teach AFTER the Executive State speech which was not shown to parents and was indoctrination materials asking asking children \\"help\\" the STATE LEADER achieve his goals etc. And 5) the STATE White House was caught on tape with the National Endowment of the Arts giving instructions to NEA taxpayer money supported artists telling them to GET the STATE agenda out using their \\"art\\" methods. They knew it was illegal and are actually on tape saying \\"while we figure out how to legally communicate\\". The NEA guy is moved to another position but nothing happened to the White House media woman named Buffy on the call also.But hey, the STATE says it REALLY doesn't want to \\"control\\" the banks, auto, health industries, schools, and media, all the while pushing for more Fed Reserve control over all companies, pay caps, regulations, etc. and making it difficult for banks to give back the bail out money and when they do, the STATE doesn't give it back to the PEOPLE to pay down the borrowed debt-OH NO- It keeps the money to loan/control more companies it doesn't really want to control.Smile! Even the Russian newspapers on 19 April 2009 called the U.S. fascist saying \\"The merger of corporate and government powers in modern America is plain and simple fascism\\" and Americans didn't even whimper.This book's definition of Liberal Fascism\\" will make your day and give you nightmares at night."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Neocon Jonah Goldberg has written a flawed but fascinating book. Critic David Gordon (Mises.org) has pointed out its factual errors but Goldberg gets 90% of it brilliantly correct.

The chapters on Woodrow Wilson and World War I, Progressivism and eugenics, FDR and the New Deal, and LBJ and the Great Society, are outstanding. However, the cherry-picked chronology ignores the Cold War 1950s, and therefore the inconvenient truths revealed in Murray N.

I am unfamiliar with author Jonah Goldberg, other than knowing that he is a conservative columnist. I have been hearing quite a bit about his book lately, along with another book titled The Road to Serfdom. I wasn't sure what to expect from the odd, brightly colored book with a red cover and Hitler smiley face on the cover. But I came close to biting off more than I could chew.While reading Liberal Fascism, I found myself laboring through the intellectual muddle in order to grasp the broad concepts that Goldberg offered. While the points were well constructed and organized, the language was precise but heavy. I am normally a fast reader. While this book has 503 pages, nearly ten percent of that length is Notes. That still leaves an extensive tome of fine print to work through. That challenge becomes even more daunting when the language requires more than one pass for the concept to emerge. I found myself going back over passages to ensure that I took the correct meaning away. While this was informative, it slowed me down considerable, relegating the reading to a chore at times.What I liked about this book is that Goldberg doesn't pull punches. He is well informed and thoroughly documents the extensive research that went into this book. Goldberg certainly knows his stuff. His writing is a mix of heavy but accurate descriptions offset by light cheeky observations. He begins with an examination of fascism that begins with an attempt to define the term. (Sorry, Bill Maher, Fascism is NOT when the corporations become the government). Actually, fascism appears hard to nail down in terms of definition. While a broad definition might be \\"an authoritarian centralized government,\\" the concept goes well beyond that. Goldberg begins by examining Mussolini, who created a strong central government, but also ensured the trains ran on time. There is a populist element as well as a great deal of socialist and even communist ideology that seems inherent to this term.Mussolini developed his political theories in the same environment as Lenin. In fact, there appeared to be some cross influence and mutual respect there. Goldberg also examines Hitler and the elements of Mussolini that influenced Hitler's own movement. After establishing common traits amongst fascists, Goldberg moves on to examine US Presidents that espoused many of the same values. He talks extensively about Woodrow Wilson, whose suspension of civil liberties and war-mongering along with his strengthening of the central government make him appear to be the first fascist American President. An examination of Wilson's education and early influences provide insight into his leadership style. Examinations of Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, JFK and Lyndon Johnson also add insight into the development of modern progressivism from its fascist roots.Along with an examination of Presidencies, Goldberg also takes a look at social and popular issues that have had an impact on progressivism. From the culture of the 1960s to Hollywood, Goldberg dissects influences that have infiltrated both parties. Taking a balanced look at the issue of progressivism, Goldberg finds damaging messages in everything from left leaning films to films he enjoyed himself, like the Dirty Harry films. While the container may be different, the message inside stays the same. Goldberg takes this lesson as an instruction, claiming that we are all fascists now. In saying that, he points to fascist tendencies and softens the blow with consideration of the fact that anything in moderation can be tolerated. But he also sounds the warning of the destruction that fascism will have on our way of life. With that, he examines modern progressivism personified by Hillary Clinton. The book was written at a time when Hillary was the heir apparent to the Democratic Party. His observations are actually fulfilled in a follow up chapter on Barack Obama and his rise to the Presidency.Goldberg has done extensive research, which results in an informed, intelligent and humorous examination of progressivism. His ability to keep things light with humor did not make the subject matter less weighty. While it did make the reading more enjoyable, it was still a difficult read. I enjoyed the book and the message, but labored through the reading over a three week period of time. I found myself having to break the book up into sections to work my way through it. It reminded me of the struggle I had working my way through Ayn Rand's tome Atlas Shrugged. While the latter took even longer for me to thumb through, Liberal Fascism was anything but an easy read. I would highly recommend this book, especially for political junkies. But beware what you are getting yourself into...this book will not be an easy read, but it will be an informative one.

Books like \\"Liberal Fascism\\" do not come along very often and should occupy a special place in any sincere and truly liberal student of history."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"A thoroughly researched work that nonetheless leaves the footnotes in the author's filebox, this is an indispensable addition to any reading list trying to account for American political divisions, particularly the otherwise confusing role of the Progressives, of the Roosevelts, Kennedys, and Clintons, and of the \\"Great Exchange\\" by which American liberal/conservative labelling become incomprehensible to the rest of the world.

After I posted my 1-star review, the review began getting numerous comments within 20 minutes. The comments all said variations of \\"no evidence you read the book.\\" My review's negative rating began shooting up, and within 45 minutes my review disappeared. Now, is it reasonable to think there are hordes of outraged citizens reading my review and instantly trying to get it deleted by posting identical criticisms? Or is something else going on? I strongly suspect the author (whose juvenile blog posts suggest he has the time and inclination) of creating some \\"sock puppets\\" and trashing his negative reviews.But my experience turned out to be a perfect example of the mentality of this book. It is not interested in truth, or scholarship, or genuine debate. No, it's just about shouting down the opposition and settling scores. The author has written how upset he gets at conservatives being labelled \\"fascists\\" and has proclaimed this is his attempt at saying, \\"I know you are, but what am I?\\"So he throws in a few footnotes at the start of each chapter to make it look like he's been doing lots of academic research. If you check the footnotes, they usually turn out to be some totally obscure person who has no relevance or influence to anything nowadays. Careful readers will notice that the footnotes drop away as each chapter flows into what are essentially op-ed \\"essays\\"; only then, when people are lulled into believing this is a well-supported thesis, is the supposed link between fascism and liberalism made (always on ridiculously flimsy grounds).The whole thing is laughable. Reading the author parse some totally ignored speech by Hillary Clinton for its fascistic undertones shows how weak this guy is for material. Of course, there's tons and tons of material to show how fascism and conservatism are very, very closely linked. But all that is verboten to mention here. To read this book, you'd think Hitler's main platform was free health care.Scholarly this ain't, that's for sure. This guy isn't a journalist or academic; he's just some dime-a-dozen op-ed writer. HNN had an online forum with real professors pointing out how muddled this book is, and the author \\"participated\\" by basically just brushing it all aside without addressing the criticisms. You see, academia requires proof, evidence, the ability to defend your thesis in open debate. This author knows he can't, so he will just ignore negative comments (or try to delete them). He simply retreats into his own closed-off community where no one will challenge him or point out his lack of qualifications, and where he doesn't have to actually put any real work into his thoughts.Sadly, this is another example of the conservative mindset of inventing a narrative to fit their predetermined partisan views. If anyone disagrees with them, you're likely to get something akin to the \\"no evidence you read the book\\" shutdown, as if no one could possibly legitimately disagree. I certainly hope no intelligent conservative would bother with a book like this. It's very insidious actually, and even desperate, the way it sacrifices truth for partisan advantage, and concocts a phony version of history dressed up with the trappings of academia to make it look believable. One day, the people who reinforce their partisan dreamworld by reading this kind of garbage will slam up against the real world, and it won't be pretty. But they'll have only themselves to blame."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg does a fantastic job of examining the roots of modern liberalism's \\"smiley face\\" fascism. He outlines in detail the leftist origins of fascism, tracing them historically through the rise and fall of European totalitarian regimes and the socialist policies of Woodrow Wilson and FDR. The chapter on Wilson's press censorship, jailing of political opponents and dedicated propaganda machine should be a wake-up call to all those who think Bush is a \\"fascist\\". There is certainly a case to be made that today's liberalism is just a softer, nicer fascism and Goldberg makes it.

So does the open quote of Chapter 10 \\". . . it is generally thought that National Socialism stands only for brutishness and terror. But this is not true. National Socialism - more broadly, fascism - also stands for an ideal or rather ideals that are persistent today under other banners: the ideal of life as art, the cult of beauty, the fetishism of courage, the dissolution of alienation in ecstatic feelings of community, the repudiation of the intellect, the family of man (under the parenthood of leaders). These ideals are vivid and moving to many people . . . because their content is a romantic ideal to which many continue to be attached and which is expressed in such diverse modes of cultural dissidence and propaganda for new forms of community as the youth/rock culture, primal therapy, anti-psychiatry, Third-World camp-following, and belief in the occult.\\" Susan Sontag, Fascinating Fascism, p. 358"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Great book. You come away with a much better understanding of today's world and what is happening!!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Well, if we are asked to swallow the quote in my title from Jonah Goldberg's book \\"Liberal Fascism\\", we can legitimately entertain the notion that American Webster Edgerly was the original Nazi, even if he was already prominent in his career when Hitler was still in knee britches. Edgerly, known to his devotees as Dr. Ralston(of Ralston Purina), was not a conventional politician, but he certainly saw himself as a revolutionary messiah. Like Hitler, he believed that he alone knew the right path for the salvation of mankind, or at least his countrymen.He became one of the leading health gurus in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As Goldberg points out, Hitler was also very health conscious, although the stress of his warmongering ruined his health. Edgerly advocated many details in one's daily life, including proper diet, exercise, hygiene and sex. He even created what he considered the ideal language. He attempted to create a utopian rural community as a model for others to follow, although only a few people were willing to go this far.However, like Hilter and Wilson, he was an adamant racist, advocating the castration of all-noncaucasian races in order to eliminate inferior races. He also taught his followers that they could control the thoughts of others by developing their personal magnetism, following his instructions. This, of course, was the primary means by which Hitler spread his influence before he seized Germany's military machine. Unlike Hitler, Edgerly was not interested in spreading his movement through strong arm tactics and militarism(other than castration!) However, clearly, his ultimate goal was to eliminate eveyone who didn't look rather like him and think exactly like him, which was also Hitler's basic goal.Like Goldberg, I find that clearly distinguishing between the pragmatic policies of Fascism, State Capitalism, soviet-style Communism, Socialism, Anarchism, Progressivism and various other isms of the last century that involve a high degree of group control over individual behaviour is virtually impossible. But, these various political movements can be rather easily divided into two groups: those that commonly used strong arm tactics, militarism, and dictatorial suppression to achieve their goals and those that sought to achieve their revolution peaceably by truly democratic procedures. Fascists are in one camp, liberals in the other. Thus, the term Liberal Fascism, invented by H.G. Wells, is an oxymoron. Some liberals in the 1930s considered FDR to be a slightly watered down fascist, while many conservatives considered him a slightly watered down communist. That should tell us something. Indeed, there was a well hushed up plot by some of the nation's leading tycoons to stage a march on Washington, forcing FDR to resign, replaced by a popular WWI general, who would serve as a puppet-like fascist dictator. I have long(past 50 years) considered the Stalin and Ceausescu regimes, for example, to be far more fascist(totalitarian and nationalist) than the Mussolini, Hitler or Franco regimes, for example. Membership in certain cults and organized crime syndicates provides a more fascist experience than the classic fascist regimes, if we replace the word national with identity group. Thus, Goldberg's main thesis that fascism, Soviet-style communism and extreme forms of progressivism have much in common, although possibly revolutionary compared to what most textbooks teach, should be old hat to any perceptive person who sees through this convenient compartmentalization by American historians.The optimal amount of governmental regulation vs. individual freedom, and benevolent dictatorial vs. consensus rule will always be controversial and will change with changing social, economic, political and technological conditions. The rapid urbanization and industrialization of most Western countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, along with military and economic crises, was bound to spawn an orgy of greater governmental regulations of various aspects of society. Greater dependence upon each other at the local, national and international levels necessitates more regulations to avoid occasional anarchy, extreme poverty and concentration of power among a small oligarchy. Greater threats from foreign powers necessitates more concerted organization at the economic and military levels. Greater mobility, urbanization and divorce rates along with job insecurity necessitates greater reliance on governmental and philanthropic programs to take the place of a weakened safety net of nuclear and extended families and close neighbors. True, an unfortunate side effect of the culture of allowing governments to regulate everything, to spend a sizable fraction of the GNP and to dish out entitlements, is a tendency toward overregulation, overtaxation and entrenched bloated bureaucracies, which can be very difficult to pare down to a useful size or to eliminate when they become antiquated or so autocratic as to be counterproductive.Goldberg's book serves to emphasize what perceptive people in the first half of the 20th century must have recognized: that pragmatic fascism, communism, socialism and progressivism share much more in common than their leaders will publicly admit. They rather remind me of the various spinter groups of Christianity, which at times have gone to war with each other, but in fact have much more in common than their doctrinaire differences. However, statements such as \\"Woodrow Wilson was the ...first fascist dictator\\" detract from the credibility of his thesis. He might have, with nearly equal justification written: \\"Abe Lincoln was the First Fascist Dictator\\". Lincoln was one of Wilson's favorite models and was hated by many Northerners as well as Southerners for his tendency to ignore the Constitution, Congress and the Supreme Court in attempting to squash opposition to his policies, and for his initiation of the draft and income taxes. He is considered by many Libertarians as an instigator of big government on a level with FDR(see Thomas DiLorenzo's \\"The Real Lincoln\\"). Others are willing to forgive Lincoln's excesses in these respects as necessary evils to accomplish his central goal of reuniting the nation by force."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Dear Professor, may I speak?When I attended an out-of-state university for one year, I was greeted with a less than enthusiastic reception by two of my professors. First was a philosophy class where I objected to the worship of Jean-Jacque Rousseau as the \\"god\\" of intellectualism, ethics, and environmentalism. I asked the professor (female) how she could give so much credibility to a man who wrote books about raising children, who advocated removing children from the home at the earliest possible moment, such as 3 years of age, to indoctrinate them into a product (proletariat) that served the \\"states\\" interests, when he had killed his own 5 children. So I was removed from the class.My second incident occurred in a poly-science course, when I argued the political model that showed the Liberals in the center of the political spectrum, Communism on the left, Conservatives on the right with Fascism just a little further to the right. He had drawn the model on the black board. I argued that this was not correct, and I believed almost all policies used to achieve societal consolidation, i.e. Communism, Socialism, and Fascism were identical. \\"Only the degree of recognition of international and national borders\\" determined the course to government totalitarianism. I was kicked out of the class and banded from any courses in the College of Liberal Arts, forcing me to transfer back to our instate University of Idaho.It took me until 2 years ago, after frequent consideration, to come up with a working model. And Jonah Goldberg has given me confidence and validation that my model was correct. Left-wingers are simply mouthing the propaganda of Joseph Stalin when they say that right-wingers are fascists. The \\"rising star\\" of communism, as Benito Mussolini was joyously named by Vladimir Lenin, broke the accepted communist model when the theory of borderless nations and class warfare was broken by ultra-nationalism in Mussolini's effort to unite his nation around socialist ideals. As Goldberg demonstrates, Communism, Socialism, and Fascism are differentiated by the rejection or recognition of international and national borders, but the ideology and \\"ends\\" are exactly the same. A proletariat is created as a tool or \\"means\\" of the over-throw of Capitalism or other form of government to create a new society of \\"social justice and equality\\" to be controlled by the elites, experts and professors, and ideologs who understand their \\"needs\\" better than the ignorant proletariat understand themselves.I am on my second read, and I was especially surprised at the degree of suppression that Woodrow Wilson subjected this country too. Some parts may be a little bit of a reach, but especially the foundations of the \\"Progressive Movement\\" are well outlined. It also helps me to achieve a clearer understanding of the connections between French Marxist philosopher Georges Eugene Sorel's \\"anarchosyndicalism\\" model of community and societal organizing, the \\"Vital Lie\\", the great \\"Myth\\" theories to Woodrow Wilson, and Saul Alinsky (this was not covered in the book). Excellent!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is one the best books I've ever read in the sense that it really forces you to grapple with a wide variety of political preconceptions you may have. Mr. Goldberg compiles an enormous amount of evidence that early 20th century Progressivism has much more in common with Fascism and Nazism than the average reader probably ever knew. Despite the provocative title, the author does not under-state the differences. He simply points out the extensive, largely unknown similarities. And despite the serious subject matter and the enormous research that went into this book, it's a very well-written and easy read.This book raises so many issues regarding the proper role of government, the extent to which it's fair to compare ideologies on procedural as well as substantive grounds, the extent to which linguistic limits hamper the entire debate and many other philosophical questions that I can't possibly do anything but trivialize them by pretending to write a synopsis here. I've posted a number of comments in the many, many forums that have cropped up regarding this interesting thesis, and I'll just repeat that this is wonderful revisionist history. You may not agree with the author's thesis. You may think he over-states the opposite thesis, but I guarantee you will learn more about Nazism and Fascism than you ever have, and you will definitely not think of them the same way again."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I think people should read this book. Why? It touches on various topics that are not well understood by most people and many that are considered taboo. For example: How many people out there know about eugenics and the fact that we had several states that had eugenic laws? Moreover, how many people know that several revered people in our History we not only supporters, but also funded eugenic research?I read various reviews, especially the negative ones, and many people charge the book as having erroneous facts and cherry picking. I have not seen one specific fact listed in the book properly challenged by any of these reviewers with actual facts that can be verified.Even if the author cherry picked passages of speeches, it does not make them untrue. It is part of the public record and anybody should be able to access them. If your interpretation of such passages or given definitions differs from that of the author's, that\\\\s fine. That is what books are for. This is the nature of humans: to question, to search.May this book and other books serve the purpose of instigate open, honest conversations about things that are relevant.. and not inspire a meaningless finger point bickering between left and right. Maybe if we stop bickering and start reading and researching a bit more about our past, we will stop making the same mistakes over and over again. Or, at least, recognize the warning signs of trouble and have a real discussion.I don't give 5 stars to the book only because the prose is not that fluent, which can make for difficult reading and loose the reader on what is being discussed. But again, I praise the author for being able to publish a book that brings out various topics that should be discussed into the mainstream."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book is a surprisingly subtle review of what for want of a better word might be termed \\"collectivism\\" in American and European politics over the last century. Goldberg is quite the opposite of Ann Coulter, who hammers every point home. As a matter of fact, \\"Liberal Fascism\\" can be read simply as an account of Naziism and Italian Fascism. The fact that the NSDAP was in part a socialist party (it's right in the name - the \\"S\\") has been known to anyone even remotely familiar with German history in the 1920s and 1930s. Again, the connection between \\"New Age\\" ideas and Adolf Hitler has been known to anyone who has ever heard of Guido von List and Lans von Liebenfels. But Goldberg carefully brings these strands together, and ties them up fairly neatly.The main surprise to me in Goldberg's book is his analysis of Hillary Clinton as a political thinker. He takes her very seriously indeed. Unfortunately, her reiterated catch phrase \\"it takes a village to raise a child\\" for her implies massive government intervention in family and individual life."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Looking at Liberalism from a different perspective, Jonah Goldberg has written Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left from Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning (New York: Doubleday, c. 2007). Goldberg's title (and treatment) are almost deliberately incendiary, designed to anger American liberals who have routinely insisted that \\"fascism\\" is a conservative trait! Here they ape \\"Stalin [who] stumbled on a brilliant tactic of simply labeling all inconvenient ideas and movements fascist\\" (p. 10). With Stalin they deny, for example, that Hitler was a man of the Left, whereas he was a doctrinaire socialist--though of a national, not an international, variety.So, for clarity, Goldberg provides this definition of fascism: \\"Fascism is a religion of the state. It assumes the organic unity of the body politic and longs for a national leader attuned to the will of the people. It is totalitarian in that it views everything as political and holds that any action by the state is justified to achieve the common good. It takes responsibility for all aspects of life, including our health and well-being, and seeks to impose uniformity of thought and action, whether by fore or through regulation and social pressure. Everything, including the economy and religion, must be aligned with its objectives. Any rival identity is part of the \`problem' and therefore defined as the enemy. I will argue that contemporary American liberalism embodies all of these aspects of fascism\\" (p. 23). Consequently, he points out remarkable correlations and draws intriguing conclusions that make his treatise quite thought-provoking. Historically, the argument he endeavors to prove is this: \\"Progressivism was a sister movement of fascism, and today's liberalism is the daughter of Progressivism\\" (p. 2).Before the Holocaust, \\"when it never occurred to anyone that fascism had anything to do with anti-Semitism\\" (p. 26), many American liberals, including members of FDR's \\"brain trust\\" such as Rexford Tugwell, openly admired fascist efficiency. To New Dealers (pragmatists to a man) success validated the truth and goodness of ideas. Thus Tugwell praised Italian Fascism as \\"'the cleanest, neatest, most efficiently operating piece of social machinery I've ever seen. It makes me envious'\\" (p. 13). What Tugwell--and earlier Progressives including Woodrow Wilson--craved is what Goldberg calls \\"the totalitarian temptation--that with the right amount of tinkering we can realize the utopian cream of \`creating a better world'\\" (p. 15). That longing still marks the rhetoric of \\"hope\\" (Barak Obama) and the \\"politics of meaning\\" (Hillary Clinton). The desire to create a perfect world, to make sure that everyone's cared for, to require everyone to live right, informed \\"the Nazi antismoking and public health drives [that] foreshadowed today's crusades against junk food, trans fats, and the like. A Hitler Youth manual proclaimed, \`Nutrition is not a private matter!'\\" (p. 19). \\"'You have the duty to be healthy!'\\" (p. 389).Nor was drinking left up to individual choice! American Progressives' crusade to banish alcoholic beverages (triumphant in the 18th amendment) garnered praise from Nazi publicists for its linking \\"moral and physical health.\\" And many Prohibitionists applauded \\"the election of Hitler, a famous teetotaler. And while the racist undercurrent of Prohibition was always there--alcohol fueled the licentiousness of the mongrel races--in Germany the concern was more that alcohol and even more the despised cigarette would lead to the degeneracy of Germany's Aryan purity. Tobacco was credited with every evil imaginable, including fostering homosexuality\\" (p. 268). Hitler hated tobacco, holding that cigarette addiction illustrated the \\"'wrath of the Red Man against the White Man, vengeance for having been given hard liquor\\" (p. 388). \\"The Nazi war on alcoholism and the Hitlerite emphasis on organic foods slowly pushed the beverage industry away from beer and booze and toward natural fruit juices. Children were a special priority. In 1933 the Nazis banned alcohol advertising that was aimed at children\\" (p. 299).Goldberg further finds fascinating parallels between the Environmentalism of today's liberals and \\"the Nazi cult of the organic.\\" Along with Hither, many leading Nazis, \\"Himmler, Rudolph Hess, Martin Bormann and--maybe--Goebbels were vegetarians or health food fetishists\\" (p. 385). There was a back-to-the-earth agenda to much of the Nazi program, a celebration of the \\"natural\\" rather than the \\"artificial.\\" Eminent Nazis proclaimed a commitment to \\"animal rights,\\" and sought to enshrine them in legislation; Himmler even branded hunting as \\"'really pure murder'\\" (p. 386). He envisioned his SS troops eating strictly organic food \\"and was dedicated to making the transition for all of Germany after the war. Organic food was seamlessly linked to the larger Nazi conception of the organic nation living in harmony with a pre- or non-Christian ecosystem\\" (p. 389).To rightly explain these totalizing aspects of Fascism, Goldberg gives careful attention to Benito Mussolini. \\"He was one of Europe's leading radical socialists in arguably the most radical socialist party outside of Russia. Under his stewardship, the journal Avanti! became close to gospel for a whole generation of socialist intellectuals, including Antonio Gramsci\\" (p. 36). Gramsci, importantly, is a major influence in leftist circles; he urged his followers to launch a long, slow march through cultural institutions (universities, media, churches) rather than rely upon revolutions to bring about a socialist utopia. Mussolini was clearly indebted to the \\"syndicalism\\" of Georges Sorel, and \\"without syndicalism fascism was impossible\\" (p. 36). Interestingly enough, \\"Sorel was deeply influenced by the Pragmatism of William James, who pioneered the notion that all one needs is the \`will to believe'\\" (p. 37). Still more: Sorel replicated much of Rousseau and Robespierre and the radical ideas of the French Revolution, which \\"was the first totalitarian revolution, the mother of modern totalitarianism, and the spiritual model for the Italian Fascist, German Nazi, and Russian Communist revolutions\\" (p. 38).Across the Atlantic, Mussolini's American contemporary, Woodrow Wilson, and the Progressives who supported him, were \\"at the forefront of the push for a truly totalitarian state,\\" Goldberg argues (p. 80). \\"Wilson's view of politics could be summarized by the word \`statolatry,' or state worship (the same sin with which the Vatican charged Mussolini). Wilson believed that the state was a natural, organic, and spiritual expression of the people themselves\\" (p. 86). Thus, as Rousseau had said, government continually changes to reflect the will of the people, and the Constitution must be considered a living document capable of endless expansion and alteration. In 1912 Wilson declared that \\"'all that progressives ask or desire is permission--in an era when \\"development,\\" \\"evolution,\\" is the scientific word--to interpret the Constitution according to the Darwinian principle'\\" (p. 88). Furthermore, just as the species, not the individual really matters to Darwin so too, Wilson insisted, \\"the essence of Progressivism was that the individual \`marry his interests to the state'\\" (p. 96).Within two decades, the Progressivism of Wilson moved seamlessly into the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In the year FDR was elected, 1932, H.G. Wells \\"delivered a major speech at Oxford University to Britain's Young Liberals organization, in which he called for a \`\\"Phoenix Rebirth\\"' of Liberalism' under the banner of \\"Liberal Fascism'\\" (p. 134). Wells had given up hoping the Fabian Socialism he'd earlier supported would work. So he envisioned a new approach to attain the transformation of society, rather resembling what was emergent in Germany and Italy. Wells highly admired FDR, frequently met him in the White House, and called him \\"'the most effective transmitting instrument possible for the coming of the new world order\\" (p. 135). In Goldberg's judgment, \\"it seems impossible to deny that the New Deal was objectively fascistic\\" (p. 158). It encapsulated \\"an ideology of power. So long as liberals hold it, principles don't matter\\" (p. 158). Thus, when Frances Perkins suggested that many New Deal proposals were unconstitutional, FDR blithely brushed away her concerns, ready to pack the Supreme Court or do whatever necessary to implement his plans. \\"In 1942 he flatly told Congress that if it didn't do what he wanted, he'd do it anyway. He questioned the patriotism of anybody who opposed his economic programs, never mind the war itself\\" (p. 158).Consequently: \\"The apotheosis of liberal aspirations under FDR took place not during the New Deal but during World War II. Roosevelt in his 1944 State of the Union address proposed what he called a \`second Bill of Rights.' But this was really an argument for a new Bill of Rights, turning the original on its head. \`Necessitous men are not free men,' he declared. Therefore the state must provide a \`new basis of security and prosperity.' Among the new rights on offer were \`as useful and remunerative job,' \`a decent home,' \`adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health,' \`adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment,' and \`a good education.' This second Bill of Rights remains the spiritual lodestar of liberal aspirations to this day\\" (p. 223).The world had barely recovered from WWII before fascism took \\"to the streets\\" in the 1960s. Remarkably resembling German youths in the 1920s, student radicals in the 1960s determined to overthrow existing authorities, beginning with the universities and their curricula. \\"The first task of any fascist reformation is to discredit the authority of the past, and this was the top priority of the New Left\\" (p. 172). Significantly, \\"In 1966, at a conference at Johns Hopkins University, the French literary critic Jacques Derrida introduced the word \`deconstruction'--a term coined by Nazi ideologues--into the American intellectual bloodstream\\" (p. 173). The rest, as they say, is history! And anyone who witnessed (as I did) deconstruction's role in subverting the integrity of modern universities can attest to the power of Derrida and his views, for \\"Deconstruction is a direct and unapologetic offshoot of Heidegger's brand of existentialism, which not only was receptive to Nazism but helped foster it\\" (p. 174).Goldberg provides extensive documentation showing the fascistic aspects of the New Left in America. Simply to understand the influence of Saul Alinksy's Rules for Radicals (influencing both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton!) is to see the parallel between America's New Left and European Fascism. To consider the heroes of the \\"movement\\" as it was called in the \`60s is to understand much of its nature. In the nation's most prestigious universities, student \\"radicals\\" plastered their walls with \\"posters of Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Mao Tse-tung, and Ho Chi Minh\\" (p. 193). They celebrated the Black Panthers, overlooking the violence and corruption that pervaded its structures. And despite his demonstrably murderous record, Che Guevara remains a cult figure for multitudes of young devotees.What's evident in all these individuals is what Goldberg labels the \\"cult of the state.\\" The gigantic growth of government characterized the 20th century, and \\"for some liberals, the state is in fact a substitute for God and a form of political religion as imagined by Rousseau and Robespierre, the fathers of liberal fascism\\" (p. 201). And that political religion has powerfully shaped modern American liberalism."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a book that was waiting to be written. For the longest time it seemed odd to me that Communism was placed on the left and Fascism on the right in the ideological continuum. The two systems always seemed more alike than different. In this book, the author explains why there is so much confusion on this point. The author argues, and I believe persuasively, that Communism and Fascism are not polar opposites but more like cousins. In doing so, the author goes back and examines the early history of Fascism and it ties to the Progressive movement in the U.S. The title of the book, allow provocative, is actually a phrase coined by Progressive and Fascist, H.G. Wells. The main point of the book is that the legacy of the modern day left in the U.S. is the Progressive movement which is philosophically rooted in Fascism.The only criticisms of the book are that it was a little too academic, it jumped around with too many names/quotes/etc., and didn't flow smoothly.

After all, it is't pleasant to have your credo labelled as something akin to one of the two great evil political movements of the the last 150 yearsFor many years, many commentators of all political stripes have defined political movements more by what these movements are against, rather than what the support. Thus , communism/socialism were seen as the opposite of fascism/nazism because the two hated each other so much. But in reality that hatred was bred from similarity of outlook. Rather like Pesi and Coke are more competitive because they occupy the same market, so Nazism and Communism were also at daggers drawn because they were fighting in the same political market. Bothe were responses to modernism and the industrial revolution that sort to collectivise as much activity as possible. The real difference between the two was that one desired state control so as to forward the interest of the proletariat, whilst the other put the nation state at the heart of its creed. But in effect the politcal philosophy of each side was remarkably similar.The left in its most extreme, stands for collectivsation of the State, with the supression of the individual. Bothe Communism and Fascism stand for totalitarianism, therefore both are left wing.Modern liberals/leftists favour greater state intervention in our lives. To that end theytoo could be seen as incipient fascists/socialists, but like the commuinists they hide behind the idea that their statism is good for the 'oppressed.' They also use fascist methods of sitffling any opinions they abhor. One only has to look at what happened to larry Summers when he dared toMr Goldberg has wittily shown how the modern liberal/left has often used the methods of fascism and communism in achieving their aims. I don't think this necessarily makes liberal/leftists fascists per se. However, it canot be denied that they see the State as the foundation of humanity rather than the individual. Thus they often confuse Society and Government, thinking that these are the same thing rather than two separate concepts.It is true that many conservatives were in sympathy with fascism in a shallow way, because they, wrongly, saw it is being somehow a way to beat communism. nevertheless, it is also true that Commuinism allied itself with Nazism in 1939, whilst Conservatives in Britain and France went to war against Hitler. it was an arch-conservative, Winston Churchill, who led the fight against appeasement, a movement stimulated by a fear of a reptition of the Great War rather than any real sympathy for Hitler's Germany."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Fantastic book. Highly recommended--judge it for yourself but if you don't read it you'll never know."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg would have been well advised to discuss why conservative views were not properly called fascist as well as why someone could call liberal ones fascist. This might have given some insight as to how to characterize political views properly with things like single names and fundamental genres.He explicitly states that Woodrow Wilson, his least favorite American President, was not a fascist. He then calls several of his policies explicitly that. This seems like a harsh term even for Woodrow Wilson's policies. Wilson was probably at heart a popular leader, albeit sometimes heavy handed. This historical episode also has to be viewed in context. Charles Evans Hughes would have used the full power of his office to effect a declarartion of war on his first day of office, and repeatedly said so. Wilson campaigned on neutrality. Belief in popular government is fundamentally at variance with any definition of fascism. Also, this author makes the same foolish mistake Pravda did in castigating The Cub Scouts as a werewolfesque, pagan, para-military organization. Roosevelt's bugle calls at WPA projects were inspried by the non-military, help-you-to-take-care-of-yourself Boy Scouts. Furthermore, fascism's \\"soft, socialistic spot for the poor\\" is badly mmisrepresented here. Clearly, Hitler and Mussolini were co-opting large contemporary socialist movements in declaring \\"pro working man\\" policies. Hitler's support for \\"working families\\" meant the marginalizing, sometimes eliminatiion of nearly everyone underemployed. Read, most of the poor here. His first gas chambers were in the asylums and the prisons. \\"Non-productive citizens.\\" Obviously, such policies didn't do wonders for factory workers' bargaining positions. Furthermore, The Third Reich was no leftist organization. They killed an estimated ten million leftists out of twelve million political prisoners. The author does a poor job of distinguishing fascism from general totalitarianism, although this may prove somewhat difficult to do. In short, most of this is a tour de force of exactly the sort of name calling he supposedly deplores. Also, who was the first American journalist to castigate Mussolini at length? George Seldes. Where did he do so? The Nation."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I paid for it. the Postman delivered it.

As it is, it is a good book. But because the author wrote it to assert a political position and repeatedly tries to score points off his real and imagined liberal opponents, it is not nearly as good as it might have been. More importantly, the book Goldberg thought he was writing almost morphs into the much better book he should have written, and on occasion, he is aware of this.Goldberg's explicit thesis is that there is a lot of fascism in contemporary and historical left-liberalism, and that much of contemporary liberalism is really fascism with a human face. Roosevelt originally admired Mussolini and borrowed many ideas from him (and vice-versa). Hitler originally had good things to say about Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson engaged in clampdowns on constitutionally-protected freedoms that fascists admired. Goldberg proves that there is a lot of liberalism in fascism, and a lot of fascism in liberalism.But so what? There is a lot of conservatism in fascism, a lot of fascism in socialism, a lot of social democracy in liberalism, and a lot of liberalism in conservatism, and Goldberg somewhat reluctantly admits this in various places. By the time he adds the necessary qualifiers and disclaimers, he goes a long way toward demonstrating a different thesis entirely -- the incoherence and mutability of modern political ideologies. Contemporary politicians and ideologues borrow ideas from each other freely, as Goldberg convincingly demonstrates. Modern political ideologies are arguably less about ideas than about power and about tribal identities, as he repeatedly shows. But by pointing to the many cross-currents infusing liberalism, social democracy and fascism alike, Goldberg often overlooks these broader points. What is unique about the conceptual commonalities shared by liberalism and fascism, as opposed to the commonalities between, say, conservatism and liberalism? As fascist ideas moderate toward more democratic norms (as in Italy's neo-facist movements, say) what is so wrong with them other than bad histories? Goldberg demonstrates that modern liberalism has roots in progressive thought, which had roots in all sorts of bad things -- eugenics, communitariansm, assaults on civil rights and civil liberties, etc. But he comes close to committing the genetic fallacy; what he should have been doing, and sometimes does do, is demonstrating the limits of history as a guide to good politics."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is interesting.

Yet, because it does not actually demonize the Left, but merely document its once-new-now-abandoned hall of mirrors (vs. the utter simplicity of small-government politicians), it's like reading a 500 page book on how magic tricks really work. If people who are buying this are really finishing it, then we are indeed entering an Enlightened period, but it's an adult one, above the level of even college kids. I don't mean to say it's like a textbook. More like a classic work of literature that is kind of boring to read, but which exactly because it's not propagandistic or overly emotional, is one of the few books that made me realize what the formerly foreign phrase \\"Civil Society\\" really means.

It's a psychotic projection of Goldberg's own neo-con, neo-fascist political orientation onto those of liberal democratic orientation.The fact of the matter is that the Wall Street and City of London international banking syndicates have used both US political parties at different times and in different ways in order to advance their totalitarian new world economic order, almost exactly as Orwell prophesied in his classic book, \\"1984\\". He was only off by a few decades.The author grossly distorts and misrepresents the meanings of both of the words in his chosen title. \\"Liberal-Fascism\\" makes as much sense as a \\"heavenly hell\\", or a \\"nightmarish utopia\\" or \\"democratic totalitarianism\\". They are self-contradictory terms.The word \\"fascism\\" has a meaning. Mussolini coined the term, and he defined it. It means a joining or merging of state and corporate power under a strongman leader of extraordinary willpower.The word \\"liberal\\" also has a meaning, although the ultra-right has done their best to distort that meaning. It means GENEROUS, bountiful, broad-minded, open-minded, inclusive, and has always been opposed to authoritarianism, totalitarianism, and unchecked power from any source.Of course this is the kind of book fascists would love, because it totally deceives the reader about the real meanings of fascism and liberalism. It stands the truth on its head. Goldberg claims he wrote the book because he was tired of being called a fascist.

My copy was published in 2007 (pre-Obama); the author's definition of liberal fascist, with there use of words, ideas, and policies seem to dovetail Obama in many ways. The concept of \\"hope\\" mentioned in the book (it was even put into quotes) is almost frightening. I personally believe the book cover is dead on the mark. The book is very fair in the sense that it doesn't imply liberal fascists are Nazi's, etc, but it does do a good job explaining that they exist in the same family tree.

It is always fascinating that the very same people who so often lecture to all of us about \\"tolerance\\" are the least so. It is particularly bothersome that Amazon chose to use one short, positive review and one very lengthy negative review. Despite some of the reviews, Mr. Goldberg's book is fair. Kool-aid drinkers from both sides of the aisle need not bother because neither side would much like what they are reading unless they are interested in truth. Whoever you are, whatever your notions, if you are opened minded, you will likely realize some of those notions require re-examination. This book is particularly helpful if you have been trying to educate yourself as much as possible about American history, have done much other reading, and are sincerely interested in seeking the truth. If you've been asking yourself: Just when did this country start to \\"go off the rails\\", you will find a lot of answers. Other well-written books about the history of Progressives, socialists, and Marxists support the documented information in this book. A couple of others I have read, and I have no idea from what political persuasion these gentlemen come, would be the very well documented book by Ronald J. Pestritto, Professor at the University of DallasWoodrow Wilson and the Roots of Modern Liberalism (American Intellectual Culture)and another, by Richard Pipes,A Concise History of the Russian Revolution. Again, despite all of the partisan reviews, if you read at minimum, the three books noted, you will see the dots connecting. Mr. Goldberg is not about finger pointing or name calling, he's about laying out, step by step, point A to point B, etc. Michael Mann's review, in itself, is to be disregarded because he accuses Goldberg of leaving out labeling so-called \\"Conservatives\\" as the \\"f-word\\", like Richard Nixon. Mr. Mann has revealed his own lack of knowledge of historical facts or that he didn't read the book closely, or well. A number of so-called \\"conservatives\\" are mentioned, including Pres. George W. Bush. Many aspects of Pres. Bush's policies, do have, in fact, elements of the \\"f-word\\", as Mr. Mann calls it. It is a fallacy of the left or perhaps a lack of much contemplation, that every individual with an \\"R\\" behind their title in elected office are automatically conservative. Richard Nixon was not conservative, he was a \\"liberal\\" Republican. Pres. Bush's fiscal policies and \\"compassionate conservatism\\" alone disqualify him from being considered truly conservative. In order to make that assessment, as a conservative, I did much reading, but didn't arrive at my conclusions until I read this book. Until or unless people are willing to start \\"calling out\\" the wrong they see in their leadership, regardless to which political party they belong, it's hard to imagine how much, if anything, will come about to change the high amount of dissatisfaction and distrust most Americans feel about their government.

Jonah Goldberg has done a superb job of showing us why the world's political leaders of the 20th Century didn't really believe or behave quite the way we thought they did -- nor were their political philosophies quite as the news media and our college professors assured us they were.We've always been taught that Nazism and Communism were polar opposites -- right and left ends of the totalitarian spectrum. Nope. Goldberg tells us in convincing detail how they actually had very similar roots -- basically, those of the socialist ideal. Both judged that the government has a right and duty to intervene heavily and constantly in people's daily lives, for \\"the good of the society\\" (or \\"the fatherland,\\" or \\"the workers\\".) Throw in Italian Fascism, which bore similarities to both, but without Nazism's deep racial prejudices. Goldberg manages to discuss the similarities of Lenin's, Hitler's and Mussolini's creeds -- and the differences, which he says were mostly due to cultural and historical differences between Russia, Germany and Italy -- without descending very much into the kind of dictator-hating that many authors have done. He doesn't express much admiration for the dictators, but he's able to discuss them and their philosophies pretty dispassionately.The most surprising parts of the book to me, and I'd guess to most of its readers, were those in which Goldberg demonstrates how the American presidential administrations of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt bore many similarities -- in a democratic context, of course -- to those of the three totalitarian regimes. This is where the title, \\"Liberal Fascism,\\" comes in. Modern-day American liberals, the lineal descendants of the Progressives of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, like to apply the pejorative \\"fascist\\" to modern-day conservatives, but Goldberg shows striking similarities between these liberals and the Communists, Nazis and Fascists of yore.The book is amply documented (54 pages of notes). Goldberg's arguments and logic are impeccable. If you're into fairly deep discussions of political philosophy, you'll love this work."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Liberal Fascism opens with a scene from the television show, Real Time with Bill Maher. The scene briefly depicts a moment from the show in 2005 where Maher and his guest, George Carlin, were discussing a political point and began carelessly and recklessly throwing around the term \\"fascism.\\" Both defined fascism as the act of government takeover by large corporations.This brief excerpt from the show perfectly showcases the vast ignorance that exists in popular culture concerning the nature of fascism. Unfortunately, Maher and Carlin are not the only liberal dunces who are completely ignorant about what fascism is and isn't. While Bush was president, it was common to hear liberal pundits and know-nothing Hollywood celebrities decry his latest action or policy proposal as fascist or to compare Bush's rule to Hitler's regime. Indeed, in the current American political climate, it is all too common for conservatives to be labeled as fascists.This is because a common myth persists that when liberalism is extended to a radical degree to the left the resulting government is communism but that when conservatism is extended to a radical degree to the right the resulting government is fascist. The perception, then, is that fascism and communism are philosophical opposites when the truth is that they are closely related; distant cousins at best. Despite all evidence to the contrary, this perception persists and Jonah Goldberg resolves to set the record straight in Liberal Fascism. Early in the book, Goldberg writes:\\"Fascism, properly understood, is not a phenomenon of the right at all. Instead, it is, and always has been, a phenomenon of the left. This fact - an inconvenient truth if there ever was one - is obscured in our time by the equally mistaken belief that fascism and communism are opposites. In reality, they are closely related, historical competitors for the same constituents, seeking to dominate and control the same social space...In terms of their theory and practice, the differences are minimal.\\"In other words, as Rich Lowry writes of Liberal Fascism, \\"How we think of the ideological spectrum -- socialism to the left, fascism to the right -- should be forever changed.\\" It was enlightening to discover that left wing liberals formerly embraced the term fascism; in fact, the progressive science-fiction author H.G. Wells was the one who first actually coined the term \\"liberal fascism.\\" Indeed, if Goldberg's book serves no other purpose than stopping ignorant Hollywood liberals from calling everyone to the political right of Barbara Streisand a fascist, then Goldberg's time and effort spent in writing this work was well worth it.Before Goldberg traces the twentieth century history of fascism, demonstrating the philosophical roots it shares with communism and modern-day liberalism, he gives us his own \\"working definition\\" of fascism:\\"Fascism is a religion of the state. It assumes the organic unity of the body politic and longs for a national leader attuned to the will of the people. It is totalitarian in that it views everything as political and holds that any action by the state is justified to achieve the common good. It takes responsibility for all aspects of life, including our health and well-being, and seeks to impose uniformity of thought and action, whether by force or through regulation and social pressure. Everything, including the economy and religion, must be aligned with its objectives.\\"Goldberg then devotes the rest of the book to argue that \\"contemporary American liberalism embodies all of these aspects of fascism.\\"Beginning with Mussolini, Goldberg's book tours the major fascist governments of the last century, identifying hauntingly similar objectives and values those governments share with today's liberals. To prove that fascist governments occupied the left wing of the political sphere, Goldberg constantly examines their policies and the platforms they ran on during elections. For instance, Goldberg notes that when Mussolini first ran for office in 1919 his party's platform included an establishment of the minimum wage, a law sanctioning an eight hour work day, a large progressive tax on capital that amounted to little more than a vast redistribution of the country's wealth, an establishment of \\"rigidly secular\\" public schools and various other pro-labor measures.It doesn't take a policy wonk to realize these goals almost perfectly mesh with the current platform of the Democratic Party. As Goldberg sarcastically notes, \\"Ah yes. Those anti-elitist, stock-market-abolishing, child-labor-ending, public-health-promoting, wealth-confiscating, draft-ending, secularist right-wingers!\\"Hitler's Nazism was a different strain of fascism, as its focus on racism and \\"scientific\\" anti-Semitism was unique to Hitler's brand of fascism in Germany. Goldberg states that even Mussolini \\"considered anti-Semitism a silly distraction and, later, a necessary sop to his over-bearing German patron.\\" Yet, many of Hitler's other goals and policies obviously come from the political left. Included in an appendix at the end of the book, is the Nazi's, or National Socialist's, party platform. There you will find calls for the profit-sharing of industries, nationalization of trusts, the expansion of \\"old age\\" welfare and the expansion of health services. Yep, sounds right wing to me.After devoting chapters to Mussolini and Hitler, Goldberg turns his attention to America, where he says the first quasi-fascist leader the world ever saw assumed power in 1912: Woodrow Wilson. Goldberg writes, \\"Call it what you like - progressivism, fascism, communism, or totalitarianism - the first enterprise of this kind was established not in Russia or Italy or Germany but in the United States, and Woodrow Wilson was the twentieth century's first fascist dictator.\\" Though it sounds heretical, Goldberg backs this seemingly outlandish claim with damning fact after damning fact.Goldberg documents several of Wilson's policies to make his case that Wilson was a fascist leader but three, in particular, stand out: the commissioning of the War Industries Board (WIB), the establishment of the Committee on Public Information (CPI), and Wilson Sedition Act. Using World War I as an excuse, Wilson declared a time of crisis to move quickly to establish complete control of the nation and circumvent many of America's built-in check and balances.The WIB was an attempt to nationalize different industries and businesses, bringing American business into \\"the loving embrace of the state.\\" Groveson Clark, a former member of the board and historian, wrote years later, \\"It was an industrial dictatorship without parallel - dictatorship by force of necessity and common consent...\\"The CPI, effectively Wilson's own ministry of propaganda, openly used fear as a tool to motivate American citizens to think and act in tandem with the government. George Creel, the head of the newly created agency, stated fear was \\"an important element to be bred into the civilian population. It is difficult to unite a people by talking only on the highest ethical plane.\\" An army of former journalists set out to purposely manipulate the American public under this agency.Finally, Wilson's Sedition Act banned \\"uttering, printing, writing, or publishing any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the United States government or the military.\\" Goldberg writes:\\"The postmaster general was given the authority to deny mailing privileges to any publication he saw fit - effectively shutting it down. At least seventy-five periodicals were banned. Foreign publications were not allowed unless their content was first translated and approved by censors. Journalists also faced the very real threat of being jailed or having their supply of newsprint terminated by the War Industries Board. \\"Unacceptable\\" articles included any discussion - no matter how high-minded or patriotic - that disparaged the draft.\\"To further clarify when a publication could be banned, Goldberg quotes Wilson's Postmaster General Albert Burleson explaining that a periodical could be banned anytime it \\"begins to say that this Government got in the war wrong, that it is in it for the wrong purposes, or anything that will impugn the motives of the Government for going into the war.\\" Wilson himself stated, \\"Woe be to the man or group of men that seeks to stand in our way.\\" That wasn't just angry rhetoric. The Espionage Act of 1917, coupled with the Sedition Act of 1918, meant that any criticism of the government, even in one's own house, could earn one a trip to prison.Throughout the book Goldberg gives further examples of fascist initiatives enacted in the United States by over-zealous liberals, effectively putting a stop to the revisionist history so often accepted as fact in American culture today. He takes a careful look at FDR's New Deal policies to mobilize society, showing that FDR copied more than a little from Wilson's playbook. Goldberg also writes scathing critiques of the radical student and interest groups of the 1960's, where terror and coercion were commonly used as a way to secure concessions and political gain.The scariest section of the book, though, focuses on the shockingly similar intellectual defense put forth by progressives in the defense of eugenics in the 1920's and still used by liberals to defend abortion today. It is by exploring the links between liberal support for eugenics and abortion that the racist history of the left is finally revealed. Briefly, eugenics was a particular form of \\"science\\" popular in the early twentieth century which called for the sterilization of people and races deemed \\"unfit\\" to reproduce. The leading proponents for this brutal pseudo-science reads like a who's who of progressive intellectuals from the era including Woodrow Wilson, H.G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Margaret Sanger (founder of Planned Parenthood), John Maynard Keynes, Julian Huxley (founder of the World Wildlife Fund), Harold Laski, Oliver Wendell Holmes and even the Bull Moose incarnation of Theodore Roosevelt.George Bernard Shaw, for instance, stated \\"The only fundamental and possible socialism is the socialization of the selective breeding of man.\\" While Woodrow Wilson was governor of New Jersey, he founded a board that could decide when \\"procreation is inadvisable.\\" Those declared to be unfit for procreation ranged from criminals and prisoners to the poor. H.G. Wells, one of the most influential progressive thinkers and authors, wrote in a chilling moment of clarity that \\"swarms of black and brown, and dirty-white and yellow people\\" would \\"have to go.\\" Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, wrote in a letter, \\"We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population,\\" while organizing the Negro Project, which aimed to stop blacks from breeding. Of course, it was the Germans' fascination with eugenics that led them to first exterminate the handicapped and mentally ill of their country and eventually led to their rationalization of the Holocaust.Goldberg does a masterful job of tracing the philosophy within Progressive ranks from past support of eugenics to the current support of abortion. Today, a disproportionate amount of abortions are done to black and Hispanic babies. In the 1970's Jesse Jackson stated abortion was akin to the \\"genocide of the black race.\\" He later changed his stance on abortion when he ran for president. In his book Freakonomics, University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt wrote that \\"Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness; unwantedness leads to high crime; legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime.\\" In 1992 Nicholas Von Hoffman wrote in the Philadelphia Inquirer that abortion would \\"save ourselves from being murdered in our beds and raped on the streets.\\"Goldberg then connects the dots:\\"The issue here is not the explicit intent of liberals or the rationalizations they invoke to deceive themselves about the nature of abortion. Rather, it is to illustrate that even when motives and arguments change, the substance of the policy remains in its effects. After the Holocaust discredited eugenics per se, neither the eugenicists nor their ideas disappeared. Rather, they went to ground in fields like family planning and demography and in political movements such as feminism.\\"He continues:\\"So forget about intent: look at results. Abortion ends more black lives than heart disease, cancer, accidents, AIDS, and violent crime combined. African-Americans constitute little more than 12 percent of the population but have more than a third (37 percent) of abortions...Revealingly enough, roughly 80 percent of Planned Parenthood's abortion centers are in or near minority communities.\\"It should be pointed out that throughout Liberal Fascism, Jonah Goldberg takes pains to ensure his readers that he is not comparing today's Democrats to Nazis. He readily concedes that Nazism under Hitler's leadership was unique in how extreme it carried out its fascist philosophy, especially the brutal crimes the Nazis committed in the Holocaust.Goldberg concludes his look with a scathing look at the modern day Democratic Party and popular American culture and a timely warning for conservatives. Indeed, it is these closing chapters that Goldberg's familiar wittiness and humor is on full display after the more academic nature of the book's earlier chapters. One such example, while explaining why he felt the need to write this book:\\"Ever since I joined the public conversation as a conservative writer, I've been called a fascist and a Nazi by smug, liberal-know-nothings, sublimely confident of the truth of their ill-informed prejudices. Responding to this slander is, as a point of privilege alone, a worthwhile endeavor.\\"Those familiar with the works of other conservative writers such as Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin need to be warned: this book is deeper, longer and more scholarly than their typical writings; less one-liners, more substance. Goldberg digs deep in the annals of history to uncover popular myths and the revisionist works of liberal academics to show that it is not conservatives who are in danger of turning America in a fascist direction, but liberals. All in all, Liberal Fascism is a book that meets an immediate need; not only within conservatism, but for all Americans. It is time to take a closer look at our past to better understand where today's political leaders want to take us in the future. Liberal Fascism does just that."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Mr. Goldberg did an enormous amount of research to make his point. I don't know how anyone could argue with his conclusions given all the facts he uses to back them up. This is not an easy book to read. I think Mr. Goldberg had so much to say it comes tumbling out in vast amounts of facts and personalities. It is fascinating reading, nonetheless, and makes one wonder why we keeping buying what the liberal fascists are selling. Those who want to deny what's happening should take an honest look at why and determine whether they want to trade our Constitutional Republic for a national socialist existence. It hasn't worked, it won't work, and may be hard to reverse once we go too far in that direction."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Could the Great Depression happen again?

The parallel lines of thought of socialists, fascists, progressives, communists, and Nazis (national socialists) of the first half of the 20th century and the methods employed currently by the Democrat party and their leftist base to force the same ideology upon American society are so starkly portrayed that the similarities cannot be missed. As people like David Horowitz in his book \\"Radical Son\\" have shown, there is no room for the exchange of differing ideas with political socialist elites about our Constitution, the free marketplace, personal responsibility, etc. And the left seeks not only to impose their ideology by any means but also to destroy those who disagree and ultimately, if possible, erase any memory or record that differing views existed. I can recall my grandfather's own accounting of his contempt for Wilson's decision to take us into World War I (Goldberg does a great job of highlighting Wilson's duplicitous decision) and the fascist methods/misinformation Wilson employed to impose his will on the American public. If America had stayed out of WWI there would have been no Hitler, Lenin, or Stalin and the murder of millions that they enabled and no World War II as we know it. This book needs to be required reading in American high school classrooms along with F.A. Hayek's \\"The Constitution of Liberty\\", de Tocqueville's \\"Democracy in America\\", Adam Smith's, \\"The Wealth of Nations\\", Thomas Sowell's \\"Basic Economics\\", our founding documents and other books in a similar vein."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"With a leftist monopoly over history textbooks, college campuses, and the media it is very difficult to get any sort of dissenting opinion out there in the face of leftist censorship. Jonah Goldberg should be applauded for exposing one the biggest leftist myths out there, but instead I am sure he will be called a Nazi or a Fascist by his leftist critics. The big leftist myth that Mr. Goldberg goes after is the one that says Nazism and Fascism were conservative ideologies. As a big conservative and a person who has lost a few of my ancestors to the Nazis, I find it very offense when Fascism/Nazism is associated with right-wing conservatives. Now this book is not trying to convince you that the Democratic Party and the Nazis are one in the same, but it instead shows that Fascism/Nazism were leftist ideologies. What the book does do is show that the policies of Democratic Party, from the Progressive Era to the modern day, were and are similar to their fascist European relatives, but instead favor niceness over raw brutality.Mr. Goldberg starts the book by trying to define Fascism, which is hard to do because as he says the many definitions of Fascism makes it similar phenomenon to Quantum Mechanics Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The next part of the book focuses on how both Mussolini and Hitler were men of the left. However, do not worry there are many more examples of leftist Nazi and Fascist policies strewn throughout the book. Through these examples Mr. Goldberg dissects the normal leftist argument that since the Nazis were nationalistic, racists, anti-communists, and evil therefore they must have been conservative right wingers. Honestly I have always found it hard to believe that after any educated adult reads the domestic and economic policies of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy that they could still think that they were right-wing. As Mr. Goldberg points out, it is hard not to be leftist when the name of your party is the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Some of the leftist policies and philosophy that the Nazis desired or implemented were: having an anti-capitalist heavily regulated economy, the promotion of the state and the common good over the individual, secularism, anti-Christian rhetoric and policies, anti-Church, anti-Monarchy, anti-traditional family values, free health care, guaranteed jobs, the confiscation of wealth and land by the state, pro-environmentalism, pro-vegetarianism, pro-gun control, eugenics, pro-abortion, a ban on smoking, pro-animal rights, and other leftist big government programs that interfere in ones personnel life. Again it is simply amazing that anyone could pass over all of these issues and call the Nazi movement conservative and not leftist. This is the reason you never get into the domestic and economic polices of Nazi Germany in school because they are clearly on the left side of the spectrum. This is also why Hitler was no friend of monarchists, the aristocracy, and true German conservatives, who tried to assassinate him more than once. Nazism was to the right of international communism, but they were still far to the left. Their nationalistic socialist message was in competition with the Soviet brand of communism for the hearts and minds of the German people. As the book explains, today's history books just support and regurgitate old Soviet propaganda than some how Nazism/Fascism was the opposite of communism even though the share so much in common. Unfortunately this will not change until history books and professors become more fair and balanced.Additionally this book examines just how similar the American Progressive movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was very close to bringing fascism to the USA. One thing you see by reading this book is that many of the \\"crimes\\" that the left accuses President Bush of were actually carried out by the Wilson and FDR administrations. The book goes into detail showing how Wilson tried to transform the United States into a fascist and socialist country during WWI. The book then clearly shows that FDR's New Deal was very similar to the same domestic and economic programs being instituted in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The book next goes on to demonstrate how fascist polices were part of the turbulent 1960's, as well as spotlight the nice liberal fascism promoted by Hillary Clinton. After that the books wraps up by showing that big government compassionate conservatism can also be shown to be close to fascism. I was very glad that this portion was also included in order to show that fascist policies can also be found on the right and center, Pat Buchanan and Michael Bloomberg being a good example of this phenomenon.My hope is this book will help in laying the leftist myth that the Nazis/Fascists were conservatives to rest. I also hope it spurs readers to investigate other leftist myths and lies in the history books concerning topics such as the Flat Earth myth, the \\"Dark Ages\\", the Galileo affair, the Spanish Inquisition, the Witch Hunts, and the general leftist myths that religion and conservatives are anti-science and blamed for every evil that has ever occurred.Additionally if one would like read more about the absurd domestic and economic policies of the leftism, as well as millions that have died under their rule readLeftism Revisited: From De Sade and Marx to Hitler and Pol Potby Erik Von Kuehnelt-Leddihin andHeaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialismby Joshua MuravchikAlso if you would like further reading on how Hitler and his atheist advisors hated the Church and wanted to kidnap the Pope readA Special Mission: Hitler's Secret Plot to Seize the Vatican and Kidnap Pope Pius the XIIby Dan KurzmanWell in closing I highly recommend the book and even though it is only January I think this will be the book of the year."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"One thing I've noticed about right-wingers like Goldberg is the near absence of any discussion of the various fascist military dictatorships that existed in Central and South America during the post-WWII period. How would these regimes be categorized in Goldberg's analysis?Rather than get into a urinating match over defining terms like \\"right-wing\\" and \\"left-wing\\", I will, for the sake of argument, assume that Goldberg is correct when he refers to Nazism as a left-wing movement. If we make this assumption, how can we explain the following historical facts.It's estimated that up to 9,000 Nazi war criminals fled to South America to escape prosecution after WWII. These criminals were sheltered by far-right military dictatorships that were in place in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil. Additionally, hundreds of former SS officers escaped to Franco's Spain after the war. Franco's regime was openly fascist and had the direct military support of Hitler during the Spanish Civil War. Spain also traded food and metals with the Nazi regime during the war. After the Spanish Civil War, Franco set up a network of concentration camps in Spain and starved and executed over 100,000 people who supported the democratically elected Republican government overthrown by the fascists. However, Franco barely gets a mention in Goldberg's book.Would the generals who ran these South American countries actually provide shelter for leftists? If the Nazis were indeed left-wing as Goldberg claims, does anyone seriously think that these South American military regimes of the post-war period would have given aid and comfort to persons who would directly challenge their economic and political interests? (Not to mention the fact that these regimes, often with the help of the CIA, routinely tortured, imprisoned and executed leftists, trade unionists, democrats, and anyone else with real or perceived links to leftist organizations).Goldberg also condemns the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini as being one of Hitler's fellow travelers in the cause of \\"liberal fascism.\\" Curiously enough, a naval officer in Mussolini's fascist regime, Prince Junio Valerio Borghese, made a visit to Chile in May 1974 to offer assistance and admiration for the regime of Augusto Pinochet. It is well known that Pinochet is a darling of the American right and has been lauded by American conservatives as \\"saving Chile from communism.\\" It is interesting that such a figure would have his boots licked by an officer from the Mussolini regime when one considers Goldberg's claim that fascism is a \\"liberal\\" movement. Not surprisingly, Pinochet gets exactly ZERO mentions in Goldberg's book.With these facts in mind, the assertion that the Nazis and Italian fascists were \\"leftists\\" doesn't make any sense--unless, of course, one is willing to entertain the bizarre idea that regimes like Stroessner's in Paraguay and Videla's in Argentina were somehow \\"leftist.\\" (Also, readers might like to look up Operation Condor to find out how friendly these regimes were to leftists.)Goldberg makes an issue of the fact that Hitler's regime was very active in manipulating the German economy prior to the war, thus giving it certain characteristics of a leftist government. Well, Franco's regime was also very active in the economy through things like price fixing, production targets, and import substitution. The various military juntas that ruled Argentina and Bolivia between 1945 and 1983 were also very active in the economy through currency manipulation, production targets, and expanding domestic infrastructure through deficit financing. Stroessner's regime in Paraguay tried to strike a balance between government intervention and free enterprise.It could be argued that these regimes gradually liberalized their economies over time once economic stagnation set in due to excessive government regulation. Very true. However, keep in mind that Hitler's government was active in the economy for the purpose of imperial conquest. Hitler made this goal very clear in Mein Kampf. Had Hitler decided to remain inside Germany's boarders and kill only leftists instead of Jews, it is safe to assume that Hitler would eventually have pursued similar strategies of deregulation. Hitler would then have achieved a place of honor alongside the likes of Franco, Pinochet, Stroessner, Banzer, and other right-wing heroes.Goldberg is silent about all of this. I suspect the real problem Goldberg has with the Nazi regime is the fact that it was expansionistic. Invasion of other countries is never an easy thing to justify, not even for people like Goldberg. Mass murder is also never easy to justify--UNLESS it occurs domestically and not after the conquering of foreign soil. (See Paraguay under Stroessner.) Had the Nazi regime remained within its post-WWI boundaries and decided to exterminate leftists instead of Jews, as Franco did, Goldberg's book would never have been written.The bottom line is this: the political construction of a government has, at best, a marginal effect on the economic policies it advocates. Capitalism can be advanced by either liberal governments (e.g. the United States, Great Britain, Germany) or illiberal governments (e.g. Chile under Pinochet, Paraguay under Stroessner, Saudi Arabia, Kenya under Daniel arap Moi, or China, which is capitalist in all but name). Socialism can also be advanced liberally (e.g. Sweden, Norway, Denmark) or illiberally (e.g. Cuba, the USSR, North Korea). Hitler's regime was politically very illiberal even though it pursued some economic policies that American liberals advocate such as the minimum wage, universal health insurance, and food safety regulations. However, Hitler's regime also advocated certain policies that American conservatives support or at least sympathize with such as banning unions, lockouts and the right to strike, hatred of all things \\"modern\\" in art and music, confining women to \\"church, children and kitchen\\", and a government built upon a form of military Keynesianism that would have warmed Ronald Reagan's heart and is the type of economy Eisenhower warned about re: military industrial complex.Goldberg has NOTHING to say about fascism of the Pinochet/South American variety. Pinochet did away with the minimum wage, privatized most businesses that were nationalized under Allende, and pursued neoliberal economic policies. He also overthrew a democratically elected government, set up concentration camps, banned free speech and a free press, and was instrumental in the creation of Operation Condor that executed and tortured thousands of people. This is ALSO fascism. The fact that Goldberg ignores it speaks volumes. Goldberg is not opposed to fascism per se. Rather, Goldberg is opposed to a specific TYPE of fascism.Goldberg cherry picks his facts to make a very dubious argument about fascism as being \\"left-wing.\\" To read an honest assessment of the true nature of fascism, check outFascism and Big Businessto see what fascism truly is--capitalism with its back against the wall."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Anyone who has studied political science can tell you there is a forest of \\"isms\\" to be learned.

Freshmen choose A or B, upperclassmen write an essay, non-PoliSci students scratch heads in confusion.There is no danger of your meaning being lost, however, if you call someone a \\"fascist.\\" The term is sufficient to convey villainy. Will some be surprised to learn that the term did not originate as an epithet? It evolved into one and this book tries to describe that evolution.If that fully described Goldberg's motives, this book would have a dry, boring title and would be shelved deep in the stacks. But the author sees another aspect of \\"fascism\\" as a descriptive term: The modern usage of the term, more so by certain portions of the political spectrum than others, is to characterize,and thus silence, a policy position or even a person one disagrees with. If that is too subtle, the left does it more than the right.That tendency would be no more than a curiosity except for the fact that the heroes of the modern left, Woodrow Wilson, FDR, Kennedy, LBJ etc. can trace their ideological lineage to Lenin, Mussolini and \\"He Who Must Not Be Named lest Godwin's Law obtain.\\"This line of argument is so far outside conventional wisdom that Goldberg sometimes comes off as overly partisan. You will have to bring an expert command of political terminology and actors to fully appreciate the power of this work. Goldberg makes his case brilliantly and unerringly in print even if his television appearances suggest otherwise.Since a conservative can expect to be accused of fascism constantly and a liberal can expect to use the word constantly, any party to political discussion should try to gain an understanding of what the word truly means, where it comes from. \\"Liberal Fascism\\" while provocatively titled, is destined to become an important resource.Comments invited."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Page 1: Nazi is an abbreviation for the National SOCIALIST German WORKERS Party.

It is rather, a very thoughtful and comprehensive book. I have carefully read this book once and I am now going over it again because it is a substantial, scholarly work, casting light on recent history, politics, and philosophy. In fact, it has helped me to continue my own research into politics and ethics, because it so clearly integrates major themes to be found in these fields. It is also a very truthful book, more or less revealing the topsy-turvy nature of the political world-view as presented by the predominantly Progressive educational and media establishment.All of this is accomplished by a careful presentation of a huge quantity of facts backed up with many notes to original sources. You will not have to guess what views of Wilson and Hitler held in common, or Roosevelt and Mussolini, or William James and Goebbels.Similarly, there is a rectification of a great wrong in the clear delineation that the roots of what is today called \\"conservatism\\" is in fact classical liberalism, a loyalty to individual freedom, not some sort of hide-bound cultural inertia, longing to turn back the clock.Perhaps the biggest surprise, especially given what seems to be the contemporary \\"liberal\\" pretense of \\"atheism,\\" is that Progressivism/Fascism is in fact a religion. I think it can be successfully argued that any \\"anti-religious\\" pose by liberals is merely a tactic to attack traditional religious rivals in American life. In reading this book, it is very clear that this is the case.This is important because, as a religion, no contrary evidence, logic, or rival moral values are accepted by Progressives in any substantive discussion. Thus if someone disagrees with Progressivism, then he or she is held to be ignorant, irrational, or immoral. One can see how such an attitude leads to a politics of personal destruction. Furthermore, Instead of serious discussion, we get Progressive propaganda expressing a sort of economic paranoia about economic matters, political paranoia about conspiracies and the Tea Party movement, not to mention junk science to support Progressive worship of the state, such as environmentalism and Keynesian economics.If there is one fault that this book has, it is the stated conviction and the Liberal Fascism found in America is a \\"nice\\" sort which will never have concentration camps and mass execution chambers. On this score, I think that Hayek's book \\"Road To Serfdom\\" demonstrates that in a Progressive regime with enough political power, sooner or later the \\"nice\\" Fascists or socialists will get chewed up by those who, being frustrated by all the restraints of \\"bourgeois\\" respect for individual rights, decide they must be \\"practical men\\" and ruthlessly liquidate all opposition.Aside from this concern, I think that this book will be a revelation for almost anyone who reads it and will liberate the thinking of many.

Political books on both sides of the national debate regarding the proper role of government have, on average, devolved into bomb slinging and preaching to the choir. Despite the provocative title and cover (which I am not particulary fond of because it might tend to put off those who would benefit most from reading it) this book is something else entirely. It is not a \\"Political Book\\" in the vein of Ann Coulter or Michael Moore. Rather, it is well researched book of political history/philosophy whose author has an admitted conservative/libertarian viewpoint. There is a world of difference.Liberal Fascism addresses true (if ignored) historical facts regarding Wilsonian Progressivism, the New Deal, and 1960's revolutionary liberalism, as well as modern liberalism, and clearly illustrates the common historical and ideological ties they share with the fascist movement in its national forms, i.e., Franco's Italy, Hitler's Germany, or international form, i.e., Soviet Communism.A liberal might argue that even if Liberal Fascism is accurate in its depiction of the \\"hidden history\\" of liberalism that history bears no direct relationship to liberalism in its modern incarnation. Moreover, that same liberal might feel that his good intentions are enough to shield those people he wishes to help from any negative consequences. That is exactly wrong. Good intentions are not enough as Goldberg aptly illustrates. Fascism, unchecked, ends badly. Frankly, were the bones of victims of fascism in its many incarnations to be exhumed from Siberian tundra, made whole from the dust and ash of the ovens, or dug out of the fields in Cambodia, and piled on top of each other would reach to sky and blot out the sun. Yet, it was the well meaning Progressives, and New Dealers (oft times one in the same), and fellow travelers, who looked to Italy, Russia, and Germany as examples to be emulated before those governments went \\"bad\\".Please note: Goldberg's point is NOT that that an objectively fascist government could not emerge under a \\"Right wing\\" type of movement. Goldberg admits it could. He has, in fact, stated on his blog that in the process of writing the book he has become somewhat less conservative and more libertarian. What Goldberg is elucidating in Liberal Fascism the fact that Progressives/Liberals never stop to look hard at historical and intellectual underpinnings of their shared beliefs (which are intimately tied to fascism). The fact that there is a bloody history of failures directly flowing from those very beliefs only serves to increase the chance that it could happen here (albeit with a smiley face rather than a jackboot) and that we should be on perpetual guard.Therefore, I would urge the aggrevied and shocked reviewers posting one star reviews on Amazon to actually read the book. Now, who knows, maybe Goldberg is completely wrong. However, snide asides about Goldberg's mother (we get it - you don't like her) and knuckle dragging, mouth breathing conservative boogey men, does nothing to diminish the power of Liberal Fascism and, frankly, merely serve to prove its point. Reading Liberal Fascism does not mean you have to surrender the underlying assumptions of liberalism, i.e., governments should use their coercive power to enforce equality, taxes should be progressive, and every aspect of life is political and therefore the legitimate subject to regulation. Hey, it's a screwed up world and it does not make someone a bad person to want it make it a better place. The best don't lack all conviction. No, you can read Liberal Fascism, ignore the ring of truth that tolls from its many, many (did I mention it's a big book) pages and continue to believe that we can have heaven on earth. Of course, you won't be able to say that you were not warned.Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg's book caused \`commotion' prior to its publication and the \`far left' is probably sputtering following its release. Goldberg's thesis makes Liberal Fascism highly readable and puts forth information about our U.S. history I suspect some folks didn't know about, weren't taught or slept when the material was presented in school.If you're willing to read the 405-page book, not including the notes, and be open-minded, the information is fascinating. Goldberg's theses is that the origins of the word fascist is not as the left uses it--to silence all that do not agree with them (the right)-but harkens back to the time of Mussolini and Hitler, and he reminds us that those original fascists were really \`on the left.'The book methodically and interestingly discusses fascism in a way that is understandable. It gives conservatives a playbook with which to counter the liberals incorrect labeling of them as fascists. Fascism is the ultimate enemy of liberty and one can stop the erosion of it by understanding it and formulating methods to \`stop it.'Goldberg's ability to provide the reader with an understandable history is what makes his book stand out. The liberalism that exists today in the United States is fascism, but it is dressed up to look \`pretty.' Beware those that believe with their heart and their head that if something is to be accomplished, the government is the only way to do it. My favorite portion of the book speaks to what we are currently experiencing from the \`far left.' The fascists question motives and then ask questions. Fascism from the past attack the motives of their \`enemies' and oppose all that will not bring about the results they deem as right.But somehow I don't think anyone on the left who would demand we all think like them, will buy any of what the author puts forth.Armchair Interviews says: Liberal Fascism is well written, well researched and a must read."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Claude Shannon famously stated that the value of information is inversely proportional to its probability. Jonah Goldberg's book is extremely valuable precisely because his extensive and meticulous research demonstrates the true roots of fascism (and Fascism) and their relationship for much of what passes for 'liberalism' nowadays.What I find most telling about the Left's reaction to this book is that virtually none of the critical reviews (much less the various rantings) have actually touched upon Goldberg's research and findings. Instead, they usually boil down to two propositions: an ad hominem attack on Goldberg and a declaration that fascism for _them_ means \\"right-wing\\" behavior and therefore Goldberg's thesis is invalid. Both propositions are well-known logical fallacies -- but then again, logical soundness and consistency have not been the Left's strong suit for many years now.This book and Amity Schlaes' _The Forgotten Man_ are, in my opinion, the two most important works in 20th Century American history and economics published in the last decade. Read them both. ..bruce.."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a must read. I think that a helpful introduction to this is Paul Johnson'sIntellectuals. Anyone who thinks that they are smart enough to dictate the lives of others and use state control to do it is truly a fascist.Thanks for a good read. Goldberg may think Liberal Fascism to be relatively less brutal than our historic European variations but that is now. Let it keep going and we'll all wish for the trains to run on time."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg of the great National Review has written an important book that attempts to rectify one of the most persistent fallacies of contemporary political debate--that fascism is a phenomenon of the political Right.Goldberg offers the following definition of fascism: \\"Fascism is a religion of the state. It assumes the organic unity of the body politic and longs for a national leader attuned to the will of the people. It is totalitarian in that it views everything as political and holds that any action by the state is justified to achieve the common good. It takes responsibility for all aspects of life, including our health and well-being, and seeks to impose uniformity of thought and action, whether by force or through regulation and social pressure. Everything, including the economy and religion, must be aligned with its objectives. Any rival identity is part of the 'problem' and therefore defined as the enemy.\\"The chapters on Wilson, FDR, and Hitler are worth the price of the book by themselves. Many people have heard of Wilson's \\"war socialism\\", but it is stunning to read Goldberg's description of how Wilson's measures to stifle dissent during WWI were arguably more suffocating than anything Mussolini tried in later years. As for FDR, his policies in his first year were such that he received a letter from Hitler congratulating him on those policies, and Mussolini stated that FDR was serving as a dictator in America. Perhaps Goldberg's most explosive chapter is the one demonstrating that Hitler was Leftist, not Rightist as he is always portrayed--Hitler's economics were populist/socialist, not conservative, and Hitler exalted the state and loathed individualism.Goldberg even deals with the \\"compassionate conservatism\\" of the last several years, and with good reason. The grotesque levels of federal spending since 2001 have greatly increased our national debts to the point that foreigners are beginning to doubt our ability ever to pay them off--a quick glance at where oil, gold, and the dollar are trading today vis-&agrave;-vis where they were trading early in this decade shows plainly just how \\"heroic\\" compassionate conservatism has been.Fascism flies in the face of American and Christian traditions. Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, stated \\"that government is best which governs least\\"; Puritan theologian John Owen declared that \\"only what God has commanded in His Word should be regarded as binding; in all else there may be liberty of actions\\". Hitler, Mussolini, and today's PC Leftists of all stripes would go apoplectic at the concept that people ought to be able to do whatever they wish as long as what they do is not illegal, is not immoral, and does not violate the rights of others.Goldberg's book is easily one of the five most important political books of the decade. I hope that the book will stop America's slow drift toward being a Denmark West in which people value being secure more than they value being free. I cannot recommend it highly enough, and wish that everyone in the country would read it. I must stop there, however--if I were to say that I'd love to force everyone from coast to coast to read this \\"for the good of the country\\".....well, that would make ME a fascist, wouldn't it? (wink, grin).And to top it all off, the book is housed in one of the A-number-one best, clever book jackets of all time."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book articulates what intelligent people knew for years. Modern liberalism is fascistic. The author masterfully and honestly describes the core dynamics of fascism, against which political histories can be evaluated. I use the word \\"dynamics\\", not \\"principles\\" because fascism has no principles. Rather, as Goldberg explains, fascism is a structure of governance without any moral or philosophical rudder. Whether it be a clarion call for \\"green-ness\\", universal non-smoking or the extermination of an inferior race, fascistic regimes pursue their chosen purposes with uncompromising ruthlessness, which necessarily subordinates the individual, deifies the collective, replaces religion, and either lectures, shuns, ridicules or gases those elements of society which are viewed to contaminate the body collective.This book was published in January 2008. As such, it was prescient. Does the phrase \\"too big to fail\\" resonate more in 2009 than it did in January 2008? I think so. This book explains why political corporatist fascism and modern liberalism come from the same playbook and how much of what we are seeing today in Washington is a repeat of the times in history when our country was fascistic (under Wilson, FDR, JFK and LBJ--all Democratic (cap \\"D\\") progressive thinkers). The difference is the speed and extent of social engineering rammed down our throats by the self-proclaimed \\"technocratic experts\\" appointed by our White House, at a time when this country faces some of the most monumental problems in its history. Delegating to such technocratic experts all social, political, cultural and economic control of the masses is a fundamental dynamic of fascism and modern liberal thought. This dynamic is reminiscent of the \\"guardians\\" contemplated by Plato in \\"The Republic\\". Modern liberals don't understand those \\"guardians\\" are more often named Adolph Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Josef Stalin, (let's not even get into the middle east, now, or even two thousand years ago) than they are named Mother Theresa or Ghandi. Even after decades, if not centuries, of \\"enlightened\\" fascistic ideology (embraced by modern liberals), has the world even come close to creating the type of utopia modern liberals think is possible? Such ideology denies the concept of \\"original sin,\\" but again, modern liberalism is God-less. Once God and \\"original sin\\" are pink-slipped, the author correctly notes, the healthy mistrust of economic and political power is neutered, which is exactly what the Hitlers, Stalins and Gores want, paving the way for the totalitarian and dictatorial imposition of global warming regulations, smoking prohibitions, \\"hate\\" crimes, proliferation of abortion/eugenics or racial cleansing, whatever the \\"cause du jour\\" rests on the power elite's front burner. Goldberg does a great job of demonstrating how fascism can become \\"nice\\", but just as uncompromising and antithetical to liberty.Goldberg is correct in this January 2008 book that the modern liberal uses manufactured \\"crises\\" to hoodwink the masses into accepting their social Darwinist experiments. The key is \\"action\\", not reflective informed deliberation. \\"The worst economic disaster since the Great Depression\\" & \\"We must have a health care bill before Christmas.\\" Sound familiar?In summary, this book persuasively illustrates that historically, fascism is left-wing and always has been, and how modern liberal historical airbrushing has unfairly pinned the moniker on the right. Young and old should read this book to help understand the history unfolding before us today. The book is prescient by predicting much of what has already happened in 2009, and which is likely to happen in 2010. This book will enable the reader, using history as a guide, to recognize the fascistic techniques used by those now in power to achieve their political, economic and social ends, and how those techniques are the antithesis of the traditional liberal democratic principles upon which our country was founded.

Discusses the evolution of socialism from Rosseau thru the French Revolition to Mussolini, National Socialism, and Communism. Shows the family tree of the Progressive movement to Woodrow Wilson to today's collectivists who promise utopia in exchange for total control of our lives.

You might find yourself as shocked as I was to realize that we haven't been as independent, individualistic and non-European as we may have thought (I did). Beginning with Woodrow Wilson, our leaders and intellectuals SHARED ALOT of ideas with the likes of Hitler (Socialism) and Mussolini (Italian Fascism)! The scary tactics of the French Revolution, the ideas of Hegel, Nietzsche, Bismarck and others - American leaders bought into them too. (Even W.E.B. DuBois was fascinated by Hitlerism.) A desire for CONTROL and UTOPIA fed our politicians just as much as many dictators in the past. As I read this book and watched our Presidential campaigning, I recognized some of the tactics/beliefs from the past are still present! Goldberg is right - coercion remains present, but with a smile and nicer manners! Elites who think they know what's \\"best\\" for the \\"masses\\" remain in play. I guess if you \\"trust\\" that \\"security\\" and \\"regulation of enterprise\\" are good trade-offs; that humans require \\"experts\\" and \\"herders\\" to guide them in proper living and attitudes, then you will continue in your rose-tinted \\"hope\\" and choose to avoid this book. But like the layers of an onion, or the rings seen in a cut tree stump (as my 19-yr-old son offered as another analogy) we must look back to the past and be CONSCIOUS of HOW WE GOT HERE to this present time in our history, and acknowledge that the battle has been ongoing for decades - between those in America who believe in laissez-faire economic policies, individuality (WE the PEOPLE) and free market innovation/problem-solving VERSUS statism and social behavior engineering and redistribution of wealth and elitism. Wilson and both Roosevelts and Kennedy and Johnson - made a lot of mistakes based on similar beliefs to people we claim to loathe! And those same IDEAS still motivate today's politicians. All the EXPERIMENTATION - with no stopping to think whether it's flawed - continues to be encouraged - Just keep on trying to make a Utopia, till you get it right! When we really need to admit mistaken paths taken, and admit we \\"listened to\\" the wrong ideas, and say ENOUGH! Aren't we on the brink of REAL destruction in America? If our leaders would return to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers - who saw civil duty as a SHORT-TERM obligation and the Best Interest of ALL Americans as the goal instead of self-aggrandizement, power-hunger, and CONTROL, maybe we could restore our country to the Shining Example to the rest of the world we once were.

I have been searching for a book that specifically clarifies this issue, and this is it!Mr. Goldberg gives us a thorough disection of the leftist poitical philosophy of the 20th century and its influence upon the contemporary liberal entities. The history is there, in most libraries, for anyone to read. Go to the library and see for yourself. As for informed debate on the matter, I find that the \\"well-read\\" liberal, has read a quantity of \\"liberal literature\\" ...and little else. They simply can't be troubled to study anything outside of their agenda-driven propaganda.The world really is more complex than the perspective of Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Mao, Guevara, and Margaret Sanger!To the properly indoctrinated leftist, the ideology is FAR MORE IMPORTANT. The FACTS, if contrary ...are irrelevant!Mr. Goldberg's book will be predictably reviled and denounced by all classes of leftist. But when confronted with skeptical rebuttal, the primary question will be: \\"Did you actually READ the book?\\"Let us consider this:The leftist can exist freely and openly under a Western capitalist government, and voice opposition to it.If you voice opposition to a leftist secular government, you wind up in a concentration-camp ...and leave through the chimney."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The Book \\"Liberal Fascism\\" would be funny if it were written in the context of a Monty Python comedy but unfortunately, Goldberg's book demonstrates the very essence of fascism itself by attempting to invert the meaning of a well known word in order to confuse and distort a well documented historical phenomena. To equate Liberalism (from the latin word Liberalis which means \\"free man\\") with fascism is tantamount to calling someone a \\"communist-capitalist, or \\"Catholic-Jew\\" or confusing a dog for a dolphin or giraffe with a salamander. The two have nothing in common, and are diametrically opposed virtual \\"opposites'. History irrefutably shows that liberalism is the mortal enemy of totalitarianism whether it be fascism or communism. Liberal institutions, policies, ideas and individuals have been systematically attacked, persecuted and killed by fascist and communist regimes throughout the historical record. Therefore it begs the question, if right-wing Republicans are anti-liberal, then they are by definition, \\"anti-liberty\\" and \\"anti-freedom\\". What does that tell you they are for? Do the math! Fascism is thoroughly documented with inconvertible facts throughout the historical record in all it grisly incarnations whether it be German, Italian, Spanish or American fascism. Fascism consistently operates under the guise of nationalistic jingoism and the pious guise of religious fundamentalism, when the opportunity to exploit religion presents itself. The current USA brand is successfully masking itself under the harmless cloak of apple pie, cookies, flag, guns and Jesus, and Fox News which is not news but Goebbels inspired 24 hour a day propaganda willfully designed to mislead and ensorcel the viewers. Very clever, and it works! In essence, Johna Goldberg is a paid propagandist for the true Oligarchical nucleus of American and maybe unwittingly, international \\"fascism\\". A word that the true fascist movement cleverly attempts to distort and twist so its unrecognizable and therefor allows them to continue their stealth operations under the sanitized, umbrella guise and grossly misleading term \\"conservative\\".To call Limbaugh, Palin, O'Reilly or Beck conservative is tantamount to describing Charles Manson as a mischievous boy-scout or Hitler & Stalin, \\"activists\\". Palin, Beck, Limbaugh, Fox (fixed) News and their nefarious affiliates have one singular agenda: to continue their toxic metastases by applying the tried and true methodology of the infamous Nazi minister of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels \\"Big Lie\\" which simply repeats a simple theme and lie knowing that if the \\"lie is repeated often enough, the people will believe it\\". This is the true mantra of the right-wing and until we recognize it, expose it and defeat it, it will inevitably destroy the essence of American democracy and the \\"liberal\\" tenants that this country and constitution were built on. This book is in itself, a cynical, deliberate and contrived attempt to obfuscate the fact that the far right-wing sociopaths have ruthlessly hijacked the Republican party and have saturated their media disinformation industry with zealous assets who dispense pure calumny and lies on a 24/7 basis - all for the deliberate and malevolent purpose of subverting our precious democracy with true USA grade neofascism.Rod Serling often depicted the horrors or a futuristic totalitarian regime that imprisoned, persecuted and murdered anyone who dared to dissent or critique the tyrants and these fictional regimes who used terror, scapegoating, thug style murder and torture were not based on the passive, anti-war liberal tenants that are the essential components of our own constitution and democracy but more accurately, the horrific brutality and virulence of the true Fascism such as the Nazi's or the Soviet style totalitarianism of the Stalin brand. Anyone who actually believes Goldberg's absurd, utterly pathetic attempt to rewrite the history and meaning of fascism just flunked the Rhesus Monkey IQ test.The Nazis, unlike Goldberg's fantasy, were vicious, sadistic fanatics who were enthusiastically funded by huge corporations such as I. G. Farben, Flick, Krupp, Siemens, and many other organizations who, like Hitlers coterie, were not only virulently anti-liberal in every facet of their being (as also written in Mein Kampf), but were primarily about racial purification including (as seen in the most well preserved Nazi texts, documents and films) the obsession to exterminate whole racial and ethnic populations including Jews, liberals, communists, socialists (that's right, socialists), gypsy's, homosexuals, handicapped, deformed, and so called \\"inferior mongrel stock\\" such as Russians, Pols, Slavs in general and of course blacks or anything perceived as \\"non-Aryan\\". This is a characteristic that bears no remote resemblance to any tenant of liberalism or democracy. The SS Einsatzgruppen was assigned the specific task of murdering millions of Jews, or any \\"liberal\\" dissidents that were a threat to the Nazis. The Nazi dream was psychotic fantasy built on old Norse and Germanic mythology, the blond, blue eyed Aryan, vast armies, statues and the whole insane dream of Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Reinhardt Heydrich, Hermann Goering, Hess, Martin Bormann and the entire grisly SS. Goldberg and his right-wing puppet masters have insidiously subverted our history and in fact, our dictionary. The fact that Hitlers Nazis merely had a word included in their general title that said \\"National Socialist\\" had nothing whats so ever to do with ACTUAL, literal socialism and was initially used to deceive and lure in unsuspecting new members. Hitler very quickly proceeded to sever any resemblance between true socialism and his Nazi fascist party. He simply exploited the term just as tyrannical kings or theocrats used pious religious dogma as an excuse to commit terror. Any credible documentation that was not written by Fox News or some delusional right-wing puppet clearly documents how the Nazi's arrested, imprisoned and killed hundreds of thousands of communists, socialists and of course liberals, Jews or anyone who opposed Fascist Nazism.The rightwing will also absurdly site the pact with Stalin - are you kidding me? Hitler used Stalin to a point then proceeded to quickly brake the pact, betray Stalin and launch an all out attack on Russia. Apparently the right-wing zealots are hoping you will forget the massive Nazi assaults on Stalingrad, Moscow and a host of Russian cities that were burned to the ground. But again, propagandists like Rosenberg are designing these books for the clueless, uneducated or delusional ideologues. He is hoping his target audience will conveniently forget that liberalism and its ideas are the absolute inverse, and polar opposite of fascism and totalitarian communism or any of its deleterious surrogates. Its a fact as unassailable as the known properties of gravity and geophysics. Again, if you believe Goldberg's book, then you are likely less intelligent than a proto Australopithecus:-)The fact that Goldberg has used this mendacious abortion of history that he has the unmitigated gall to present as a scholarly exegesis on fascism, demonstrates beyond any doubt, the extent of pure fabrication and lies the extreme right-wing are willing to sink to. To compare the Nazis to liberals is so astoundingly obscene, its almost too much for any sane mind to read without suffering from brain asphyxiation and permanent nausea. Next, Goldberg or Glenn (neuro-dysfunctional) Beck will write a book claiming that the Civil War was started by aliens from the Zeta Reticuli system to harvest Southern blood, WWII was commie conspiracy and our founding fathers were angels sent by Jesus to free the colonies from Satan worshiping European Druids.Fascism is under cover, and its winning. The hour glass is running, its almost checkmate. As Rod Serling once said during his closing narration of a show about herd instinct, mass hysteria and scapegoating, \\"and the pity of this, is that it is not confined to the Twilight Zone\\"."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg's book, Liberal Fascism, is built on the common logical fallacy called Affirming the Consequent.If P, then Q.Q.Therefore, P.We are told, for example:During the 1920's and 30's, German fascists believed in eugenics.During the 1920's and 30's, American liberals believed in eugenics.Therefore, liberals are fascists.That is,If X is a fascist then X believes in eugenicsL believes in eugenicsTherefore L is a fascist.We can all deplore the fact that so many prominent liberals and socialists believed in eugenics and we can easily be convinced that being a political progressive, liberal or socialist does not exempt one from being disastrously wrong about many things, but we are not obliged to believe that liberals, progressives and socialists were fascists BECAUSE they believed many things that fascists believed.One more observation: Goldberg quotes Nietzsche, and possibly adds a footnote (I listened to the audio version of the book so I can't verify the source) as saying,\\"Nietzsche himself had pointed the way. In 1880 he wrote, \\"the tendency must be toward the rendering extinct of the wretched, the deformed, the degenerate.\\" Reproduction Nietzsche argued needed to be taken out of the hands of the masses so that race as a whole no longer suffers. The extinction of many types of people is just as desirable as any form of reproduction.Marriage itself, Nietzsche argued, must be more scrupulously regulated by the state. \\"Go through the towns and ask yourselves whether these people should reproduce. Let them go to their whores.\\"This is clearly an apocryphal quotation.Nietzsche published Human All-Too-Human in 1878 and The Dawn in 1881 and nothing in 1880.Nietzsche distrusted the state, in all his writings. He was what we might call a libertarian or anarchist politically, and was an enemy of socialism and of the subordination of the individual to the state.Second, Nietzsche was a Lamarckian (unfortunately) and believed in the heritability of acquired characteristics. That is, he thought that it took several generations to produce a well-turned out human being, not as a consequence of eugenics but of acquired (learned) characteristics that were passed on to the child through genes that were altered by training and education. Modern science has, for the most part, rejected the Lamarkian view of genetics.In all his writings, as far as I know, and certainly not in his mature writings, is there any mention by Nietzsche of an attempt to produce the Overman or Superman through eugenics.I already admitted to another poster that I didn't read Goldberg's book, I listened to it. And I quit listening somewhere near the middle because of one apocryphal quote from Nietzsche and all the bad reasoning, some of which I pointed out.Here are some more examples of bad logic and rhetoric:(I listened to the first half of this book as an mp3 version and I'm transcribing the following quotes from the spoken version.)Goldberg says, \\"We need to to understand that American progressivism shares important roots with European fascism. No clearer or sinister proof (note the word proof AND the word sinister) exists than the passion with which American and European progressives greeted eugenics, widely seen as the answer to the social question.\\"I believe this comes from chapter 8 near the end.(Sinister) proof: the passion with with eugenics was widely seen as the answer to the \\"social question.\\" (I can only assume Goldberg means liberals and not conservatives by the word \\"widely\\")I thought the \\"social question\\" was one of the topics of world history, sociology, philosophy, religion and politics during the last 2,500 years.Does Goldberg seriously define liberals as people who rolled all of the Great Conversation of 2,500 years into one simple answer: eugenics?Can we really take a statement like that seriously?I decided to listen to the next chapter and came up with this juicy paragraph:Goldberg says, somewhere in the middle of chapter 9, I believe (I have the audio version)\\"Thanks to some deeply flawed scholarship by the liberal historian Richard Hofstadter, nearly all of so-called Robber barons of the 19th and early 20th century were dubbed Social Darwinists too even though subsequent historians have demonstrated that gilded age industrialists were barely influenced by Darwinism if at all. Darwinism was a fixation of intellectuals and academics. The so-called Robber Barons generally lacked formal education to the extent they grounded their world view in anything, it was in Christian ethics and the writings of Adam Smith. Moreover they believed that capitalism was good for the poor. Yet selected quotations and sweeping generalizations usually infused with Marxist cliches rendered the Robber Barons ersatz fascists.\\"1. You can't just say that Richard Hofstadter's scholarship was deeply flawed, you've got to give some demonstrations with quotations that prove factual errors, distortions and errors of logic such as I'm going to provide below for Goldberg's paragraph.2. The Robber Barons were dubbed Social Darwinists for their behavior, not their beliefs. No one ever accused Robber Barons of being intellectuals who carried out a Darwinian mission. Social Darwinism meant, as it does today, \\"survival of the fittest and devil take the hindmost\\" not \\"biologist or intellectual who specializes in Darwin studies.\\"3. Darwinism has never been a \\"fixation\\" of intellectuals and academics. It is a scientific theory open to verification and modification. Many scientists aren't intellectuals. They're just people who are trying to understand the world around them using the scientific method. A lot of them play in rock bands, for example.4. Darwin did not think human behavior can be equated with the behavior of animals. He knew that language and civilization changed most of us. Whatever the case, our nearest human cousins, monkeys and apes are often very peaceful and sometimes even fruitarians (eat only fruit,) such as the great apes. Monkeys and apes rarely eat meat and even our closest relatives, the chimpanzees are \\"not red in tooth and claw.\\" That is reserved for carnivores such as dogs and cats. Social Darwinist has come to mean laissez-faire capitalism with no \\"safety nets\\" and has nothing to do with \\"survival of the fittest\\" except in a metaphorical sense (the strongest man is helpless against the richest man, for example, unless the rich one is a certified idiot.)5. The Robber Barons were Christians only for show. They believed in making money for themselves and they paid their workers the smallest wages possible and made them work as long and as hard as they could. There were exceptions, such as Henry Ford. But the average Robber Baron was called that for a reason. They favored Irish and Chinese immigration because starving immigrants worked for far less money and worked far harder than Americans would, the same as today.7. The Robber Barons were just as ignorant of the writings of Adam Smith and Karl Marx as they were of the writings of Charles Darwin and were not influenced by any intellectuals, not even the few in the Bible such as Solomon.8. The Robber Barons were not called ersatz (means substitute, fake, artificial) fascists because fascism was unknown in their day AND they only wanted government OUT OF THE WAY or in their pockets or help them get rid of unions. Since they had their own armies however, they didn't need the government. There were no income taxes in those days either so they didn't bother much with the government except to pay off local party bosses. Fascists take over government and rule the people through the government apparatus. The Robber Barons could care less about the government or the people. They just wanted to get rich.If there is so much to criticize in just TWO paragraphs, what is the point in reading (listening to) the rest of the book?"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"\\"Fascist\\" has a meaning...and it's not \\"people who I personally think suck.\\" Jonah is just clarifying terms but because people have gotten away with the name-calling for so long, they don't want to let go of the word.John Stewart's interview of him looked like a 13 year old picking on the nerdy smart kid in school by giving him a wedgie and then yelling \\"I WIN THE DEBATE!\\" Liberals have the right to write their own books without hacking Amazon's site for Jonah.

Suddenly, large swarms of humans who had been \\"anonymous\\" became wealthier, and demanded a seat at the table -- or a place at the beach. Restaurants and beaches became crowded.We may note in passing that this real historical development -- the rise of mass man through increasing wealth -- is just one more thing which makes Karl Marx look like an idiot. Marx famously predicted that the increasing impoverishment of mass-man would lead to a revolution.But Ortega y Gasset missed reporting on one thing which ordinary readers will be curious about: what happens when mass-man accedes to political power? Ortega y Gasset has a few notes, but he missed the main shows.To be brief: the rise of mass-man led to the rise of new political parties, generally dedicated to taking the property of the wealthy and giving it to mass-man. The most well-known forms of this are, of course, Socialism and Communism. To be a \\"leftist,\\" after all, means mostly that: \\"reducing inequality\\" by soaking the rich. It's been a long time since I heard any \\"leftist\\" calling for more freedom, or for \\"classical liberal values.\\"Now, to get to the book under review: it is as clear as anything in history that Mussolini was \\"a man of the left.\\" He was more than that: he was a dedicated Socialist. Hitler was more complex, racist, and opportunistic, but he nevertheless rode to power on the back of his \\"national socialist\\" movement. Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot need no commentary from me. So the hair-raising conclusion is just this:Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot were ALL \\"men of the left.\\" This is just plain historical fact.But it's giving people the apoplexy to have this truth rubbed in. I am a boomer, and grew up learning that \\"Fascism\\" was just awful, while being \\"Progressive\\" was like -- (reaching for the slang) -- just like really cool, man.And now we have to re-think everything!

I have always agreed with the premise, based largely on reading Pipes and Johnson. Goldberg sets the historical record straight with an exhaustive and impressive telling of the roots of fascism. I think the book tails off a bit when he tries to connect the dots between modern liberals and the early Progressive movement. His central thesis is that fascism is a religious ideology that worships the state (which certainly seems to parallel the dystopian vision of Hillary's village), but I think he fails to adequately address the breadth of the modern liberal field. Someone like John Kerry, a devoted internationalist, hardly fits within Goldberg's definition. Of course, this is faint praise of Kerry, who is merely drifting towards the communist/international pole of the Left."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The primary problem I had with this book is not so much the author's associating American liberalism/progressivism with European fascism but with his attempt to say that all authoritarianism and idealization of the State is by definition, his definition, fascism. He goes so far as to say Lenin, Stalin, and Castro are fascists. This is absurd. They were, or are in the case of Castro, certainly authoritarian, but to call them fascist it to miss the clear differences in their economic policies from people like Hitler or Mussolini who were economic centrists--a Third Way between capitalism and socialism.If one takes into consideration all of the various political ideologies present in western democracies during the 19th through the early 21st centuries and places them on a Cartesian plane with economic issues on the x-axis (left/right) and social issues on the y-axis (authoritarian/libertarian) one can more easily distinguish the differences between various points of view. Authoritarian rightists like the American Republican and Democratic Parties would be in the upper right, authoritarian leftists like Castro and Lenin would be on the upper left, libertarian leftists like Gandhi and Nelson Mandela would be on the lower left, and libertarian rightists such as Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand would be on the lower right.Given a model of political philosophy such as above fascists are close to the center of the economic axis, though historically they leaned to the economic right, not the left as Goldberg asserts. Where Goldberg is correct is in associating fascism and American liberalism on economic issues. The Democratic Leadership Council, modern UK Labour, and the German Social Democrats under Schroder (all of whom are representative of economic centrism) have even openly embraced the term the term Third Way to represent their politics. However it must be clearly emphasized that all of these groups are certainly more socially libertarian than any historical or contemporary fascist parties.Apart from their economic centrism - once again centrism being a center between advocates of neo-liberal capitalism and economic policy as advocated by authoritarian Marxist-Leninists or libertarian socialists - historical and contemporary fascists, like the British National Party or the French National Front, openly embrace a law and order social policy that seeks to empower the police and military while promoting race and nationalism as paramount values. American liberals, on the other had, do not advocate for these things or at least not nearly as much as the BNP or the Front national.In general Goldberg states an interesting case for associating American liberalism with European fascism but he makes some pretty big mistakes by calling all authoritarianism fascism and calling it part of the economic left. The latter can be partially forgive as, in the American context that he is writing, the economic views that liberals and fascists share are the far left to some someone as far to the right economically as Goldberg."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"It is long past due that the facts be known about the extremes of the liberal movement which has been hijacked over time by the forces of socialism.

Revealing as to the evolution of Mussolini's thinking from leftist demagogue, albeit possessed of an intellect, to a dictator of another stripe."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I got the impression from the beginning of this book that Goldberg was trying to discover or articulate some kind of \\"unified theory\\" of collectivist politics. And while he did not quite accomplished this particular goal, he provides instead an absorbing historical account of the history of progressivism in the late 19th and 20th century and the common roots shared by American liberalism and fascism. His story reaches back to the grand-daddy of all progressive eras the French Revolution and the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the antics of Robespierre who, having unleashed the forces of progressivism, died at its hands.His analysis is more tortuous than need be in his effort to declare that liberalism is fascist in nature. Of course it is! But he fails to articulate a broader more encompassing simpler theory of collectivist politics that his historical examination amply displays. Albert Jay Nock, in his book, \\"Our Enemy, the State\\" illuminates just such a unified theory as did our founding fathers and most recently Ronald Reagan. From Nock: \\"The serious student sees in [Fascism, Bolshevism and Hitlerism] only the one root-idea of a complete conversion of social power into State power.\\" In other words, the usurpation of individual and community power by the State is the simple fulcrum upon which any serious inquiry into our current political condition must rest.Progressivism, liberalism, leftism and socialism are all rooted in the usurpation of individual liberty in deference to the accretion of power by the State. The accretion of power by the State takes different forms in different cultures - a point that Goldberg makes - but nonetheless does so at the expense of what Nock calls social power. Today, the State's growth continues unabated. Our monolithic State has now become a transnational goliath considerably more unaccountable than the nation-State.His historical analysis contained many flashes of brilliant insight however in my opinion the book could have greatly benefited from more thought, a better editor and more organization. Not that I didn't enjoy the book - I enjoyed it enormously and would heartily recommend it to anyone. But the book did contain some lapses which in my opinion detracted from the overall quality of the product.Goldberg's thesis is, and I quote from the end of the book, \\"that modern liberalism is the offspring of twentieth century progressivism, which in turn shares intellectual roots with European fascism.\\" And I agree wholeheartedly with this thesis. He then goes on to say fascism was an international movement that expressed itself differently in different countries. But from the beginning of the book he fails to give, in my opinion, a rigorous and precise definition of fascism. In fact, he only reluctantly offered a \\"working definition\\" of fascism near the end of the first chapter. His book would have benefited greatly from a precise definition of what he means by fascism, totalitarianism, collectivism, Nazism, Communism, progressivism, liberalism and leftism with a chapter devoted to contrasting these various ideologies. This failure to rigorously define his terms led to his failure to elucidate a simpler more comprehensive \\"unified\\" investigation into the conversion of social power into State power.At the end of the book he says that writing this book was an educational experience for him which was obvious from his imprecisions and not a little wandering, but he, as well as his readers, would have benefited had he spent more time synthesizing the historical information and refining and expanding his conclusions. He was so close to a truly great book! I wish he'd given it a bit more thought and spent some more time on it.So much of the book is good that it overwhelms the book's shortcomings, but, had Goldberg spent more time, this book could have been so much more. While liberalism and fascism do undeniably share a common Utopian impulse and desire to employ the apparatus of the State to effect change, the larger point regarding the simple accumulation of State power, regardless of the ostensible justification, fell to the side. James Madison was worried that \\"the old trick of turning every contingency into a resource for accumulating force in the government\\" would defeat the Founders goal of limited government. And it is THIS threat, the accumulation of State power no matter its particular or unique cultural manifestation that threatens our liberty. His book, despite being highly recommended, falls short of what it might have been. All the pieces are there - he simply gave up too soon."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"J. Goldberg goes to great links to correct the revisionist and misapplied lessons of the history of fascism that should have been learned thoroughly a hundred years ago. Liberalism has emulated many of the tenets of fascism and was the envy of the Eurpoeans before Hitler's dreams turned dark. The amazing thing is that the American model of fascism has happened here before, but never fulfilled to the darkness achieved in WWII. The other mis-nomer that fascism has been hung on conservatives is completely exposed. When the power of the state diminishes the individual, then we are already considerably down the road of fascism some distance.

It is clear, has a lot of interesting points and is an entertaining book to read. It also has had influence on the dialogue coming from the American right. I also learned things I didn't know about President Wilson, Benito Mussolini, and some progressive thinkers of the early 20th Century.But I have to disagree with a lot of what Goldberg says. On the topic of Hitler and Nazism Goldberg claims Hitler was a man of the left not the right because his movement was revolutionary and involved radical change as opposed to stability. But this ignores the fact that Hitler came to power because he allied himself with and made deals with the business establishment of Germany. If he had not made deals with them, and unlike many of his later promises to leaders of other nations, he basically kept his word with the moneyed interests of Germany, except for the Jews of course. Goldberg claims that the business interests only came to Hitler after he took power. This is not correct.On the topic of Wilson, Goldberg makes an excellent point that Wilson overstepped his bounds on civil liberties. But then this had everything to do with World War I. He would not have done it if we had not gone to war. It really has nothing to do with Wilson being a progressive.On the 60s Goldberg omits the fact that the 1960s movements in America took place within the context of the Vietnam War. Whatever destructiveness they caused either in their theories or in their actions pales in comparison to the destructiveness of American actions in Vietnam in the 60s and early 70s.When he gets to more contemporary topics it goes downhill. The chapter in which he claims Hillary in the 90s was trying to institute a Brave New World type of nanny state is not really credible. Hillary also is pretty much a centrist, she's not on the left as Goldberg claims.But the last chapter on President Bush( the book came out in early 2008)and Pat Buchanan has some good points.I saw Goldberg on C Span after his book came out. He said that this book stemmed from his irritation that liberals werealways calling people who were Republicans and or Bush supporters fascists. So this book is kind of giving liberals a taste of their own medicine.

Frankly, I was going to pass on it because I had viewed Jonah Goldberg as a bit of a wise acre and didn't realize he had a book like this in him. And the title and the cover art, while attention getting, contribute to the idea that this is going to be a lightweight attack piece. I guess the title and cover art got a lot of attention and helped the book sell well, but I only read it because a friend told me I shouldn't miss it. I am glad my friend brought it to my attention because it is a valuable book and will provide great information to anyone who is willing to actually read it rather than surmise what it says one way or the other.If you have doubts or objections to what you think the book might be saying, I encourage you to start with the Afterword in which he anticipates many of the likely criticisms of the book and also shows where he believes conservatism can run off the rails. This is not the one sided or wild-eyed attack piece some have claimed it to be. Goldberg shows us what an imprecise and slippery epithet fascism has become. He then takes us back to the father of fascism, Mussolini, and shows how it grew out of the Progressive movements alive in American and Europe and uses the writings of intellectuals of that movement to show the linkage and their praise of Pre-Hitler Mussolini.Goldberg then demonstrates how Hitler was a man of the Left and how the accusations of his being \\"right wing\\" have to be understood as accusations against a nationalist socialist movement from the USSR's internationalist (read Moscow dominated) communist-socialist movement. The author is CLEAR and says many times that he is not saying that the left wing in general and especially that the left of today is NOT guilty of the holocaust nor is he saying that their policies would lead to such a monstrous outcome.We next move to Woodrow Wilson through to Franklin Roosevelt and the ways in which they introduced fascist policies within America and in our foreign policy. The kind of public suppression of individual liberty and thought under Wilson is swept under the rug today and I hope the events Goldberg describes in this book get brought back into popular awareness. We would be horrified at someone being shot for refusing to say the pledge of allegiance, but in that time it was seen as a justifiable and heroic act!Franklin Roosevelt's true history is getting broader play today and the all but universal praise he received in my youth is justly being reconsidered. This book does a fine job in setting those policies in a clear context of the worldwide progressive and fascist movements. Remember, you cannot use your present suppositions about what fascism means to judge this use of the term. It was a term that was used with praise prior to World War II and the holocaust.Chapter 5 takes us through the 1960s and the cultural revolution that revived many of the fascist notions and spread them into the radical youth who are now striving for power in our political (and economic) institutions today. Chapters 7 reviews how eugenics was originally stated and how its echoes remain in present left-progressive policies (without their advocating the kind of eugenics policies that seemed so useful to intellectual advocating social and racial hygiene a century ago). Chapter 8 tours the economic bargains the participants in various progressive economies were willing to strike with fascism. Goldberg shows clearly why big companies are no longer capitalist and why they work for state protection from competition, for tax breaks and subsidies, and end up supporting progressive-left state policies.Chapter 9 is a useful and clear headed analysis of the kinds of policies Hillary Clinton and her progressive compatriots advocate and how they have changed the techniques of persuasion in order to sell the old progressive nostrums in the name of \\"the children\\". We see clearly our own acceptance of these old fascist notions and how the old-time religion of individual liberty and limited government is weakening under the administrations of BOTH the Democrats and Republicans, especially George W. Bush.This is a very useful book and I hope it is widely read and discussed seriously. We don't need any shouting down, spitting, or claims about what the books says or proves that it doesn't say for itself. In any case, Goldberg has my sincerest praise for his accomplishment. Superbly done.

They are all daughters of the Counter-Enlightenment in that they privilege collectivism over individualism, emotion over reason and have all succumbed to what has been termed (not by Goldberg) the \\"totalitarian temptation\\"; the idea that if only we had a good enough plan, if only we had the right people, the people with the special insight or occulted knowledge, we could achieve perfectibility in Man.Therefore, the common wisdom that fascism is a phenomenon of the \\"Right\\" vice communism as a phenomenon of the \\"Left\\" is actually misleading. Both movements share a common ancestor in the Counter-Enlightenment and are thus better understood as different branches of the same family. Goldberg makes a good argument that the received wisdom as it stands today is the result of a propaganda coup by the Soviets wherein they labeled all competitors to the Soviet Empire as \\"fascist\\" (even though fascism and communism were philosophically and functionally similar.) Thus, today, any philosophy of the Right (conservatism or classical liberalism) is parodied as \\"fascist\\" or \\"crypto-fascist.\\"Goldberg writes a strong history of European fascism and how the American Progressive movement of the first half of the 20th century bore an eerie resemblance to it. Anyone worried about the creeping fascism of George W. Bush would do well to read Goldberg's narration of the Woodrow Wilson/FDR eras. It is compelling reading that will make your hair stand on end.Less compelling to an extent is his later discussion of modern liberalism, but his argument is well taken; modern Leftism traces its lineage directly from the Counter-Enlightenment and thus shares more than a gene or two with historical fascism.Note that Goldberg is *not* saying that liberals are fascists, and certainly not Nazis (he feels compelled to constantly highlight the distinction throughout the book - for good reason.) However, because these two movements do share the same philosophical roots, it is imperative that we, as Americans who have largely been defined by our classical liberalism, understand that the siren song of \\"social justice\\" and appeals to \\"get beyond politics\\" lead to a dark place.Essential reading for an understanding of the current global struggle between the Enlightenment and its discontents."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Along with David Mamet's \\"The Secret Knowledge\\", Goldberg's \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is a must-read for anyone with even an inkling of objectivity and any degree of regard for history and truth.The more upset you are by the conclusions presented in \\"Liberal Fascism\\", the better your chances to come away from reading it with a better understanding of the damage liberal progressivism has done to this country in particular and to the world in general.You will, of course, have to be willing to accept such unpleasant realities as well-documented events, confirmable annotated sources, undeniably accurate presentation of valid conclusions and the always-inconvenient fact here and there, but if you are a reasonable, rational individual, this book could certainly help you the next time you ask yourself \\"How did we come to this?

He also walks the reader through how the modern progressive movement grew out of the policies and tactics used by Woodrow Wilson and FDR to surpress and control the population during WWs I & I, respectively. With this, the reader gets to see the roots of BHO's Alinksy-inspired tactics, and why the word \\"LIBERTY\\" is almost never uttered by the modern Statists while throwing around the terms \\"fairness\\" and \\"shared sacrifice\\". Not too long ago, I was given a glimpse of the liberal strategy during a personal debate with a Madison-Wisconsin true disciple. In a rare display of honesty, he stated that all modern issues, by definition, are infused with elements of \\"Race, Gender or Class\\", and it was clear that this slip was an unintended and immediately regrettable look at the progressives' playbook, namely to connect all American woes to unfairnesses involving race, gender or class, with double or triple \\"points\\" for multiple connections. While this admission helped frame the absurd lengths that I've seen the Left contort their arguments in order to appear that their beliefs command the moral high ground and thus dominate all debates, it took this book to fully understand the origins of this strategy.This book is pure, unadulterated enlightenment for anyone trying to figure out how we ended up in this Orwellian state, where what once was virtuous is now denigrated, and what once was base is now exalted.And for those that find themselves the subject of this tome, why don't you man up, and own your philosophy, instead of constantly schucking and diving, in an attempt to avoid having to defend your beliefs, like some philosophical version of \\"Whack-a-Mole\\"? If you are a statist, a progressive, a socialist, a Marxist, et al, then stand tall and admit it. And if you really believed in your convictions, you would read this book, and try and prove to yourself where it fails. Finally, for those Lefty Madison professor types, I challenge you to make Goldberg's \\"distortions\\" the subject of your next class, and let the young impressionables at it. That's if you have the courage of your convictions, which, based on countless rounds debating with moles, is unlikely."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"we can't be afraid to label fascists appropriately. the left needs everyone on the same page and to snare most freedom-lovers that means control and untruth. it took the recognition of fascism for whittaker chambers to finally break from communism. it is a revelation had too late in many cases. thank you to mr. goldberg for shining a light."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg offers a definitive, scholarly text in readable form of the progressive nature of Fascism.

I wrote about it in my book \\"Eternal Treblinka\\" (see below), so I won't go into it now.Instead, I want to draw attention to Mr. Goldman's amazing pronouncement that \\"Himmler was an animal rights activist.\\" Not only is his statement false, but it's stupid!!!Perhaps that kind of myopic thinking eases Mr. Goldman's conscience when he sits down at mealtime and feeds on the flesh of abused and murdered animals, but such superficial and shoddy scholarship does not speak well for his book or for his integrity as an author.Heinrich Himmler was not only NOT an animal activist, but his career as a breeder and killer of chickens contributed to his being the driving force behind the Holocaust.Here is an excerpt of what I wrote about this in my book \\"Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust\\" (p. 101):\\"Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS and a main architect of the Holocaust, began his journey to eugenics with animal breeding. His agricultural studies and experience breeding chickens convinced him that since all behavioral characteristics are hereditary, the most effective way to shape the future of a population--human or non-human--was to institute breeding projects that favored the desirable and eliminated the undesirable.Himmler's operation of a chicken farm increased his obsession with eugenics and improving human as well as animal stock. As Fritz Redlich writes, 'this interest in breeding and killing chickens was transferred to the breeding and killing of humans.'Himmler was in a position to apply the principles and methods of animal breeding to humans in a way no other eugenicist was ever able to do. Jochen von Lang writes, 'After his commercial failure as a chicken breeder, Himmler elected to become a breeder of human beings.'After the war, one of his SS officers testified that Himmler's farming background was behind his obsession with racial breeding. At each step of the way along the road to genocide, animal exploitation--breeding, culling, and slaughtering--paved the way.\\"Himmler was an animal rights activist?

It is exceedingly well written, well researched and well documented, and it gives a refreshing, alternative view of history that you will NOT find in the standard liberal-dominated texts. The author eschews political-correctness in favor of seeking out the truth! He makes a deep impression that Fascism is simply State-control of a society, and is hence a form of statism, which is usually a left-wing phenomenon. He totally debunks the old, kneejerk habit of liberals calling conservatives \\"fascists\\" (which they believe basically because they say so), by showing how fascism started out as a form of socialism, ie was a movement on the left, and follows it from the WWI Progressives to the Liberals, through FDR, the Great Society, the 60's radical street movements, the liberal God-State, and up to today's \\"Global Village\\" and oppressive politically-correctness.This book should be the subject of an entire history course, in every college in America.

It took me years of independent reading to \\"un-learn\\" all the wrong-headed and misleading political analysis of fascism that is 'common-knowledge'. The fact that Fascism in general is the child of Progressivism is fairly well known, but the chapter on the abuses of the Wilson Administration was a real eye-opener. George W. Bush never even imagined 1/10th of the anti-civil liberties measures that Wilson put into place and enforced. As expected, the writing is fresh, clear, concise, and has the inimitable Goldberg wit..This book is extremely timely. Next year, when the new administration begins to praise \\"bold experimentation\\" and urges \\"unity\\" to save the nation, you will know what to expect."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"A cogent answer for the slingers of \\"Fascist\\" arrows at conservatives. Jonah Goldberg's well-researched new book, Liberal Fascism, reveals Adolph Hitler's National Socialist Democratic Party and the Communist Party grew from identical Socialist roots. They both advocated state control of the people and means of production and commonly pursued identical socialist programs to realize their special brand of utopia.Liberal Fascism documents that Fascism & Communism are not enemies at all. In fact, you might say they could pass for Siamese twins and occupy the left in tandem.Mr. Goldberg documents both fascist and communist societies rest on the same socialist pillars* The state, not the citizenry, either owns or controls all or most production.* Like monarchies of old, the state reigns supreme over individuals. These forms of government inevitably extend control into sacrosanct areas - property, religion, family and even thought. (You see evidence in current U.S.Supreme Court decisions, attempts at public school socialist indoctrination, attacks on religion and political correctness, to name just four.)But, aren't the two systems ideological enemies? Seems not. Marxian socialist principles under gird both. In the 1930s, the two groups clashed only because they both wanted to recruit the same German Socialist party constituents. Hitler molded the principles around nationalism. Lenin shaped his around international communism. Both degenerated into dictatorships.Incidentally, Jonah says his title came from H.G. Wells and he had no intent to impugn the Left. This progressive and famous writer of last century coined the phrase as a \\"badge of honor\\". \\"Progressives must become \`liberal fascists' and \`enlightened Nazis,' he told the Young Liberals at Oxford in a speech in July 1932.\\"Jonah also gently reminds us the Left has never ceased espousing many fascist/communist principles and programs. (As if in confirmation, this book prompts near apoplexy from the anointed. Some so want to derail this topic, they hacked Goldberg's Amazon.com page, not once but twice! a \\"first\\" at Amazon. To avoid debating issues, some leftists forestall any chance at honest discussion by hurling the \\"Fascist\\" label at conservatives. So, you can understand their anguish. Jonah's research pins that slur back on the throwers.Another reviewer says the author \\"equates all authoritarianism with fascism.\\" He definitely takes pains not to and deals in-depth with that idea in later chapters. Obviously the reviewer did not read all the book.Liberal Fascism is a bombshell of a book - well worth reading to achieve a balanced view between current progressive & conservative thought."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I have really enjoyed this book. Goldberg has shined a light on what it truly means to be Liberal today. While I had heard some of this in college a lot of the information, especially about Wilson was all news to me. At times it does seem that Goldberg reaches a little to make his point, but he does make it. I would, and have, recommend this book to Liberals I know so that they can lean a little about their history and where their beliefs come from"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The reaction of leftists against this book has been strong in its emotional content, but weak in its intellectual content, and rightly so. To associate ones' opponents with fascism should draw a strong emotional response. Welfare state liberals should know this because they have been hurling false accusations of fascism against their opponents for decades. Conservative and Libertarians have been characterized as \\"right wing\\", along with fascists and Nazis. In some instances Leftists have explicitly conflated Conservatism and Libertarianism with Nazism- without really substantiating their opinions on this matter.Was there ever really a basis for comparing conservatives and Libertarians to Nazis and Fascists? How do they compare on domestic policy? The fact of the matter is that Mussolini and Hitler favored extensive government regulation of industry and finance. Hitler also favored gun control, heavy progressive taxes, public health care, public works projects, public education, and minimum wage laws. Hitlerean Germany followed a Keynesian type policy of demand management (see also Barkai: Nazi Economics). The New Deal and Nazi economics were both patterned after Mussolini's program. The fact of the matter is that Nazi Germany adopted extensive central planning. The Nazi economy was run by four-year plans, administered by Hermann G&ouml;ring. Libertarians and Economic Conservatives are clearly opposed to such policies. Do Welfare state liberals oppose or support such policies?The Liberal-Left favors regulation of the economy by government officials. The far left favors an agenda that is disturbingly similar to Fascist/Nazi policies. The New Deal was seen as fascistic from the outset:\\"Among the early Roosevelt fascist measures was the National Industry Recovery Act (NRA) of June 16, 1933 .... [these ideas] were first suggested by Gerard Swope (of the General Electric company)... They were adopted by the United States Chamber of Commerce. During the campaign of 1932, Henry I. Harriman, president of that body, urged that I agree to support these proposals, informing me that Mr. Roosevelt had agreed to do so. I tried to show him that this stuff was sheer fascism; that it was a remaking of Mussolini's \\"corporate state\\" and refused to agree to any of it. He informed me that in view of my attitude, the business world would support Roosevelt with money and influence. That for the most part proved true.\\" Herbert HooverHoover Memoirs 3:420To be fair, one should note that Germany already had an intrusive government before Hitler came to power. It would also be grossly unfair to compare Liberal Democrats and Fascists on foreign policy- but conservatives and libertarians also oppose fascistic foreign policies. Hitler favored economic policies and other domestic policies that Democrats have imposed on America. Other books have made this point, but this point bears repeating.Leftists and Liberal Democrats have been making completely absurd comparisons between Fascists and the conservative/Libertarian right for decades. This is not turnabout as fair play because there never was any factual basis for leftist accusations against conservatives and libertarians. There are real and significant similarities between Fascism and welfare state liberalism, mainly on economic policy. Democrat Woodrow Wilson DID jail war protestors, including Eugene Debs. Wilson also segregated Federal employees. It was Wilson's Republican successor Warren Harding who pardoned Debs and desegregated Federal employees. Self-described progressives ought to be more aware of history. FDR did try to \\"pack the supreme court\\" and \\"purge the congress\\" (his words, not mine). FDR did inter Americans of Japanese ancestry. So-called progressives, like FDR, TR, and Wilson did things that should disgust modern Liberals. Yet liberal democrats praise these presidents. Wake up and smell what you on the left have been shoveling.Those on the left who are annoyed by these facts should be more careful about who they refer to as fascists. They should also reconsider their beliefs. Contrary to what they believe increased federal regulation and taxation does not promote or lead to a truly liberal and free society. In reality, \\"government is a dangerous servant and a fearful master\\". The Liberal-left has been as foolish in conflating Conservative and Libertarians with fascists and Nazis as they have in ignoring the obvious parallels between their policies and fascist policies. They are mad at Goldberg because his case is factual, like it or not."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"There are a few things that we've learned as kids and have since taken for granted: the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, the birds fly south in the Winter, and north in the Summer, there are four seasons, seven days in week, etc. One of these truisms that almost no one questions is that communism is a left/liberal ideology while fascism is a right/conservative one. And while communism to this day has maintained a certain level of respectability and even moral high ground in some circles, labeling someone a fascist is the lowest form of insult, and something that many conservative thinkers are constantly subjected to. Therefore it came as a bit of a surprise to me to discover that fascism is in fact, when looked at objectively and without the baggage that it has assumed in popular perception, a quintessential left-of-center ideology. Granted, \\"Nazi\\" is in fact a shorthand for \\"National-socialist,\\" but for the better part of last seventy years hardly anyone thought to emphasize the \\"socialist\\" part of the label, only the nationalism by which it was widely known. In the light of that Jonah Goldberg's book comes as a revelation that has profound effect on one's perception of the world. It is equivalent to discovering that the sun rises AND sets in the East. I was at first rather skeptical of the premise of this book, but the exhaustive, detailed and persuasive historical evidence that was presented in the book put all my misgivings aside. It documented many of the fascist tendencies and full-blown policies of some of the darlings of American left: Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. It shows that aside from the extermination of Jews, there are hardly any policies of German National-socialists that differ substantially from any other socialist movement of the time, or even today. And herein, according to this book, lies the greatest danger for the modern western democracies. By demonizing fascism as a phenomenon of the right, it leaves open the unimpeded encroachment to many fascist policies under the guise of socialist and other liberal movements. These movements don't necessarily want the full-blown fascist dictatorships installed, but they are certainly progressing in that direction. That's why they are referred to as \\"liberal\\" fascists - fascists with a smiley face.Jonah Goldberg does a remarkable job of presenting his ideas and impressions to the modern reader - always backed by facts, never overdoing the rhetoric. The book covers somewhat the similar ground as the legendary \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" by F. A. Hayek. This latter book was written in the middle of WWII, and had some of the same perceptions as \\"Liberal Fascism.\\" Its thesis was to warn the Western democracies against implementing many of the social programs that led to the rise of fascism and communism in Europe at the time. It is sobering to see that many of those warnings are still relevant today, maybe even more so than in 1940s. We live in the world where both fascism and communism are rapidly recede in people's memory, and it is easy to think that what led to them could not possibly happen again. \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is a sobering reminder that the road to fascism is indeed sometimes paved with the best intentions.One final note: many of the current-events books out there don't age well, and their relevance diminishes almost as fast as that of many periodicals. This is certainly not the case with \\"Liberal Fascism.\\" The style of writing and the comprehensive historical references and examples will keep this book relevant for many years to come."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The book is very well documented but it is hardly surprising for anyone who has read \\"Road to Serfdom\\" by Friedrich Hayek or \\"The vision of the anointed\\" by Thomas Sowell. If someone is writing a doctoral thesis, this book is very interesting due to its very valuable references. If the reason to buy it is simply a better understanding of politics and social dynamics, any of the two mentioned books could be a better option.By the way, it is very easy finding reviews of this book that, trying to be destructive, make fully clear the main point of the author. While trying to criticize it, many people certify its truth with a behavior fully adapted to the description of the book.Since the author uses many references from Europe, it should be interesting emphasizing that the term \\"liberal\\" itself has a meaning almost opposite at every side of Atlantic Ocean. Liberal, in Europe, is someone who is near to people like Hayek, Sowell, Revel or even Popper. Liberal, in the U.S., is another word for socialist. It is difficult to be more different and the contents of the book deserve a clarification of this point."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book outlines the mutual admiration between the many socialists and fascists of the early 1900s through the present day. Outlines how our language has been prostituted by propagandists who are focused upon social engineering. Jonah Goldberg presents a seamless argument that fascism and communism are similar in theory and practice, and that American progressives are the children of a fascist past. Communism was promoted as an international movement of workers with class-based conflict. Whereas fascism used socialist economic principles combined with nationalist and often militaristic enablers.Classical liberals (who are now called conservatives) believed in maximum individual and economic freedom with foci upon: free markets, primacy of the constitution, individual freedom, and our right to property. In contrast, communists, fascists, and today's progressives believe in collectivism, a \`living' constitution, collectivism, Statist rights (that supersede both individual and property rights) and replacing ones belief in \\"God\\" with the primacy of the God-State. There are many similarities between Communist, Socialist and Fascist goals and today's progressives to include: command economy, nationalization of industry (GM, banks), guaranteed employment (government jobs), and anti-capitalism, expansion of health care and abolishment of market-based lending. Similarities are frightening.Goldberg makes the point that today's progressives are kinder and gentler somewhat maternal versions of Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany and Stalin/Lenin's Soviet State ... but they are cut from the same clothe none-the-less. Starting with fascism under Woodrow Wilson, continuing through the Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"New Deal\\" to Lyndon Johnson's \\"Great Society\\" and concluding with the politics of today the author connects the dots on the liberal/progressive goal of subjecting the American people to the whims of self-anointed, technocrat-elitists in Government. Goldberg succinctly outlines how the former party of racists, Jim Crow laws, Japanese Internment, Tuskegee experiments, and communist sympathizers has become aligned with \\"victims\\" through a century of propaganda (false accusations of hate and racism), violence or threats of violence, and government handouts by the Welfare State - tactics that would make Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler, Goebbels, and Himmler proud. If you read this book with an open mind, you will shift from \\"Fascism can't happen here\\" to the realization that \\"It has already happened here.\\"First read The 5000 Year Leap: A Miracle That Changed the World by W. Cleon Skousen. Immediately thereafter read Liberal Fascism by Jonah Goldberg!

His humor shows up self-important fools for who they are. His irreverance horrifies the left, some of whom seem unable to defend their beliefs with reason and logic, but believe their passion justifies their policies. They resort to name-calling, floundering helplessly. It's a hoot.I expected the book to be full of tweaking. I was ready for Ann Coulter-style archness and snark.In fact, it was off to a good start with the title! To determine the impact, read the negative reviews of this book, many of which respond solely to the title.But I didn't get much of the rollicking good fun I expected. I wanted a book to puncture that smug self-righteousness that surrounds leftists, as if being liberal equals being virtuous. We did eventually get there, but not till page 317. Instead, what I got was a factual, thorough history of the Progressive movement. Which I needed, as my education failed me in this area (surprise!). The book shows how the term \\"fascism\\" has been hijacked by the left, virtually meaning \\"anything that leftists don't like.\\" It is used as an attack term, not an argument.So, from its roots in Rousseau and Robespierre, Progressivism has been a system dedicated to a rebellion against the existing traditions: church, aristocracy, family, authority. Progressivism lauds experimentation over policies -- it is a movement propounding \\"change\\" and \\"action\\". It is a youth-oriented revolt, an appeal to community, an ideal of \\"bettering mankind\\". As if, given the right people in control, all society's problems could be solved.For Progressives, individuality *contravenes* the public interest. Individualism is not in the best interests of society -- only collective interests are valued. If society is to move forward, then some people are going to have to sacrifice their selfish individuality for the common good. Where have you heard that recently? Who said it? It is a cardinal rule of fascism.Progressivism exploits popular resentment against \\"fat cats\\", international bankers, global outsourcing, and economic inequality and seeks to redress those wrongs through government tinkering. Believing in the authority of experts, they want to hand the economy over to these experts in order to fix the problems. Putting the economy under the direction of experts who have the best interests of \\"society\\" in mind is... fascism.Progressivism values unity (conformity) over debate, because REASON IS A TOOL OF OPPRESSION. Have you ever heard that? Who said it, and what were they wanting to accomplish? It is a fascist argument.By page 120, the book had (using REASON -- beware! You might become oppressed) made a tight case that Progressivism is fascism and fascism is from the left.Finally, after we work through 350 pages of history, some classic Jonah starts to emerge. Now we get the crackle of a finger well-pointed. His chapters on the Clintons have lots of tweaks and chuckles. I thought the last section on the dangers to libertarian-style conservatism was excellent. Modern republicans are just democrats -- albeit with *slightly* better reason and accountability. Increasingly, the goals of both parties are the same: to make Americans comfortable and mitigate life's pain. Not the government's job! The government's job is to get out of the way so people can be free.The book is well worth the price. I learned a ton and thought through the arguments in new ways. While I wanted more sizzle, I got an excellent steak. Excellent.Finally, there is joy in reading a book well-written and rational. Disagree with the arguments and debate them using logic if you will, but if you must stoop to calling names to discredit the argument, you lose."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Of all the books I've read since I've been writing reviews and reading others on Amazon, this book has had the most profound effect upon my thinking and my political affiliations.THIS BOOK SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR EVERY SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL'S (PUBLIC AND PRIVATE) AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS IN THE USA.I mean every single word I say here.I love writers who make me think, love when I can tell they've done much soul searching and thinking themselves. Doesn't surprise me at all that he's a jew. I wouldn't have touched this book ten years ago knowing that he writes articles regularly for the National Review, a decidedly rightist publication. Very early on in this book, he made me think of two words very carefully: N A T I O N A L S O C I A L I S M.\\"N A T I O N A L S O C I A L I S M\\"-What does it mean? Does it conjure anything resembling the republican ideals espoused by people like Alexander Hamilton??? Absolutely, absolutely not.The symbol most associated with fascism is that of the bundle of sticks tied so closely that there is no space between them. An axe head is attached to the bundle, conjuring up utility, work, but also a threat. I have so many pages bookmarked in this book. I've been trying to find one I remember reading, but can't, where he talks of democratic ideals and if you wouldn't go along with the program, well-get out of the way. (You will never be fooled again after reading this book). Goldberg provides evidence that this last century began upon nationalistic, populist, fascist foundations most evident within democratic ranks as early as WOODROW WILSON! Yes, it is really shocking what you'll find here within. I have a more realistic appraisal of FDR now. You can tell when you've read a book that is well researched and carefully reasoned. It very definitely is thought provoking.My book is a library book, overdue, and would love to have it on hand at all times. Would love a subscription to National Review. Needless to say, a deep and long lasting impression, this book has made upon me. It's time the American Heritage dictionary rewrote their definition of fascism. Goldberg effectively argues that the public's perception of fascism being a right wing phenomenon stems more from the extreme far left's, i.e. communism's, categorization of it. Fascism's association with the military and business and therefore the American Republican party is misguided. That the American left, most evident today in the far left Democratic party, has far more in common with Mussolini's not so racist brand of fascism will become abundantly clear upon reading this book.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK BE READ.

I find Goldberg's sourcing to be abundant and his argument to be cogent. He effectively wends through history while staying on message--that there is a dominant system of political thought today that promotes and perpetuates the institutionalization of state dominance over the organic communities of family and Church. Without getting preachy, Goldberg presents a case that is at the same time humorous and maddening in its meaning for American and European society.

The author takes us through European and American political history of the past century, defining exactly what fascism is and who the fascists were and are. Carefully dissecting their government programs and policies, speeches, writings, political behavior and propaganda found in the annals of history, the author teaches us the true meaning of fascism and how to spot it when we see, hear, and read it. Liberals fancy themselves as the intellectual elite of the world and in their ignorance have been fond of throwing the label \\"fascist\\" at anyone who dares disagree with them. Now the fasce badge of honor is pinned squarely on their brown shirts and on the brown shirts of all their dead political heros (Woodrow Wilson and FDR, to name but two) and they're none too happy about this!

If you have ever seen or heard him on TV, he spews more hate language in 5 minutes than any normal person can handle. Though he takes a more calm approach in his writings, it makes you wonder about his motives as a \\"scholarly\\" author. He seems more interested in discrediting lauded liberal Presidents than in exposing true research of the facts. What is even more interesting is that he presupposes that Fascism is a negative term, or why would he be trying to get it off Conservative backs and hang it on their critics? Of course, all politically sane and well-informed and cogent people know that Fascism IS a negative philosophy, but why is HE so obsessed with not being called one? This flaw in his logic compromises this work which is based on a false premise and follows it all the way to its erroneous, defamatory, and just plain false conclusion: that the 'real' Fascists are the liberals. Jonah wastes a lot of ink contradicting himself. Save your money and do your own research."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"There can be no doubt that Mr. Goldberg provides ample evidence to back up his central theme: that is, that liberalism shares more in common with the basic tenants fascism than does what we call, today, conservatism. In the broader sense, this is nothing new, especially to anyone who has ever read F. A. Hayek's \\"The Road to Serfdom.\\" However, Mr. Goldberg does provide an excellent example of how one builds such a case today. Coming from an attorney, this means providing very solid examples and building very strong associations that can reasonably be drawn from the existing evidence.Of course, we must also understand that, in this arena, we must always concede that there is going to be a certain amount of interpretation. Not that I disagree with Mr. Goldberg on this account. Far from it! Also, as an econ/history double major in undergrad, I find his overall analysis very strong.But, in the end, Mr. Goldberg fails in his \\"alternative\\" to fascism. And this only occurs in about 1% of the book. He rails against fascism, and does an amazing job properly qualifying the fascism that he is railing against, and then, in the end, relies on the same \\"evil association we all have with fascism\\" (I'm NOT quoting him here) that he uses to deflect the (truly) mindless use of the term fascism that the left engages in. In short, he (very correctly) dissects the use of the term fascism by the left, and (accurately) diagnoses said use as a symptom of \\"it's bad, therefore, we'll throw it at those we dislike,\\" and, then, ironically, basically does the same thing.I say this because the only alternative Mr. Goldberg ever provides us for fascism is \\"Enlightenment principles.\\" This alternative is provided to us as if that is anything other than his own, narcissistic, egocentric choice of \\"truth.\\" I purposefully say \\"truth,\\" because he cannot, in such a choice, say \\"Truth.\\" He cannot appeal to big-T \\"Truth\\" if all he can say is that the opposite of fascism is \\"reason\\" or \\"logic,\\" as if those were ends in and of themselves. Clearly, they are only methodologies or tools. Depending on your starting presumptions, you can \\"reason\\" or \\"logic,\\" so to speak, your way to any ending. If you start out with the assumption that certain races are inferior, you can logically conclude that the elimination of those races is in our best interest.In the end, then, all Mr. Goldberg can offer us is a critique and a very pathetic alternative. Though his historical chronicling of the trajectory of liberalism and its association/origin with fascism is wonderful and very useful, the book's value as any sort of true insight into, again, big-T \\"Truth,\\" is minimal. He offers nothing as an alternative. In other words, he complains but offers no answers.I get the feeling that his greatest problem is in addressing the fact that the starting presumptions of said \\"Enlightenment principles\\" are very Christian in origin. I know it is very politically correct to say \\"Judeo-Christian\\" these days, but, culturally, there can be little doubt that, outside of the obvious connection Christianity has with the Old Testament, Jewish culture has little, if anything, to do with \\"Enlightenment principles.\\" Or, in any event, any more (and probably a great deal less) than Plato does. Thus, Mr. Goldberg avoids acknowledging the bigger problem - what do \\"Enlightenment principles\\" mean if you don't believe in absolutes, anyway?First, I must say this: I greatly admire much of Mr. Goldberg's work. Always have. However, I cannot escape the feeling that he is, at heart, something of a secularist, anti-Christian. Reading his last chapter, or the afterward, as it is labeled, I don't necessarily disagree with him on a good many points. But there is definitely a feeling of anti-Christian sentiment. True, I have no doubt that it is very much anti-Protestant/\\"Fundie\\" in origin, but I would think that Mr. Goldberg would be much more accurate (especially given the specificity of the rest of the book) in his inclinations. I can even see why he would take such a position (as an ex-Proddy, I can truly understand this position).But one cannot escape the necessarily egocentric (and I don't mean egocentric as in \\"you're a jerk,\\" but as in \\"seeing everything from yourself, outward\\") position that Mr. Goldberg is forced to take as an alternative.As my own alternative, I would suggest the following: do an internet search for \\"Nihilism\\" by the late Father Seraphim Rose. It's free online, though I'd suggest buying the book. Written as one chapter of a larger book in the early 60's, the man would become Father Seraphim wrote very much the same thing as Mr. Goldberg, but in 50 pages, or so, and much more consistent, internally. That is, though you, dear reader, may disagree with the idea of original Christianity (Orthodoxy), if one assumes that position, the idea of an absolute versus \\"revolution,\\" as Father Seraphim Rose calls it, allows us a consistent view that does not, in the end, come down to \\"well, you're wrong, because *everyone knows* it's not *logical* to think *that* way.\\" Which, in the end, is, basically, where Mr. Goldberg goes wrong.I do recommend the book, but I'd recommend Father Seraphim Rose as the first read and, with that framework in mind, *then* one should read \\"Liberal Fascism.\\"And as far as . . . well, ALL of the \\"one-star\\" ratings - I don't think it's too much of a stretch to conclude that NONE of them have actually read the book. To say that they don't respond with anything approaching an intelligent (or specific) response is giving them, as it is, too much credit."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"\\"Liberal Fascism\\" is an example of a genre of right-wing tracts, in which the author takes a radical or absurd idea, assembles a bunch of factoids that seem to support it, and sees how far he/she can go with it. The tone of this one is more intellectual and less vicious than certain others (Coulter, Hannity, Limbaugh, et al.), but the formula is the same. \\"Liberal fascism\\" is, of course, an oxymoron; fascism is by definition illiberal or anti-liberal. Fascism is generally characterized by authoritarianism, dictatorial one-party rule, suppression of dissent, extreme nationalism, racism, militarism, aggressive foreign policy, and central economic control (but private capital). Liberalism is generally characterized by democratic government, tolerance and acceptance of minorities, civil liberties, an orientation toward peace and international law, and moderate economic regulation by government. Liberalism is NOT socialism or communism. Goldberg never manages to precisely define what he means by either fascism or liberalism, which is one reason that the result is such a muddle.Goldberg's entire argument can be demolished in two words: Francisco Franco. If you do not understand why this refutation is so devastating, here is a nutshell sketch. In the early 1930s, a series of centrist to left-wing governments, generally known as the Republic, were elected in Spain. Franco was a general in the Spanish Army and led a military revolt against the Republic in 1936, eventually achieving victory in 1939. Franco ruled Spain as a repressive dictator until his death in 1975. Although he did not call himself a fascist, Franco was clearly ideologically, as well as politically and militarily, allied with Fascism and Nazism. Franco was supported by conservative sectors of Spanish society--e.g., landed aristocrats, industrial interests, the military, and the Church. He was opposed by \\"Republicans\\": liberals, labor interests, socialists, and communists. Hitler and Mussolini supported Franco, to the extent of sending tens of thousands of \\"volunteers\\" to fight, while liberals and leftists generally opposed him. Interestingly, socialists and Trotskyites were much more enthusiastic supporters of the Republic than was Stalin. Other than Germany and Italy, most western governments adopted a policy of neutrality. \\"International Brigades\\" of volunteers were formed to fight for the Republic and many foreign liberals and leftists, including Americans, gave their lives for the cause. The very title of Goldberg's sophomoric exercise is an insult to their memory.Here is what Goldberg has to say about Franco: he did not deport Spanish Jews the way Hitler wanted him to. That's it. Goldberg's mentor, William F. Buckley, was a big fan of Franco. It is impossible to believe that Goldberg did not notice this elephant in the room of his thesis. The fact that he has next to nothing to say about it is a tacit admission that he has no answer."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book is a major disappointment.

And here Goldberg is, throwing \\"fascist\\" back the other way.These liberal fascists, he says, are \\"friendly fascists\\", not evil, but still bad. To the liberals, he says, every aspect of life is politically significant. On this point, Goldberg notes similarities in ideology and policy between these \\"liberal fascists\\" and the old-time fascists. But so what? Fascism, as he's said, is hard to define, and is not inherently good or evil (and can in fact be used for good or evil), so who cares?Here's the list of fascists Goldberg discusses: Mussolini, Hitler, Woodrow Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Hillary Clinton. While he gives a lot of factual information, Goldberg tends to overstate and over-simplify things to make his points more dramatic, and so we get some bad propaganda, along with some smears. He makes some legitimate arguments having to do with how the extreme left is trying to take the morality out of issues, but ultimately he's so unabashedly biased as to be untrustworthy.All of this continues to beg the question, \\"so what?\\" The ultra-left liberals certainly do crazy things and make crazy allegations, but so do the ultra-right conservatives. Why do we need a 400 page rebuttal to a ridiculous, silly position? Goldberg realizes that \\"so what?\\" is a legitimate question, and he addresses it at the beginning and the end, but never does a convincing job, and ultimately the book devolves into a slam on current liberals (Hillary) and a Bush apology.

As with Adam Toozes book based on Hitlers later writings there were capitalists economic drive for control of world resources for world domination on the economic markets, that were really more at play. Thus the decision to invade Russia, the nation with wealthiest natural resouces to control. While liberal ideas and parties were shuffling and forming during those times strong world economic factors were, also. After all what is fascism but goverment ran by corporate dominated direct and indirect influences, as we see in the US. Party affiliations and social philosophies almost are secondary to supporting the economy of the corporaations or capitalism, which is what was the economies of those countries under democratic elections? Always follow the money first. As we see in the US now both parties continue to support world imperialism, to control the markets and energy control. Those with the money Rockefellers and Murdoch want control of Iraq and Iran oil. Now they turn to let the democrates finish, knowing the public will think a party change will stop the war in iraq, yet they also continue to pass bills to fund the war and military bases around the world for world domination. While the right started the agression the left may change tactics towards the end goal, yet still continue with the world control (New World Order) end game for the corporations and wall street. Both parties agree to work for world economic control, while differing on other social issues, (abortion, gay marriage, illegal immigrants and social programs), but the wall street objectives stay the same. They will use the distractions of those issues to divide and conquer towards putting in office those who can best distract these issues from falling on the evils of what the corporations and military industrial complex are doing. Then and now its about capitalisms domination and which countries will win even if it means losing democracy as we know it, fascist regimes historically hold elections too. Hitlers later writings of his objectives after Mien Kopff have shed differant light on what the war was really about. Consider the contrast of Adam Toozes book, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Nazi Economy\\" with this book. To me the end culprit is the greed of the finacial philosophy of capitalism and its real fear of Marxism. Hitler felt he could dominnate the US and Great Britton if he controlled Russia's natural resourses, which Germany was running short on. To sustain its then current and growing power, what and how they manipulated the political philososphys of the various liberal groups of the day; shows some roots not necessarily the true culprit that feed those roots for its own gain for growth and power."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The entire basis of this book is the common conflation of Nazism of all forms of state agency. The author dos not only misunderstand Progressivism, he misunderstands the entire political spectrum. Unfortunately, this stems from the fact that he knows absolutely nothing about history, even though his argument is historical! It used to be that conservatives accused liberals of being communists; an accusation that stemmed from the same misunderstanding of history that Goldberg's argument stems from. Any political ideology, with the exception of extreme libertarianism or anarchism, can somehow be connected to some thinker or some statement that supported either the fascists or the communists in the early 20th century.Its the same way people try to make a connection between evolutionary theory and eugenics. Some people, who by and large were not scientists, misappropriated the views of Darwin and applied them to human societies. Goldberg's argument follows the same line of reasoning - guilty by association. The same argument can be turned on conservatives - modern American conservatism has a very distinct connection to racist/segregationist policies in the American South. Trying to connect FDR ir Hillary Clinton to Hitler is a much further stretch of reasoning than drawing an ideological comparison between Ronald Regean and the KKK.By the way, this guy was embarassed on the Daily Show.

Fascism is not liberal or conservative - anyone convinced that any one ideology, whether it be political or religious, is the one and true can slip into fascistic thinking. Intolerance of opposing views exists in both the right and the left and that is the true seed of fascism. Bush declaring that if you aren't with us you're against us and saying that those that opposed the war in Iraq were traitors is at its core fascist thinking. The so-called Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act are the first steps into fascism.I laughed when I read the Nazi \\"liberal\\" policies. The first euthanasia victims of the Nazis were those in mental and long term health centers. Communists and other \\"intellectuals\\" were persecuted even before the Jews.

Liberals embrace change, new ideas and a more universal belief that the individual is more important than the state. How does this make Liberal/fascism interchangeable?But this book is well worth reading for Goldberg's own interpretation of fascism, liberalism and conservative and his view of world politics in the recent past.

Mr. Goldberg with LIBERAL FASCISM clearly intends to do both.It's easy to understand why some of Mr. Goldberg examples of \\"liberal fascism\\" may, at least on the surface, ring true. There are elements of mass politics on the left and the right that are similar: mass rallies, militarism, the marginalization and extermination of one's enemies.It may be helpful to review a definition of fascism offered by Robert O. Paxton in his insightful work, THE ANATOMY OF FACISM to identify the commonalities between mass politics across the political spectrum, and, at the same time, firmly place fascism on the right wing of that spectrum, where, despite Mr. Goldberg's best efforts, it decidedly belongs. Here's the definition:\\"Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.\\"I would suggest that Mr. Goldberg characterizations of FDR, the Clintons and other liberals as fascists fails to take into account the latter part of Paxton's definition. FDR, for instance, was despised by wealthy elites and often charged by them with being \\"a traitor to his class.\\" A descendant of New York's Patroons, he did not identify his interests with the elites of his time. Neither did FDR take power by employing \\"militant nationalists\\" -- he was elected to office three times by the American people. Nor did he pursue the New Deal \\"with redemptive violence.\\" It could be argued that by allowing Japanese-American citizens to be interned in concentration camps, he engaged in \\"internal cleansing without ethical or legal restraints;\\" however, it is something of a specious argument. The internment of Japanese-Americans was promoted by panicked nativists on both the right and the left.The Clinton's did have a fairly friendly relationship with some elites; after all, Bill Clinton took over George H.W. Bush's NAFTA project and managed to get it passed over the protestations of unions and working Americans, so could be guilty of \\"external expansion\\" on this score. His promotion of \\"globalization\\" -- which outside the US was seen as the promotion of \\"Americanization\\" -- could qualify him as an expansionist as well. President Clinton, however, did not engage in \\"redemptive violence\\" in the United States, and so on that score at least, does not fit the definition offered by Paxton.It is inevitable, I suppose, given the current political climate where intolerance and invective is big business, that Mr. Paxton's definition of fascism will be assailed as the work of a member of the \\"liberal professoriate\\" regardless of Mr. Paxton's political beliefs. In addition, the definition will no doubt be attacked as incomplete or malicious or tendentious.It is offered here as a counter to Mr. Goldberg's definition of fascism, a definition which he never states forthrightly, but relates only through the selective slander of the political enemies of the right and a willful misreading of history."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Yes, I have perused Jonah's wail.Bill Buckley's eternally rolling eyes would roll right outta his head if he could but read 20 wds. of this tragically stupid laughing-stock.

This is the same as saying that Freedom is Slavery, or that Ignorance is Strength.Goldberg also lied about his being a neo-liberal. He is absolutely a neo-conservative.The Right-wing-Lie which Goldberg and other conservatives spread, that Hitler was a Socialist or a Leftist is Orwellian doublethink. The truth is that Hitler believed that Socialism was a Right-wing ideology and that communist Jews had falsified Socialism into the opposite of Nationalism.Munich speech April 12th, 19221. 'NATIONAL' AND 'SOCIAL' ARE TWO IDENTICAL CONCEPTIONS. It was only the Jew who succeeded, through falsifying the social idea and turning it into Marxism, not only in divorcing the social idea from the national, but in actually representing them as utterly contradictory. That aim he has in fact achieved. At the founding of this Movement we formed the decision that we would give expression to this idea of ours of the identity of the two conceptions: despite all warnings, on the basis of what we had come to believe, on the basis of the sincerity of our will, we christened it ''National Socialist.' We said to ourselves that to be 'national' means above everything to act with a boundless and all-embracing love for the people and, if necessary, even to die for it. And similarly to be 'social' means so to build up the state and the community of the people that every individual acts in the interest of the community of the people and must be to such an extent convinced of the goodness, of the honorable straightforwardness of this community of the people as to be ready to die for it."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"A severe problem runs throughout the entire 496 pages of this book.Goldberg rests nearly his entire case against liberalism on an argument from analogy that leads him into ignoring all the dissimilarities in his case study of fascism( Nazism) and liberalism.Such a study requires a comparison - contrast approach .For example,Goldberg states in his book that he believes that he has uncovered heretofore unknown information about Nazi philosophy and practice concerning their advocacy of organic farming,animal rights,health foods,etc.Goldberg argues in his book that modern day liberalism also emphasizes the importance of organic farming,animal rights,and health foods.Goldberg reaches the inductive conclusion in his book that ,due to these similarities,it is highly probable that liberalism and fascism(Nazism )are very similar in their moral, political,social , and economic content.Goldberg does not stop here .The reader of this book will find additional \\"similarities\\" drawn between liberals and facists (Nazis) by Goldberg, such as Himmler's support for witches(liberal feminists also support witches).An entire chapter in this book is dedicated to \\"proving \\" that Hitler was a leftist.Goldberg states that liberalism and Fascism support minimum wage laws,heavy industrial regulation,and a progressive income tax.Therefore ,liberalism and Fascism are similar.This argument has the following form- fascism supports the use of street lights;Americans support the use of street lights;therefore,Americans are fascists .Unfortunately, Goldberg,in this book, ignores the hundreds of dissimilariies that exist between fascism( Nazism) and liberalism.Once the dissimilarities between liberalism and Nazism are carefully weighed against the similarities Goldberg's entire argument collapses because the dissimilarities far outweigh the similarities.It is essentially illogical to draw the conclusions that Goldberg draws in his book from the very strained comparison -contrasts he attempts to make.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Isn't it strange that today's American Neo-nazis are on the far right fringe?

Skip it."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"It is quite amazing that Jonah Goldberg can still be sought by some for his opinion considering the man backed some pretty disastrous neoliberal policies that are backfiring all over the world. Now Goldberg gives us \\"Liberal Fascism,\\" an interesting piece of propaganda where Goldberg tries to find a bizarre connection between Liberals, socialism and fascism. Apparently Mr. Goldberg has never read a history book or he would point out that Hitler called Communism a \\"Jewish conspiracy\\" and specifically cites Communism as a plague etc. that must be destroyed. Goldberg tries to label Mussolini as a socialist which is of course laughable considering Mussolini actively crushed socialist movements in Italy, even creating militias specifically designed for the deed. The irony is that Mussolini and Hitler would actually back Goldberg's economic plans. Mussolini himself described Fascism as the fusion between the corporate and the state and during Hitler's reign in Germany, business boomed with huge American companies such as IBM profiting from the rise of Nazism, not exactly the kinds of stories we hear out of Cuba, but whatever. Oh, but the Nazis believed in free healthcare, something apparently Goldberg believes is an original fascist concept, another laughable idea. \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is nothing more than a cheap shot at attempting to scare people into not voting Democrat this year, nothing more. Again, the irony here is that the only people who have ever backed Goldberg's economic ideas are hardcore fascists themselves such as Augusto Pinochet, Suharto, the Argentina junta of the 1970s, and yes, Mussolini. Of course there have been psychos on the Left, but for every socialist Joseph Stalin there's a conservative Francisco Franco. \\"Liberal Fascism,\\" a surprisingly short book, is also written in a very simplistic, dead prose that feels like a really bad, over-extended pamphlet out of an Orwell novel. The fact is Goldberg isn't even convinced himself about his ridiculous theories, instead the simple buried message of this book is: Vote Republican. And the truth is, the people who actually read this to be informed have already chosen that path."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"As an avid reader, I have seen weird titles of books before, but this one thus far is the icing on the cake!

But, when I do then a review will be submitted. Thanks."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I confess the title to my review is not original. It came from a doctoral candidate (Scott Eric Kaufman blogging at \\"Acephalous\\")whose academic focus includes the writings of Herbert Spencer. When he responded to Goldberg's public request for other people to do his research on Spencer for him, his expertise was dismissed out of hand because it didn't fit Goldberg's thesis.So we know going in that by his own admission, Goldberg couldn't be bothered to read the writings upon which he purports to base certain critical parts of his argument. Possibly he ended up with something from Custom Term Papers.At any rate, it explains a lot about this book when you understand it's the effort of someone working backwards from his own preconceived notions.How else to explain this laughable attempt to connect fascism to liberalism: \\"This is the monumental fact of the Nazi rise to power that has been slowly airbrushed from our collective memories: the Nazis campaigned as socialists ... .\\" ?This in support of his absurd thesis that \\"modern progressivism and classical fascism shared the same intellectual roots,\\" and thus \\"fascism, properly understood, is not a phenomenon of the right at all. Instead, it is, and always has been, a phenomenon of the left.\\"Any college student who has read even the basic background texts can point out the logical fallacy of these arguments and the sheer absurdity of his oversimplification of complex theory.Goldberg approaches history ahistorically and poltical theory by way of partisan hackery. In other words, he just makes stuff up.Serious historians and theorists will rightly laugh this buffoon off the stage (a stage his mommy put him on in the first place). However, the wingnut audience will love it, because it gives them a new catchphrase to mindlessly toss at those with whom they disagree...as evidenced by so many of those articulate five star reviews."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg is one of those right-wing writers who equates capitalism with lack of government involvement in business, and who consequently categorizes fascism as anti-capitalist (and therefore \\"liberal,\\") because every fascist regime--including Mussolini's Italy, Hitler's Germany, and Franco's Spain--threw heavy state resources into the marketplace. If \\"capitalism\\" just means \\"no government,\\" then Goldberg is right to think of fascism as anti-capitalist.Capitalism, however, is not the same thing as an absence of government from business. Capitalism is *private ownership of the means of production*. Capitalism is a system, in other words, characterized by private, non-democratic control over a society's land, labor, resources, and machinery. Since these things can be privately controlled while getting help from the government--e.g. subsidies and \\"bailouts\\"--it's actually possible to have capitalism *with* government involvement. Fascism is a version of this kind of capitalism: it begins as a violent, reactionary populism that blames organized labor for the decline of traditional values--such as the family, the church, and the nation--and it ends up as an anti-labor military state, which devotes its resources to maintaining profits for the private sector. Thus Gaetano Salvemini, a survivor of Italian Fascism, wrote, \\"In Fascist Italy the State pays for the blunders of private enterprise. As long as business was good, profit remained to private initiative. When the depression came, the Government added the loss to the tax-payer's burden. Profit is private and individual. Loss is public and social.\\" One of fascism's main features as a an economic system, then, is re-enforcement of profits at the public's expense.The three most famous regimes to be called \\"fascist,\\" however--including Mussolini's Italy, Hitler's Germany, and Franco's Spain--were not always up-front about their support of monopoly capitalism. As Goldberg points out, the earliest fascist propaganda includes anti-capitalist rhetoric in addition to social conservatism. Here Goldberg's use of history is selective, however, as any examination of the majority of fascist propaganda--especially later propaganda--will find a dearth of anti-capitalism. Instead of blaming social ills on systemic exploitation, as socialists would, the fascists blamed them on individual moral corruption. In particular, they blamed social ills on moral corruption that, on their view, came from foreigners and homosexuals, from unpatriotic citizens, and in particular from Marxists and anything having to do with organized labor. As scholars like Paxton and Griffin point out, it was sometimes necessary for fascists to blame capitalism to gain popular support; and the alliance between fascism and big business was easier in fascism's later stages than in its inception. Nonetheless, this alliance was effective even when it was uneasy, and the fascists invariably worked as hired muscle for big business. On the subject of capitalism, then, there is thus an important difference between the things that fascists occasionally said and the things that they actually did.To illustrate, note that the fascist Nazi party gave themselves a left-sounding name--to wit, \\"the national socialist German workers' party.\\" From their name, one would think they were socialists--i.e. part of the labor movement. However, facts were the exact opposite. Rather than supporting the labor movement like real socialists would, the Nazis broke up picket lines, murdered union leaders, banned worker newspapers, outlawed strikes, and sent the leaders of pro-labor organizations to death camps. The Nazis gave their organization a left-sounding name to garner popular support, and they appealed to imagery that appeared to praise the working class. Yet as soon as Hitler assumed power, he implemented \\"Operation Hummingbird,\\" in which all socialists in the Nazi party were executed. Likewise, Mussolini's Squadistri--the \\"Blackshirts\\"--were also hired by private businesses as strikebreakers, union-busters, and as a \\"front against Bolshevism.\\" Under Mussolini, hundreds of socialists and communists were murdered, and the peasant workers' movement was demolished by the corporately-funded Fascist squads. And no, the fascists were not \\"competing with their fellow leftists for power,\\" as Goldberg intimates. The fascists and the socialists were not like the Bloods and the Crips; their violent opposition was ideologically-driven, specifically in that the fascists were anti-Marxist and against organized labor, while the socialists were Marxists fighting on the labor movement's behalf. Far from being socialists, the fascists were vehemently opposed to socialism and everything that socialists stood for. Like Hitler, Mussolini crushed his country's labor movement as soon as he assumed power.All this is confirmed by the economics of fascist regimes. During the 1930s, Italy, Germany, and Spain were strangled with public recession, wage cuts, the banning of strikes, the overturn of workplace safety laws, and the private appropriation of both public property and public industries. At the same time, profits for big corporations like I.G. Farben and the Federazione Industriale were never higher. The fascism of Italy and Germany showered the weapons industries with state money, and stimulated war profits by waging imperialism abroad, as Mussolini did in Ethiopia and Hitler did in eastern Europe. Hitler and Mussolini both eliminated the inheritance tax, cut taxes for the rich, deregulated business, gave public property and public works to private companies, and increased taxes for the poor. (In Italy, child labor was reintroduced as well!) A fascist regime, summarily, is a conservative, pro-business, *capitalist military state*, in which the state's suppression of organized labor is purportedly justified by appeals to tradition, heritage, patriotism, the family, and other conservative social norms. Fascism is right-wing in its conservatism, right-wing in its alliance with the private sector, right-wing in its policies of imperialism and war, and right-wing in its violent opposition to Marxism and organized labor. Fascism is not socialism, nor is it a left-wing movement of ANY kind.Goldberg's study focuses on peripheral fluff while ignoring the economic facts. He mentions that Italy and Germany had public works, for instance, but fails to touch on their pro-profit character. He mentions that the Nazis employed environmentalist rhetoric and practiced vegetarianism, while ignoring the fact that huge funds were given to Germany's largest polluting corporations. We get no mention of the fascists' violent and ideologically-driven opposition to the labor movement, and no mention of their relationship with business--except with the demonstrably false claim that Mussolini somehow \\"oppressed\\" private industry when he gave it state support. We also get no study of the *actual* fascist groups that existed in America's history, nor those that exist today--with the appalling exception of a paragraph in which he says that the KKK's reputation for racism is exaggerated, and that they are effectively a harmless fanboy cult of the movie \\"Birth of a Nation.\\" (This claim, by the way, is a boon for *actual* Klansmen and fascists, who can now try to dodge their association with political villainy by citing Goldberg.) If Goldberg had bothered to research American fascism, he would have found corporate money from the Du Ponts and Mellons flowing through the Klan, the Black Legion, and the German American Bund. Yet instead, Goldberg gives us a highly selective focus on irrelevancies--such as the fact that the Nazis had a non-smoking campaign--with no detailed focus on socio-economic history. Goldberg, like the fascists themselves, chooses to focus on what the fascists said rather than on what they did, and treats their propaganda as accurate rather than looking at the facts.Goldberg's book is not an academic study. It has footnotes, all right--except when they're needed to substantiate his preposterous thesis--but its intent is not to contribute to the academic study of fascism, totalitarianism, or extremist politics. By his own admission, Goldberg's aim is not scholarly but political. His purpose is to smear contemporary US liberals--specifically, the supporters of public health care--with the *label* of being fascist, regardless of the evidence for doing so. In the end, Goldberg's book is mere propaganda. While contributing nothing to the study of fascism, it is a significant contribution to actual fascist movements in the US today, such as the Minute Men, the Klan, and the Dominionists, who can now try to dodge their association with fascism by citing Goldberg and fallaciously smearing their leftist opponents with the label \\"fascist\\" instead."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"What's simply amazing and precious about this book is that it uncovers historical record and reports it to us through the words and deeds of the people who helped shape the world we know today. Yes, Mr. Goldberg's POV is right of center. But if we strip out his opinions and conclusions we are left with artifacts from the past that are indisputable.Unfortunately, most of the negative reviews here involve name calling rather than rebuttal. I urge you to read the work for yourself and decide how it pertains to your everyday life.We must face the fact that those who are the establishment (civil service, gov't administration, education, the press, and academia) influence greatly the context and tone of information. Prior to the turn of the 20th century this was basically conservative. Since then it has shifted back and forth over the last century. Much of what we know today has been framed by our severest challenges: WWII and the Great Depression. During this time the country was under the influence of the liberal establishment. We live with the interpretation of history that was sifted during that time.Is there anything wrong with going back and looking at the original words and actions of people who made history? In fact historians are duty bound to make sure the history we believe in matches the actual past.This book allows us a glimpse into events that actually occurred. They are documented and confirmed. The question is are we open to hear them or simply intolerant?Decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Everything went very well.

I would broadly define \\"left-wing\\" as statist, collectivist, egalitarian (within a defined group, be it based on class, race, or nationality), enamored of the Romantic spiritualization of the political, and hostile to tradition, religious orthodoxy, natural rights, and Lockean individualism. I would define \\"right-wing,\\" particularly within the Anglo-American tradition, as pro-market, favoring limited government, respectful of religion and tradition, and protective of the individual and his rights. By any remotely similar definition, fascism belongs on the left -- and, to date, not a single critic of the book has even come close to rebutting this basic point.\\"I have long believed that there is a political dichotomy between what I would called the centralizers versus the decentralizers. Centralizers believe in an all powerful state and are highly skeptical of individual freedoms, in other words power flows from the top down. Examples of this philosophy are absolute monarchy and confessional states, communism, fascism, progressivism, and contemporary liberalism. Decentralizers believe power should be concentrated mostly in the individual, less so in regional government, and least of all in a federal government, in other words, power flows from the bottom up. Examples of this philosophy are the Hebrews as prescribed by Moses in the Old Testament, The Anglo Saxon society under Hengist and Horsa, the system of government as designed by the Founding Fathers, classical liberalism as defined in the Scottish and French Enlightenments, the Chicago School and Austrian School of Economics, and contemporary conservatism/libertarianism. (As an aside, an excellent book for further study on this matter is \\"The 5000 Year Leap\\" but I digress...)To my way of thinking, the Nazis clearly belong to what I call the centralizers, and are thus in the same category as the Soviet Communists. Yet we are taught to believe that somehow Naziism and Communism are polar opposites. This never made any sense to me. Nor could I explain how it was that two ideologies that are so similar in application came to be widely regarded as opposites. \\"Liberal Fascism\\" explains the history of how this came to be. It explains the history of Mussolini, Hitler, the French Revolution, Herbert Croly, Woodrow Wilson, FDR, and connects to the New Left in the 1960's and contemporary liberalism with Hillary Clinton's \\"It Takes A Village\\" and Obama's \\"Hope and Change.\\" Certain aspects of classical fascism (i.e. eugenics, imperialism) have become deeply unfashionable, but the basic impulse to centralize power and dictate via philosopher kings remains intact.If there are any flaws to this book, I can think of two: the first is the cover of the book. While the smiley face with the Hitler moustache is a very humorous depiction of modern day happy, smiley-face, mommy-state fascism - such as currently exists on both sides of the Atlantic - that whimsical image may actually serve to improperly represent this very scholarly rectification of 20th Century political history.My second criticism is that the book barely touches upon the similarities between Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in terms of their political philosophy (both were what I call centralizers, as compared to Calvin Coolidge, a true decentralizer and a highly underrated president). This gets to the heart of another series of interconnected myths with respect to the Great Depression. The standard Arthur Schlesinger Jr./William Leuchtenburg narrative is roughly this: The 1929 stock market crash represented the failure of laissez-faire capitalism and was a necessary corrective to a decade of decadence. Herbert Hoover exacerbated the crisis, allowing the depression to degenerate into a full-blown depression by sitting on his hands and fiddling while the economy burned. Enter FDR. Dear Leader, I mean FDR's New Deal got us through the Depression, which ended with the US's entry into WWII. The truth is the stock market crash was a standard market correction (it had been 8 years since the previous recession - the average bull market lasts 7 years so a recession was due). The depression was caused by a combination of an international sovereign debt crisis which was the after effect of the war debts of WWI, flawed federal reserve policies (which popped a housing bubble and caused the stock market crash in 1929), and a series of disastrous economic interventions including agricultural subsidies, restricitons on immigration, the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act, the Davis Bacon Act, Make-Work programs, and the largest peacetime tax increase in US history. FDR's New Deal doubled down on Hoover's policies, as members of his Brains Trust would later attest. Liberal Fascism goes into great detail here, as does \\"The Forgotten Man\\" by Amity Schlaes and \\"New Deal or Raw Deal\\" by Burton Folsom Jr. Finally, the Great Depression does not end until after the end of WWII as economist Robert Higgs has demonstrated. I realize I've gone on a bit of a tangent, but the myths surrounding the Great Deprression are as pervasive and plaguing as the myths surrounding fascism. A rectification is necessary.Bottom line: This is a solid scholarly book and ought to be required reading in every high school history class. Buy this book if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"As a 17 year old high schooler, what I traditionally viewed as fascism was an image of \\"In Soviet Russia...!\\" or scenes of \\"The Enclave\\" from Fallout 3.In fact, fascism is not so much a tyrannical militarized state of n Orwellian Dystopia, it is a sly, corruptive force.Fascism is the older brother bending the rules of a board game with his younger siblings, ensuring them his new rules will \\"help\\" them when all it does is ensure his victory at a board game. Fascism is the awkward means of pulling the wool out from under our noses by calling everyone that opposes the crime a fascist.Fascism is the essence of forcing a contradiction down our throats, all while telling us its for the \\"good of the people\\", while calling all who have the right to oppose it fascist. The creation of a common enemy to rally the people and ensure their loyalty.In the dogmatic, political, neo-religion that is fascism, the people are pawns bloated on entitlement tricked into believing they are rising in unity and comraderie, only to be taken advantage of by the government. It is secret serfdom, armed via propaganda. It is the appearance of liberty and individual rights, while in reality the said rights only force people to be subjective to the government.Much like big brother taking advantage of younger brother. Bend the rules to make little brother think he has an advantage, all while you pass continuous rules which force him to make you the victor.After reading this book I had many questions.I understand it is a very right wing work of literature, naturally I believed there would be bias. However, there is very little. I have investigated most of Mr. Goldberg's sources, all of which are referenced correctly and summarized correctly in the novel. Likewise, Goldberg does a fabulous job at linking the parallels between the social political policies of the Nazi Party, and those of Obama's.Did you know the American Progressive movement started the Eugenics program and also supported it 100%? Did you know Hitler took what the American political leftists did with that program and implemented it himself? Did you know this later created the Final Solution to the Jewish Problem (i.e. the mass genocide of Jews and minorities)?I also read many reviews that held a stance against this book.In all honesty, many scholars created some very interesting points about the book.The humorous thing is, these \\"scholars\\" will take a passage, summarize it, explain Goldberg's view, and then talk about other related facts that \\"prove\\" Goldberg wrong.However, if they READ the book, Goldberg always includes the facts said scholars said were *always* missing.Ironically, the only reviews that denounce Goldberg's work are ones who conveniently leave out parts of the book to skew its appearance (the exact same type of liberal propaganda Goldberg warned about) or they judge the book by its cover as automatically \\"fascist\\" (the irony of that is so increadibly funny you would have to be a liberal or stupid to not see it).All the negative reviews perfectly fit Goldberg's model of a fascist, or follower of a fascist ideal.Try it. Pick up the book, give it a chance, observe what Goldberg says, then observe the attitudes of the critics.Everyone fits his model of fascism, most of which are liberals or are NOT conservatives.Its the same principle as trajectory physics. The most a human can ever stay in the air when jumping under his or her own power is 1 second.Go try it with anyone. They will always remain in the air 1 second when jumping.The same applies here. Every negative critic of Goldberg's work perfectly fits the model of a fascist as they critique his work under the mindset of one.Dont believe me? Go and see.You will be amazed at what is really going on."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book is a great book that documents the factual history of fascism, socialism and the progressive movement.

As a lay reader I needed to put the book aside every so often to simply process what Goldberg was saying to me, but it's a testament to his literary prowess that he was able to get through to me.While it is, as I said, approachable, I don't consider it a light beach read.

To me they both seemed the same.Goldberg expounds on this observation and writes a comprehensive history of why fascism is in fact a left-wing, modern day liberal philosophy, and not right-wing or conversative. While some of his arguments, such as those attacking the film Dead Poets Society, are a bit stretched, it is definitely worth reading, and thinking about."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Excellent book that tells of a history of America I rarely heard about. President's Wilson's tyranny was one of those things. The book is worth buying just to read about that. But there is much much more where the author shows the connections between Mussolini's ideas and FDR's New Deal to Hitler's National Socialism. It is truly and eye opener for anyone interested in this country's history. I've read the paperback edition which gave me access to an Afterword not available in the hardcover edition. There President Obama's all powerful state as quasi-religion is pointed out in detail using the President's own words.The only thing that bothers me is the author's tone of sad inevitablity that the freedom that is important to most Americans {as in freedom from government) may fade until it is one day gone. To be fair Mr. Goldberg addresses this very issue at the end of the chapters and makes a brief counter argument that this isn't so. But for me his very anticipation of my conclusion belies his denial that the American government won't become, or at best is now on the verge of becoming a smiling fascist one."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Essentially, the thesis of this noble book is that the American Liberalism has more in common with Fascism than the right does. It's all good. I liked how he approached the term Fascism. Even though there were several issues that disappointed me, I am still willing to look positively at this work because it is shattering the leftists' myth that Fascism is a right wing idea. Here are a few questions I have for the author and other reviewers.1- Goldberg talks about how Fascism is rooted in the French revolution of late 18th century but he fails to provide the slightest background for the French revolution. I am not saying that this should have been the purpose of that chapter but he could give the readers a short background into why French revolution was a tide of anti-Christianity terror. So he fails at that. 2- On page 8, 9 of the introduction he constantly mentions that Fascism won't happen in America but pages later he says it can happen here or it has happened here. I mean, if the author believes (as he provides it in detail in chapter 3) that Fascism has happened in the US once, why should we not believe that it can happen again. So I wonder if the author is aware of contradicting himself several times from introduction to the end of chapter 3. These contradictions disappointed me and made the rest of reading more sluggish and less enjoyable. 3- Jonah Goldberg is shy of providing context to the events of 1920s and 1930s. He also fails to provide us with the events that took place under Republican presidents in 1920s.But the most positive and bright aspect of this book is that it raises the level of discussion/debate around the word FASCISM. It gives it an intellectual cover and no one can easily name others fascist. In that, this book does a good job in laying out the relations between the Liberals and Fascism. It deserves to be read and discussed and I am glad I got to read it."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Alot of history here... and alot we can learn from history.

He's a combination of funny and smart that's hard to find on the right. O'Rourke and Goldberg are all we've got. Some have praised the near absence of humor in the book. I miss it. There's nothing that keeps my interest in a long political tome (500 pages) than Jonah's flavor of wry humor. There is the occasional chuckle but I miss the G-file. Jonah has changed over the years. People who take themselves too seriously make me uneasy. Read Atlas Shrugged and see what I mean. I'd hate to see him go down that path.That said, since everyone else has concentrated on the arguments within the book I'll instead address the criticisms of the book like Manns so you'll know what's NOT in the book. Mann and company note that conservatives of old supported statist solutions, so they fit Goldbergs definition of fascistic better than liberals, ergo it must still be true today. Aside from the glaring logical error, what most liberal critics conveniently forget is that the meaning of conservative and liberal have swapped places over the last century. Dig up a copy of The Nation from the turn of the century and compare it to todays. Jonah is not the first on the right to point this out but at least the point is getting more voice given the popularity of the book.The other critical nitnoid is the argument that liberals today are not violent as Goldberg claims, so they can't be called fascist. Excuse me.. but what happens if I refuse to pay into Social Security, Medicare, or the impending HillaryCare programs? People with guns will break into my home, drag me away in irons (or at least stainless steel,) lock me in a cage, and take my stuff. Most would call that violence, liberals call it Democracy in Action. I'm glad someone on the right finally called them on it.People forget that fascists had a domestic policy. They were hugely popular not because of promises of genocide and a 'lets take over the world' foreign policy, but of full employment, free healthcare, etc.Fascism is a loaded word that's largely lost its meaning over the years. Goldberg is the first writer with the nads to restore it."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"~Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning~ reveals the dirty little secret of the American Progressive movement. As Jonah Goldberg observes many Progressives from Woodrow Wilson to John Dewey to Franklin Roosevelt shared in the ideals of fascism, and borrowed exceedingly from this European-born authoritarian ideology. In _Leftism Revisited: From De Sade and Marx to Hitler and Pol Pot_, Erik Von Kuehnelt-Leddihin offered an analogous indictment of fascism and national socialism pointing at its sponsors' left-wing character. It has been through the work of postwar revisionists to re-interpret the political phenomenons of fascism and national-socialism and divorce it from its own avowal of Leftism and/or Socialism. In fairness, there were times when fascists identified themselves as being on the Right. The whole origins of the Left-Right dichotomy are ambiguous and trifling anyway. After the French Revolution, as revolutionary turmoil settled, the elements of the anti-monarchists, Jacobins and socialists lived on, and their political leaders congregated on the Left in the National Assembly, while the traditionalists, monarchists, and classical liberals congregated on the Right. By this custom, the NSDAP would be on the Left.Mussolini became the Prime Minister of Italy in 1922, an erstwhile socialist journalist. The son of a Marxist. He was named 'Benito' after a Mexican socialist revolutionary. He never lost his zeal for socialistic ideology, just doctrinaire Marxism and its cosmopolitan flavor. Many socialists perceived that the nation was the ideal vehicle for implementing socialism and rallying populist forces. The fusion of nationalism and socialism was almost innate. In fact, the American ambassador Richard Washburn Child, a Progressive himself, admired Mussolini so much that he asked Il Duce to write an autobiography. Mussolini acquiesced and Child later added a hagiographic introduction.Mussolini's ideology incorporated a left-wing brand of trade-union syndicalism emphasizing national economic planning and cooperation between labor and corporations. The so called Code Authorities of FDR's National Industrial Recovery Administration (NIRA) was a conscious attempt to follow Mussolini's corrupt scheme, and was wrought with all the inefficiencies of central planning and price-fixing as well. William Welk, in Foreign Affairs magazine, drew similar comparisons. Upon hearing of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, Benito Mussolini exclaimed, \\"Ecco un ditatore!\\" (\\"Behold a dictator!\\") Fortune Magazine declared: \\"The Corporate State is to Mussolini what the New Deal is to Roosevelt.\\"In Germany, the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) came to power echoing the ideological slogans and rhetoric of the Left. The Nazis were dyed-in-the-wool socialists. They favored universal health care, the confiscation of inherited wealth, speech codes at public universities, the closing of church schools in favor of state controlled public education. They legalized abortion and euthanasia, and implemented gun control. Notice any parallels with the American Left today? Hitler consciously used popular iconography and symbols of the Left. The red flag emblazoned with the white disc and swastika were a conscious attempt to appeal to the socialist Left political base. The NSDAP platform was in many ways analogous to the Communist Manifesto. In fact, the Nazis made it point to devour the radical Left opposition in the 1920s before attacking traditional conservatives and classical liberals in the 1930s. The Nazis in Goebbel's words represented the \\"authentic nationalism\\" of \\"the German Left,\\" as opposed to \\"bourgeoisie nationalism.\\" The Nazis were vehement anti-Monarchists, and detested conservative monarchial regimes. Hitler characterized his Nazi revolution, as \\"the exact counterpart of the French Revolution.\\" Goldberg captures this reality in his chapter entitled, 'Adolf Hitler: Man of the the Left.'Prior to World War II, American Progressive ideologues were singing the praise of fascism and the regime of Benito Mussolini. The stark parallels between Progressivism and Fascism were ominous enough: (1) both shared an enthusiasm for central planning, dirigisme, regimentation and managerial regimes; (2) both possessed fringes enamored with the ideas of eugenics and enthusiasts for abortion; (3) both favored redistributive fiscal and monetary policy guised behind populist banners; and (4) both favored national service and massive public works projects to effectuate full employment. Another researcher Wolfgang Schivelbusch has cast light on the parallels between the regimes of Hitler, Mussolini, and Franklin Roosevelt in his tome _Three New Deals: Reflections on Roosevelt's America, Mussolini's Italy, and Hitler's Germany, 1933-1939_. FDR's cousin Teddy Roosevelt even shared the militant racism of the fascists.Is this book an ad hominem? Perhaps. Taken to an extreme, it can be. The use of the term 'Liberal' to delineate the 'Progressives' is a misnomer, as both Progressivism and Fascism are illiberal. The classical liberalism of Adam Smith, Frederic Bastiat, and Ludwig von Mises had nothing to do with fascism whatsoever. After World War II, the Frankfurt School Marxists made it a point to delineate \\"capitalism\\" as \\"fascistic,\\" and in the United States we witnessed the absurdity of conservatives like Barry Goldwater getting scorned with the epithet \\"fascist.\\" So, is Jonah Goldberg just doing the same thing to the 'modern statist liberal?' Examining and profiling the interconnections between Fascism and Progressivism serves a purpose. The connections are far from tenuous. Indeed, the fact that a multitude of American Progressives were consciously emulating Mussolini says a lot about the Progressive movement's core ideology and its roots. To be sure, the Progressives made their divorce of avowed sympathy complete as World War II emerged. FDR developed an embarrassing adulation for Stalin and the Soviet system.In the end, the reader is reminded that \\"the quintessential liberal fascist isn't a SS storm trooper; it's a female second-grade school teacher with an education degree from Brown or Swarthmore.\\""},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Or in America's case perhaps I should say, 'the road to the Brave New World....'Jonah Goldberg's Liberal Fascism is an eye-opening, easy and entertaining read - an interesting and revealing survey of the past century's progressive political thinking, often turning widely held dogma on its head (namely that fascism is strictly a conservative 'right-wing' phenomena). It begins by focusing specifically on the rise of fascism at the beginning of the 20th century, in Europe and simultaneously in America, as a pragmatic \\"Third Way\\" to effectively apply Marxist/Socialistic principles in a more local context. And it concludes by showing how these same pragmatic intentions are continually shaping the America of today. Fascism hasn't gone away, or even gone fringe by any means, it has become mainstream!Fascism is a particularly hard term to define, since it is more an expedient approach to governing (rather than a specific set of ideas) that can be applied across a wide ideological spectrum. And especially after its identification with the terrors of Hitler's Germany it has come to be used more as a pejorative label for one's ideological enemies than an historically accurate term. But Goldberg clearly shows its affinity with left leaning ideology (even if it is usually an expression of the right edge of that left-wing), and is able to draw ever tightening concentric rings around it through historical examples, and so eventually define it clearly by both it's roots (French Revolution, and Marxist calls for classless societies devoted to social justice) and effects (the state centered union of all aspects of economic and social life) - in both the obviously thuggish (Mussolini and Hitler) and more friendly American (Woodrow Wilson, FDR, LBJ, and Bill and Hillary Clinton) varieties.It is this friendly, liberal (smiley-face) form that Goldberg is wishing to illuminate, because this is the form it has increasingly taken to adapt and spread (vs the more extreme and ugly Neo-Nazi strains). Today this pernicious (yet \\"nice\\") variety is embodied in every aspect of life - from the thought police of environmental fads and crisis's and public school curriculums to crony capitalistic board rooms and the relentless influence of lobbyists and media propagandists to fuse government, big business and social values in the form of the Modern State, subordinating the individual to the \\"greater (common) good.\\"If you doubt this is a valid concern, does this following quote sound ominously familiar?\\"The artificial is everywhere; everywhere food is adulterated, filled with ingredients that supposedly make it last longer, or look better or pass as 'enriched,' or whatever else the industry's admen want us to believe...We are in the hands of the food companies, whose economic clout and advertising make it possible for them to prescribe what we can and cannot eat...After the war we shall take energetic steps to prevent the ruin of our people by the food industry.\\" (Heinrich Himmler head of the SS in Nazi Germany, quoted on pg 301)And as Goldberg writes (in his discussion of Hillary Clinton's new-age fascist do-gooder agenda), \\"In short, collectivists of all stripes share the same totalitarian temptation to create a politics of meaning; what differs between them - and this is the most crucial difference of all - is how they act upon that temptation.\\" (pg. 327) \\"Hers is a Third Way approach that promises to be neither left nor right, but a synthesis of both, under which the state and big business will work hand in hand. It is a fundamentally religious vision hiding in the Trojan horse of social justice that seeks to imbue social policy with spiritual imperatives.\\" (pg. 330)This Brave New World mentality surely hasn't gotten any weaker or more timid in the past 5 years since this book was first published, and Goldberg's views obviously threaten and offend the biased preconceptions of people educated within and dependent upon such a thoroughly thought-policed system, but this is a good thing. For the rest of us they provide some refreshing (and timely) clarity, and that's even better."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I want all my tuition money back from college!

Goldberg's fundamental point is that socialists, fascists, communists and progressives all share common political goals. The primary commonality of these philosophies is state control over the individual. Goldberg then accurately traces the adoption of the \\"progressive\\" \\"liberal\\" agenda in America. Recall that Thomas Jefferson (a classic liberal) said; \\"That government which governs best, governs least.\\" Anyone who claims to be a liberal in current America but denies the fundamental truths in this book is either ignorant or plans on being one of the pigs on the \\"Animal Farm\\".

I have read it cover-to-cover, word-for-word. That seems to be an important point to make as many of the 'lesser' reviews in this blog are by people who proudly [and stupidly] claim they haven't read this book but are still 'qualified' to review it. Other reviews make it painfully obvious that the posters have read little if any of the book, though they are intent on 'faking' their review ... which is far less honest than those who admit 'not reading' !'Liberal Fascism' can become a serious academic work if all of Goldberg's referenced material proves to be accurate. There is some marked weakness in its bibliographic referencing that makes it a bit more difficult to trace sources. Perhaps Mr. Goldberg could rectify this problem with an on-line link to a more thorough bibliography. Certainly any future editions should contain references for all source material. Also, I wish Mr. Goldberg would have abandoned the Political Correctness routine that says you can't offend someone by writing the truth about their politics and philosophy. Mr. Goldberg apologizes too often for stating reality, as if he is worried that the truth might hurt too much ... or that some modern Liberal might accuse him of a 'hate crime' ! This is one of those subjects that requires you let the 'chips fall where they may'.I am confident from my own long obsession with pursuing an understanding of Socialism, Fascism, Nazism, Communism, and all the other 'ism' variants of Collectivism, that greater than 90% of Goldberg's material is indeed accurate. I am a physical chemist/chemical physicist by education and occupation. I have watched many years of government planning in science/engineering lead to corruption of projects [and even death] ... and still more years of crisis-management in corporations and academics as they waste time and money to the point of absurdity. I began 15 years ago a passionate quest to understand 'good' and 'evil', 'right' and 'wrong', 'just' and 'unjust'. The search led quickly [and ultimately] to philosophy ... over 2000 years of it recorded in books written by men [and women]. In that search I have read many dozens of texts on Socialism and its variants, most of those texts being very 'deep' and requiring many hours of reading and re-reading and introspection to assemble an accurate assessment of the author's thoughts and mindset. Few laymen would invest this amount of time or effort, as most people just don't have that amount of time available to them with today's 'busy schedules'.Jonah Goldberg's 'Liberal Fascism' is an excellent treatise of the concept of Fascism, making Fascism and its history accessible to understanding by the serious layman. He does perhaps 'bend' the concepts somewhat in his assessments of modern derivative political concepts ... but points out when key characteristics of the Fascist concept are present in those derivative systems. Ludwig von Mises himself had difficulty in defining explicitly what Socialism is when he first wrote 'Socialism' in 1922 as Fascism was just becoming known. Von Mises ultimately defined Socialism as any system of economic and political philosophy that advocates centralized planning of the economy. Fascism has always been vague in its core definition, even when first coined by Mussolini. But though Mussolini may have 'invented' the term, key elements contained in the concept, and recurring over-and-over through to present times, existed and were practiced by authoritarian governments and parties prior to Mussolini ever coming to power. Thus Hitler and Mussolini were able to express their gratitude and admiration of Woodrow Wilson's ideas and other American academicians ... and ultimately F.D. Roosevelt. That is precisely the history Goldberg is communicating within the body of his book. What the book 'should do' is inspire interested persons to dig deeper ... and force critics to justify their opposition with facts, not vitriolic invectives.The 'Ace' of economists, Noble Laureate Ludwig von Mises, wrote in his 1950 'Preface to the 2nd Edition' of his 1932 book 'Socialism --- an Economic and Sociological Analysis' regarding Communism and Socialism, \\"No longer should individuals by their buying or abstention from buying determine what is to be produced and in what quantity and quality. Henceforth the government's unique plan alone should settle all these matters. 'Paternal' care of the 'Welfare State' will reduce all people to the status of bonded workers bound to comply, without asking questions, with the orders issued by the planning authority. Neither is there any substantial difference between the intentions of the self-styled 'progressives' and those of the Italian Fascists and the German Nazis. The Fascists and the Nazis were no less eager to establish all-round regimentation of all economic activities than those governments and parties which flamboyantly advertise their anti-Fascist tenets.\\" von Mises was born and raised in Austria during the rise of Mussolini and Hitler. The above excerpt was written after he had migrated to America.I would also point out that last year on Tim Russert's 'Meet the Press', Mr. Russert asked Howard Dean, Chairman of the Democratic Party, if he was a Socialist. Mr. Dean was stunned at the question, but did answer that he is 'a Democratic Socialist'. Just last fall in one of the Democratic Presidential debates, Hillary Clinton was asked if she is a 'liberal' ... she responded that she is a 'proud modern Progressive'!! Jonah Goldberg's book is very relevant to contemporary political times!!I strongly recommend Jonah Goldberg's 'Liberal Fascism'. I also recommend the above book by von Mises ['Socialism'], along with Leonard Peikoff's \\"The Ominous Parallels: A Brilliant Study of America Today and the Ominous Parallels with the Chaos of Pre-Hitler Germany\\" [1982]. Additionally, a 1988 work by F.A. Hayek: \\"The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism\\" is a not-too-difficult yet significant treatise. It is always interesting to read the 'later' works of learned men to see how their views have solidified [or changed] later in their lives [Hayek died in 1992].Kudos to Mr. Goldberg !!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"If you are a thin skinned leftest you will hate this treatise.

I always laugh out loud at left wing losers who toss about the facist word like blacks toss around the racist word. Anyone with a working brain and an ounce of common sense can see that the people who use those words the most are in fact prime examples of the adjective they use. But when its turned around in their face and their actions exposed, it ticks them off to no end. As in any other endeavour when your fighting something or someone, you don't know your on the right track and winning unless your opponent gets PO'd. The parallels are there, they are real, and they are scary. Whats even more sad is the number of idiots who fall for the lies propagated by the left, and fall lockstep in line with them. Credit is due to these neo-communist socialists, they knew they could not beat us militarily, so they slowly and quietly infiltrated our schools, media, courts, and government and have been working their destructive deeds from within. If its not stopped, the US is doomed. If your a non-believer, but its simply because your not sure of the facts, I highly recommend this book, and hope that it will push you over onto the right side of the fence."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"WHILE EXTENSIVELY DOCUMENTED and, in fact, written with the modest and legitimate aim of giving liberals pause about the intellectual past of their politics, I venture that Mr. Goldberg suffers from a limited perspective.In brief, he is right about the kinship between Progressivism and Fascism. However, as a decent classical liberal, Goldberg does not hesitate to grant that many Progressive initiatives, and their Fascist counterparts, were legitimate; as he says many times, he does not accuse liberals of Fascism in its brutal, evil connotation, but merely notes the similarity of their policy programs. By this means, he admits that \\"Fascism\\", in essence, is hardly evil, and logically removes every reason for maintaining the term Fascist as an adjective for the repugnant to oneself.The astute reader will wonder why it has come about that, as Goldberg says, \\"We are all fascists now.\\" If his research is to be believed, and it is, since the early Twentieth Century, the constituency of Fascism has expanded to the extent that not only Communist zealots and Deep Ecologists, but Big Business and Republican \\"conpassionate conservatives\\", all public-spirited and idealistic in their own ways, are guilty of endorsing variations of what Goldberg claims to find a dubious ideology. Indeed, when discussing Fascist themes in popular films, Goldberg acknowledges their aesthetic appeal himself. Goldberg points out the resurgent interest in paganism shared by the National Socialists and New Agers, and makes this a mark of Fascism; yet he also notes the deep Christian faith of old school Progressives like Wilson, and implicates believers from Fr. Coughlin and Huey Long through Patrick Buchanan in Fascism; in the Afterword he even concedes the Left's contention that the aspirations of the Religious Right are essentially \\"Fascist\\"! The thoughtful observer may wonder if many men of deep religious conviction, whether Christian or pagan or even secular humanist, simply find the Liberal Order unacceptable, and either labor (as yet unsuccessfully) to replace it with a more communitarian society, whether founded on the politics of the Left or the (authentic) Right, or have worked to improve the system from within (though, I would comment, almost always to bad effect, because the would-be reformers, whether hailing from Right or Left, themselves generally retain the individualism and egalitarianism which created the Liberal Order itself, thereby tainting their hoped improvements).I remark that Goldberg cites G. K. Chesterton in his criticism of the eugenicist Progressive H. G. Wells, with nary a word against Chesterton. It is common knowledge that Chesterton, along with Hilaire Belloc and other devout Catholics, formulated Distributist economics, which has ever since been the scourge of those Austrian and Objectivist ideologues who comprise the last redoubt of unreconstructed capitalism in the West! Is it not remarkable that both Wells and Chesterton, two contrary men who certainly considered themselves intellectual foes, embrace some form of what Goldberg labels \\"Fascism\\"--the latter, whom he cites favorably, for essentially inventing a major school of the Third Way economics he despises!The phenomenon Goldberg classifies as Fascism is clearly a bit too big to identify with what most of his contemporaries see as a dead movement so hateful they can so namecall their bete noirs and it will sting. What he calls Fascism, then, is clearly a very wide range of movements and civic instincts aimed against capitalism and plutocracy, whether in part or in total, and their real or perceived effects."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Very informative book where the author even points out some of the liberalism of some who are on the right.

I thought this book was well written and does in fact expose the re-writing of history. These men were radicals and did embrace many of the same tired arguments of the left albeit not all of them (which Jonah many times points out).I would suggest buying the book, or borrowing it, and reading it.

He explains this and no one can deny it. Mussolini was loved, many loved him even after the war. One must consider Mussolini in his role BEFORE wars broke out. The same for Hitler. He too was widely praised during the peacetime years. Nationalism and Socialism together. What's wrong with that? Before you react, THINK about it. Socialism. And Nationalism.

Nothing!When you are dealing with a large nation like the USA (no longer a small group of allied states practicing laizzes faire), maybe you do need socialist reforms - and if the states unite, then nationalism is good.That's what Mr. Goldberg is explaining, clearly. He's pretty much showing anyone that reads it with reason that the word \\"fascism\\" was not originally an insult that you hurl at anyone whose views you don't like. It's a valid word and it defines a specific kind of government and system. It does NOT have to be racist either (Italy was not racist, but Italy was Fascist).

Usually, political books turn me off because the author will bust off the tracks and start giving diatribes defending his own viewpoints. The reason I liked this book was because of its thorough history of fascism during the reign of Mussolini and onward into WWII. I found this fascinating... and it has made me step back and want to know exactly what fascism is. The first time I ever heard the word \\"Fascism,\\" was in an old Sonic Youth song, \\"Youth Against Fascism.\\" And growing up, I sort of knew vaguely that fascism was behind WWII and it was a bad thing. But ask anyone to define it and no one knows what it is. This book helped me grapple with a more concrete understanding, first, of what fascism is and how it still resides today in modern politics despite claims people making about being 'progressive,' and 'compassionate.' I am turned off if a book leans too far left or right. This book, as you might guess from the cover, leans slightly right. But I don't feel they go too far. One thing I pulled from it was a deeper understanding of Mussolini and a better knowledge of what fascism is. I should mention I purchased the audio version and the narrator does a great job."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The book works well on two levels, as a history of late 19th and 20th century political thought, and helps to identify key elements in the development of Communism, Fascism and Liberalism and I was surprised to find that I had to agree that Fascism was firmly a movement of the left.The author arguments and well thought out and in the main he backs those arguments up with some insightful facts and examples. He does not equate progressive American politics with Fascism, in that liberals are fascist, but rather that many of their policy's spring from the same desire that the state should always intervene for the greater good.I did not agree with everything, in particular religion, nor did it change my views on many issues, but rather gave voice to my concerns on how politics is often conducted these days. For example the politics of climate change, I do believe that man is causing the climate to change, but at the same time I am appalled at how the debate has been closed down here in Europe, and that whole host of other organizations have attached their agendas to the issue, so nobody can debate both the extent of mankind's impact, or how best to deal with it.Anyway an interesting, enjoyable and thought provoking book does not deal in absolutes and all the better for that."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This was a very deep and historical book. There is a lot of stuff in here I didn't know. I didn't know that the lady that originally started the Family Planning organization did not believe in abortion at all but only believed in birth control. Hitler got many of his ideas from people right here in our country! The true goal of abortion is eugenics, which means to eliminate the unwanted people from earth to create a great race of people. Abortion was not originally created to help people. This is similar to what Hitler's people did. They killed all the old and handicapped people first because they were considered un-useful to society.

So why write another? Well, no good reason other than that this book needs to be read by everyone. The recent news of Randi Rhodes and her less than flattering characterization of Hillary forces my hand. The slashers and terrorists who inhabit Amazon and brutalize both books and reviews whose ideas they do not like have been hard at work; read the 1 star reviews for a good laugh. OK, you know they're not honest or informed. It is nearly impossible for me to imagine anyone who has actually read this book finding anything objectionable in it.As to Randi. One of the major objections to the idea that Communism and Fascism are very closely related cousins is that they have been mortal enemies across the globe. That is hardly convincing, but the left uses it as their trump card. (Ignoring how many good Communists Joe and Mao executed...) But listening to the absolute rage that the current Democratic primary engenders, rage that is not based on policy (as there is not 10 millimeters of difference between the two major candidates) but on personality, makes it all too clear how the left hates those not in perfect compliance. Whatever you can say about Hillary, she has been a loyal foot soldier for the left since the 70s. Yet now, a major personality (well, as major as No-Air-Left America can have) like Randi can be utterly disgusting and foul and humiliating toward a conscientiously leftist Presidential candidate, and get cheers! (And if there were no Obama in the race, would be, as the exact same candidate, the enthusiastic choice of Randi and the other Hillary bashers.) Any doubt she'd like to line Hill up next to Kamenev and Zinoviev?And Randi probably calls herself tolerant and me a Fascist! Well, Jonah Goldberg got tired of this kind of slander, and demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt that Fascism is a movement from the left, and many of today's leftists love Fascism. Their fantasy nice-nice Fascism is home to Puff the Magic Dragon, where, in that happy place, nice people play nice and stop bad people, who wear big black mustaches and capes, from doing bad things. Now sometimes those nice people have to play a teeny bit rough to get the hard-headed bad people to stop doing the bad things. But it's for the good of all, so it's OK.In this world, good intentions are the same thing as good results, and words count as deeds. Well lots of the left likes that place, because they are always correct there. In the real world, where people actually live and work and act, however, the dreadful and frightening consequences of bad thinking and bad policy are clearly visible. And the left is eager to shovel more of their control down our throats for our own good.I could write much more. But save your time instead and read this book!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Don't let the ridiculous Smiley-face Hitler moustache fool you.(Goldberg reportedly had nothing to do with that decision, it was a publisher's choice)To sum-up Goldberg's book, he first looks at what fascism really is, along with its origins. (Hint: there is not an accepted definition of fascism, even among historians..) He further illustrates that it has nothing to do with racism and anti-Semitism. (those factors were injected into Germany's own \\"brand\\" of fascism. Italy actually protected Jews, until Hitler invaded them in 1943, and fascist Spain refused to turn-over Jews when Hitler demanded they do so..) His greatest attention though is spent on establishing Fascism's bona-fides as one of the many variations of Socialism/Populism that were all the rage in Europe during the 1920's and '30's. For someone reasonably well-read on the history of the period, there is nothing particularly new or revealing in this book, but as with much other \\"commonly-accepted wisdom\\" of modern culture, most of what you hear or think you know of this topic is probably wrong, and this book does an authoritative job of correcting that."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Fascism was a specific political movement with very particular characteristics. The word \\"fascist\\" is and has been ignorantly thrown around a lot, especially by overheated leftist college students, but that's no reason to twist its meaning even further. Just because it's comforting for some segments of the conservative electorate to believe that modern American liberals are the heirs of Adolf Hitler doesn't make it correct.The biggest problem with the book is that Goldberg's definition of fascism is so broad to make it virtually useless. In his view, any kind of collective or government action is \\"fascist\\". He concentrates on Woodrow Wilson's activities during WW1 as an example, and brings FDR into the fascist fold, but based on the fuzzy set of criteria that Goldberg sets forth not only are Wilson and FDR \\"fascist\\", but Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan and Teddy Roosevelt could be also. In Mr. Goldberg's world, World War 2 was fought entirely by Fascists, Fascist Germans, Italians and Japanese, vs. Fascist Soviets allied with Fascist Americans. In short, it's premise is sloppy. Mr. Goldberg refuses compensate for historical context. Comparing 1930s political economy to that of today's is something that should be done very carefully. Capitalism was widely regarded as a failure in the 1930s, and virtually all industrial countries tinkered with it, including American conservatives (think Smoot-Hawley).And that is the biggest blind alley in this work. By concentrating on political economy Goldberg ignores the more important markers of Fascism. Fascists were notoriously uninterested in economics, and Fascist political economy, such as it was, was a pastiche of free market capitalism, corporatism and socialism, and in most countries where it was ascendant it lazily morphed into support for the status quo, i.e. protecting wealthy landowners and business owners. What made Fascism a distinctive political movement was not a centrally planned economy but militarism, racial chauvinism, and a sort of false, golden age, nostalgia for monarchism, Fascism's closest relative, which is why fascist movements, especially in southern Europe attracted monarchists into their ranks.Mr. Goldberg doesn't address these more cogent descriptors of fascism because it would contradict his thesis. Since most American liberals are less militaristic then his own conservative base, to highlight Fascism's militarism would destroy his argument. And by neglecting Fascism's kitcsh-laden obsession with the nuclear family, he avoids uncomfortable comparisons with American social conservatism. And by dismissing Fascism's anti-communism as mere factional competition, he ignores Fascism's most important base--lower middle class shop owners and artisans, terrified of losing their property in a Marxist revolution. Hitler did admire Stalin's totalitarianism, but he hated Marxism, which if Mr. Goldberg cracked open Mein Kampf, he would know.But I suspect Mr. Goldberg does know, which is why in the end his book is so dishonest. It is not an inquiry of history or politics, it's a partisan polemic, which is fine, but buyers should know that when they buy it."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg provides many interesting insights. I wish he had said more about the vicious and mad anti-smoker campaigns but what he says on that is on target as is most of what you'll find in this book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"A brilliant counter to the near uniformity of misinformation masquerading as 'history' taught in American public schools. A must read if you have managed to open your mind enough to question the complete silencing of any opposing views in higher academia, or if you truely wish to be and act open- minded. Warning, though- reading books like this may force you to examine other 'accepted' and 'consensus' views of the American establishment more than most find comfortable."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"A very bright light truth is.

I especially enjoy a book that can be honest about the modern liberal's birth from the Eugenics movement. Something liberals always try to distance themselves from, but is substantiated by volumes of history. It is substantiated today as a movement still at work...its just that the Eugenics movement of today has a compassionate veneer.Which leads to the matriarchal tendencies of American fascism. Goldberg states that if there is a fascist takeover of America, it would come via \\"lawyers and social workers saying \\"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\\" I think that may be why, personally, I have noticed so many women becoming involved in restoring the classic liberal vision of individuality, private property, free markets, etc. Perhaps, men suspect patriarchy, but it seems that women find discontent with matriarchy- a challenge from the State against their own role as Mother.Goldberg concludes that he has faith in the American people. That the American people will not take fascism sitting quietly. Yet, it seems the majority have taken it for over 100 years. From both mainstream, media-supplemented parties. Many of the choices facing us are fascism or fascism-lite. Ultimately, I think fascism is just a small fraction of the bigger picture. The broad view is the push to empower the State...Statism. Whether the vehicle is fascism, communism, socialism, or any other random\\"ism\\"- the Cult of the State will gain many devotees.I think this is a great book of warning, but it may be too late. Statism seems inevitable when its being advocated in one way or another by mainstream parties.

They were both trying to achieve the same goals by the same methods, You can take the latest debate about healthcare when People like Pelosi, and other \\"Liberal\\" or Progressive- Socalled Democrats hurl insults at Republicans and accuse. When In reality, it's more than an Republican matter, It's An American Matter, Americans don't want it. Yet as the Author noted, It's a Soft Tyranny/Fascism, the same one they criticize and loathe is what they practice.they want to impose, All in All. Fascism is The State,First and always in otherwords, no religion,no dissent, Cult of personality,etc. Does the Author say All Liberals are bad, of course not, And they are not, But today's Democrats are not Classical Liberals but Modern Liberals who share disturbing traits and tactics like the so-called Fascists."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The author has really done his homework and writes an interesting book.

Every American should read this book carefully."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The title alone makes the book, which catches an impulse in the contemporary liberal spirit which is often ignored. Liberalism has always meant something opposite to fascism, but as liberalism has hardened it has indeed taken on some of the temptations of the totalitarians of the 20th century. I have known many liberals who talk about killing their enemies. There is a strong puritanical streak in many liberal causes, curiously fought most strongly by Californians where cult enthusiasm often develops into fascism. All the famous cults have had this tendency. Liberalism has become a kind of cult. One often feels that the punishment for disagreeing with a liberal is exclusion and shunning. Liberals introduced the idea of laughing at all opponents. In my lifetime all Republicans have been dismissed as stupid which is the ultimate catch phrase used by liberals. Knocking cigarettes out of smokers mouths became big in southern California. Now the big thing is shouting opponents down, so that no opponents can be heard. Liberals know it all. This is key, running right back to the Bolsheviks. Mao practiced this sort of fascism; today it is found in all university classes, where one doesn't dare disagree with liberal dogma. Today self-appointed fascistic students sit in anthropology classes waiting to hear their professor say \\"primitive\\" or some other taboo word that violates the PC vocabulary banned list. Next thing, that Prof is being brought before some panel for disciplinary action - in a scene out of Mao 's cultural revolution. Only liberals could think of such tactics. The left set the tactics for the 20th century. They now are looking for a stage to play out their next move, which is to annihilate all their opponents."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Michael Mann's verbose and tediously sour-grape review is continuously off mark. Goldberg correctly examines American Progressivism and its historical parallels to Social Fascism, Nazism and Statism, but with an honest admission of his right (and intent) to correct the record after being continually called a fascist for nothing more than his Conservatism. Mann charges Goldberg with hurling the f-bomb repeatedly, yet the only time the f-word is used in the book is when quoting liberals. One can reasonably conclude Mann did not read the book by his insistence throughout his review that Goldberg uses the f-bomb on anyone.Liberal Fascism is a wonderfully researched book; thorough in its historical documentation.

Nazism is an abbreviation for Nazional Sozialismus, National Socialism. Utterly leftists ideology, which was replaced later by Internacionalism (code word for total control over the world).That's why Hitler was proclaiming proudly in 1933 that \\"... we are going to fullfill the dream of socialism started in 1917 in Russia.\\" That's why Hitler and Stalin were so close allies, literally ideological comrades, hence Hitler-Stalin pact and American communists and leftist openly supporting Hitler in 1930's. Only when Hitler realized that Stalin began seeing Hitler as a competitor for usurping total world power and was preparing to invade Germany, only then Hitler did not blink and attacked first. The reason why his troops got to Moscow so quickly - most of Soviet troops were concentrated along German borders, preparing for the attack on Germany.And where the perfection of concetration camps came from: Lenin and Stalin learned from Brits in South Africa and then perfected in infamous GULAG, Hitler went on to add German know-how, and Communists in eastern Europe built on Gestapo's experience far surpassing them in brutality and ability to cover up the evil deeds.Left = communism/socialism = fascism = nazism = totalitarianism.Thanks for this book!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Columnist Jonah Goldberg's \\"Liberal Fascism\\" (2007, 487-page hardback) is a hefty history of the \\"American left\\". Stretching from 18th century French revolutionaries into contemporary 21st century presidential politics this book tells the protracted rise of secular progressivism. Goldberg's is sometimes worrisome, scary, humorous, and hopeful. For Goldberg \\"fascism\\" is the totalitarian political religion determined to control through militarism and nationalism. He presents a similar definition for \\"progressivism\\".Goldberg's heavily documented analysis (with 51 pages of endnotes) speaks to the progressive liberalism of Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, FDR, JFK, LBJ, 1960s radicals, and many more. He believes progressives to be synonymous with fascists. \\"American Progressivism shares important roots with European fascism\\" (page 246). Goldberg documents correspondence between Mussolini and Wilson, Hitler and FDR, and communists in Roosevelt's administration. This history is startling!Most helpful are the book's history on Mussolini (chapter 1) and Hitler (chapter 2). Because these dictators continue to be lesser known, or taught, in contemporary America, Goldberg's warnings from these chapters are poignant. Fascinating, also, is FDR's pre World love for Soviet communism (chapter 4). The Appendix's \\"The Nazi Party Platform\\" is finally illuminating for his main point: Liberalism is fascist (page 2).Although Goldberg's narrative is interesting, even gripping, at points one wishes for brevity. (The sheer length of the book keeps it from earning the fifth star). Each of ten chapters' 40 page average allow for presentation redundancy. (We get it- it's not necessary to be so repetitious.)Author Goldberg's writing style is comfortable and informative.

It appears that Goldberg began with a premise - (How can I paint liberals in the most negative light possible) - and then shoe-horned historical facts into that premise, squeezing where necessary, and cutting out any historical inconsistencies. It is, basically, a political screed. A speech written for a Republican National Convention rather than for nonpartisan people who simply want to learn something.Goldberg equates \\"fascism\\" with \\"liberalism\\" only through the tried and true process of re-defining words wherever necessary, and by ignoring any evidence that does not fit into his radical premise. Specifically, Goldberg determines to define as \\"left\\" anything that assaults personal liberty. But that is NOT what the words mean, nor what they have ever meant.Furthermore, re-defining the word \\"leftist\\" to include ANY assault on personal liberty would leave us with quite a few bizarre results: Did you know that those who oppose Gay Marriage (for example) are LEFTISTS??? No? I didn't know that either. But this is an undeniable conclusion that stems out of Goldberg's preposterous theory.Unless you are a partisan rightie, I strongly suggest that you skip this book.

Both Mussolini and Hitler tried to control or end religious influence on society. The Right/GOP would have you believe the US Liberals ALSO want to destroy religion. The fact is, modern America is turning away from Religion. The Right/GOP fixation on religion is a value of the past and a marker of fascist fixation on tradition and old values. The Liberal view of religion is one of acceptance, but not as a formal core value. The most glaring problem with this analogy is that the Right/GOP only really values Christianity and to some degree Judaism, it is very fearful and unaccepting of other religions such as Islam.Overall Goldberg is trying to pull a rabbit out of his hat and instead has fallen into the age old fascist trick of trying to re write history to suit the party."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Three words for you knuckle-dragging right wingers out there - Pure Argumentative Fallacy.

I'm glad I didn't buy this book (got it from the library) so as to help support this guy who, I am sure, is making a mint off right-wing hysteria. I am so sorry that a major publisher would have anything to do with this venture - which obviously is just a money-maker for the author. Whatever sells, right?"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"My title should explain it all.

And thats because it's true home is in the close neighborhood of his own neocon ideology.If there was a thread of interesting conjecture, I'd pass on criticism. But I only see a polemical tract dressed up like a small college term paper."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"America was once under the rule of a more or less fascist dictator. He locked up thousands of political prisoners during the war, created a propaganda agency, sent out thugs to beat people up in the streets, and more. Surely I must be talking about the Bush/Cheney dynasty? Nope. I'm actually talking about President Woodrow Wilson.Liberal Fascism is difficult to put down not only because you'll learn things you never knew about, but you will probably be chilled and horrified by what you learn about. I know I certainly was. Did you know that many of FDR's closest advisers and aides spoke gushingly of Hitler's and Russia's \\"experiments\\"? Did you know how adored Mussolini was by people in the American press? Did you know that Nazi doctors in concentration camps took much of their inspiration from some of America's \\"progressives\\" and their eugenics programs? Did you know that America's supreme court in the 20s, which included the legendary Oliver Wendell Holmes, fully endorsed and authorized eugenics right here in the US? Did you know thousands of innocent people were sterilized in our country to rid society of 'imbeciles?' One has to wonder where the muckrakers were all these years!I picked up the book last year after seeing Goldbeg on Glenn Beck's show. The title obviously caught my attention, but the truth of the matter was that I wanted a better understanding of what fascism really was. George Orwell, after fighting in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side, bemoaned the fact that fascism had ceased to be a meaningful word, and simply meant anything you didn't like. Conservative as I am, that was roughly my understanding of it before I read Liberal Fascism as well. I just kind of assumed it was right-wing like everyone says it is. (Great job high school history classes)It makes sense to think that since communism is left-wing, then fascism must be right-wing. I mean they fought each other so much, so that makes sense, right? Wrong. Well, actually...left! As Goldberg points out in the book, when you look through history and even up to the present day, some of the most hated rivals are actually fairly similar to one another. Catholics and Protestants. Sunni and Shia. And yes, communism and fascism. They all have their differences of course, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are opposites either.One of the biggest things that sticks out to me in this book is just how \\"nice\\" true fascism can seem. Much like Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" the American brand of fascism has taken on a slightly more motherly sort of style. We haven't had, as Jonah might say, \\"mustache-twirlers with British accents\\" type of bad guys; the typical storm troopers/Gestapo/death camps, or what have you. Instead, we've opted for a more loving, caring, and parental fascism; a nanny state that knows no limits and will take care of us from cradle to grave. True fascism in fact has little to do with concentration camps or militarism. In fact, fascism is very appealing and popular to most people because it seems to offer so much, which is why it is so dangerous."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book was not only a page turner for me, but also an eye opener. The romantacized information that was once put out about Mussolini and others made me believe that this is all there is to know.

The author convincingly demonstrates, with a vast assembly of facts, that while Fascism (and German National Socialism) historically did contain some elements of right-wing (conservative) doctrine, the movement mainly grew from roots deeply rooted in the left-wing (liberal). Thus Fascism is more closely related to FDR and LBJ than to Goldwater and Reagan. And liberals/progressives can, based on the definitions of words developed in this comprehensive book, now be labeled as a \\"Softer American type of Fascists\\"! Will this work help undo the legacy of Stalin's propoganda? Only time will tell."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"In the intro, Goldberg discusses the confusion surrounding the term 'fascism' with reference to Roger Griffin, Emilio Gentile, Gilbert Allardyce, Ernst Nolte, Stanley Payne, Roger Eatwell et al. The phenomenon has many variants & names whilst the manner of its expression is influenced by the national culture. Nowadays the term is loosely applied to 'anything not desirable.' The author investigates the characteristics of the movement, its roots in American Progressivism of the late 19th and early 20th century, manifestation during the New Deal and similarities with the agenda of what is today called Liberalism in the USA.First he examines Mussolini, a favorite of the New York Times, New Republic, Hollywood and many intellectuals until his invasion of Ethiopia in 1934. This chapter includes sections on Jacobin Fascism with observations on the French Revolution, JJ Rousseau, Georges Sorel and Napoleon, and War, which deals with populism and pragmatism as forms of relativism. National Socialism predated Hitler, competed with communism for the same support base, used identity politics and was not identical with Italian Fascism as Goldberg points out in the 2nd chapter. Further information on the similarities, differences and the danse macabre of shifting alliances in 1930s Europe is available inSinisterismby Bruce Walker.There's selective amnesia as regards Woodrow Wilson during whose 'progressive' presidency censorship, economic regulation, militarism, propaganda & corporatism dominated the USA. Unimaginable crackdowns on the media, restrictions of civil liberties & other outrages took place. During Roosevelt's New Deal the term Liberalism replaced Progressivism; it was the leftist author HG Wells who first advocated 'liberal fascism.' Goldberg shows how closely the programmes of Roosevelt, Mussolini & Hitler resembled one another. Fortunately, democratic parliamentarianism is an Anglo-Saxon tribal institution so the global trend didn't gain totalitarian power in the UK or USA.The third fascist movement exploded in the 1960s with the student riots, assassinations and terrorism of groups like the Weather Underground & Black Panthers. This tumult flowed from the writings of European academics like Paul de Man, Herbert Marcuse, Michel Foucault, Carl Schmitt and Derrida whose 'deconstruction' was a direct offshoot of Heidegger's variety of existentialism.The Reckless Mindby Mark Lilla takes a closer look at these intellectuals and what they promoted. They in turn influenced Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin & Hillary's mentor Saul Alinsky. A wide chasm separates the aforementioned from the classical liberal, conservative or libertarian thinkers like Adam Smith, Montesquieu, Burke, Locke and Hayek. Classical Liberalism focused on the individual whilst its collectivist opponents favored the group, whether based on race, gender or whatever. In other words, Multiculturalism.The author traces the seeds of the 'god-state' idea from Hegel, Darwin and Bismarck's Prussia through the Frankfurt School and the marriage of psychology & Marxism by Adorno, Marcuse & Fromm. Its chief propagandist was Richard Hofstadter. The Kennedy Myth underpinned Lyndon B Johnson's idea of the 'Great Society.' In truth, the 1960s tumult was aspiritual phenomenonthat transpired simultaneously on campus and in government with its vast spending sprees that resulted in family breakdown, the escalation of crime and street violence. The notion of 'unity', neutral in itself, is easily hijacked for the purpose of irrational groupthink.Earlier in the 20th century, Eugenics was promoted by progressives like the Fabians, George Bernard Shaw, HG Wells & Maynard Keynes and opposed by traditionalists like GK Chesterton. The author quotes Nietzsche on eugenics and investigates Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood & the birth control movement. In the economic sphere, the Italian & German collectivist states enforced corporatism (co-ordination) and the New Deal was the same. Government meddling, regulating and corporate lobbying limit competition, are detrimental to small businesses and consumers, and resemble the corporatism of Mussolini's Italy, Nazi Germany and Bismarck's Prussia. Hillary's 'politics of meaning' is a theocratic concept since it claims that the collective can solve all problems via the state, leaving no room for voluntary associations. Polanyi's Science, Faith And Society provides valuable insights on this matter.Today's culture wars echo Bismarck's Kulturkampf, with liberals as the aggressors. Then as now, the enemy is traditional religion and the battlefields are identity, morality, the family and nature, including environmentalism and the cult of the organic. By undermining truth, tradition and reason, ideologies like deconstruction, existentialism, postmodernism, pragmatism and relativism pave the way toward dystopia as Stephen Hicks argues so eloquently inExplaining Postmodernism. Liberalism in the USA is really Leftism, a secular salvationist ideology. No matter how 'nice' it appears on the surface, it has been subverting Enlightenment standards for many decades. And without those standards, society decays into the Nietzchean abyss where brute force supplants reason.In the Afterword, Goldberg looks at the tempting of American conservatism which is a blend of cultural conservatism & classical political liberalism. He examines the writings ofPatrick Buchanan, the most notorious champion of tribalism on the Right and looks at 'compassionate conservatism,' a well-meaning policy that nevertheless extended state powers. Finally, Goldberg observes that transforming the USA into a European welfare state is not the end of the world (although there's plenty of evidence that the real thing is unsustainable, nearingimplosionand civilizationalcollapse). He warns against what might come after a welfarist America. The Western European utopias so beloved of American liberals will show the way in the next two decades. Claire Berlinski's Menace in Europe and Bruce Bawer's While Europe Slept offer intriguing glimpses into the continent's current condition & possible future. The causes and effects are highlighted by the philosopher Chantal Delsol in her illuminating books Icarus Fallen andThe Unlearned Lessons of the Twentieth Century.This well-researched and brilliantly argued book concludes with an appendix (The Nazi Party Platform), 54pp of bibliographical notes and an index. For further reading, I recommend United in Hate by Jamie Glazov, A Conservative History of the American Left by Daniel Flynn, Unholy Alliance by David Horowitz,The Road to Serfdomby FA Hayek and Leftism Revisited by by Erik Von Kuehnelt-Leddihn."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg's _Liberal Fascism_, (Doubleday, 2007), finds that the elites in the US espouse fascism, and have done so from Theodore Roosevelt onwards. He actually concludes that we are all fascists now, more or less.I would characterize the book as a continuation of Eric Voegelin's _The New Science of Politics_ at the level of a catalog of evidence rather than at the theoretical level. So I highly recommend it to my friends. There are problems with it. For instance, it is deficient in theological insight and understanding of such documents as _Rerum Novarum_ and _Quadragessimo Anno_, and one must imagine what a society of three hundred million people would look like without fascist elements, for the author is silent on this important consideration, but nevertheless the detail is enthralling, especially if you were raised, like me, on an account of America's past that was largely harmonious mythopoesis, with, as Goldberg so nicely puts it, the unpleasant details \\"air brushed\\" from the story.Many will be interested in the dominance in the American academy of Bismarckian educated academics (Apparently 9000 studied nach Deutschland by 1900 AD and, for instance, at one time, all faculty at Johns Hopkins had received their training there.)One historical clarification made by Goldberg: What was called fascism in Italy was called progressivism in the US., and Benito Mussolini borrowed freely from Wilson; fascism was highly admired in the US until Italy invaded Ethiopia. Fascism was a left wing socialist phenomenon which the Comintern denominated \\"right wing\\" because it was an obstacle to Stalin's expansionism.Here is his mention of Eric Voegelin, although Voegelin comes to mind hundreds of times as one reads:\\"As mentioned before, Richard Pipes described Bolshevism and Fascism as twinned heresies of Marxism. Both sought to impose socialism of one sort or another, erase class differences, and repudiate the decadent democratic-capitalist systems of the West. In a sense, Pipes's description doesn't go far enough. While Fascism and Bolshevism were surely heresies of Marxism, virtually all collectivist visions at the end of the nineteenth and be ginning of the twentieth centuries were heresies of Marxism in the sense that Marxism itself was heretical. All of these isms, as the philosopher Eric Voegelin argued, were premised on the idea that men could create Utopias through the rearrangement of economic forces and political will. Marxism, or really Leninism, was the most influential and powerful of these heresies and came to define the left.\\"But just as Leninism was a kind of applied Marxism, so, too, was Fascism (as well as technocracy, Fabian socialism, corporatism, war socialism, German social democracy, and so on). Collectivism was the \\"wave of the future, \\" according to the title and argument of a book by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and it would be known by different names in different places. The fascist moment that gave birth to the Russian-Italian method\\" was in reality a religious awakening in which Christianity was to be either sloughed off and replaced or \\"updated\\" by the new progressive faith in man's ability to perfect the world.\\" (p 139) (Interestingly Voegelin's name is NOT found in the index!)A few other bits:\\"Rexford Guy Tugwell, an influential member of FDR's Brain Trust, said of Italian Fascism, \\"It's the cleanest, neatest most efficiently operating piece of social machinery I've ever seen.It makes me envious.\\" (p.11)\\"The one thing that unites these movements is that they were all, in their own ways, totalitarian. But what do we mean when we say something is 'totalitarian'? The word has certainly taken on an understandably sinister connotation in the last half century. Thanks to work by Hannah Arendt, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and others, it's become a catchall for brutal, soul-killing, Orwellian regimes. But that's not how the word was originally used or intended. Mussolini himself coined the term to describe a society where everybody belonged, where everyone was taken care of, where everything was inside the state and nothing was outside: where truly no child was left behind.\\"Again, it is my argument that American liberalism is a totalitarian political religion, but not necessarily an Orwellian one. It is nice,not brutal. Nannying, not bullying. But it is definitely totalitarian--or 'holistic,' if you prefer--in that liberalism today sees no realm of human life that is beyond political significance, from what you eat to what you smoke to what you say. Sex is political. Food is political. Sports, entertainment, your inner motives and outer appearance, all have political salience for liberal fascists. Liberals place their faith in priestly experts who know better, who plan, exhort, badger, and scold. They try to use science to discredit traditional notions of religion and faith, but they speak the language of pluralism and spirituality to defend 'nontraditional' beliefs. Just as with classical fascism, liberalfascists speak of a 'Third Way' between right and left where all good things go together and all hard choices are 'false choices.' \\"The idea that there are no hard choices--that is, choices between competing goods--is religious and totalitarian because it assumes that all good things are fundamentally compatible. The conservative or classical liberal vision understands that life is unfair, that man is flawed, and that the only perfect society, the only real Utopia, waits for us in the next life.\\" (p 14)\\"In Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueveille warned: \\"It must not be forgotten that it is especially dangerous to enslave men in the minor details of life. For my own part, I should be inclined to think freedom less necessary in great things than in little ones.\\"(p 20) [For me this was the most compelling quote.]\\"Almost every program of the early New Deal was rooted in the politics of war, the economics of war, or the aesthetics of war emerging from World War I. ...Many New Deal agencies, the famous \\"alphabet soup,\\" were mostly continuations of various boards and committees set up fifteen years earlier during the war.\\" (p 151)Particularly interesting is the account of the founder of the New Republic, Herbert Croly, who was baptized in the religion of August Comte, converted by William James to progressive Christianity at Harvard, and became the progessive guru for Wilson.The progressives, who later changed their name to \\"liberal,\\" were also, by and large, eugenicists and provided Germany with a great deal of theory and practice. Progressives were in favor or compulsory sterilization of the \\"unfit\\" rather than waiting for evolutionary sorting. Justice Oliver Wendel Holmes, Jr: \\"Three generations of idiots is enough!\\" (You will remember the quote in \\"Judgment at Nuremberg\\" spoken by the defense lawyer played by Maximilian Shell.)Herbert Hoover, \\"the great engineer,\\" was offered the Democratnomination in 1920 because he was the most admired member of the most admired technical class at that time. He was only damned as a right wing capitalist later in the New Deal when they needed a bogie man to account for the failure of the anti-depression measures. Of course the New Deal has become the untouchable \\"cargo cult\\" of current liberalism, in Goldberg's memorable phrase.A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Conservative columnist and author Jonah Goldberg has always had a big beef with the left, and the latest liberal thing to be getting under his skin is the hurling of the word \\"fascist!\\" by those ever-so militant leftists at Conservative figures and icons such as himself. To kind of turn the tables, as well (come on let's be real here) get some payback, Jonah attempts to tie Fascism to modern Liberalism, and show that both political philosophhies share the same ideological root, alas, his book: Liberal Fascism.And what an attempt it is. I got to give it to Jonah, he may have not done so well on the test, but he sure as hell did his homework: first, he gives a plethora of historical examples of liberal Presidents (most prominently FDR) instituting massive state-run economic and public works programs and compares this to the similiar programs instituted by the Nazis (as well as by the Italian fascists in Italy) to revitialize their countries' economies, and this, in Jonah's mind, proves that fascists and Liberals are very alike, he's got a point right? Whoa, not so fast. Just because two parties happen to share some ideas, doesn't mean they're alike, hell, you can make the case that both modern Conservatives and fascists are for big military spending, and thus, conservatives and fascists are alike and that they share similiar ideological roots, so he could just as easily write a book called Conservative Fascism (I'm sure Michael Moore would give the foreword)..but I digress. Next, he gives examples of early 20th century prominent intellectuals and celebrities expressing admiration for the economic programs instituted by Hitler and Mussolini in their respective countries, and Jonah proves once again he's done his research, but once again he pushes it too far. It is true that many early 20th century liberal intellectuals such as W.E.B. Dubois expressed admiration for many of the policies Hitler and Mussolini undertook to revitalize their countries, however men such as Dubois praised them only for their economic, and (obviously) not their social policies, and indeed liberals such as Dubois later condemnded the Nazis for their militarism and racism. Also, the admirers of fascists also could be found among the ultra-conservative ranks, the most obvious being the KKK, so you could once again say that conservatives are more like fascists, and you're back to square one. Jonah's thesis..is not holding together..And last and not least..he compares the ways of modern liberal politicians to the personality cults of fascist dictators..and to really drive the point home he uses a famous speech by Hilary Clinton to say (or at least kind of imply) that she is an authoritarian fascist. Is he serious? Say what you will about Hilary folks, she may be phony..she may be an unreasonably loyal wife...and she may be a straight up stubborn bi..um.(can't say that on here)..but one thing she is not is a fascist. Jonah's jab at Hilary was a new low.So, to sum things up, Jonah's thesis is wrong..liberalism, with it's respect for democracy, representative government, minority protection, equal rights,and individual liberty has little in common with the fascism of old. However, if Goldberg really wanted to make a scholarly contribution to the world and score big points for the right wing at the same time, he should have written a book detailing the links and similarities between fascism and communism, since both fascist and communist countries (unlike liberal and fascist countries) do HAVE A LOT in common-authoritarianism, lack of democracy, government encroachment on individual and economic liberty, massive propaganda and censorship, etc..but hey who am I kidding..it's the 2000s, and to get the big check and all the publicity on FOX NEWS Jonah had to write a book bashing Liberals instead..So would I recommend this book? If you're looking for typical political polemic and smearing..sure..but if you're looking for a serious scholarly work..turn your eyes elsewhere."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I had some eye opening experience, when my neighbor gave me to read Goebbels's Diary translated into Czech by Vaclav Moravec. It was 1974 in then communist Czechoslovakia and books like that were not around, this one was found in the roof structure of the church, where my neighbor was laying new roof tile. Official line of communist propaganda never missed an opportunity to place themselves into exact opposite to Nazism/Fascism. When I read the Diary (which described Hitler's rise to power), I was shocked to see the similarity of the Diary language to the major communist media in communist Czechoslovakia. How that can be, if they are supposed to be on opposite side of the political spectrum? Since then I left Czechoslovakia and more and more I was coming to the conclusion, that not only Communists, but current liberals (Democrats and Greens) and socialists in Europe are together with Fascists and National Socialists on the left side of the politics. My conclusion was coming from stepping back from the history of mankind. I was looking on historical evolution of human freedom (individualism), which is not progressing throughout the ages always toward personal freedom, but overall trend does; from barbaric times of killing opponents toward slavery (progress), to feudal serfdom (progress), to Capitalism with more freedom for people selling their work (progress). Socialism is a historical movement back toward serfdom and slavery, not a progress, as leftists like to claim. They are actually reactionary trend. Right is not represented by KKK, Skinheads etc. Those are extreme leftists, just different kind, which embarrasses modern dominant left. They deel with the problem their traditional way - they call them extreme right. It always worked so what. This book provide a lot of information showing the relationship between Fascism and Socialism. Only difference between them is the fact, that Fascism was forced to rename itself due to its adversity toward international control. One can say, that today's Globalism has the same ambitions as Socialist International had. There is a lot of confusion and smoke blowing, but that seams to be a case. Some proponents of Globalism do it for a selfish reason not realizing, that they are heading in the direction of the leftist plan (did I tell the well guarded secret?). Libertarians are confused about it as well because they see globalism as an expression of economic freedom, well, useful idiots maybe? Some leftists oppose Globalism (they are more equivalent of Fascists), some push it like Clinton or liberal Republicans do (those are more like followers of Socialist International). I am sorry that I had to wait for this book for so long. It (in my opinion) does not go all the way but it is an important step in prohibited direction. And it is right direction."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"There are a few things that we've learned as kids and have since taken for granted: the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, the birds fly south in the Winter, and north in the Summer, there are four seasons, seven days in week, etc. One of these truisms that almost no one questions is that communism is a left/liberal ideology while fascism is a right/conservative one. And while communism to this day has maintained a certain level of respectability and even moral high ground in some circles, labeling someone a fascist is the lowest form of insult, and something that many conservative thinkers are constantly subjected to. Therefore it came as a bit of a surprise to me to discover that fascism is in fact, when looked at objectively and without the baggage that it has assumed in popular perception, a quintessential left-of-center ideology. Granted, \\"Nazi\\" is in fact a shorthand for \\"National-socialist,\\" but for the better part of last seventy years hardly anyone thought to emphasize the \\"socialist\\" part of the label, only the nationalism by which it was widely known. In the light of that Jonah Goldberg's book comes as a revelation that has profound effect on one's perception of the world. It is equivalent to discovering that the sun rises AND sets in the East. I was at first rather skeptical of the premise of this book, but the exhaustive, detailed and persuasive historical evidence that was presented in the book put all my misgivings aside. It documented many of the fascist tendencies and full-blown policies of some of the darlings of American left: Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. It shows that aside from the extermination of Jews, there are hardly any policies of German National-socialists that differ substantially from any other socialist movement of the time, or even today. And herein, according to this book, lies the greatest danger for the modern western democracies. By demonizing fascism as a phenomenon of the right, it leaves open the unimpeded encroachment to many fascist policies under the guise of socialist and other liberal movements. These movements don't necessarily want the full-blown fascist dictatorships installed, but they are certainly progressing in that direction. That's why they are referred to as \\"liberal\\" fascists - fascists with a smiley face.Jonah Goldberg does a remarkable job of presenting his ideas and impressions to the modern reader - always backed by facts, never overdoing the rhetoric. The book covers somewhat the similar ground as the legendary \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" by F. A. Hayek. This latter book was written in the middle of WWII, and had some of the same perceptions as \\"Liberal Fascism.\\" Its thesis was to warn the Western democracies against implementing many of the social programs that led to the rise of fascism and communism in Europe at the time. It is sobering to see that many of those warnings are still relevant today, maybe even more so than in 1940s. We live in the world where both fascism and communism are rapidly recede in people's memory, and it is easy to think that what led to them could not possibly happen again. \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is a sobering reminder that the road to fascism is indeed sometimes paved with the best intentions.One final note: many of the current-events books out there don't age well, and their relevance diminishes almost as fast as that of many periodicals. This is certainly not the case with \\"Liberal Fascism.\\" The style of writing and the comprehensive historical references and examples will keep this book relevant for many years to come."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"...is that author Jonah Goldberg does not begin from anyone's preformed definition of the term. Nor does he accept the common assertion that to be fascist, a regime or movement must incorporate racist / genocidal elements. Rather, he unearths the ideological commonalities among regimes and movements commonly accorded the fascist label -- a signal departure from the fascism-is-anti-Semitism, fascism-is-conservatism, and fascism-is-big-business currents of recent decades. He follows those ideological themes and their instantiations in policy through a large chunk of American history.The core fascist premise Goldberg identifies, as anyone who's read the book will tell you, is the elevation of the State to a position of unbounded, unchallengeable authority over individuals and their voluntary associations. The fascist concedes unbounded authority to the State, implicitly setting at naught the notion that individuals can have rights against it. The State need not necessarily use all of that authority all the time to be conceptually fascist. However, when challenged on any subject for any reason, it must assert that authority as metaphysically unquestionable, a natural property of the State.The controversy over Goldberg's title arises from liberals' fondness for the word \\"fascist\\" as a pejorative to hurl at conservatives. Admittedly, no one likes having his rhetorical weapons turned against him. However, Goldberg's analysis dovetails with that of Thomas Sowell in \\"The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy.\\" Both analysts find that American liberals are far more friendly toward the fascist premise than American conservatives are or have ever been. Goldberg's book does the ideological detective work; Sowell's delineates the underlying attitudes, showing that American liberals believe themselves morally and intellectually superior not just to conservatives, but also to the accumulated legal, moral, social, and economic traditions of the United States -- and therefore entitled to set all that aside and remake America according to their own vision.Goldberg's conclusion is chilling beyond words: fascism is with us, being fastened upon us increment by increment, with our cooperation -- because it's popular. We accept the nullification of Constitutional constraints on Washington (and for that matter, on the state and local governments as well) because we expect \\"things to be better\\" afterward. Liberals and conservatives will disagree on how often we've been disappointed in such expectations, but that's irrelevant to the larger point: that American liberals approve of the dismantling of those Constitutional barriers to State action, whereas American conservatives, in the main, disapprove of it and want to put a stop to it."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg (et al) did himself proud in this well written fastidiously researched historically accurate and humorous book.

If you wonder what happened to our school system, our political system, our representative republican form of government then you will find the answers in this book... You won't like them, but you'll find the truth in these pages.Jonah provides not only an accurate history of fascism but Nazism and why back in the day they were so popular even in America and why today our government is 'chock a block' with socialist and progressive fascist programs and an endless democrat support for it providing names and examples using present day government policies and supporters. You'll be able to identify fascist techniques being used every single day in the news and in politics by your government officials, special interest groups and 'news' providers.If you are like I was, you can't figure out why government seems to contradict itself, can lie directly to your face like God Himself never spoke truer words, when you know it's false, why the gears of news and information just don't seem to mesh with actions by government it's in this book.

I've also wondered how the left became identified with the \\"liberal\\" label, which originally referred to those who believed in individual and economic freedom and restricted government, clearly at odds with what the Democratic party has stood for since the New Deal. Third, I've wondered as well why the Nazis and the Italian fascists have always been associated with the right of the political spectrum when they had so little in common with conservatism, and so much in common with Communism. The conventional explanation that left meant internationalism while right mean nationalism just didn't make any sense.So I was pleasantly surprised to find all three of these questions addressed by Jonah Goldberg's book. I admit I haven't had a good grounding in modern American history, but I had heard of the Progressive Movement, which I associated with Wisconsin, Robert La Follete and populism.This is not the history you'll learn in high school, and it certainly undercuts all the claims of the left who, having fouled the name of liberalism, are now calling themselves progressives once more. Goldberg demonstrates convincingly that all of the current movements built around government planning and control, whether called Communism, Fascism, Nazism, Liberalism or Populism, stem from the so-called populist and progressive movement beginning in the 1800s and resulting in most of the misery and death during the late Nineteenth and the Twentieth Century.What is even more unsettling is the current influence of the ideas of radical guru Saul Alinsky on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.I found the organization and narrative of the book to wander somewhat in the second half, seemingly from an overabundance of evidence bearing on all versions of the progressive, or more honestly, the \\"government knows best\\" movement. Conservatives can be compassionate. Government can't. When it tries, it ends up making it a legal right to live on other people's earnings and destining the poor to remain so for generations.I'm currently reading a book on Postmodernism, which repeatedly makes the point that rationalism and other elements of the Enlightenment have failed. Yet, our elites never seem to have gotten the message, which might account for pomo mumbo jumbo."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"Liberal Fascism\\". How often can we find an author, in our times, willing to tell the truth?For instance, it is undisputed that Socialism itself is a form of Collectivism. It is further undisputed that \\"Collectivism\\" is \\"THE\\" mantra of The Left. So how in the world did \\"Nationalist Socialism\\" (aka Nazi Party, a quintessential \\"Collectivist\\" group if there ever was one) become labeled as \\"Right Wing\\"?The book will leave you wanting more, which isn't a criticism of the book at all. Each chapter could be expanded into a separate book that would alone be difficult to condense into twice the number of pages in \\"Liberal Fascism\\". However, the author gives the reader more than enough to grasp the story of the Progressive movement.The story of Progressivism has mysteriously made its way out of our History books, or more accurately - these are pages of History that have been completely (and intentionally) torn out.Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, & John F. Kennedy: What do these men have in common with one another?If you feel that question is controversial, go ahead and duct-tape your head now and brace for the next question:What do Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, & John F. Kennedy have in common with Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini?In \\"Liberal Fascism\\", Jonah Goldberg walks you through the fascinating & disturbing journey of the Trans-Atlantic Progressive, or more accurately \\"FASCIST\\", movement in America & Europe from the early 20th Century to where we stand today. The \\"Right\\" has been blamed for the ideological sins of the \\"Left\\".Even today, logic is thrown aside when the \\"Left\\" call Conservatives \\"racist\\" while simultaneously supporting measures to discriminate and keep America separated by class or race. Just wait until you read the chapter about the Progressive push for eugenics right here in the United States, absolutely shocking!The concept and dangers of \\"Collectivism\\" are nothing new to anyone who studies history. Jonah Goldberg's \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is a well researched and entertaining book that looks at the recent, and tragic, history of Fascism and then proceeds through history up to present day Progressivism, which as you'll soon discover is nothing more than \\"Fascism with a smiley face.\\"The very \\"Progressivism\\" (aka Fascism) that Mr. Goldberg writes about is without a doubt, the greatest threat to our Freedom and the very ideology that plagues the majority of our elected politicians today, just as it plagued them in recent history.While I don't find this so difficult to spot, I would suggest that those who disagree need only to look at the power grabs (and history) being made through the marriage of government & industry here today in the name of \\"fairness\\" and \\"compassion\\". Politicians are choosing the rule of \\"empathy\\" over the rule of law, and while it might \\"feel\\" nice and \\"feel\\" like the right thing to do... tell ya what, don't take my word for it. Read the book and come to your own conclusion. [If more people would do nothing more than that... I'd feel much more optimistic about the future]4 out of 5 stars!I'm Jason Bradley, thanks for reading.[...]"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The \\"editorial review\\" of this book is almost as interesting as the book. It ignores all of the documented history of limitations of and assaults on individual and economic history under Wilson and Roosevelt (the most valuable part of the book since none of this is taught in schools) and instead let's us know that \\"Neocons support militarism.\\" Naurally, in constrast to Goldgerg who provides massive documentation the reviewer expects us to rely upon his judgement (perhaps augmented by the \\"authority\\" of the WaPo) for everything he says."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a very well documented history of politics in this country since Woodrow Wilson and World War I, focusing on the similarities between liberal movements in this country and fascism under Mussolini and Hitler, minus the horrors of the so-called Final Solution. There was more mutual admiration between Wilson and FDR and Italian fascists than most of us have been led to believe, and its well documented by the author. He shows how liberals since World War II have successfully stigmatized the political right as fascist when in fact the opposite is true. He traces the corporatism of Wilson, FDR and modern liberals and compares it to Mussolini. Looking at today, he points to he demands for unity and collectivism and demphasizing individual rights and responsibilities as warnings for the future."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg's Liberal Fascism is an interesting but problematic book. Because of its incendiary topic, it needed to be really great to be successful. It falls short of greatness in multiple ways. I avoided reading it for a while because I had already come to the conclusion that historical fascism was essentially leftist and liberalism by nature in danger of trending totalitarian. I thought I had nothing to gain from this particular book. In the end, I read it because I wanted to see for myself whether strong critical reviews were justified. The book is both better and worse than I was expecting. It is more serious but more weakly argued. Narrower in scope but less focused. The prose less juvenile than the author's columns but also less consistent and less constructed.In general, the book holds up well against its critics. Many of the negative Amazon reviewers appear to have (1) not read the book, (2) not read it carefully/completely, or (3) not understood parts. For example, in one review, the reviewer correctly points to some problems of logic in the book's overall approach, but consistently says that Goldberg equates Nazism and modern liberalism, whereas Goldberg in fact goes to lengths not to equate them and clearly distinguishes between Nazism and a definition of fascism that can be applied outside the specific German context.Another reviewer says Goldberg \\"customized\\" his definitions and calls it \\"loony\\" when Goldberg writes \\"The quintessential Liberal Fascist isn't an SS storm trooper; it is a female grade school teacher with an education degree from Brown or Swarthmore.\\" Although Goldberg descends into stereotyping here, we can understand what he means, and the term \\"liberal fascism\\" wasn't coined by Goldberg but by a mid-20th century British fascist who meant exactly that the stormtrooper needed to make way for softer forms of coercion.In general, the number of negative reviewers who can't deal with relatively simple historical complexities like internecine conflict that could leave Mussolini both a socialist and an opponent of Italian Socialism is truly disturbing. At least as disturbing is the tunnel vision of reviewers like the one who says Hugo Chavez can't be a socialist because he is a tyrant. Following these types of reasoning, \\"socialism\\" and other labels are useless as descriptive historical terminology.The two largest problems I see with the book are that it (1) straddles the worlds of intellectual history and political polemics and (2) resists using a working definition of fascism.The first problem leads Goldberg to undermine his own work by switching back and forth between the voice of a historian and that of a columnist. In multiple places, we have a narrative documentation of historical points followed by a paragraph that begins something like \\"We are constantly told that...\\" referring to partisan positions floating in the ether. This is arguably acceptable in political writing, but unacceptable in historical.As the book progresses, this problem becomes more pronounced so that by the end of the book, it is hard to see anything beyond partisan commentary on the contemporary political scene. Even if not indicative of an intentionally partisan book, the last chapters leave Goldberg's arguments open to legitimate criticisms of ahistoricity and selective reporting.The second problem--a failure to use a consistent working definition of fascism--leaves the book's purpose and line of argumentation shifting and at times in doubt. The reason is clear and laid out by Goldberg: even professional scholars who focus on fascism and twentieth century politics cannot agree on what exactly fascism is. The closest Goldberg comes is his definition of fascism as a religion of the state, although this is so broad as to be almost unusable, and Goldberg does not in fact use it to explicate what was going on in the various historical manifestations of fascism that he examines. It really comes into play in his analysis of the JFK mythology, which is perhaps the weakest part of the book. JFK was more like a non-ideological lull between FDR/Truman and LBJ, and the consequent myth of Camelot is mostly a generational/NYC/New England phenomenon. I know young liberals today who don't really know of or care about JFK.There are essentially two possible ways to approach writing a book like this. One would be to show the intellectual lineage of fascism and liberalism in the sense of \\"this politician read that theorist and took these ideas and influenced this other person.\\" Another would be to document paradigmatic and structural similarities. The first way would involve methodical and extensive documentation of source material, while the second would involve comprehensive sampling and incisive argumentation. Goldberg does both and neither. For example, he discusses Mussolini's intellectual heritage in socialism and Sorel without an extensive discussion of the Fascist program, but then writes about the Wilson administration in terms of a checklist of things \\"everyone\\" recognizes as fascist, mentioning only in passing thinkers read on both sides of the ocean. This mixed approach is not satisfying or convincing.The book is structured as:(1) an examination of classical (i.e., universally recognized) fascism through chapters on Mussolini and Hitler;(2) an argument for a \\"fascist moment\\" in the mid-20th century through chapters on Wilson and FDR;(3) an argument for the sublimation of fascist sentiments into a modern American liberal myth through chapters on the 1960s and JFK/LBJ;(4) an argument for the continuity of themes between the \\"fascist moment\\" and modern American liberalism through chapters on race, economics, and the ideal of corporatism;(5) a mea culpa through chapters on modern life and conservatism;(6) and finally, some comments on the Obama phenomenon.The most interesting chapters in the book are on Wilson and FDR and present a lot of history that isn't taught in the modern secondary school classroom. However, these chapters are argued with the level of investigation and at the breakneck pace of Howard Zinn's People's History. There are multiple topics in both these chapters that deserve volumes of their own for proper consideration.The best chapter in the book is probably that on the 1960s counterculture youth movements, which had much in common with classical fascism in terms of impatience, violence, and other spiritual outlook. This is also the only chapter that tries to examine fascism as a popular movement rather than a function of philosophy and historical figures (an important drawback to the book as a whole since fascists have relied parasitically on the demos).As I said, the chapter on Kennedy is a big stretch, and then we are on to themes. I agree with much of what Goldberg says in these chapters, but there isn't space in his book to do much beyond finger-pointing, which isn't going to do anything but preach to the choir. The chapter on racism and eugenics is embarrassing. In the chapter on Germany, Goldberg has already defined focus on racial conflict as a Hitlerian obsession rather than a global fascist problem. As a result, his attempt to draw a moral equivalence between Progressive eugenics and Southern racial politics in the US is a mistake. Likewise with identity politics, which, although representing the institutionalization of 1960s counterculture nihilism, would force us to consider race conflict as a global fascist problem. This brings us to the point of considering rightist politics in the US...By far the biggest criticism one could make of Liberal Fascism is its failure to refute the claim that fascism resides on the US right by showing that the right is not fascist. Goldberg has clearly defined US conservatism as part of the \\"classical liberal-libertarian\\" tradition, although there are theoretical gaps here. Goldberg paints McCarthy (probably correctly) as a leftist, but WFB got his start by supporting McCarthy and telling Ivy League college presidents that they needed to quash academic freedom. If WWII era conflicts between fascists and communists were intra-party socialist squabbles, how do we explain the early history of WFB, anti-communism, and the embracing of neo-conservatives/ex-Marxists on the right? I do believe that NR is not a fascist instrument, but by resisting, as I said above, the use of a working definition of fascism, Goldberg has left these questions hanging.Although I really can't give this particular book more than three stars, I do hope it spurs other better explorations of some of the topics and perspectives presented."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg's book is excellent: well document, soundly reasoned, and sometimes painfully obvious for anyone who has studied the roots of progressivism, eugenics, the politically correct movement, the nanny state trends or the environmental movement.Goldberg leaves no stone unturned. Wait until you see his sobering take on the origins of the minimum wage. It will surprise you. Much of the material in the book I had read or heard before. Goldberg, however, has done us a great service by pooling the ideas together in one comprehensive volume. So, what you might have gotten an inkling about by reading Robert Proctor's The Nazi War on Cancer, you get a fuller picture of in Goldberg's book. After all, who knew the Nazis were animal rights believers before Proctor? Not too many of us. Goldberg follows the line of thought from the progressives to modern day Democrats and leftists. The linking pin between those liberals a century ago and those today is fascism. This will come as a surprise to many people, but it is undeniable.Goldberg's book is excellent.

I finished my copy in the airport and the plane the day I bought it.If history is written by the \\"winners\\", then the history of fascism has been written by those who have historically claimed to \\"fight fascism\\", namely Marxists and the left. Ignoring the often forgotten chapter of history when the leftist Popular Front allied themselves with fascist Germany, the left has always claimed that they alone have fought the good fight against fascism and they use the fascist club to beat their ideological opponents with. Look at recent bestsellers from Naomi Wolf and Chris Hedges and it is evident that this club of \\"fascism\\" is still used with great effect. After all, one of fascisms biggest targets were communists and conservatives don't like communists, so conservatives must be fascists. It's a typical \\"Logical Fallacy\\", but considering the ability of most of today's left to come with anything resembling reasoned thinking and a ideology still mired in discredited mid 18th century Marxist though, it shouldn't surprise.In his book, Goldberg takes a good stab at a more thoughtful and objective look at fascism, and its real historical roots. Its not about whether Hitler was a vegetarian, or if Nazi Germany had welfare. Its about how these two ideological cousins, fascism and leftism are similar in both form and function and how Fascism grew out of leftists and leftist movements of the late 19th and early 20th century, who were looking for an alternate path power. If Fascism and leftism look so similar in form and function, its because one was built off the other. Fascism developed as a fascio, a form of radical socialism. While opposing communism and social democracy, fascism was rooted in radical leftist dogma, including the theories of those such as Gabriele D'Annunzio (a former anarchist), Alceste de Ambris and or former socialist Benito Mussolini. Both fascism and leftism in general share as a prime goal collectivization for the common good of the people and the use of totalitarian power and violence to achieve this.This is by no means a new argument, but its one that challenges the long held conventional wisdom of the demagogues who have appropriated the definition of fascism, and its time to remake that definition into what it really was.Should be read along with Joshua Muravchik's, Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism for more background."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Hegel gave us the dialectic.

Historically, it has been most violently opposed to liberal political factions, such as trade unions. Fascists have been rabidly opposed to Communists; wherever Fascist governments have come into power, leftists have been disenfranchised, incarcerated, tortured and killed. So why do we see \\"Liberal-Fascism?\\" This book was published as part of a timed publicity campaign intended to link the term \\"liberalism\\" in the public mind with the hated term \\"Fascism.\\"This book deliberately preys on public confusion about aspects of these terms. Conservative pundits constantly assert that they oppose government in all its forms - associating any level of governmental authority with tyranny. Since Fascists believed in a strong centralized state, and liberals try to use the state to promote social programs, the two movements are linked, right? Wrong. The book minimizes or ignores the differences between these ideologies, as well as the way in which Fascist beliefs changed and solidified with time. The clash between Fascists and liberals began in earnest when the former rejected ideas about class conflict in favor of an emphasis on national - and eventually - racial conflict. With rising hostility from the left, Fascists gravitated towards the most reactionary elements of their society.This book also ignores a political truth that most thoughtful people know; that neither the left nor the right are really opposed to the idea of the state, they simply want to use the state to achieve their own cherished goals. Usually the faction that is not in power loudly decries government.The sleepy kid in government class awakens long enough to mention: \\"Didn't Hitler's Fascists and Stalin's Communists become allies?\\" Yep, it was an alliance of convenience that ended rather badly. Both movements were totalitarian however. Totalitarianism exists on both the farthest ends of both the left and right ends of the political spectrum. Both Hitler and Stalin's states used the power of government to violently crush all dissent.The danger and intent of the \\"Liberal-Fascism\\" propaganda campaign is that it attempts to fuse the public's perception of all political extremism exclusively with the left. If successful, it would allow the propagandists to lead the nation unopposed so far in the reactionary direction that a truly militant, totalitarian state would emerge. You don't believe it?

The advance dislike for this book simmered for months, and now the floodgates for negative reviews are open. I'd advise all potential readers of this book to bear in mind how few of the negative reviews appear to reflect a reading of the book.For those willing to give Goldberg the chance, he offers the following thesis: that the label fascist has its roots in the governing philosophies of Italy's National Fascist Party and Germany's National Socialist (Nazi) Party. He argues that there has been a false duality created between the Soviet Socialists of the USSR and the socialists united under the fascists in Italy and Germany. He argues that the totalitarian impulse, the philosophy of state control of decisions taking priority over individual freedoms, is the core uniting principle behind these movements, and he argues that the ongoing home of such statism is in what has come to be known as the \\"liberal\\" politics of the modern progressive movement. As you can imagine, that doesn't sit very well with the targets of his argument (hence the rain of 1-star reviews).I'd encourage open minded readers of all backgrounds to read Goldberg's book and address his arguments. I find his conversational and somewhat informal style to be witty and readable. That said, longtime Goldberg fans should know that this is not a book-length \\"G-File\\" (the hip and irreverent column he wrote for National Review Online). This is a serious scholarly work, and it deserves to be read and judged as such. Goldberg is attempting to right a historical injustice. This book is not attempting, as many seem to think, to say that all liberals are closet Nazis, but rather that, contrary to popular misconception, it is not conservatism, but liberalism, that traces its roots to the fascists. In some ways it is a book-length extension of the question conservatives sometimes pose to liberals: \\"If you leave out the parts about killing all the Jews and invading Poland, what specifically about the Nazi political platform do you disagree with?\\" (That platform is handily provided in the appendix.) After Goldberg's book, this question is much harder to simply shrug off.Still, one doesn't need nearly 600 citations just to allow conservatives to say \\"I'm rubber, you're glue\\" the next time they are called a fascist. Goldberg argues that our focus on the atrocities committed by fascists in Germany obscures the fact that the fascist drive is, to a degree, universal in modern politics. The heritage and institutions of America lead it to manifest itself in a different form here. Whether it is the smothering embrace of the \\"It Takes a Village\\" mommy state or, to a lesser degree, the big-government, \\"compassionate conservatism\\" of Bush, fascism in the U.S. is well-intention, \\"smiley face\\" fascism, but it still looks first to the state, last to the individual.In the end, that's what I liked best about this book. Yes, it's great to have a 5-pound rebuttal to the next person who tries to use \\"fascist\\" as an epithet to end criticism of a liberal program. However, what comes through in the end is not so much Goldberg's hatred of fascism, but his love of liberty. Fascism in all its forms is the enemy of liberty, and recognizing it for what it is will always be a prerequisite for stopping it. Goldberg's \\"Liberal Fascism\\" clears away decades of obfuscation to allow that recognition in both the past and present day politics. Those who continue to fight for individual freedom will enjoy and appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"First of all, allow me to say that I have purchased and read this book -- something I believe few, if any, of the negative reviewers have done.This is an important work, tracing the intellectual development of the idea that the all-powerful people's State should always trump the individual and be in firm control of all aspects of the population's culture, education, defense or military expansion, information, health and economy, from its modern beginnings under Wilson to the currently epoused nanny state. One could go further back to the French Revolution or further to Thomas More, of course, but given the deplorable state of history knowledge in the US, this might well be counter-productive. Monarchies need not be considered as they are not states that derive their legitimacy from the people -- but rather from God and inheritance.The most negative aspect of this book is its title, \\"Liberal Fascism.\\" A careful reader will learn what is meant by the author, but the vast majority will simply see the juxtaposition of the two words, \\"Liberal\\" and \\"Fascism\\" and read into this anything their pre-conceived ideas suggest. Actually, the author meant to describe something like \\"Benevolent Fascism\\", \\"Soft Fascism\\", \\"Smiley-Face Fascism\\", or my favorite, \\"Fuzzy Fascism\\" (e.g. Fascism that will not hurt you.) The word \\"Liberal\\" is used to put a more moderate or liberal face on Fascism, something more appropriate to nanny-state fascism. If the reader misinterprets the title, then little rational discussion can ensue.The strengths of the book are in its rediscovery of the truly disturbing policies of the Wilson administration in 1917 and 1918 whereby opponents of his administration and policies were brutally suppressed. One should review the repressive Alien and Sedition Act and the Espionage Acts that Wilson promulgated. Nor did he shrink from meddling in other countries' affairs and supporting leaders he favored. The reader is advised to study his backing of Carranza and his Vera Cruz expedition in Mexico. At any rate, the Progressive movement in the US really did bring many ideas into the mainstream of American political thought that were later used as cornerstones of fascist ideology.The author traces the support of communist and fascist states by American progressives until World War II -- an historical fact that should not be denied today as an inconvenient truth.He also argues succinctly that Fascism replaces a religion based on a supreme being (God) with a religion based on a supreme State. So does communism as a matter of fact. The new God becomes the will of the people as interpreted and enforced by the State's elite for the people's benefit. Hence the development of the nanny-state political philosophy is a direct descendent of Fascism and features many of its evils. Bill O'Reilly has coined the name \\"Secular-Progressive\\" to describe thie political philosophy, although I wonder if he realized the historical accuracy of his term. The missing part is the militarism and genocide associated today with Fascism, which were outgrowths of the core ideas of Fascism and may well yet develop in the nanny state. After all, what would there be to stop such a development? It should be remembered that one of Hitler's early steps was to introduce full gun control in Germany to reduce any possibility of internal resistance to his regime.The argument that \\"it can't happen here\\" should be revisited in light of Wilson's actions, Roosevelt's creation of concentration camps for Japanese during World War II, and the more recent Patriot Act. Unfortunately, many turn to the ACLU for solace, but it must be remembered that this organization was founded to foster the spread of communist ideology, and consistently supports the all-powerful leftist and secular state against the individual and religion.The book bogs down somewhat in the argument that fascism is a product of the left and not of the right (politically.) The author is correct here, but he is swimming upstream against a powerful current from the mainstream American media which is firmly leftist and committed to the creation of a nanny state. In addition, he is trumped by the educational industry, both in public schools and in universities which has consistently taught socialist ideology since World War Two under the rubric of liberal teaching. As of this date, we have had a steady diet of socialist propaganda in our schools and universities for so long than no national or local figure has escaped its pernicious effects. What was thought to be \\"far-left\\" in 1960 is now centrist -- so far have we gone down the road towards a fascist state.Nevertheless, the use of terms that everyone interprets in their own fashion by the author colors this discussion so markedly that constructive dialog between liberals and conservatives over this work is highly improbable. That is a great loss to our democracy.So what is the solution? There probably isn't one. Politicians eloquently espousing \\"change\\" and \\"hope\\" have already very effectively learned how to evade issues in favor of vacuous but thrilling demagogy to rise to power. It must be remembered that both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama studied Saul Alinsky thoroughly, making him possibly the most important individual in the background of the 2008 election. Senator Clinton even did double duty traveling to California to study under an unrepentant Stalinist. Perhaps they do not understand the road on which they are traveling -- after all, they've never been taught anything different. (That's why home schooling and even charter schools are such threats.) I suspect that the US will survive anything they do in the short term, but they are harbingers of things to come. The trend is there from the days of Wilson, and the ultimate denouement is in sight with Europe cheering us on out of envy every day. Even the mass demonstrations so loved by fascism to demonstrate the power and popularity of the State and its leaders are now being copied.Before I receive thousands of hate comments from Obama supporters, allow me to state that the epithet \\"Fascist\\" does not fit Barack Obama in any way, shape or form. But the parallels I noted should not be overlooked in a study of the historical sweep of events and the acceptance of ideas. There is no question that the US has taken many steps on the road to the author's fascist nanny state, and opposition to this trend is fast being suppressed."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"A lot has been written about this book, and I'm not inclined to add much to the debate. If you read LIBERAL FASCISM as providing a grand unified theory of contemporary history you will be able to find some flaws (like most books of the genre). Yet if you read the book to get a quick overview of recent history, I think you will learn a lot. Most people don't know about the importance of eugenics in US history, how \\"progressive\\" the Nazis were, the left's infatuation with Communism (and fascism), and many other facts that are brought out in the book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg's book wanders from time to time and there are parts that are hard to follow because of this. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book. Goldberg correctly identifies fascism as a left wing movement, a fact that most do not seem to recognize. He exposes the continuity of thought from the so-called progressives a century ago to the so-called progressives today. While identifying similarities between fascism over the last 100 years and today's liberals, he takes pains to insist that he is not saying that today's liberals are just like Nazis (in contrast to some of the other reviews you may read). This is a thought-provoking and enlightening book. Hopefully the skeptical will be motivated to learn the truth."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"At this point, I'm only about two thirds of the way throughLiberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning. So far, I've found the book to be fascinating. Growing up thinking that \\"this is just how things are\\", or hearing the sanitized (or romanticized) versions of recent history, it's really good to see the origins of \\"liberal\\" or \\"progressive\\" thought, its connection to the fascist or Nazi world view and the context of certain events -- like the unrest and the Great Society agenda of the 1960s.The author approaches the subject of Liberal Fascism with considerable thoroughness. That is good, because you can get a very good sense of how things fit together, looking at things from several different angles and in different contexts. However, by the time I got halfway through the book, a lot of things were starting to sound very familiar. Since I'm not an historian, I almost wish I had waited for the Readers Digest version to come out.The author also makes very strong links between the progressives of the early 1900s and the liberal politics of today. And, while you can draw a straight line through these respective agendas, I think the author might be overstating the links. However, as he states, \\"even when motives and arguments change, the substance of the policy remains in its effects\\" (p. 276).All-in-all, I think this book is well worth the time it takes to read it. Certainly, anyone from the Right would gain insights from this book; but, those from the Left could also benefit from the historical perspective of his or her own political view. I think this book would be a great textbook for a college course on political history, and would provide valuable insights into a study of 20th Century American History."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Question: What do Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, Woodrow Wilson, and FDR have in common? Answer: More than you think! Jonah Goldberg in this well researched, detailed, and introspective look at the history of Progressivism, Liberalism, and Fascism, and how there are similarities is an eye opening look at not only the European past but our own American background. Goldberg, if one is familiar with his columns and his interviews, displays humor and a lot of witticism in his relaying of various examples of how government both local and national in their endeavors in looking out for everyone's well-being invariably overreaches and interferes with citizens' rights. Some of the examples are funny but some of them are a bit scary. My favorite example was the progressive daycare in Seattle where LEGOS were banned because \\"children were building assumptions about ownership and the social power it conveys.\\" Supposedly the teachers wanted a playtime that reflected \\"collectivity\\" not something that \\"mirrored a class-based,capitalist society.\\" Really? What happened to creativity here? I thought that's what LEGOS were meant to do--encourage children to use their minds and develop dexterity. Not everyone will like this book but I think most people would at least embrace the history aspect of it.

It is relatively well researched. You will not be able to put it down.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I have to admit that I had not planned to read this book; the title and cover, as well as some of the reviews in the major media, led me to believ that this was a screed of the Ann Coulter sort, long on invective and short on fact and reason. But I received a copy as a gift a few days ago, and I was surprised to learn that it is anything but.Goldberg goes to great pains to say that this book is not an attack on liberalism, nor is he saying that liberals are fascists. What he is doing, rather, is uncovering the hidden intellectual antecedents of the modern liberal movement in the Progressive anbd Fascist movements of the past. Now before you jump to conclusions claiming (as some reviews have) that Goldberg is equating liberalism with Nazism, consider that Fascism as a movment long preceeded Nazism by a good 15 years, and that in the 1920 Mussolini was greatly admired by progressives for his social programs. Western intellectuals looked at Fascism as a model for modern progressive government, with its emphasis on social services and cradle-to-grave goverment care. Nazism took these ideas, along with the Fascists' rejection of the Internationalism of the Communists, but added to that his own veneer of antisemitism.Not that the American Progressives were any less guilty of racism and nationalistic fervor; during the Wilson era, which modern liberals point to as a time of great social progress, this country saw newspapers and magazines shut down for printing dissent, people imprisoned for expressing opinions contrary to government policy in their own homes, and the infamous Palmer Raids, in which suspected radicals- foreigners- were rounded up and imprisoned and expelled.Those who still think of the McCarthy era- a brief period of history in which a group of Hollywood party members became martyrs for lying to congress- was the time when fascism came to America should really read about the Wilson era- or, for that matter, FDR, who, despite being a great wartime leader, imprisoned and confiscated the property of thousands of native born Americans because of their race, and attempted to stack the Supreme Court in violation of the Constitution.The legacy of the Progressives is no mere historical artifact. Today's liberal offspring of the progressives often complain of government abuse of power, and yet too often they endorse sweeping government powers in support of their political aims. Consider the great \\"urban renewal\\" experiments in social engineering of the 1960s, in which neighborhoods were destroyed, property seized, and populations rounded up into housing projects. Or the famous \\"HillaryCare\\" initiative, in which a complete nationalization of health care was dreamed up not in the public forum, or even in Congress, where it could be debated, but behind closed doors.Liberals are forever accusing Conservatives of being the intellectual heirs to Mussolini and Hitler, but the historical record tells a very different story. I've touched on just a small part of this book; there's a tremendous amount of well-researched history that should be of interest to anyone, whatever their political preferences, if only to see a very different view of history from that written by the Progressives and their followers. Of course, I'm sure this review will get the usual collection of ignorant responses that many other positive reviews have received, mainly by people who have not read the book, and many of whom have, in their comments, opined that it should be burned, or never have been printed. And that is very telling in and of itself."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Length:: 8:02 MinsMy video about the book Liberal Fascism.[...]"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book raises important lines of intellectual inquiry that have been ignored or repressed both in popular culture and academia. I'm sure much of that stems from well earned embarrassment in the aftermath of World War IIFor me, the basic premises of this book were not entirely new. F.A. Hayek certainly made it clear in his The Road to Serfdom how Fascist and Nazi ideas grew out of socialism. Hayek also makes clear in his The Counter Revolution of Science where all of these ideologies have their roots in the French Revolution. Contrary to the 1 star reviews, this book is on solid historical and intellectual ground.Nor is the discussion of Woodrow Wilson's WWI wartime dictatorship new to me. Properly taught U.S. Constitutional History or Constitutional Law classes certainly cover the Sedition and Espionage Acts. Oliver Wendell Holmes opinion in the Schenk case caused me to think, one afternoon in 1969. what might have happened to Jane Fonda had Wilson rather than Johnson or Nixon been President during the Vietnam War. I think she would have been hanged.Speaking of Holmes, don't forget that one of the great scenes in the movie Judgment at Nuremberg is where the attorney defending the Nazi collaborator quotes from Holmes's opinion in Buck v. Bell.Nor is the idea new that the National Recovery Administration (the other NRA) was a fascist undertaking. The Blue Eagle lives on at the beginning of movies from the early 1930's. I recall documentaries on the New Deal with newsreels from the 1930's with marching bands and showgirl reviews. The Nazi's had a better filmmaker but the idea was the same.What accounts for all the foaming at the mouth over this book? During the 1950's, many academicians had an embarrassing and dangerous paper trail of bad ideas behind them. By the 1960's, since Mussolini and Hitler had been humiliatingly defeated, they were past history. Who cares? Castro, Guevara, Ho, and Mao were all the rage. Political theory classes became all about the professor's whimsy rather than a discipline.The result is that many speak about politics today with no knowledge or understanding of the origins of their ideas. When so confronted, they become enraged.To Goldberg's credit, he does not spare \\"conservatives\\" from his irony either. George W., Pat Buchanan have expressed ideas and programs that are essentially Liberal Fascism as well.Yesterday, I listened to a Los Angeles AM radio news station that purports to report business news. The stock market was down 50 points on top of other declines. The President was declaring a stimulus package. The host was breathlessly taking phone calls on what people should do with their stocks! What to do with that mortgage? How do we save our economy? Who is going to help us?Good grief. It occurred to me that not only does the media believe in Liberal Fascism but creating a panic boosts ratings and the government action gives them something \\"serious\\" with which to fill up their time. And if people are panicked into selling good assets at steep discounts, what is their freedom worth to them?Update: I had to allow some of the ideas in this book to percolate and give them some more thought. Jonah Goldberg makes a number of connections that were new to me. Most accounts I've read of the Progressive movement were favorable treatments. The Progressives were civic minded citizens cleaning up the corruption of the political parties and big industries. Most of these historical accounts are long on the practical reforms and there is no diminishing the importance of them in changing American politics(direct primary, initiative, referendum, local nonpartisanship.) But the intellectual influence on the Progressives of Nietzsche, Hegel, and Comte are not commonly discussed in these event driven narratives. From Nietzsche comes the idea that God is dead therefore conventional morality should be thrown out, from Hegel comes historicism or the idea that history is a march of progress, and from Comte comes the idea that society is like a giant machine and is suitable for social engineering. I oversimplify, of course, but all of them lead to the destruction of individual rights in favor of the power of the state.I was also not aware of the influence of William James and his ideas of pragmatism on Georges Sorel and later on Italian fascism. From James comes the idea of the will to believe, and when combined with Nietzsche's will to power becomes the basis for the big lie. This unaccountable naked power combined with an amoral regard for human rights and liberty along with delusions of inevitability led to much of the misery of the twentieth century.I knew of Woodrow Wilson's contempt for some aspects of our Constitution, but not the extent. The claim of the modern Democratic Party to be successors to the party of Jefferson is of course an intellectual fraud but that fraud didn't begin with Franklin Roosevelt. It began with Wilson. Wilson despised the separation of powers and now appears to have desired a living evolving constitution rather than one that limited the powers of government.Jonah Goldberg has written an important much needed book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Liberal Fascism is a very informative book that did indeed open my eyes to the progressive fascism of Woodrow Wilson and FDR, but reading felt like a nightmare that I could not wake up from.

Given Jonah's columns, which I read often, and the cover art on the book, I had assumed this would be right up my alley, since he is usually so concise and well thought out, expressing my thoughts well, without being dry or preachy. Boy, was I wrong.Jonah is a really smart guy, and I like him a lot, but this is not at all in the style of his columns. This is a textbook, and if you're looking for some easy talking points, you won't find them here.I tried to read this book, even when I discovered it to be so dry, because like a bad movie, I kept waiting for the good part. 4 months later, I'm only a third of the way through. I just can't make myself read it. It is genuinely a text book, and not at all written for the casual reader. There are plenty of good points in there, and if you were giving a lecture on the subject, this would be a handy reference guide, but nothing presented (at least in the first 3rd of the book) is usable in conversation with a non-believer.I already knew the basic premise of the book, and long ago had the same beliefs, but without proof, my son is not willing to listen to my \\"beliefs\\". I thought this would be the perfect gift for him, to help him see the light. Unfortunately, I can't give him a book I can't even get through - and I already care.I'm no dummy, and it's not that I can't grasp what he's saying, but frankly, I don't care that much. For those already in agreement, this is too much like work, and for those who don't believe the premise, they won't do this much work only to prove themselves wrong.

Once the linkage to fascism is understood, history supplies the ending for experimentation with this individual-crushing, subjugating form of politics.All forms of socialism are attractively deceptive in their philosophy. Those destined to be enslaved by this political policy, history shows, have stood in line, vying for position, to ultimately be fitted with their chains.This book will not stop societies from experimenting with the destructive philosophy of socialism, which seems to be an obvious shortcut to happiness. I can see why so many despise the positive reviews.It is well written, interesting, eye-opening, and dangerous to some. The dredging up of the term fascism certainly gives rise for concern and provides the hook for reading this book."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book was amazing. It provided great detail about the philosophical underpinnings of the various left-leaning movements of the twentieth century, tracing their origins back to the Romanticism of Rousseau, the social welfare programs of Bismarck, Marx, Engels and Nietzsche right up to the New Deal and the Great Society, to name just a few sources. Goldberg does a brilliant job showing that figures as disparate as Karl Marx, Woodrow Wilson, Mussolini, Hitler, FDR and Che Guevara were inspired by similar desires of transforming manking and society into something new and presumably superior to what had come before. The essence of all of these approaches is a totalitarian, utopian and well-meaning, but ultimately deeply flawed vision of the relationship between individuals and the collective, with the belief that the collective (the \\"fasces\\" is a bundle of twigs showing that unity is stronger than individualism) is better than the individual. He concludes that today's leftists seek a maternal form of fascism rather than the masculine, militaristic incarnation of Hitler. Goldberg succeeds in defining this newer, kinder version of fascism as \\"liberal fascism,\\" but at its root is the same vision of the state as being the source for the solutions to all of society's problems. He traces the essence of all leftward leaning ideologies as this belief in the ultimate goodness and supremacy of the state and the collective over the individual, in contrast to the belief of classicial liberalism in the importance and value of the individual and individual freedom, liberty and responsibility.Mind-boggling and highly recommended reading for all idological persuasions!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The book, Liberal Fascism, by Jonah Goldberg, takes off from the Introduction, and gives the reader a tour of history from the politics of war that has been insidiously woven into the American state of government.

I would recommend Amity Schlaes book, The Forgotten Man, a new vision of the great depression, especially the chapters on the NRA as further evidence of the fascism with a smiley face that the New Deal was.I recommend this book wholeheartedly.

(OBAMA)"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"In Liberal Fascism, Jonah Goldberg uses 400+ pages to mash onto our heads that 1) fascism, as originally defined in history (Mussolini's Italy, Nazi Germany), was not right-wing; 2) modern-day conservatism does not have its roots in said fascism; 3) contemporary liberals uses some political tools from the fascist toolbox; and 4) the modern Left's use of the word fascism to define anything they oppose has led many today to believe that right-wingers are fascist.He starts from the beginning, giving us the root of the word, the Italian fascio, which means bundle and was also used as a term for unions in Italy at the time of Mussolini. The word bundle here is significant because as Goldberg will demonstrate over the remaining pages, fascism of both the historical and liberal fashion tends to focus on grouping people together. With Mussolini, the focus was the Italian state, with Hitler, the German race, with Hillary Clinton, the \`village'. Central to Goldberg's point though is that both Mussolini and Hitler practiced left-wing politics, despite what modern left-wingers would have us believe. Then Goldberg proceeds to follow the historical path of this train of political thought, to show us how Wilson sympathized with Mussolini and FDR with Hitler, thus starting the fascist line within the United States, firmly within the left camp. He continues through the 60's, with JFK and LBJ, right through the Clintons and Obama.As a right-leaning independent, I was sympathetic to the premise and found it intriguing. But he didn't need 400+ pages to prove his point. I found the text to drag in many places. It seems he pulls every single Mussolini or Hitler sympathizer out of the closet, until the book almost turns into a boring list of people and anecdotes. He also makes some specious connections- for example, seeming to identify vegetarians with Nazism because Hitler was vegetarian- that irritated me.Still in the end, I think Goldberg proved his point. The history he outlines is pretty clear, and the similarities between the fascist and modern liberal techniques he cites are pretty convincing. An easy example is Rahm Emmanual's bragging about never letting a good crisis go to waste. Using crises to advance their polititical agenda was a common tactic of the fascists. And whatever you think of global warming (it's a real threat vs it's all BS)it's hard to argue that the left isn't using the crisis to advance it's political agenda, whether though higher taxes, more regulation, more intrusion on the lives of Americans, etc. As for the roots of fascism, I didn't think there was anyone who didn't know Mussolini was a socialist before his views evovled into what we now call fascism. Hitler's a little hazier to me. There seems to be evidence that he jumped back and forth on the political spectrum, but I beleive this to have more to do with the fact that he had no ideology but his own.Does it matter though? Does it matter if left-wingers call right-wingers fascists? I don't think it does. It's just another tag. I do think it matters that people are informed when politicians are trying to pull the wool over their eyes, and this book does educate some in that respect. It's important to know that when Democrats are being superficially benevolent, they are often practicing a \`nice' form of totalitarianism, and this is probably where Goldberg succeeds the most."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book is the history of what the author argues was the American fascism of 1913-21, 33-53, 61-69, 77-81 and 93-2001 - the Democratic Party.The author's best point is his criticism of Woodrow Wilson. As his record from the US entrance into World War I until the end of the Red Scare shows, he was not really a liberal figure at all and he is not an historical figure to admire.My only real surprise was not seeing Martin Luther King Jr. brutalized in the same manner as the other primary 20th century liberal heroes Theodore Roosevelt, Wilson, FDR, Kennedy, Johnson and Bill Clinton.The value of this work comes from its insight into the right-wing establishment's perception of its enemies in the 05-07 period, when Hillary Clinton was a target worthy of an entire 40 page chapter as well as being titled \\"the First Lady of Liberal Fascism\\" (328). Meanwhile, some guy named Barack Obama was a footnote worthy of a mere two sentences in the entire book (16, 322).

In the last chapter, the author admits that he is angry at the fact that liberals call him fascist. So he tries to point out that they themselves are fascist. Fascism is a form of dictatorship, and neither the Right or the Left are immune from it. Each sides accuses the other side of wanting to take away their freedoms, and of wanting to become the \\"dictator\\" of the US.Fascism and Nazis were anti-religious, just the same as communism, and the some powerful people on the current Left. But on the other hand, G-d fearing Christians were handing Jews over to the Nazis to be exterminated. During the Warsaw Ghetto uprising the good Christians were having Easter Mass.

Rather, consider a four-sided model composed of x and y axes, where the familiar left/liberal and right/conservative positions are flanked on the north and south by libertarian/individualist and authoritarian/collectivist positions.We can then account for the fact that both left and right can be guilty of so-called 'fascist' authoritarian/collectivist thinking in their ranks. We usually call it \\"totalitarian\\" when it occurs on the left, and \\"fascist\\" when it occurs on the right, for good reasons. Fascism was philosophically rooted in vitalism, rule by the physically better or stronger, where totalitarianism was supposed to be rule by the smarter or 'more rational'. So the right/fascist and left/totalitarian labels apply well to the distinctly different-flavored versions of collectivism on each side. Mr. Goldberg's argument then comes off as a pointless exercise in playground name-changing.I agree the fanatical left is rightfully deserving of strong criticism, but Mr. Goldberg seems to be saying nothing more than 'I know you are, but what am I?' in response to frustration at being called 'fascist'.

They are the idea that we should heighten our sense of nationhood and national belonging, being anti-conservatist, that is, to create an idealized way of looking at society from some mythic past, and brainwashing people into thinking a nation is under constant threat or crisis. In this regard, you can pretty much define ANY politician and political party as fascistic if you pick and choose your quotes properly. None of it adds up. It would be the 'liberal' equivalent of using John McCain's reference to remaining in Iraq for a hundred years as 'proof' he is a warmonger. Can you think of any or 'fascistic' remark that \\"If you're not with us, your against us\\" made by that avatar of rational thinking George Bush? In other words, you can make an argument that any political group is fascistic simply because the tenets of fascism are so broad. People who toss around the term fascist to label \\"Republicans\\" are no more cogent than those who use it to label \\"Democrats\\" and one could just as easily write a book about the former. One can twist the 'politics of meaning' in any direction one wants. It would be easy enough to write a book about how the term 'anti-semitism' has nothing to do with hating Jews because \\"Semites\\" are any group of people who originated in the Tigrus Valley region, not simply Jews. A little common sense, though, would see that such an argument is absurd just as the one typing liberals to fascists. I suspect the popularity of this book is mainly due to the author's penchant for using curse words and his conversational style. This is a good way to endear oneself to the general reader who can say, \\"Hey, here's a regular guy who is smart enough to write a book on politics.\\" Can you think of a truly serious book on political science that garners the sizeable audience this one does? They don't because such books don't have reductionist thinking, which means they would actually require the readers to a) have a thorough background in the subject matter, and b) research the issue for themselves to see the sources the author uses and be able to critique them--that's what the idea behind the practice of writing research papers in college.At one time, when discerning people understood the nature of propaganda, and the use of rhetorical devices, this book would be categorized as using 'strawman' technique. The Age of Enlightenment, that great era in history that gave us concepts such as reason, empiricism, rhetorical analysis, and the scientific method, seems to have been passed up by those who give this book glowing tributes.To graduate from college in the days of our founding fathers (I don't think there were too many founding mothers) required that one translate Greek to Latin and vice-versa. I suspect the true motive behind this book is that Goldberg is mad that he'll never get a chance to guest host Saturday Night Live. I think I'll write a book about the Republicans who fought against Franco during the Spanish Civil War to show how they are connected to the Republican party."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Truth can hurt, but needs to be told. I hope that more people will read this book before giving it bad reviews."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"\\"Liberal\\" is an adjective. When used to modify \\"fascism,\\" it distinguishes (relatively) \\"liberal fascism\\" from the more illiberal varieties practiced by Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco.Fascist unity may be imposed by the jackbooted stormtrooper, the sadistic Gestapo torturer, and the corrupt and tyrannical judge; or by the irritable feminist social worker, the competent and professional policeman, and the \\"Human Rights Commission.\\" This latter thing is what Goldberg (and leftist intellectual H.G. Wells, who used it to describe his own political program) means by \\"liberal fascism\\" (though Wells was no liberal in the classical sense, explicitly calling as he did for the extermination of dark-skinned races).Yes, the word \\"liberal\\" brings in certain overtones regarding current politics, but if you read the book, you'll see that they're well-justified.I think the one real problem with this very good book is Goldberg's failure, having conclusively placed fascism on the political left and convincingly argued that a more liberal fascism is still part of today's politics in both parties (but especially the Democrats), to recognize one of the outstanding examples of the \\"permanent crisis\\" mentality which he decries: the so-called \\"Global War on Terror,\\" which he mentions only obliquely, to brush off the suggestion that it might be a fascist project in the way lefties love to caricature it. This is surely true, but it seems to fit just fine into Goldberg's liberal-fascist model.The \\"War on Terror\\" mentality originated as a genuine and understandable reaction to the shock of the 9/11 attacks. By the time it became clear that it was an *over*reaction and that we were not really going to fight a global war against a bunch of third-world barbarians and their sponsors, the thing had taken on a life of its own. Too many people were intellectually, politically, and emotionally invested in the idea of a new world war.\\"This is *our* generation's great task,\\" we are told, as if it's a good and normal thing for an entire generation to share a task. When confronted with the fact that this \\"world war\\" seems to be limited to futzing around in Afghanistan and Iraq for year after year, we are told that this is a \\"long war.\\" The populist right uses the \\"war\\" to brand opponents as \\"traitors.\\" The respectable right prefers \\"defeatists.\\"All this seems to me a near-perfect example of the \\"permanent crisis\\" model. In some ways it is an even better example than World Wars I and II. In those, as Goldberg himself points out, we were stuck with enemies who had something to say about when the war would end. This \\"war\\" will last until some US president says its over, which is probably about the same time he will announce the end of the \\"War on Poverty\\" and the \\"War on Drugs.\\" It isn't just a \\"long war\\": it's a permanent war.Fortunately, the fact that we kind of stumbled into it has kept the fascist aspects of the thing from becoming too oppressive. When the president's first war directive is, \\"Go shopping,\\" you're not exactly in Wilson/FDR territory, let alone Mussolini/Hitler territory. Still, the fact that so many people have acquiesced in the idea of a \\"long war\\"--especially conservatives, who should reflexively oppose such stuff--is very disturbing, and suggests that Goldberg's fears about creeping liberal fascism on the right are well-founded, even if he fails to see the best example.Perhaps when President Hillary begins to see the opportunities afforded a good Progressive by a permanent state of war, the thing will become more obvious."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Writers who seek to encourage division among citizens are destructive to a strong democracy.

I will give one example. In a review of Liberal Fascism, the author from the Claremont Institute repeated without scrutiny the claim that Nietzsche was a 'great advocate of state power'. Anyone who is at all familiar with the writings of Nietzsche will know that this is clearly false. One need only read Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Part 1, 'On the New Idol' in which he castigates the state as a beast which destroys peoples and cultures. Such a mistake shows that these people really do not know what they are talking about and are indeed engaged in merely superficial propoaganda."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"In the fifties there were many attempts to link Communism and Fascism with phrases such as 'Red Fascism' gaining traction in the US but not really anywhere else in the English speaking world.

The type of flawed logic at work reminds me of the examples of bad syllogisms given to us in high school : Communists are in favour of chjld labour laws, the Pope is in favour of child labour laws, therefore the Pope is a communist. .

How could supposedly intelligent people hate this great country and not only root for its destruction, but work towards actively towards it? Why are liberals so pretentious and closed-minded? Why do I, as a person born towards the end of the Baby Boom, have so little in common with people like the Clintons, John Kerry and others whose only goal is the destruction of what I hold dear?In Liberal Fascism, Jonah Goldberg explains it all to me (and to you.) What an awesome book, not to mention that it has the best cover of the year. Yes, it's a little slow in spots and yes, he stretches the occasional analogy a bit too thin. But overall, this is an immensely readable survey of the evil that is modern liberalism, and how it got to be that way.

As \\"Liberal Fascism\\" correctly argues this is the basis of Fascism - and also the basis of much of modern \\"liberalism\\" (in this \\"liberalism\\" has changed its meaning by almost 180 degrees in modern times - liberalism used to mean rolling back government control, but it has come to mean rolling it forward).That Fascism was about state control (especially of economic life) is not a difficult point and it was admitted by the Fascists (such as Mussolini) themselves. But there are still many people who seem unable to grasp it - hence the need for Mr Goldberg's book.For example, Mr Mann of the Washington Post, in his review of \\"Liberal Fascism\\", defines Fascism as being on the side of \\"capital\\" against \\"labor\\" - this is in fact a MARXIST definition of \\"Fascism\\" (which would not have been accepted by the Fascists themselves - for example it is hard to see Mussolini, a leading ex Marxist in Italy and editor of the Communist newspaper, following such a docrtine) indeed even such terms \\"capital\\" (by which Mr Mann means employers) are used by Mr Mann in a Marxist way. This is not to say that Mr Mann is a Marxist - but he is using Marxist tools of thought (a Marxist ideological frame of reference), and that makes it impossible for him to grasp what Mr Goldberg's book is about.Given his false perspective it is understandable that Mr Mann does not understand Mr Goldberg's book. What is harder to understand is why Amazon presented the review of Mr Mann as so important - a review by a man who (because of his ideological perspective) is incapable of understanding what the most basic starting point of \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is.Perhaps if Mr Mann has read such works as F.A. Hayek's \\"Road to Serfdom\\" and Ludwig Von Mises' \\"Omnipotent Government\\" (as Mr Goldberg clearly has) about the ideological origins of such collectivist movements as Fascism and German National Socialism, then he would be able to understand Mr Goldberg's book. It is actually straight forward for ordinary person to understand - but then most ordinary people do not have the \\"benefit\\" of the sort of \\"education\\" that a senior person with the Washington Post is likely to have recieved."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Starts out like a thesaurus to define what Fascism is and isn't. The chapters show the sociological development of liberal history and influences, pointing out the tendency of the liberal left to disinherit the very movements that define the left, while attributing fascist name-calling to the conservatives who oppose fascist doctrines. Liberal Fascism is often packed with historical references, illuminating the Left's embarrassing history. It isn't easy to read, though it seems immaculately researched. It seems too erudite to reach an Obama audience. Even after you read it, there is so much information, you'll just get a taste of the deceptive tactics practiced by Liberals, but there is so much information, it's a challenge to assimilate a portion. It isn't the kind of book you can speed through and absorb much of what's going on. The slight of hand the liberal left uses to assign most of their history and founding principles of progressivism as if conservatives laid claim to fascism, but it's a pattern that doesn't go away today. The same way a thief has no trust for anyone else, liberals constantly accuse their opponents of the tactics and prejudices that are standard fare in the liberal playbook. Much of the confusion arises from the warped policy that supports fringe policy, eugenics, fetus murder, race, gender, and identity politics; along with the tendency to paint their opponents as villains. They aren't obligated to play by rules or be guided by ethical principles in attack mode.Goldberg covers the gamut of history and methods. He presents counter-arguments and gives credit where typecasting might get carried away. As a general rule he doesn't label everyone on the left as fascists, but he outlines the ways liberals stand on the shoulders of fascist movements trying to paint anyone who disagrees with their way of thinking as fascist. Goldberg frequently reminds that the fascism of today wears a smiley-face, unlike Nazi, Mussolinist and Stalinist regimes, or even the heavy-handed tactics of Wilson and FDR of the past century. He says, \\"If there is ever a fascist takeover in America, it will come not in the form of storm troopers kicking down doors but with lawyers and social workers saying, \`I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'\\""},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Amazing to think this hasn't been put down on paper ever.

Of course, it has never made sense to equate conservatives with fascists, as today's liberals are much closer in ideology, but it is great to read a thorough, scholarly treatment of the subject, which does a great job of dispelling the confusing myths surrounding left-wing / right-wing ideologies. Modern liberals will have a hard time with this book, as it clearly shows what I would think would be a very uncomfortable pedigree for their ideology. The truth really hurts sometimes!I think the book's most valuable contribution is in identifying the kind of thinking that led to the last century's horrible crimes against humanity.

I heard a friend was reading it and I wanted to join her. Goldberg has redeemed himself in my eyes, much to his relief I'm sure.This book connected the following truisms for me:Truism #1: everyone wants a meaningful existence.Truism #2: all government power comes out of the end of a gun.The age-old struggle begins when people think #2 (coercion) is a good way to get all of us to #1 (a meaningful life). But just like there's a world of difference between a wink and a blink, there's all the difference there is between deciding for yourself what to do and someone else deciding for you and making you do it, even if the outcomes are prit' near the same. From the Progressives, through the New Deal, the New Frontier, the Great Society and yes, even compassionate conservatism, generation after generation of Americans forget our power-skeptic heritage and are seduced by the Big Plans of Experts.Visualize the following scenario: I want a clean house. It's better for me to train my kids how to clean a toilet and then stand over them while they do it. For someone else, it's better to hire a cleaning lady. I say, vive la difference. However, the government could see fit to hire (at taxpayer expense) an efficiency expert to find THE BEST way to clean houses (which no doubt will not be the way eleven-year-olds with tyrannical mothers do it). There will be a public \\"Clean! Don't be mean!\\" campaign encouraging full employment of cleaning ladies and discouraging ruining children's childhoods with Saturday-morning drudgery. There will be studies linking Ty-Dee-Bowl fumes and ADHD. As a result of studies, I will be provided a government cleaning lady. Of course my taxes will rise in order to pay for this wonderful entitlement. Then I will have to go get a job to cover my family's increased tax burden, but hey, at least someone else will be cleaning my toilets. And that makes me happy, doesn't it?My example may be silly, but Goldberg is saying that like the devil, tyranny must appear attractive because otherwise nobody would go for it. Totalitarianism will arrive wearing a smile on its face.Query: on p. 30 Goldberg mentions \\"Ernest Hemingway was skeptical of Mussolini almost from the start.\\" Good old Papa!

Goldberg defines his terms: FASCISM: \\"Fascism is a religion of the state. It assumes the organic unity of the body politic and longs for a national leader attuned to the will of the people. It is TOTALITARIAN in that it views everything as political and holds than any action by the state is justified to achieve the common good.\\" (p. 23). LIBERAL FASCISM: \\"In this book, I have argued that modern liberalism is the offspring of twentieth-century progressivism, which in turn shares intellectual roots with European fascism...In the United States, the movement known elsewhere as fascism or Nazism took the form of progressivism--a softer form of totalitarianism that, while still nationalistic, and militarist in its crusading forms and outlook, was more in keeping with American culture. It was, in short, a kind of liberal fascism.\\" (p. 390). \\"For another, arguing that progressives were a product of their time simply reinforces my larger argument: Progressivism was born of the fascist movement and has never faced up to its inheritance.\\" (p. 254).REDUCTIO AD HITLERUM is a common liberal tactic of today. (p. 244). Very many things usually attributed to conservatism or fascism are not unique to them. Bismarck's Kulturkampf was liberal. (p. 362). Anti-Semitism was not characteristic of fascism: early Italian fascism was hardly anti-Semitic (p. 62), and Communism became anti-Semitic. (p. 75). Nationalism is not invariably right-wing unless one considers Castro, Pol Pot, Guevara, etc., as right-wingers. (p. 71). Militarism was championed, in the early 20th century, not only by fascists, but also by Communists and the western democracies. (p. 5, 106). The German exceptionalism under Nazism can be compared with some forms of Afrocentrism today. (p. 65). Also, \\"As a result, the Nazis played the same games against the Jews that today's left plays against \`Eurocentrism', \`whiteness', and \`logocentrism.'\\" (p. 368). The eugenics movement was not conservative but liberal in that it was squarely based on the perfectibility of society by government action, and was supported by many socialists. (p. 249). The restrictions against freedom under McCarthyism were dwarfed compared with those earlier enacted by the progressive President Woodrow Wilson. (pp. 113-114).As for the rise of Nazism in Germany, \\"What cannot be overestimated is that German students were first and foremost rebelling against the CONSERVATISM of both German higher education and the older generation's \`bourgeoisie materialism.'\\" (p. 168). The much-mythologized corporate support for Hitler was virtually absent in the 1920's, and later tended to follow Hitler's successes (p. 58, 288-289). Also, \\"The fascist bargain goes something like this. The state says to the industrialist, \`You may stay in business and own your factories. In the spirit of cooperation and unity, we will even guarantee you profits and a lack of serious competition. In exchange, we expect you to agree with--and help implement--our political agenda.'\\" (p. 290). Goldberg's quip is priceless: \\"In reality, if you define \`right-wing' or \`conservative' in the American sense of supporting the rule of law and the free market, then the more right-wing a business is, the less fascist it becomes.\\" (pp. 285-286).Other misconceptions are corrected. The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was liberal in the sense that it supported many reformist and progressive policies. (p. 259). Contrary to Sinclair's JUNGLE, meatpackers actually favored government inspection of meat (because it favored selling their products and it handicapped smaller producers.) (p. 291). Father Coughlin was no rightist intellectual grandfather of Rush Limbaugh: Coughlin favored government interventionism over free enterprise, essentially deifying the New Deal. (e. g., p. 138). Pre-WWII American isolationists included liberals, not just conservatives. (p. 157).Some have argued that the progressive programs enacted by the likes of Bismarck, the European fascists, and the American New Deal were simply tactical moves designed to head-off Communist revolutions. Consider Bismarck. His progressive policies were groundbreaking and far-reaching--so unique that they inspired many socialist policy makers (p. 263). They were clearly far more than would be expected as a mere concession to pacify the masses. Goldberg comments: \\"Bismarck's \`top-down socialism,' which delivered the eight-hour workday, health care, social insurance, and the like, was the gold standard for enlightened social policy.\\" (p. 95).The European fascists favored a large number of socially-progressive policies. (e. g., see p. 46). The connection between Nazi policies and those of the New Deal were not superficial or incidental. In fact, the connection was widely celebrated at the time. (p. 123). In any case, according to Goldberg, whatever the caveats were behind the policies in question, they do not nullify his thesis, but actually reinforce it: \\"The German and American New Deals may have been merely whatever Hitler and FDR felt they could get away with. But therein lies a common principal: the state SHOULD be allowed to get away with anything, so long as it is for \`good reasons.' That is the common principle among fascism, Nazism, Progressivism, and what we today call liberalism.\\" (p. 131).Goldberg compares the culture war in Nazi Germany with the more recent one in the U.S. He comments: \\"In 1935, mandatory prayer in school was abolished, and in 1938 carols and Nativity plays were banned entirely. By 1941 religious instruction for children fourteen years and up had been abolished altogether and Jacobinism ruled supreme...In like manner, the American Kulturkampf of the 1960s begins not with the hippies, the Vietnam War, or even civil rights. As befits an attempt to clear the way for a new political religion, it starts with the effort to eliminate prayer in school.\\" (p. 365)."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The past is prelude to the present. The same Marxist-socialist strategies developed by Lenin and Trotsky and exported around the world were used by statists to create Italian socialism, Nazi socialism, Chinese socialism, and the march of socialism in dozens of Third World countries from WW2 until today. I was surprised to realize that American socialism owed more to the Mussolini model than it does to the Hitler-Nazi model. I was not surprised by the constant, consistent, and profound influence of the Soviet KGB in building levels upon levels of subsersive cells and front groups. More modern expressions of this true religion are found in the works of archetypical community organizer, Sal Alinsky, and those budding or experienced agitators in his orbit. The guidelines of how to destroy a democratic country by using its own democratic institutions against it are seen being used today in places like Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, the stolen elections in Iran, and even here in the United States. Hillary Clinton wrote a fawning disseration of the glories of Alinsky for her masters degree. She evidently learned her evil \\"politics of personal destruction\\" from her socialist saint Sal. Obama is highly familiar with his work, and taught aspects of it to other would-be community agitators as an adjunct college professor. Every American should read this easy-to-digest history of the creeping, or perhaps we should say, charging socialism occurring around the world and in our own country, over decades of deception and lies, under cover of closed doors, secret meetings, bills that \\"have to be passed so we can see what's in them\\" (to quote Speaker Pelosi), the Orwellian \\"transparency\\" of the White House and its many czars of dubitable reputation and concealed backgrounds. Read Goldberg's book to become aware of the dangers around us. Another good book to read is \\"Blacklisted by History,\\" by M. Stanton Evans, who details the historic infiltration of the U.S. government by Communists and Soviet spies during World War 2 and the early 1950's. It's time Americans learn to pay attention to those little men \\"behind the curtains.\\" They are not wizards, but they can certainly perform the magic trick of making the audience think they're not really there (as with the profoundly effective destruction of Sen. Joe McCarthy, who turns out to have been right all along). As Jonah Goldberg warns us--the Left cares nothing for truth, human welfare, anyone's political rights, and least of all, for America's most precious founding documents and its sacred Constitution. They falsely swear their oaths of allegiance to it, but their actual approach is based on doing whatever is necessary to lie, cheat, and steal their way into power over the rest of us \\"unenlightened hicks\\" from the \\"flyover states.\\" Read and heed Jonah Goldberg's warnings, before it is too late for America."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I have purchased and read this important book. Goldberg correctly depicts fascism as a cocept and tool deployed by the left and not the right. In its most diabolical form it was deployed by such believers in nationalism and socialism as Mussolini, Hitler, Peron, Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Castro in Utopean dreams to improve mankind. True believers were and are motivated by a desire to impose their own preferences in order to perfect the nature of man, to collectivise mankind in pursuit of nationalist, imperialist, often racist goals, and to organize individuals into malevolent public and private assocviations designed to override the economic discipline of free markets. Liberal fascism is defined by Goldberg as a softer but no less evil brand of the same product, pursued in the United States by progressives of the left, epitomized by Woodrow Wilson, FDR, Lyndon Johnson, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, in direct attacks on the United States Constitution and the laissez-faire basis of its market economy. Any person who is concerned to defend property rights, individual freedom, limited government and the rule of law should look to the right, not to the left to support him in this ideal. Goldberg's book is courageous and effective in outlining the true nature of fascism as the definition of the American Left since the early twentieth century.Charles Rowley, Duncan Black Professor of Economics at George Mason University, and co-author of Economic Contractions in the United States: A Failure of GovernmentEconomic Contractions in the United States: A Failure of Government"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a brilliant, well-written book that makes you envy the erudition of the author. As a long-time National Review subscriber, I can be accused of a conservative bias but this well-researched book clarified in my own mind what a fascist really is. And it ain't 21st Century conservatives whose highest value is freedom. Sure, we believe in the rule of law but we are also suspicious of the all-powerful state, which President Obama is obviously building.Goldberg traces the roots of fascism back to Mussolini who in retrospect seems to be very close to the liberals in power today. Then he follows up with an examination of the American progressives in the early half of the 20th Century, which I found very interesting, never having studied that period. It seems Silent Cal Coolidge was an oddity back then with his credo, \\"The business of America is business.\\" He was overshadowed by Presidents Wilson and the two Roosevelts who obviously believed that the nanny state was the ideal and they vigorously set out to overturn the republic established by our founding fathers. It is obvious that President Barack Obama wants to continue their efforts in a blind, ultimately disastrous, drive to remake our society.Context is important and I recommend every concerned American read this book. It traces the seeds, dare we call them Acorns?, of the totalitarianism that is looming today, thanks to a party and a president who are forcing us all to reeducate ourselves to the real meaning and source of fascism today.

I knew Johan Goldberg tends toward the partisan but I heard a lot of good stuff about the book and figured it'd be worth the read.Regardless of your political persuasion I think you'd have to admit that if nothing else, the author does a really thorough job trying to back up his points. He takes a strong academic tone with his premises and puts a lot of effort into backing up his contentions.Perhaps the most important aspect of the book though is his explanation as to why he wrote it. There's no doubt many people throw 'Fascist' out any time they disagree with someone politically. A lot of the time it ends up being little more than petty name calling. He points out that there's no universally accepted definition of fascism. Many definitions are merely historical descriptions which render them meaningless when used in any sort of modern context. Others focus on the characteristics of fascist movements in general which affords them more relevance when used to describe current events.I had always been of the impression that Fascism was a right-wing phenomenon and that's always what I had learned in high school and college. While reading the opening chapters, I put a lot of energy into double checking his claims b/c they were contrary to what I had always believed to be true. I definitely found a lot to be said for the contention that early progressives shared a lot of affinity for fascist principles. And I also think that his point that traditional fascists had a lot more in common with the current left than the current right.Outside of pointing out that the word is used so commonly yet there's no remotely universal definition, the other really eye opening point was with respect to the Reds and the Browns. He contends that philosophically, they were idealogically very similar. But inner group animosity was strong and when fascists got a bad name worldwide, the Reds didn't want associated with them lest it hurt the cause. So they branded fascism as a right wing phenomenon - b/c they essentially didn't want the pr hit. I don't know that I was completely convinced of this particular argument, but he makes a decent case for it and it was not something I had considered before.Throughout the book though, he constantly illustrates fascists in their own words, and then asks essentially \\"Who does this sound more like today? The people who get called fascists or the people who are doing the name calling, i.e. the right or the left\\"? (Other than Right wingers calling a certain group the Islamofascists, I don't see the charge of fascist coming out of right wing circles that often. [I will say though that if Fascism was definitely a leftist philosophy, I would expect the RIght to point it out more, and I don't see that too often.]). Most of the time, even though I find it a little uncomfortable, I have to admit that it does seem that the modern left seems to behave more in line with the traditional fascists than the right does. And I definitely hear many libertarians called fascists by some on the left, and I don't see anything substantive in common with modern libertarians and fascists {many libertarians are anti-war, want lower taxes, less regulation, private gun ownership, stronger property rights}. If you take the Hawks and Religious Right out of the mix, I see virtually nothing in common with the modern right and the traditional fascists.Before I read this book , I never really looked though. I'm always cautious when I read one book and then start to completely rethink something I've believed all of my life. I will always ask myself if I'm just being swayed by some clever arguments. So I will look around and do further investigation... and keep looking until I'm comfortable one way or the other about the issue(s). So far, pretty much everything I'm finding makes me believe more and more than Goldberg is right and I've been wrong all this time. And while my mind isn't made up yet, it's definitely leaning strongly in that direction.-----As a side note (and I say this about both sides...), if an author's point is really weak, then why not just point out where he's wrong. Pointing out for instance that Goldberg's mother got him his job (I honestly don't know if it's true or not, I've just seen that down in the Tags) doesn't disprove any of his points, so why rebut him with such comments if his material is clearly so wrong? Branding someone a Moonbat, Wingnut or whatever will certainly convince some closed minded people to ignore what they have to say, but it's doubtful it will convince anyone but the already convinced. Reasoned and substantiated arguments would go a lot further to winning over people who are still making up their minds. But too many on both sides are too intellectually lazy to do that - name calling is so much easier."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg's Liberal Fascism is a highly intelligent book that chronicals the history of Fascism from Mussolini and Hitler, to FDRS New Deal, LBJs Great Society and finally, to today's Left who's intentions are good, but who's effects, well, not so much.Throughout the book he consistently stresses that he does not feel Liberals are bad people, and that non-Liberals good people. He also stresses that being called a Fascist does not make you like Hitler. To be fair, Goldberg is a Conservative, and he is clear that he believes his Conservative values are best suited for this country. To his credit, through the use of facts, he makes a pretty good arguement as well. As I read this, it seemed to me his goal was simply to explain what Fascism is, how it has been unfairly and incorrectly pushed off as \\"right-wing\\" and in the end, what the repercussions of a Fascist \\"Nanny State\\" will have on our country. His final chapters focus on society in the USA today, and how such things as going \\"green\\" and welfare are not only Fascistic, but can have very negative ramifications on the economy, as well as on the people they propose to help.Regardless of your political affinity, if you are interested in history, and how it impacts the world today, you will likely find this book interesting. Finally, Goldberg's writing style is highly engaging, making this a quick and entertaining read.In my opinion, Goldberg has written a very important book that should be read by anyone intending on voting in the next election."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Not yet done but love the book, a great uncovering of the dirty little secrets of the dogmatic \\"liberal\\" left and its origins"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This extraordinary book offers the most complete and well researched history of Fascism over the past century and into the present day. This documented history blows away the myth that Fascism is a right wing movement and shows how this myth was devised originally by the communists to separate themselves from Hitler's Germany. This idea has survived today through the efforts of leftists and communists who want to disassociate themselves with the tactics of the third Reich. However, on closer examination, Goldberg makes the case that rather than being opposites, Communism and Fascism are close cousins. When you omit the Holocaust and the millions of murders committed under Hitler's Fascistic rule, you find that the socialism that Hitler expounded and the tactics he used were simply mirrored from the Communist rule under Stalin. In fact, untold numbers of individuals were murdered, starved, and imprisoned under the Soviet dictator but not nearly as much attention has been paid to those atrocities as with Hitler's.Goldberg breaks the common belief that Fascism has always been reviled in America. This is far from the truth. Fascism (along with communism) was actually admired back in the thirties and Mussolini, the father of the movement was admired by many. Even Hitler was admired at first, and only during and after the war and the atrocities exposed, was Hitler seen for the evil that he was and only then was Fascism seen as corrupt, racist, and totally evil form of government. On the other hand, the far left has never demonized the communists as they have the nazis. But communist dictators like Castro, Chavez, and Mao were all cut from the same cloth as Hitler.Most on the far left, would never admit that the tactics they used in the sixties were the very same used in Hitler's Germany. In fact the hippies of the sixties were nothing new. Italy had their own hippies in the twenties, and Germany their own in the thirties. The youth revolt, the rejection of their parents values, the call for unity, elevation of the common good, and violence, perpetuated in the effort to remake society for the better. All these have their roots in Socialist movements whether in Stalin's Russia, Mussolini's Italy or Hitler's Germany. The rejection of God and the move to replace Him with the State is common to all far left movements including Hitler's Germany.The right calls for small government, individual responsibility, low taxes, and respect for traditional values such as religion, respect for parents and authority. The right believes in rewarding hard work, and encouraging entrepreneurial enterprise, not penalizing success with high taxes and redistributing the wealth. The propaganda machine that has us believe that Fascism is a movement of the right just doesn't fit with the facts.If you are interested in historical truth, and want to understand what is going on inside the far left today from the perspective of history, there is no better book than Jonah Goldberg's book, Liberal Fascism."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"If the average leftist were to merely read the title of Jonah Goldberg's new best selling book they'd likely think it was just another \\"right-wing rant\\" that seeks to point out what is obvious to so many conservatives and libertarians; Leftists (\\"liberals\\" or \\"progressives\\") are Fascists (!). Assuming from the title that Goldberg's book deals with this issue simply and without supporting historical facts would be a mistake.The Term \\"Fascism\\" is, of course, tossed around a lot when leftists seek to brand anyone's ideas they disagree with as unworthy of acknowledgment. But, can the right legitimately use the \\"F\\" word when describing the left...? Yes, they can and should because, as Goldberg thoroughly proves, they'd be correct in doing so.Although the author does not intend his book to be taken as scholarly or academic, it is indeed just that. A rich array of facts from the French Revolution and America's so-called \\"Progressive Era\\" through the present, that details and proves beyond a reasonable doubt that today's \\"liberalism\\" is a kindred spirit to fascism (and no, it is not hyperbole to say this).People like myself have known for some time now that Mussolini was a follower of Marx to his dying days. We know too that NAZI stood for National Socialist German Worker's Party. We've looked with warranted suspicion upon the philosophies articulated under the label \\"post-modern\\" and have realized that the philosophers who most influenced Nazis and Fascists are the same ones with the same ideals that have influenced and motivated the \\"revolutions\\" of the left.Those who have some genuine knowledge of the left and its beliefs know that Fascism, Nazism, Communism, and a wide variety of socialisms have a great deal in common with each other. No matter how heretical they may see each other, their common enemy has first and foremost always been free, open, pluralistic, non-utopian, capitalist society.As a former secondary school history teacher I can testify to the skewed themes and \\"information\\" that classrooms and textbooks have sought to inculcate in youth. So it is that the very words \\"progressive\\" or \\"liberal\\" have come to mean good, caring, loving, kind, and humanistic. An accurate inquiry into the history of leftism however finds it all too often to mean, racist, nationalistic, militaristic, authoritarian, and anti-individualistic -- fascist. The average high school student is told to read Upton Sinclair's, \\"The Jungle\\" and is told of the wonderful things \\"Progressives\\" did to \\"protect us\\" from ourselves...but, how often is the term eugenics associated with \\"progressivism,\\" as it should be?Goldberg's book is not a pedestrian conservative attack on the left, it's a very informative, interesting, and richly discerning inquiry into the history of authoritarian political movements and the psychological motivations that drive them. If one seeks a good overview of the philosophy of various \\"isms\\" that have sought to wrest control of the individual from his or herself for the glories of collectivist and state power, this is the best book I've seen on the subject.Goldberg's, \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is long overdue and provides depth and honesty to the issues of history, political philosophy, and culture."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book is like a great mystery novel.

Ta da! Again, so right!I came into this reading already with the understanding that fascism grew out of socialism, and that fascism's creators and initial firm believers were fanatical socialists. But to read the fawning of American socialists who loved what they saw in the heyday of European fascism was chilling.Also chilling? I'm too young to have heard about the Weathermen and its soldiers.

Of course, pigs should fly."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Several conservative commentators have observed that left-wing politics has its basis in the idea that all (perceived) human needs can be satisfied. The conservative, on the other hand, intuitively understands that desires and obligations may be inherently conflicting --- sometimes even tragically so. Left-wing politics centers on a belief (statolatry) that the power of the state can and should be extended to the point where the (perceived) needs of all in society can be maximally satisfied. This faith in Progress, with a capital \`P', according to Goldberg's thesis, is definitive of the left; its absence is equally definitive of the right. This understanding is however at odds with the ways in which the terms \`left' and \`right' are used in everyday political parlance, and Goldberg seeks in this book to realign debate with the proper understanding of the terms.In addition to socialism, social democracy and communism, Goldberg's definition of the left also includes \`centre' or \`Third Way' liberalism and, most controversially, fascism or national socialism. (Goldberg uses \`national socialism' without capitals to refer to a family of related creeds combining a socialist platform and nationalism. Used in this way, \`national socialism' is a synonym for \`fascism'. German National Socialism, or Nazism, was of course additionally characterized by aggressive anti-Semitism, but this is not a feature of all, or even most, groups whose politics can be described as both nationalist and socialist.) Goldberg nevertheless shows that these movements share an ideological commitment to the state as well as a common history. (This idea was earlier developed in the work of the remarkable Austrian thinker Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, whom Goldberg regrettably omits to mention. The Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau occupies a central place in the thought of both as intellectual primus motor of the Left.)Consider, for example, that Benito Mussolini started out as Italy's most prominent socialist, before he rejected the internationalist Marxist-Leninist interpretation of socialism in favor of a nationalist one, and founded the fascist movement. In 1920's Germany, red and brown factions supported by paramilitary groups vied murderously to achieve domination of the same constituency. It is from the bloody rivalry between socialists faithful to the internationalist interpretation, and heterodox nationalists, that the popular present-day usage of the term \`right-wing' derives. Stalin labeled as \`rightist' anyone whose socialism did not entail loyalty to Moscow (which, for Stalin, came to include Leon Trotsky). In many ways, popular usage follows his lead today. This flawed understanding is a source of endless paradox and deception. The absurd identification of eugenics with the right fails to square with the conservative stance on abortion, or with the fact that social democratic countries Norway and Sweden practiced, until the 1970s, enforced sterilization of patients suffering certain forms of mental impairment. And when the facts fail to jive with cherished conceptions, truth is the first casualty. Think of media portrayals of the present day Ku Klux Klan. A quintessentially conservative rural movement, right? The inconvenient truth, that it is a largely cosmopolitan \`progressive' phenomenon, originating as a fan club of D. W. Griffith's film The Birth of a Nation, with its white supremacist take. It was the highest grossing film of the silent era.It is not hard to understand why these perverse equations endure, although it is no less regrettable for that. In the wake of the Holocaust, Nazism became petrified in public opinion as the ultimate expression of human evil. The \`right-wing' label stuck. It is an enduring tragedy of the Second World War and the post-war period that only a few souls have had the bravery and honesty to penetrate the cloak of taboos surrounding Nazism to try and really understand the connection between the war's unique horrors and the system of beliefs and attitudes that created the conditions that allowed them transpire --- beliefs and attitudes that are not only alive today, according to Goldberg, but at the most fundamental level part of the mainstream. Behind the widespread caricatures of Nazi evil, the essential nature of Nazism and Fascism remain widely misunderstood.Before the War, things were all very different. National Socialism and Fascism were widely regarded not only as benign, but as models to be emulated by progressive politicians like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose New Deal was sufficient proof to Mussolini that the American president was \\"on side\\". Goldberg skillfully lays bare the parallels between the national socialist political systems of Europe and several US administrations with profound and lasting influence on the history of the West. Woodrow Wilson's war socialism brought with it unprecedented violations of civil liberties and free speech, and the first propaganda ministry in world history. John Kennedy too presided over one of the most militaristic and nationalistic periods in US history. Lyndon Baines Johnson was FDR's direct ideological successor.Democrats figure predominantly, but by no means exclusively, amongst America's \`friendly fascists'. An important lesson that emerges from this book is that it is impossible to equate the Republican vs. Democrat dimension with the opposition Right vs. Left, properly understood in terms of the role of the state. Goldberg argues several leading republicans have succumbed to the progressive temptation, including Pat Buchanan, John McCain, and George W. Bush who, as a \\"compassionate conservative\\", presided over significant increases in health and education spending during his incumbency. Interestingly, Goldberg is supportive of the Bush administration's commitment to bringing Western-style democracy to the world, which might explain his silence on the question of the ideological connections between the neo-cons in Bush's administration and the radical left, where several prominent neo-cons started out their political lives. Ronald Reagan, however, emerges as a genuinely conservative liberal figure.One of the most pernicious myths bequeathed us from the first half of the Twentieth Century is the notion that fascism and national socialism are uniquely bourgeois in origin, in collusion with or a direct expression of capitalism in its dying phase. The myth was shaped and propagated by doctrinaire Marxist-Leninists, perhaps partly because they stood to lose most from fascist gains, but also because Marxist-Leninist theory was unable to accommodate national socialism within the simple dichotomy of capitalist exploiter and oppressed proletariat. If national socialism could not be construed as working towards the international socialist revolution, the logic of the theory leaves only the interpretation that it was a manifestation of capitalism. This myth has gone on to become a received wisdom in the media, the film industry, in academia (except, of course, scholars that actually specialize in the subject). In Germany at least, the support of big business for the Nazis came after the fact of Hitler's political success, and then it was motivated by opportunism, not ideology. And yet, the ahistorical, ideologically motivated equation of big business interest and \`the (quasi-)fascist right wing' (as popularly understood) persists to our day.There is indeed significant collusion between government and business, and this is the subject of much critique, from liberals, certainly, but also from true conservatives. Goldberg writes (p. 290) \\"Many liberals are correct when they bemoan the collusion of government and corporations. [...] What they misunderstand completely is that this is the system they set up. This is the system they want. This is the system they mobilize and march for.\\" The de facto collusion of governments and corporations is an emergent by-product rather than ideologically motivated, however. Because regulations are so costly to implement, small businesses end up being punished for the reason they can't afford lawyers to negotiate the regulations or lobbyists to represent their interests to the regulating bodies. The increased regulation so favored by liberals ends up rewarding big business and promoting the collusive pattern of government by proxy by large corporations. Liberals fail to grasp the connection, and the collusion takes on the complexion of a conspiracy. The truth, though, is more prosaic.All left-wing movements, according to Goldberg, have an emphasis on mobilization against a common enemy. Socialism may come naturally in times of war, but in peacetime, left wing groups must find a \`modern equivalent of war'. The pretext for mobilization, whether it is poverty, the environment, patriarchy, perceived oppression of one kind or another, varies depending on the place and time. However it manifests itself, the author discerns in the endless quest for action a profound sense of ennui. And anyone who cannot or will not march to the beat will be vulnerable. Because the left-wing reasons using an alphabet of defined groups (\`the nation', \`the ethnic group', \`humanity', \`women', and so on), discrimination is an inherent, reflexive feature of left-wing politics. And for Goldberg mainstream liberalism too \\"is joined at the hip with racial and sexual identity groups of one kind or another\\".Goldberg devotes attention to parallels between our own obsessions and those of Nazi Germany. The parallels are disturbing: vegetarianism and organic food, environmentalism, paganism and New Age spirituality, hatred of Christianity, language hygiene and \`political correctness', technological and managerial solutions. If some of these sound contradictory, I can thoroughly recommend Irving Babbitt's Rousseau and Romanticism for an insightful treatment of the deep connections between scientific naturalism and romanticism.In sum, learned a very great deal from this book. I was unable to put it down, and whatever your political views, you won't be either."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"What a great blast this was. From page one you feel Goldberg is a high octane New Yorker who just knows too much and hasn't got time to get it all out. So loath or love the thesis - that all fascism has its roots in the left - the sheer energy of the writing and volume of fascinating historical detail makes it a ride not to miss. And the thesis has a lot going for it. Socialists and liberals always imply that lurking behind Conservatives and Republicans are \`right wing fascists', when ironically all the actual fascism that both Europe and America has experienced has come not from the right, but the left. Mussolini started off as a radical socialist, and then moved to populism; Hitler was the leader of - the National Socialist Party, which had originally been, The German Workers' Party. And if you look at their founding documents, it was very left-wing: Big business loathed the Austrian. His economic policies interfered with the market, and much worse just like Marx he was always wanting a \`revolution', a new age, a third way which is beyond politics which would rip down institutions, to get their \`expert' hands on all the power to build a society where the state, for the good of the \`people', is allowed into \`every nook and cranny' of our lives, or as Mussolini said \`Everything in the State, nothing outside the State'. This has never been a conservative idea: it is certainly a socialist one. After proving that European fascism belongs to the left Goldberg crosses the Atlantic and looks at Wilson and Roosevelt, two heroes of \`progress' and argues they both brought traces of fascism to the USA. Wilson was a great admirer of Bismarck, and used the First World War as a crisis to justify a great remodeling of society, as the Prussian had done, under the auspices of the War Industries Board which took control of the economy - just as Hitler did later in Germany. For persuading the people, Wilson created a formidable propaganda machine which aimed to create, \`100 percent Americanism', helped along by 100,000 four minute men who could deliver passionate speeches in town squares around the nation. The other side to propaganda was silencing dissent - and this happened a lot. In fact Wilson locked up more dissidents than Mussolini, and closed down many papers. Under Wilson, any criticism of the government - even in your own home - could earn you a prison sentence. Behind it all was not xenophobia against Germans - but, as one of their own said, \`The great European War is striking down individualism and building up collectivism.' It was all about control - and it was coming not from the conservatives, but the progressives. With Roosevelt, who was involved in all that Wilson did, there is more hero worship and the same use of a crisis, the depression, to increase state power. However shocking the idea that Roosevelt was a closet fascist, Mussolini thought there was something in it. Reviewing FDR's book \`Looking Forward' he writes, Roosevelt calls his readers to battle...reminiscent of the ways and means which Fascism awakened the Italian people' And FDR returned the compliments, writing in a long letter to \`that admirable Italian gentleman....I am much interested and deeply impressed by what he had accomplished.' With those peace loving hippies of the 1960's it's not difficult for Goldberg to show the links with 1930's fascism. The mystical assumption there was a \`Wrong Turn' in history away from tribal/environmental roots into Christian industrialism; a sentimental lurch back to communing with nature; a demand for \`action' with a blurring of the lines between revolutionary action' and violent crime; hostility to marriage, the family; pure hatred for the church; extreme emphasis on victim identity politics - the blacks, the Hispanics, the gays. It's not very difficult to see the links. And their heroes prove the point. Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Mao Tse-tung were all men of violence: fascists. Goldberg's pounding of the goody liberal image continues as he looks at eugenics: it is rooted in the left. The Fabians in England, the Webbs, Bernard Shaw, Laski, H.G. Wells were \`devoted to the cause', all standing on Darwin, whose cousin was the father of eugenics. The bottom line of the movement is exterminate the \`unfit and darker races' (Wells) and introduce \`selective breeding' (Shaw). All of this went to America and was keenly adopted by the \`progressives' so Wilson, a \`forthright defender' of eugenics', became \`the most racist president of the twentieth century'. And of course it was all soaked up by Adolf Hitler - and tragically implemented. All of this is definitely not finished history, as Goldberg makes clear as he looks at environmentalism, abortion, health foods, and even an analysis of recent Hollywood films such as Brokeback Mountain with its call for a return to the instinctive wild. Fascist ideas are alive and well. And perhaps now its seeds are installed in the White House. He has a fascinating chapter \`Brave New Village', which looks at Hilary Clinton's political philosophy which makes the village, the community, the state -more important than the individual and the family. Having spent over three hundred pages explaining where that takes us, this is disturbing. Weaved into the history Goldberg reminds us of the political gurus, Rousseau (loyalty to state, same as to God); Heidegger (good and evil are childish notions, make your own truth); and Hegel/Darwin (life = violent struggle) behind the menace of fascism. And he also points us to the thinkers whose ideas have worked - John Locke (equality of all men before God, role of property), Adam Smith (division of labour, free markets), and especially Edmund Burke (tradition less blood-thirsty than revolution). There is no propagating here, but in between the lines the answer to fascism is very clear: keep a strict line between what the state can do, and what God can do."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Great Book. Before I read it I had the preconception that this book was just an extreme right wing bloviation. I was wrong! This book is very well written and describes the modern history of fascism along with its concept in today's politics. Today's left wing media likes to portray fascism as a right wing creation.

Few know that Fascism and Nazism are types of socialism, which puts them squarely to the Left. Goldberg writes well and the book is well researched. A central assumption is that our western belief system is comprised of a dichotomy of Left and Right. This dichotomy is well described from a traditional American position of our founders in the book: \\"America's Thirty Years War: Who is Winning?\\" by Balint Vazsonyi. Fascism and its variants are often called a \\"third way,\\" combining aspects of socialism, national industrialism, and nationalism. How many of your friends know that the full name of the Nazi party was the \\"The National Socialist German Workers Party\\"?Goldberg's extension of Fascism to more modern political issues is of interest, but is less clear: not everything can be labeled by words. This non-historic part of the book is probably the most controversial, although one can see connection between Fascism and modern leftist systems whose goal is group benefits over individual liberty. If one needs a basic history of Right and Left I recommend that you first read Vazsonyi's book or \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" by F.A. Hayek."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg did a magnificent job in researching and writing this book.

It is a must read, if one cares to be prepaired to combat this pernicious adversary to our democracy."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a big book and can be a bit tedious in places. Having said that, I highly recommend it as strong medicine for some pernicious distortions of history. This is political science, history and quite a bit of philosophy organized by chronology. A few points are made with more heat than necessary but it is apparent that it would draw intense fire from the left no matter what the title or the cover art. He begins with a chapter that sets out his theme; conservatives are not the heirs of the Nazis. That would seem obvious except for the rhetoric from the left which stimulated him to write the book in the first place. For example, on page 4 Jonah points out that Congressman Charles Rangel called the \\"Contract With America\\" of the 1994 election \\" more extreme than Nazism.\\" Bill Clinton said in 2000 that the Texas GOP Platform was \\"a fascist tract.\\" There is plenty of provocation for an angry response. This, however, is not an angry book.I fancy myself a student of history, having written one history, but I learned a good deal of new information. Mussolini, for example, was an extremely intellectual socialist and editor of a newspaper called \\"Class War.\\" He was the author of a number of well received books. What I did not know was how popular he was with the Progressive Movement in the US. He even appeared in a 1923 Hollywood movie with Lionel Barrymore. His reputation with the American left was high until World War II. The founder of Fascism was a socialist and an inspiration, readily acknowledged at the time, to the Progressive Movement. Of course, the chapter on Woodrow Wilson was a revelation to me. The War Socialism of Wilson's administration is not well known and he is mostly a cardboard figure in American history. Most interest seems to be directed at the aftermath of the war and the failure of the Versailles Treaty. How he organized the government during the war is ignored and the excesses pointed out by Goldberg in his book are almost all new information. I will have to read more from a neutral source as Wilson seems to have been the beneficiary of a whitewash. I do know from family history how the Germans were vilified during the war but did not know how much this was government policy. Perhaps Roosevelt's internment of the Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor had more precedent than is usually understood.Goldberg's chapter on Hitler points out once again that the Nazis were socialists and Hitler had many interests that are present in the Environmentalist Left of today. He was very health conscious, a vegetarian and violently anti-smoking. In a later chapter, Goldberg goes back over this information and compares the Nazis, with their mystical attachment to the German forest, to modern day environmentalists. There is a trend running back to the Fabian Socialists, through the Nazis, on to American academics that is tolerant of genocide, as long as it is in a good cause. The current enthusiasm for abortion began with eugenic impulses of Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood. She is a saint of Feminism but her interest in eugenics is ignored. In 1922, she wrote,\\" More children from the fit, less from the unfit- that is the chief issue of birth control.\\" The fact that 70% of abortions are performed on black women is another statistic that never seems to make its way into the newspapers.Goldberg pulls together a number of threads that were either ignored or distorted in American history. It can get tedious, as I said, but the end result is a fascinating accomplishment of revisionist history. It is an excellent companion to Amity Schlaes history of the Great Depression, \\"The Forgotten Man.\\" Both of them emphasize the Progressive roots of Herbert Hoover and Schlaes makes the point that his policies toward the deepening financial crisis in 1932 differed little from Roosevelt's that followed. Goldberg discusses at length the open fascism of Hugh Johnson's National Recovery Administration until it was declared unconstitutional.There are times when Goldberg gets a bit over the top, as when he considers \\"Forrest Gump\\" an example of a fascist movie. I agree with him, however, that \\"American Beauty\\" was such an example. His comparison of the Nazis' anti-Semitism and the popularity of \\"Whiteness Studies\\" in college curricula may seem extreme but I'm not sure. He may well have a point. All in all, I highly recommend this book although it is not light reading. It is pretty good history and will stimulate some reconsideration of the Progressive Movement in America and its modern liberal descendants."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"What an excellent book!

It just goes to show that the LEFT can not see what is in front of them as they are into SO into denial.This was a difficult book for me to read. I think mostly because of the concepts Goldberg discussed. Fascism is hard to define but like most other charged words the LEFT is expert at twisting things around and getting on top of the battle while labeling conservatives what they themselves actually have become. All you have to do is read George Orwell's '1984' & 'Animal Farm' and it becomes clear as a bell to anyone honest enough to question their own prejudices that the left twists and distorts beyond belief. Now the likes of Conservatives are being labeled RACISTS because they oppose gov. take over of health care. What a perfect book to read at this time. Goldberg is right on the mark.I came away from this book feeling sick to my stomach because Goldberg is right when he says that it is a never ending struggle. If they don't pass health care this time, then wait 10-15 years and they will try again. Eventually they will get it because the public just gets worn down. The left is rabid and wants progressively more government control of everything. It is in their nature. They are like spoiled children throwing fits if they don't get their way and saying..I hate you Mommy, I hate you Mommy. How many Mommies give in because they can't stand it?When you couple that with the schools and media singing praises of anything government and now esp. anything Citizen O wants, we are doomed I fear.Read Liberal Fascism and you will understand more about what is happening to our society piece by piece and it is not a pretty picture.Washington Post, aren't your numbers dwindling rapidly???

This book is a nauseating heap of lying neocon propaganda. The author desires to prove that socialism equals dictatorship, i.e. all socialists are opposed to democracy. He then dishes out a distorted version of 20th century Italian history that confirms his propaganda message. Curiously, however, he neglects to mention the most celebrated opponent of Fascism, the martyred Giacomo Matteotti. Matteotti is a key figure in 20th century Italian history. His name is nowhere mentioned in this book. Why not? Because Matteotti was a socialist who courageously opposed Fascism in the name of freedom and democracy and was murdered by the Fascists for his pains. Matteotti's murder by Fascists was a climactic event in Italian history. Matteotti is the proof that Goldberg lies when he charges all socialists with being opposed to freedom.

Speaking as a european, in no country - Italy, Germany - included would the assertion of this book be taken half seriously. In fact many would be insulted by its premise that facism is a left wing phenomenon.Which beggars the question - if Jonah Goldberg thinks everything evil is left wing and everything good is right wing then as a person, what kind of mental state must this man have?Shoddy.

We are on a startlingly disturbing path in America today if this is reflective of the populace in-general.Since Ms Eide's 1/2-to-1-star review covered pretty much all that needed to be said, I'll not elaborate much further except to refer you to her review, and to regard Mr Goldman's work as not unlike a poorly written college thesis in which the evidence is thin at-best, and in the main only gleaned in order to support the title, rather than as having been researched to see if-indeed the original thesis can be upheld.The oxymoron of Liberal Fascism that Goldman fashions is not completely without merit - since 'liberal fascism' is not unlike what CS Lewis would call communism, essetially, wherein communism is the 'twin son' of fascism (see: Pilgrim's Regress, wherein the brown-shirted and red-shirted dwarfs serve the same Lord Savage). Indeed, a college buddy of mine once referred to a mutual friend as a 'grainola-bar-fascist' for his near anal retentive attention to being both politically correct, and 'pure' about his vegan eating habits. So the notion is not without some conceivable image - but not in the 'truer' sense when one actually gets down to defning terms in real politik.Indeed in the real world the notion of liberal fascism is indeed counterintuitive since liberalism itself (read: liberal democracy; liberal education; liberation theology; liberal thought) has been historically banned, banished, and purged from fascist countries of any and all stripes.The notion of the rule-of-law, true representative democracy, freedom of speech, assembly, thought, press, etc., are all values of a 'liberal' democracy, which fascists (and totalitarian communists) all despise, regulate, and/or purge from their 'systems' as readily and handily as they possibly can.Merely because anicdotally there are instances in which either legislative, legal, or even municipal governance decisions are made on the basis of some nefarious overly-politically-correct stance, does not warrant the inferrence that any and all 'liberal' ideas are therefore evil on a scale of advocating a fascist state.Indeed, much the same could be said for stereotypical liberals' views of the beliefs of conservatives (traditional or neo-con). There are certainly instances of anecdotal evidence by which one might compare this or that feature of neo-conservatism to fascism; but in the main this would not be an accurate assessment. True-enough in either instance there may exist the proverbial slippery-slope in which either of these two 'sides' might fall into a kind of absolutism that could easily morph into a totalitarian view of the world (I've seen this among 'young communists' who want to legislate hate-speech as off-limits to any conversation on a college campus, for instance - with them being the person or group to determine what hate speech entails). But for either side this is more due to the nature of humanity's will-to-(if-not lust after)-power - regardless of one's ideology (see Rhobes Pierre (sp?) of the French Revolution after having just helped to create one of the more lasting documents in the cause of Liberty - The Rights of Man (sic).No, Mr Goldberg, Ms Eide's got your number - and unlike the number of stars I put at the top of this review, (in order to ensure it got read), your work herein adds up to a great big Zero."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The link below has plenty of discussion between Goldberg and David Neiwert.

Thus far, I've noticed three examples of what I provocatively call blatant idiocy, an inability to write using even basic high school parallelism, and several footnotes that when referenced drift off into nowhere-ville. Secondly, I don't much like Woodrow Wilson, but to leave out the Zimmerman Telegram or German U-Boat activity in the Atlantic and claim that Wilson jumped into WWI for the heck of it - is clearly shopping through the grocery store of history for items to fit your recipe. Thirdly, to claim that William James, John Dewey, Josiah Royce, and whatever other pragmatist Goldberg could round up were all Fascists is hilarious. One of the primary Pragmatist scholars in the US, Sandra Rosenthal, was one of my undergrad profs and from her I was able to discern the pragmatists could barely agree on how to spell the word let alone how to brainwash legions of Americans through the reordering of Library Books! (Not a serious claim on my part, but I doubt Goldberg seriously cares about this epistemological movement anyway.) And randomly, on p 6, where he notes that liberals always like to start wars on things and then he mentions the \\"war on cancer\\" and the \\"war on drugs\\". Both of these terms have their origins in the Nixon Administration, as best I recall. (Although I have been saying for the better part of a year that Nixon was more liberal than Obama. Guess Nixon's a fascist too. But wait wasn't that what the hippies were saying in the first place? AHHHHH The circularity!!!!!)Anyway, thus far it seems to me that Goldberg burns down the kitchen at the very beginning of this historical potluck supper. On pages 3-5,he establishes that \\"fascist\\" is the contemporary epithet for denouncing people you politically dislike. And then, Jonah Goldberg editor at large of the National Review, spends the next 408 give-or-take pages calling Liberals fascists. Well, that kind of seems tautological, now doesn't it, Mr. Goldberg?In sum, as of page 132, this book is the equivalent of St Anselm's argument for the existence of God. It is incredibly effective at logically proving what you had unfalsifiably believed all along.

I've been reading him since he was most of NRO and his wit has always brought a smile to my face. I remember being sad when he dropped back to a mere 3 columns/week on NRO.I am also very sympathetic to his premise. I despise the easy throwaway lines of Nazi and Fascist to mean, \\"I disagree with you\\". Many of my liberal colleagues are all but dedicated fascists.That said, I'm very disappointed with this book so far. I'll admit I'm only on chapter 4 but I doubt I'll be able to finish it.I was hoping Jonah's wit would shine through and this book would be an amusing read. Perhaps even to the level of a P.J. O'Rourke. Jonah's witty enough that he should be at that level. Unfortunately, it's like some editor came through and stripped all wit out of the book. Almost like Jonah was told nobody would take a humor book serious.Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out that this was not an academic work. That was actually quite astute. Despite 50 pages of end notes I was very disappointed with the citations. Some of the end notes were not references but parenthetical comments that should have been in the text. While actual quotes seemed to be correctly referenced other claims of statements were either not referenced or referenced incorrectly.I think there is a lot of value in the historical information in the book, even more in the attempt to even establish a working definition of fascism. Unfortunately, mixed in with the factual information is strained reasoning to match it to the modern Progressive movement.I believe that if Jonah did a sequel, put the wit back in, and used his examples to show how there are parallels between totalitarian regimes and proposals of modern progressives he'd have a major winner.OK, he's high on the Amazon best seller, but by winner I mean a book that was a fun read."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"A clear attempt to discredit liberal politics as though either left or right had no skeletons in the closet. All extremes of any view are scary territory; this book tried to demonize the left to the benefit of the right."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Mr. Goldberg starts off with a strong idea: Liberals (in particular Socialists) have a historical precedent for turning into Fascists. The problem for Mr. Goldberg is that just because one says one is a duck, doesn't make one a duck. This is the problem with American politics in particular, and possibly politics in general the world over: Labeling complex. The innate need to label your opponent as something evil. Still, it is Mr. Goldberg's flawed hypothesis based on historical fact.The latest example of this flawed hypothesis from Mr. Goldberg is the \\"Socialist\\" Hugo Chavez. Declaring yourself a Socialist, but engaging in the behavior and actions of a tyrant, while tossing out crumbs makes one a tyrant, no matter what label you choose for yourself.Herein is where Mr. Goldberg's treatise falls flat. He simply, and quite succinctly, takes the labels other gave themselves as justification for declaring the whole. That would be like judging the entire Republican party (born in Wisconsin, my home) from the actions of Reagan, Gingrich, Limbaugh, G.W. Bush, et al. Those men, and indeed Mr. Goldberg, do not represent my Republican party. They represent the party of anti-intellectualism (which is ironic), victimization complexes, gut based decision-making, and socially intrusive government.Mr. Goldberg is apparently a child of the \\"Reagan Revolution\\" and as such displays all the foul temperaments associated with it in this book. As a true conservative, I must disavow this book as I disavow the majority of AM Radio personalities.Mr. Goldberg's title was designed to draw inflamed response, just as many other conservative titles have done, from the left. In this he is no different than Ann Coulter, or many others, seeking to justify the fears and prejudices of the buying public they are supported by. His logic is extremely tenuous (in the best of circumstances) and leaves us with this vague feeling of cotton candy for \\"conservatives.\\" Indeed the marketing to faux conservatives is so thick throughout the book, as to leave a sugary smell that permeates the dust cover.In the end, that's all the book is, a feel-good treatise for his target audience. This book is fine entertainment, but that's all it truly is. There is no true historical perspective here, but one is not expecting a shill for either side to do honest fact checking in any case."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Even the most hardcore liberal would have to admit that Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, Johnson, and Clinton had their flaws and made mistakes. However, I believe that they were all well-intentioned. I really can't say that much for Hitler and Mussolini. I think they were motivated by evil. I really can't stand Nixon and Reagan, but I am willing to admit that they thought they were trying to do the right thing for America. Maybe the word fascist needs to be eliminated as a useful label. If someone disagrees with me and I call him a fascist, and then he calls me a fascist for trying to shut him down, the word has lost all meaning. This country is evenly divided by two groups that despise each other. Liberals and conservatives are both convinced that the other side is determined to ruin America. I think we can achieve unity and common ground if both sides admit that there are two ways to be a patriot, by loving your country when it does the right thing, and by changing your country when it is clearly in the wrong. Name-calling is easy. Cooperation is a challenge."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The author has no idea what he is talking about. The title of the book is a slogan: there is no need for any facts or logic.Totalitarian regimes, like fascism and communism are CONSERVATIVE, not liberal.The main goal of such societies is to remain unchanged and to preserve the status quo. This is the definition of conservatism.It is true that Communism wants to portray itself as progressive, liberal, democratic, even atheist. The facts however are just the opposite.Totalitarian societies are united under 1 party, 1 lieder, and 1 doctrine. There is no space for people who think differently. \\"Everyone who is not with us is against us\\". \\"Spirit in doubt is a rotten spirit\\".During the 1960-s the Communist countries banned Jazz and Rock-N-Roll music, because it endangered the moral fabric of the society. Young people who listened to Jazz or RNR could loose their jobs or kicked out of the University, or sent to re-education boot camps, (popularly known as Siberia).During the Vietnam war years, the Communists DID NOT support and DID NOT popularize the hippie movement: just the opposite. The hippies were described as filthy, lazy, spoiled, sexually promiscuous, drug-addicts, gay, alcoholics and declared to be ideological enemies of the communist society. The young people were forbidden from wearing long hairs, short skirts, bell-bottom pants etc.The communist Propaganda machine explained that ALL American youth is hippie, and the hippies are invented by the CIA to destroy the Communist ideology.In addition, the young people were scared from following western way of life by inventing convenient facts such as:Coca-Cola is high-alcohol drink with devastating effects on the health.Dancing twist leads to intestinal collapse and painful death.Sex is bad and especially sex outside of marriage. Children born out of wedlock are defined \\"illegal\\".Love (and free love) is bad. There should be only one love: to the Mother Land and Comrade Stalin (Chaushesko, Honeker, Enver Hodga, etc). The love to Stalin precedes the love to family and friends.Abortion was illegal. Check the Romanian movie: \\"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\\".Abortion was illegal in Hitler's Germany as well.Homosexuality is a crime and/or a disease. Homosexuals are persecuted, beaten on the streets, placed in Konz-lagers, prisons or mental hospitals.Hard Sciences are liberal. In order to develop and to push the boundaries of the knowledge they need scientific argument, disagreement, out-of-the-box thinking.In science both Communism and Fascism pretended they support progress.In reality, the sciences were imposed the party ideology.Under this ideology during the 1930-1940 the Soviet Physicist were forbidden to study Quantum Physics. Communists did not like the uncertainty principle by Heisenberg. (Heisenberg was a Nazi supporter). This prevented Kremlin from developing the A-bomb in 1945.Do you still believe that Communism or Fascism is liberal?"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book is the biggest waste of print I have had the displeasure of reading.

But democrat, republican, progressive and many other political words have evolved, their definitions changing with the passage of decades. My advice is that before you read the book, you discover exactly what the author means when he uses certain terms and what the up to date definitions of those terms are. Otherwise, your head will swim, too.Also please remember that no idea exists in a vacuum, or alone. Political ideologies often share concepts. However, all of them are many ideas combined to support one outcome or the other, and their shared concepts can lead to totally different results.I FEEL, i suspect that the author is playing with words to make a sort of irrelevant point, but i will let you know.

In reality Mussolini was called a fascist because he called HIMSELF a fascist. He coined the phrase and applied it to himself. Second, Mussolini's persecution of socialists and communists in Italy is well documented, clearly he was at odds with their vision for the economy, politics and the social order in general. Thirdly, what is most distinctive about fascism, particularly Italian fascism is the relation between the financial and business elite and the state. The interests of the this elite was promoted fervently by the state under fascism.So, this is quite anecdotal evidence, but I would hope that someone who is attempting to rewrite the last 60 years of history would at least know something about history."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"While the writing is less than first rate, the information imparted by this book rings true and is both worthwhile and relatively unknown to the public."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Growing up we were often told in school and in the media that fascism was the final resting place of a right wing conservative agenda. Jonah Goldberg not only dispels that myth but gives the reader an objective and excellent education on the history of fascism and how the \\"progressive movement\\" in America is the epitome of fascism. When one thinks of Hitler we have been told so many times by teachers all the way from elementary school to college that Hitler was a \\"right winger.\\" It amazes me that nobody ever stops to think of the word \\"Nazi\\" and what it stands for; National Socialism. It's funny when I read the book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich that many Nazi's had been Russian Communists and many Communists had previously been Nazis. Those who left the S.S. prior to the Invasion of Europe left Germany to sign up with the Russians and went on to become KGB agents after the war. I often wonder if Nazism is conservatism at its worst why would a Nazi join the KGB. Goldberg answers this question and shows that Nazism is a close cousin of Marxism and not conservativism.Reading Goldberg's book it's clear that Socialism, Communism, and Nazism are all cousins. These beliefs seek to take the power from society and put it in the hands of government. Taking liberalism to its logical conclusion, it seeks to control the population with big government and intimidation. The left of today sees the mistakes that Hitler and Stalin made and realise that in order to take control of America that they have to do it with a happy face rather then with the fist. Obviously if they can take control which Reid, Pelosi and Obama are desperately trying to do, they will used the fist if necessary. Thank goodness for people like Goldberg who give us an objective lesson in history. Goldberg shows how the proggressives under Wilson began to stomp on the Constitution, how Roosevelt used his own progressive mind set to creat large government.Fascism is not a conservative ideology but usually stems from a \\"progressive thought pattern.\\" Goldberg shows too that it is the liberal fascist who is the most dangerous in that look at history's assassinations of political leaders. Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth, Gavrilo Princip, Charles Guiteau, Leon Frank Czolgosz all left wing radicals wishing to overthrow the government and wanting either a radical Marxist agenda or were anarchists who were bent on creating a one world utopia where the only absolute is that which is created by the state.It's a common misconception that the further one goes to the right the more likely that they will become, fascist or an anarchist, and the further left one goes the more likely that they will become Marxist of Communist. The truth is the further one goes to the right, the more likely one will become an isolationist and the further to the left one goes will likely result in becoming a National Socialist, Marxist, Fascist, Anarchist. The left today is interested in taking power anyway they can and the route they always choose if fascism, this time they are going to try it with a smile. The left has learned that fascism is easier obtained with a suit and tie then with a uniform and gun."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"(EDIT NOTE, 2/20/2010): I did finish the book, finally, and amended this review to reflect this fact. Thanks to one of the commenters for reminding me to add this note. It has also been brought to my attention that there are allegations that the author has changed the subtitle of his book several times to \\"make it fit\\" whatever the \\"hot topic\\" of the day is in American politics, essentially, to my way of thinking, making a claim that his work is the \\"one size fits all\\" final word on this subject. This is a further bothersome point, since it would seem that this work is then more a \\"product\\" than anything serious. But apart from that, I really don't have anything to add from what I originally wrote on a one-third of the way through read. It's just not good at all).Instead of my own opinion of the book, I would point out to any prospective readers and buyers that as of this date, January 25, 2009, the History News Network has published no less than four rebuttals of Mr. Goldberg's book by some of the most pre-eminent scholars of fascism living today, including Robert Paxton, arguably the finest scholar on the subject of fascism working. And one, Professor Peter Griffin, has blatantly stated that Mr. Goldberg deliberately misused his scholarship in support of his own hypothesis. And all of these scholars have found and cited multiple obfuscations of sources and mis-statements in the work, if not outright distortions. This is not good. Not good at all.But all also mention something that I noticed right off the bat as well which, for me, annihilated any credibility Goldberg might have had and right out of the gate. Goldberg is presenting an alternative historical view to, essentially, \\"get back\\" at people for whom he has no political use and who, often foolishly, toss and have tossed the word \\"fascism\\" around to describe their \\"conservative\\" enemies. Goldberg, then, just like the incindiaries on the other side of the political fence, repays the favor by using the word \\"liberal\\" as a monolithic construct, encomapssing everything from Marxists to communists to Democratic and Republican moderates and civil rights progressives in the modern United States and then playing \\"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\\" to brand them all \\"fascists.\\" It is nothing less than his stated intention to brickbat anyone who does not share his own world-view with the stain of \\"fascist\\" criminality and murder. In other words, he's upset, and \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is his temper fit on the nursery floor. And, oddly enough, I don't have a problem with that per se. Polemic is part of writing just as anything else. But I do have a real problem with playing fast and loose with other people's work in unabashed service to wounded ego or personal pique.I simply cannot this seriously then, anymore than I can take the aforementioned monolithic use of \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" seriously. A personal investment is, in work like this, playing with fire and flame. Worse, in the opening pages, I could not essentially tell what sourcing he was using to develop his unique and non-scholarly definition of what fascism \\"is.\\" And indeed, many of his bombshell statements, basically cited as \\"true fact,\\" are not even sourced at all as, again, the eminent authorities at HNN pointed out, including citation of a famous quote by Mussolini as \\"true\\" that is, in fact, a likely urban legend. This strikes me as very shady.I also mention that my copy, which was not a remainder copy or galley as far as I could tell, actually had some typos. This does not inspire confidence in editorial competence.But, as I mentioned, please do not take my word for it. I invite all to read the fine essays on this book published today by the History News Network, and if you want a superior book on this subject, please check out Robert Paxton's which I reviewed some time back.In fairness to Goldberg, I read his response to the historian's critiques. Apart from the fact that he insinuates that they are all \\"out to get him\\" somehow, which I find rather hard to countenance, I did not see where the most damning criticisms were answered. Instead, he took a lofty, dismissive tone effectively signaling, to me, an unwillingness to confront the serious charges made against his work or engage in a serious debate about his thoughts. Perhaps he will more firmly address this in later writing, but as of now, I found his \\"rebuttal\\" to be disingenuous and slitheringly Byzantine. And, again, this does not bode well.No recommendation based on the negative reviews of renowned and respected scholars who have panned this work on serious, objective bases.(PLEASE NOTE: I am not informed when people comment on my reviews, but I stumble across comments from time to time as I work edits. I will not tolerate name-calling or harsh language in a comment directed at myself or another person who sees fit to comment. But I do ask that comments be sober and thoughtful, of assistance to prospective purchasers. Any such breach of good manners will be reported to Amazon.

I'm a member of the blank generation and have always had a nagging resentment of post-war baby boomers. (Like hangnails, don't y'know?)

Goldberg's book will enrage liberals and enchant everyone else."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg's point in his new book is not merely to shock with the title but also to examine the roots and origins of some modern day leftist policies and movements. Take anti-smoking laws for instance. This was a pet project of the Nazis in their attempt to create a 'clean' and sterile society. Hitler, the health nut, welcomed anti-smoking legislation. At the heart of the legislation is the notion that the state knows what is best for the average man. This is also the essence of fascism and, in an irony, the essence of socialism and many leftist policies. Thus it is no surprise that today's adherents of anti-smoking laws are on the left, not among the libertarians on the right. This is why the book is adorned with a happy face and a mustache, it shows that although the roots of modern policies lie in fascism, those policies are crafted 'for our best interests' today and do not result in concentration camps or death camps.The book essentially examines the roots of fascism and shows them to be leftist rather than conservative. This is a fact of history. Hitler's party was not only influenced by Socialism, but even by communism, the essential difference was it was natioanlist whereas the Soviet Union was internationalist. Mussolini had been an editor at a Socialist newspaper until he became a futurist and then a fascist oweing to his loyalty to Italy. Franco, despite being called a fascist, was not in truth fascist for he was not affected by socialism. He had a much deeper respect for the church and for the monarchy than fascism did, since fascism was revolutionary and secular.The roots of fascism are not secret. However the label fascist is usually applied to the right. This is an accident of history because the racist 'right' became a cliche after the 1950s. However what really happaned is that the old conservatives of Europe simply disappeared. The monarchists simply died out and the 'liberals' who were classic liberal economists also died out. In the 1920s and 1930s everyone basically became a socialist and the destinction on the continent was between leftist socialists and rightist socialists. Bukharin, the Communist in Russia, was known as a 'rightist'. This was the essential difference. It never took into account what would happen in the United States, where a new conservative movement led by William Buckley and Goldwater (Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American ConsensusorThe CONSERVATIVE REVOLUTION: THE MOVEMENT THAT REMADE AMERICA) remade American politics. Yet the old labels remained of 'right wing fascists' even though they were meaningless. Goldberg, in a good natured way, tries to remind us of this fact.A worthy endeavor and one that should not cause rancor but rather insight and memory and interest.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The WaPo reviewer takes Goldberg to task over some definitions, and some omissions, and I do not fault him for that. However, the point of the book remains true: today's distinction between the Right equalling fascism, and the Left equalling socialism/communism etc. is absolutely hokey, propaganda, BS with a capital B and a capital S. And Mr. WaPo is wrong claiming Hitler was no socialist - it IS called the 'National Socialist Party' after all, and his F&uuml;hrership certainly started out as a leftie (and ended as one, which we're not supposed to acknowledge).For those who doubt all this, here's some basic thoughts: if 'right' means conservative and 'left' means progressive, then the most conservative is a Royalist, a man who believes in the hereditary right of kings, of nobility, of people holding title to lands and being natural superiors to the serfs/peasants tilling their fields. The progressives are those who strive away from that, which means chiefly the abolition of privilege, an end to the landholder/peasant society, along with various social 'reforms', from voting rights to legalized usury.So, where did Hitler or Mussolini try to restore the old aristocratic privileges? The peasant society? Were they not heavily into industrialism, armored warfare, sweeping social and government sponsored work programs (Autobahn, anyone?)I would argue that even capitalism, built on Bentham's ideas, is part of the new 'radicalism' and not a conservative movement at all. It certainly has in common with fascism and socialism (fascio-socialism might be an appropriate word here) the intent to create a new and better society in the here and now and based on secular principles. Aristocrats, monarchs and the like were in theory considered God-willed and oftentimes God-appointed rulers whose chief duty was toward God rather than toward their subjects."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"All I can add to the already voluminous comments about this superior book isthat I wish it had been available years ago, during my own social-politicalindoctrination.

What a great book!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The general arguments of this book are already familiar, presumably -- but check out one of the other excellent reviews for a summary if you are in doubt. I just want to highlight some of its weaknesses. (The strengths are Goldberg's fairly competent and witty writing style, a well-argued and well-supported thesis, and several provocative ideas.) Interested readers should also consult reviews by professional historians.The overarching thesis of the book, that modern liberalism (in contradistinction to modern conservatism) stems from and is deeply imbued with fascism, is partly true, but: (a) is profoundly and deeply biased and (b) is historically incomplete (to say the least). More, Goldberg relies on cheap rhetorical tricks to make many of his arguments - perhaps because they are not supported by reason and facts - which significantly dampens the overall impact of his more important points.Let's start with my first objection. Goldberg argues that fascism is a \\"left-wing\\" movement, and that, therefore, progressive politics is fascist politics. The payout, then - the whole point of the book, in fact, and the reason for all of the adoring 5 star reviews (just as much as the title is the reason for all the 1-star reviews) - is that modern American liberals are secretly fascist, whereas modern American conservatives are the noble, just champions of individual liberty. This the bias of the book - Goldberg is basically just trying to smear the left as \\"fascist,\\" without giving serious attention to parallel and equivalent fascist elements on the \\"right.\\"And how can his thesis really be true when the left-right distinction in American politics is broadly social and cultural, focused around a few 'hot-button' social issues (abortion, gay marriage, gun rights, etc.) and identity, rather than substantive issues of politics and public policy? (Okay, sometimes a real issue finds its way into the mainstream debate, but promptly becomes turned into a question of identity - witness the way in which the Obamacare debate quickly became one about the hard-working, individualist American vs. the nanny-state-suckling city slickers.) The fact is that the Democratic and Republican parties are in substantial and deep agreement on almost every important political issue, with disagreements only surfacing around the margins. Do we need to point out again that Federal government spending rose as quickly under conservative hero Reagan as under any leftist president? That many of the programs intensified in FDR's New Deal were actually begun under Hoover? That Nixon imposed price and wage controls? (And how about the \\"militarism\\" part of fascism? Liberals are far more often pacifists, ambivalent towards the military, or at least significantly less ready to drop bombs than the right is.)The fact is that the right and the left, in American politics, are separated only by a small margin on most real political issues -- or, to phrase it more accurately, there is just as much variation within the parties on any given issue as there is difference between their respective 'average' positions. How can it be true, then, that one party is fascist while the other is not? Where they differ is in issues of culture, social values, and identity.As for my second point, Goldberg ignores or trivializes all of the philosophical roots of liberalism in what we now usually call \\"classical liberalism.\\" (To be sure, these writers [JS Mill, Locke, etc., etc.] are just as often invoked by thoughtful conservatives as by thoughtful liberals.)And Goldberg wonders exactly which parts of the Nazi platform (included in an appendix) the modern liberal disagrees with. Well, let's see just three examples (I don't want to be boring):- 4. \\"Only a member of the race can be a citizen.\\" (Xenophobic anti-immigration opinions are above all characteristic of the \\"right.\\" See: Arizona.)- 15. \\"We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.\\" (Both parties are complicit in the rise of the welfare-warfare state, but no one is talking about radically expanding it.)-17. \\"We demand... abolition of taxes on land...\\" (Sounds pretty \\"right-wing\\" to me!)The most basic and fundamental flaw of the book is in seeing surface and linguistic similarities as proof of a deep spiritual affinity. Goldberg basically wants his readers to come away from the book thinking that if liberals support something and fascists supported something, well, that must mean that liberals are naughty fascists and that whatever they both supported is wrong and evil. (If being a fascist just means supporting public education and a vibrant middle class, sign me up.)Ironically, in trying to recover the real meaning of fascism, Goldberg has only succeeded in further trivializing it through cheap rhetoric and wildly biased argumentation in pursuit of conservative plaudits. This is one to skim."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book exposes the truth about the left wing and the state of mind there in .There beliefs and there Double standers."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Even though this work has sometimes been criticised as less than \\"academic quality\\" it is nonetheless a very good layperson's introduction to the history of fascism and is particularly useful in explaining the similarities between the various fascist and socialist principles at work in Europe and the movement in America called \\"progressivism\\". These same tenets have led through an elaborate route to tenets common in today's liberalism.The similarities between National Socialism and Italian Fascism and Socialism are actually quite vast (read the book-it has a copy of the Nazi party platform). The author explains how the label of fascism has been shifted over to the right, if only to allow for the action of tarring the right with the evil brush of \\"fascism\\". I always knew nothing could be further from the truth, but I did not know that Mussolini was a leader in the Italian Socialist movement for many years. I also did not know that Hitler simply co-opted an existing political movement and that he and his cohorts were as \\"proletariat\\" oriented as the most ardent socialists. Now I know fascism is a bizarre, statist, variety of leftist politics.It makes you wonder how the disinformation is spread. It seems as if just enough time has gone by that a re-examination of this particular part of political history is definitely in order. I especially am enjoying my current reading covering the bizarre ideas of Woodrow Wilson. I knew I disliked him, if only because he was a fan of the bigot filmaker D. W. Griffith who featured the KKK as heros in his magnum opus movie. Also, of course I could not help but dislike his obsessive need for a League of Nations.

They are fascists. All Nazis are fascist. Not all fascists are Nazi. Being a fascist is not about hating Jews but its about government control on daily life.It's a bold statement, but by the end of the book it makes sense. Goldberg first describes Mussolini and Hitler's regimes, slicing the fascism from Nazism and Communism. Then he compares it to turn-of-the-20th-century Progressivism and FDR's New Deal. Then he looks at the protests of the 1960's and LBJ under the fascist lenses, and then Hillary Clinton and the like. Throughout the book he goes back to Italian fascism, German Nazism, and Progressivism and unpeels more and more about their politics and philosophies like an onion. He uses this to discuss economics, race politics, and abortion.His discussion on FDR and the New Deal was the biggest shock to me. I didn't know that the NRA (National Recovery Administration) employed Nazi tactics like big demonstrations and sanctioning non-NRA aligned businesses. I also didn't know that FDR received a personal letter from Hitler commending him on his New Deal. Before I read the book I thought FDR was the best president ever, followed by Ronald Reagan. Now I'm not so sure he was that great or the closest we have had in the USA to a fascist dictator.However, by the end of the book you start to wonder if fascism is really that bad after all. Political correctness has made us all accept a \\"happy fascism,\\" hence the smiley face with the Hitler mustache on the cover of the book. Goldberg discusses this towards the end of the book in a chapter \\"We're all Fascists now.\\"The section on abortion and race politics was hard to read, not because they were poorly written but because they are sensitive subjects for me. I also waited to the end to read the Nazi platform in the appendix, which was a let down. It's underdeveloped with it's 25 planks compared to modern standards and doesn't describe all the public policies that the Nazi's eventually implemented.Liberals are going to revolt at the thought of them being the fascists instead of conservatives being the fascists. But then, do you think conservatives liked that label for the last 30 years? It may not be college textbook quality but it is well researched and referenced.

That's a pretty brazen title for a book, is it not? Don't let that confuse you though. The strength of this book is not in another attack of liberals via conservatives... the strength of this book is that it details how the two dominant political parties in America are being swayed by radically leftist ideaologies which promote government on a scale that both true rebublicans and classical liberals are, by their definition, opposed too. Not only that, but the author talks about how these radical leftist stances have historically led governments to some pretty dark eras.Before you dismiss this book because you're wary of another party-bashing-party book, then you should note that Goldberg spends a good deal of his time critsizing the Republican Party.I found the book intersting, bold, and informative. Its about reclaiming American politics, not about doing away with liberal sentiments, but recognizing that there is a line between good ideas and bad ideas... and the left has some bad ideas that, if adhered to, can lead down a very slippery slope. I hope he writes a companion book aimed at overtly conservative philosophies."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg's \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is an excellent book which exposes the modern day \\"liberals\\" for what they are: totalitarians. I had known this ever since about twenty years of age, when I began questioning the \\"liberal\\" anti-Vietnam radicals and left-wing magazines such as \\"Time,\\" \\"NY Times,\\" \\"Washington Post,\\" \\"Newsweek.\\" My brother was in 5th Special Forces and the 101st Airborne, and I detested the left-wing calling him and others \\"baby killers.\\" They were just serving their country, not making policy. But I thought that the left wanted the government to do things their way, and only their way, and that many of the left's ideas were Marxist, like championing Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh, Mao, and Marx, who were really totalitarians. Even Hitler was a \\"liberal\\" or progressive advocating statist control, rather than democratic sovereignty.Now, having Obama and his Marxist regime as our rulers reinforces this idea of the left as totalitarians. Obama believes in: the Progressive Income Tax (a Marxist plank), state control of healthcare (socialism), anti-Church policies (Marx was an atheist.), pro-deficit spending, anti-military, anti-business, and most of all anti-Constitution (making him a tyrant). Goldberg also talks about the \\"progressives\\" who were left wingers: Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, LBJ, Kennedy. They too disliked the Constitution. I highly recommend this book and another one by Mark Levin: \\"Ameritopia.\\" We all need to know what today's \\"liberals\\" actually are: totalitarians. We are in dire trouble, and if Americans don't wake up, we'll become enslaved by despots."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Even after a second read, Liberal Fascism is almost as difficult to evaluate as the term fascism is to define. Parts of the book are quite excellent. For instance, Jonah Goldberg is generally successful in proving that Italian Fascism is a phenomenon of the left. His chapters on Wilson and Roosevelt are not only quite engaging; they are also persuasive. Still, the book possesses a number of flaws. It was a mistake to approach the subject both chronologically and thematically: the result is a good deal of repetition.In the introduction, George Orwell laments: \\"The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies 'something not desirable'.\\" (p.4) In modern discourse, this often means anyone who is not sufficiently progressive. This is a tendency Liberal Fascism seeks to rectify. To an extent, Goldberg avoids slinging around the term Fascism as a generic pejorative. However, he has the annoying habit of pointing out insignificant coincidences between fascists of yore and modern liberals. This not only detracts from his more substantial arguments, it also ensures that almost everyone fits under the ever-expanding definition of fascism.One gets the impression, then, that Goldberg is confused about his subject. Granted that fascism is a bit nebulous, one would hope that the writer of a book on the matter would be able to use the term correctly--or at least consistently. He gives the following definition: \\"Fascism is a religion of the state. It assumes the organic unity of the body politics and longs for a national leader attuned to the will of the people. It is totalitarian in that it views everything as political and holds that any action by the state is justified to achieve the common good.\\" (p. 23)Proceeding with his definition, it is unclear how a number of the examples Goldberg cites can be construed as fascistic. While the students in Dead Poets Society may invite parallels to a militarized culture (pp. 373-4), they cannot be seen as fascists since the State nowhere enters into the picture. Likewise in V For Vendetta, \\"The villains and the hero alike are all fascists.\\" (p. 375) In what manner dismantling a totalitarian regime is fascistic I leave for the exasperated reader to decide.The book ends by urging conservatives not to avoid adopting a religious significance about the State. This is a laudable endeavor, but it would have been more successful had Goldberg presented a clearer alternative to fascistic government. He explains that \\"if libertarianism could account for children and foreign policy, it would be the ideal political philosophy.\\" (p. 344) However, since political philosophy deals with imperfect man, flaws will be inherent in any system. But this is no reason to dismiss libertarianism. After all, it is difficult to see another group in America which better recognizes that there is a realm outside the State, and which is, therefore, better suited to resist the temptations of totalitarianism.There are, it is true, extensive references to \\"classical liberalism\\", usually in the context of explaining how it differs from progressivism. He notes that conservatism \\"is the conviction that a properly ordered republic has a government of limited ambition.\\" (p.402) But I have trouble remembering the last time conservatism thought such a thing. Although they are not fascistic, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq--which Goldberg supports--are hardly indicative of \\"limited ambition.\\"Blemishes aside, Liberal Fascism provides a good history of the Left. It is now time for conservatives to begin the introspection Liberal Fascism insisted that liberals take. Justin Raimondo's Reclaiming the American Right provides a good place to start."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"If you're like most people without a political science degree, but with an open mind, you'll find this book intriguing. If you've been drawn in with recent events in American history, noticed a hotter political atmosphere and feel that something is going wrong with the America around you, but you're not sure what it is, this book will explain it in detail. If you're able to look at history objectively, set aside what you've been taught and be open to an alternative history - as the author prescribes in the beginning of the book - you'll come away more confident that your feelings are not misguided, and that your (societal) guilt is actually manufactured by the constant drumbeat of a political and social philosophy which is (on the whole) contrary to your individuality and ultimately to the founding of this nation.Before reading this book, I read Liberty and Tyranny by Mark Levin and although both are principally the same, Mark's book - in my opinion - was more accusatory, where this book is more explanatory. This book is considerably longer and at times belabors points, but the author concedes this as a necessity.If you're politically moderate, this book will help you realize that you're actually conservative.

But this is different.Essentially, the thesis of Goldberg's book is that the American Left has more in common with bona fide facism than the right for whom it frequently uses this epithet.He begins by talking about Benito Mussolini and Otto Von Bismark, the founding fathers of what we now call facism, and makes note of the fact that many liberals initially praised these men and their ideas.From this, he discusses Americna lefitists (in some cases, people who did not identfy themselves with the left) such as Margaret Sanger, Huey Long, Father Coughlin, Upton Sinclair, etc. and the inevitable comparisons of FDR's New deal and LBJ's Great Society. He ties all of this in with the indefensible extremes of the \\"New Left\\" of the 60s that has tarred the reputation of the left ever since.In fairness, he uses excellent research to back up his points and the primary sources are worth checking into. What keeps this from becoming a typical dogmatic political rant is his willingness to admit that the right's hands are not entirely clean in this matter either. So it is somewhat balanced. The problem is a \\"throw out the baby with the bath\\" approach to some of these concepts. For example, he chides Blacks who support Planned Parenthood because of the admitted racism of Margaret Sanger (Goldberg never mentions that Dr. Martin Luther King was also among PP's major supporters) and a few slips of outright bad history (He accuses JFK of masterminding Patrice Lumumba's murder when that actually happened during the Eisenhower administration earlier in January 1961).But with that's said, it's still an interesting read and sobering for leftists as well as the right."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"If you leave out the parts about killing all the Jews and invading Poland, what specifically about the Nazi political platform do you disagree with?\\" (That platform is handily provided in the appendix.)

I didn't and don't think so. That said I have never been comfortable with my own understanding of what Fascism is. A simple Google search will show that Academia also is not agreed on a definition either.The author makes some valid points and some incorrect ones. Example: All revolutions are left wing in nature because they want to over throw the status quo and right wingers are by nature defenders of the status quo. Here we run into a problem. Is the definition of revolution dependent on physical violence?In the sixties I saw politics in black and white. Age has taught me the fallacy of that belief. The author makes a strong case that the Nazi's were more left than right. He starts from the premise that the Nazi were fascists. If you jettison that idea and compare Italian, Spanish, and German political movements you will see that the argument is pointless. It is not comparing apples to oranges, but there were enough differences to make the case that you can not place all three under the single umbrella of Fascism. One thing is for sure; the use of the word Fascist has become meaningless and without proper context in current discussions. I seek to be exposed to as many opinions as I can even if subscribing to the Nation and the National Review makes for an interesting dichotomy in my mailbox.

Instead, I found an exhaustive history of fascism throughout Europe and the United States. Although Goldberg is an admitted conservative, I felt he presented his case fairly objectively. Early on, he makes several references to fascist ideals during the Wilson and Roosevelt administrations. Not living during this period, (and frankly, finding some of his assertions hard to believe) I checked the references myself and found them to be indeed factual, which led credibility to the remainder of the book. At times, it does read like a dull history text, but after a while I detected a wry, understated humor that added life to the pages. I would strongly recommend this book for anyone wishing to increase their knowledge of the many forms fascism and its implementation."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This book is deliberately provocative. The basic thesis is that fascism is not a conservative phenomenon. Rather, early 20th century American progressivism shared many of its intellectual roots and sympathies, which were antagonistic to and dismissive of the concepts of \\"classical liberal\\" thinking that underlay the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution's system of limited powers of government and individual rights. The \\"modern liberal\\" in American politics, with his or her emphasis on the government's role in fixing racial, social and economic problems, is ideologically descended from the earlier progressives, hence beware of the nice guy with the smiley face who promises to make your life fulfilled and happy through the power of the state. Culture war partisanship aside, essentially this is a very important message and should inform our response to any politician's campaign promises and actions.However, there are many places where Goldberg's otherwise well-researched approach to the intellectual history of fascism and progressivism yields to his urge to force connections between the motivations for events at the turn of the century and what occurred, for instance, in the 1960's or today. There are numerous places in every chapter where he veers off to deliver a jab at some liberal or Democratic figure or another, and many instances where these barbs are based on an unfair reading of the historical facts. These will keep your adrenaline going, but really detract from the essential point and ironically lower the tone of the discussion to the level of socialist agit-prop. As you might guess, most of his invective is reserved for Democratic presidents and party leaders and \\"liberal\\" academics, although he does offer some critical discussion of the Teddy Roosevelt presidency and at the end takes a well-deserved shot at W for his willingness to grossly expand federal entitlement spending (Medicare D).I'm not sure you will accept his arguments 100%, nor should you in my opinion.

Well researched, well written, I am recommending this book to everyone who is a seeker of truth. A lot of information I am going to read the book again, now."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"While Goldberg's political activism is an important factor in his approach to many subjects, the proposition that organizes this book need not be read as a purely partisan project. He is challenging the conventional mapping of political systems on a geometrical model, that is, left vs right, with all the party allegiances and historical props that those catchphrases tend to suggest. So many casual readers will dismiss his thesis by reducing it to a straw man that would be unfair to him and harmful to themselves.The dichotomy of ideas organizing his analysis entails a battle between the virtues of liberal democracy and the ideals driving various collectivist political agendas. He's not mixing militarist fascism with class-struggle communism, or identifying either of those totalitarian schemes with the progressivist politics which values state solutions to human problems. These are cousins in the collectivist family, with some similar ideas but not all ideological roots in common.He is making a specific ideological connection between them, in their opposition to the values of classical liberalism (such as the right to private property, the right to a free market, and the responsible freedom of individual citizens in meaningful, local associations, as de Tocqueville famously observed in America.)The title \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is borrowed from H.G. Wells, which is an interesting source, because his collectivist vision is a progressivist, non-military, trans-national instance of the kind of political thinking on which Goldberg puts his finger. It's utopian in its goal, but Wells is driven by a fear of war between nation states, and by the need to equip people to survive; he understands the principle of T.H. Huxley's ethical evolution as turning around Darwin's survival of the fittest. Government can provide help--like 'universal education'--but it can't avoid the need for competition, which helps a person or species evolve.Contrast the too-peaceful Eloi and the too-savage Morlocks in the failed future in the 'Time Machine.' While one relies on lawfully peaceful existence without any struggle or pain or spirit (even if such 'communal' peace requires sacrificial victims), the other group has locked itself into the militarist pursuit of death (even if it dehumanizes them).Though he favors the classical liberalism of the American experiment instead, Goldberg probably likes Wells' positive vision better than he does a utopian communism or militant fascism, even though it's still collectivist."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Johan Goldberg's Liberal Fascism is a well researched and clear headed look at fascism and its home in progressive politics. Before it was tainted by the Nazi's and WWII, fascism was seen as the path to the promised land by many of the elites here and abroad. After the Nazi horror show irredeemably tainted fascism the progressives effectively tagged conservatives with many of its unsavory terms and associations, while their agenda remained true to the heart of Mussolini. Goldberg links the radicalism of the 60s to the earlier fascist movements, and he ultimately makes the links to contemporary America. Definitely a cut above much of what is out there and great background for anyone concerned about current political trends."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a tremendous book. Goldberg explodes the persistent -- and pernicious -- myth that fascism is part of the conservative's family tree. As you make your way through the book, it becomes apparent that Goldberg's challenge was not to find enough evidence to support his thesis, but to organize the overwhelming mass of favorable historical data to allow the presentation of his argument in a cogent and compelling way. In this, he succeeded. The book is chock-full of detail, much of it new (at least to me); obviously painstakingly researched; and still fun to read.The narration, however, is not equal to the text. For example, the narrator pronounces W.E.B. Dubois's last name \\"Doo-BWAH\\" in some places and \\"Doo-BOYS\\" in others. Non-words like \\"undoubtably,\\" \\"supposably,\\" and \\"conservativism\\" are heard throughout. Most annoying is the narrator's cheesy attempts to imitate the voices of quoted individuals.

Goldberg's main point is that, contrary to everything we have been taught since the mid-1930's, fascism is a SOCIALIST movement, not a \\"right-wing\\" (whatever that means) one. Obama, and to a slightly lesser degree, the Clintons, are the spiritual heirs of Nietzsche, Hegel, Emma Goldman, Wilson, FDR, and yes---Mussolini, and even Hitler. As the various corporatist initiatives of the Obama administration are rolled out, it is amazing (and frightening) to see how closely they track the early Italian and German fascist laws. Once we see that Hitler's virulent racism was not a necessary component of fascism at all, but rather something that he added to the fascism of Mussolini, Franco, the English fascists, etc. (who weren't adamantly racist or anti-semitic), we can begin to understand how the American intellectuals who were the lifeblood of the New Deal (e.g., Tugwell, Ickes, Perkins) could have so admired the early (clearly socialist) stages of Italian fascism, and even early Nazism. Hitler's party was not named the National SOCIALIST Party for nothing!If, to paraphrase Keynes, political leaders blindly push the ideas of (relatively) unknown philosophers of past decades, then we should all now be very, very afraid, because, as LF (written BEFORE Obama's election) prophesied, the \\"progressive\\", \\"liberal\\" roots of the new administration's goals are essentially fascistic in nature. IMHO, the hyper-statist views of the president's Chief of Staff, and the forced eugenics goals fervently espoused by his brother---both currently very senior US policy officials---go well beyond even Mussolini's brand of Italian fascism, and are frighteningly reminiscent of the policies of Italy's northern neighbor in the 1930's."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"IF PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WHATS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY, THEN THIS BOOK WILL CLEAR YOUR MIND."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"First of all, PW's review is predictable.

It seems as if he is taking his marching orders from NYT and HuffPuff, but I'm not sure; he or she (I'll use he from now on) is not thinking for himself or doing his own reading and research:So, how do conservatives feel about gays? Be honest now.ANSWER: FINE - People should be allowed to enter into any relationship they like. Even gay marriage. Some Republicans may say they are against it, but the majority of conservatives don't care.Questions like this make me think Kavity and his cronies don't know what a conservative is. Seems like he is depending on stereotypes and other people's thoughtless descriptions. So I'll tell him: Conservatives believe in freedom, liberty, individualism not collectivism, free markets (failure is a part of that, and cannot be successfully legislated away), and a small federal government that does not invade people's lives in every which way. We believe in states' rights - oh I know, how evil! We believe - horrors - in minimal taxes and the rule of law (something Obama has talked a lot about, BTW). We believe in the Constitution, but not as a living document - oh how terrible! Other than that - do whatever you want, have sex with who or whatever you like (just not a child - do liberals believe in man-boy or adult-child sex?) Just don't steal, commit murder, hurt a child, commit fraud, or be a bad neighbor. We do not believe in identity politics because is smacks of preference and racism. This definition, in the olden days, used to describe a classic liberal. How times have changed.How do conservatives feel about immigrants? No excuses.ANSWER: Okay, no excuses Kavity: We like them; they made the country great. We would, however, like to make it legal for those who come through illegally, so they can earn a decent wage, and we'd like to have them learn the national language, which is English, so they can make a really GOOD living. When in France you better speak some French. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Why can't we expect the same of those who come to America? What's s wrong with that? Why is it okay for Europe but not for us? We are a plural society, but we should all speak the same language and understand the same general social contract (a term I love that one of my lefty friends uses). And yes, it's the one that was here before my grandparents came and that still exists, although it's hanging by a thread.How do conservatives feel about legislating \\"morality\\" (their version)?ANSWER: Republicans may want to do it, but conservatives understand that freedom means freedom. We don't want much legislated, and we believe in the rule of law, and most of all individual liberty. We do want to legislate child abuse and child pornography, murder, theft, and fraud (how come liberal Eliot Spitzer never found out about liberal Democrat Uncle Bernie?). However, many conservatives believe that hate crimes are thought crimes, because, well, they are. Many conservatives feel that marijuana should be legalized. We are in agreement with many left wing vegan and vegetarians who do not believe abortion should be a common event. And chopping the head off of a 7, 8 or 9-month viable person in the womb should be illegal. If, as PETA says, a rat is a dog is a boy is true, then we should save the children who are in third trimester (and even younger fetuses) and get them into the adoption rolls once they are born. No reason for a mom to be burdened with a baby she cannot cope with. Many, many people would be overjoyed to help a needy mom and her baby and bring him or her into their lives. It's a wonderful thing. We have talked to moms who know they killed a viable 7, 8, or 9-month gestational person and they suffer for it terribly. It's an awful burden to bear that no women should have to live with. And if Dr. Tiller did not think these babies were people, why would the late doctor offer memorial services and funerals for the babies he has killed? We he sees them he certainly knows they are people and not \\"blobs.\\" BTW, conservatives condemn the cold blooded murder of Dr. Tiller - we did not dance in the streets and shoot guns in the air as some other groups did when 3000 innocent Americans were killed.How do conservatives feel about corporate interests vs. those of the individual? Not rhetorically, but in terms of voting behavior time and time again.ANSWER: I don't know how Republicans feel, but conservatives favor the individual - that's why so many of us run our own businesses. If business becomes successful we can hire lots of people. If it gets so big we can take it public, are we supposed to close it down? When Hollywood actors make millions, and license their names to product after product, should we stop them? Or should they be stopped only if they are conservatives or Republicans; the liberal actors can pull in as much as they want because \\"their heart is in the right place?\\"How do conservatives feel about the seperation of church and state? If left totally unchecked, would there be one?ANSWER, first of all, I cut and pasted these questions and left them as is - Kavity misspelled separation, (check his original review if you think I'm kidding) - understandable when you are not an original thinker. Anyway, not sure about Republicans, but conservatives believe in that s-e-p-a-r-a-t-i-o-n. But we also believe that religious groups and institutions do a lot of wonderful community organizing and are often best positioned to meet the needs of the needy people around them. They should be supported. I do not know of a single religious charity that discriminates against people of other faiths. If they do, they must be an anomaly or not be a conservative church. They must be something else. We also feel strongly about the idea of freedom of assembly. We do not believe the government should tell people they cannot invite a group of friends into their home to pray. Government - stay out of religion! BTW, I am an agnostic."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg has written a book the has the rare combination of being highly informative, well documented, logically argued, and immensely enjoyable to read.

He is very careful with the evidence---which clearly shows that Fascism is primarily a socialist phenomenon. Goldberg is, after all, well aware that his critics will exploit even minor inconsequential errors. The only substantial difference between Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin is that the Nazi's vision was restricted to those possessing imaginary Aryan racial characteristics. The latter gentleman at least paid lip service to the notion of international and racially inclusive socialism. There is also no such thing as a fascist libertarian. They were inherently hostile toward the individual freedoms of capitalism. Every last single one of them advocated a command economy where designated elites gave orders to the hoi polloi on how to carry out the economic aspects of their lives. The author points out the adulation of Benito Mussolini by numerous American left-wingers who adored the infamous Italian leader. Even British socialist H.G. Wells had kind words for the Nazis and thought them to be the positive wave of the future.The perverse doctrines of genetic superiority underpinned much of the infatuation of the West's elites with Nazi ideology. How many people realize, for instance, that the majority of academically credentialed liberals in the early 20th Century were outright racists? But please don't take my word on anything. Read the book and double check Goldberg's assertions. And if you do so---you will never again perceive Fascism as merely a right-wing phenomenon premised entirely on ancient traditionalist fantasies. You might even endure a personal existential and psychological meltdown."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I found so many parallels to today's thinking, it's scary.

How ideology has replaced religion."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The thesis of this book is that today's Liberals who demand increasing state-control, in matters of economics and sometimes free speech, share many political views in common with the infamous Fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini. The author cites extensive examples of how the Nazis (short for National Socialists) adopted many programs that reflect the modern ideals of the Democractic Party. These include, but are not limited to, universal health care, public education, guaranteed jobs, large state-guaranteed pensions and comprehensive campus speech codes. To illustrate the parallel, Goldberg extensively discusses the sharp increase of central economic planning amongst the administrations of Wilson, FDR, JFK up until the agenda of Hillary Clinton.This book is particularly rich in intellectual history. It delves into the infatuation of early 20th century intellectuals, such as notable Pragmatist John Dewey, with Mussolini's Fascist experiment in Italy. It also discusses the influence of thinkers such as:* Georg Hegel's influence on Nationalism* Georges Sorel's particular influence on Mussolini and his radical views on transforming a capitalist society through labor driven revolutions.* Herbert Croly's ideas on encouraging state-worship in his work \\"The Promise of American Life\\" and his influence on the Progressive movement.* Saul Alinsky's strategies on community political activism and his influence on modern Democrats such as Hillary Clinton.The major drawback of this work is that it is blatantly partisan, which is especially self-defeating on this topic. While the author has correctly labeled the Liberal desire to increase central economic planning as Fascist, he has failed to identify the Conservative drive to increase social control by bridging church and state as another, arguably more dangerous, form of Fascism. Since William F. Buckley, Conservatives have been trying to restrict individual rights by curtailing birth control, abortion rights, flag burning (an issue of free speech), immigration as well as bringing religious views, such as intelligent design, into government-run schools and imposing ever-greater security restrictions with no objective end in sight. The fact that the author conspicuously evades Conservative forms of fashion makes it difficult to believe that he is objective in his scholarship.In summary, this is an excellent book for all who are interested in the ideological origins of many Liberal forms of Fascism. However, I think this book could have been substantially better had it explored both Liberal and Conservative forms of Fascism without the blatant partisan bias."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg provides a stunning case of comparing liberalism and facsism. As he explains in the book, each country has their own flavor of fascism and not all them are the German variety with its extermination component.He shows the differences of the different countries's fascism and the antecendents of fascism. Generally, it comes down to statism in the name of the perfectability of man.Goldberg compares the various policies of liberals and fascism and backs it up with copious notes at the end of the book.Other books such as \\"The Forgotten Man\\" and \\"FDR's Folly\\" show the economic parallels.A list of the similiarities is too long to mention in this review. An example of just one is on page 365 and the Nazi policies regarding the Church in Germany.

It applies now more than ever.For the past 2 weeks I have periodically tuned into MSNBC, the home for liberal fascism on cable tv, as host after host lectured us on the larger evil implications of the shooting of Trayvon Martin. The unanimous conclusion is that Zimmerman is a racist and a cold-blooded murderer, never mind that no charges have been brought much less a trial. Indeed,in this liberal world, no opposing views are wanted.When a random guest even suggests that one might wait until the facts are known, he/she is hounded off the show. Liberal fascism at its best.Meanwhile, we have a President who decided that all Americans must buy health care, whether they want to or not, and whether they can afford to or not. Again, liberal fascism - Obama knows what's best for us. Fortunately, the Supreme Court is about to put Barack in his place.Liberalism has been, for the past 50 years, about making society's losers feel better about themselves at the expense of the winners. Since half the country can properly be categorized as losers, this accounts for its appeal. But the winners always vote, and they vote with a passion when liberals get out of hand. Can't wait for the 2012 elections!"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"True story: after reading this book, I had a conversation with a notoriously liberal friend where I asked: \\"Do you believe that society evolves along a certain path towards a set end? Do you feel frustrated that this change is too slow and advocate building a strong government to better organize people towards this end? Do you feel that the foundational Jeffersonian liberal democratic principles of America are expendable if they are found to be detrimental to this 'progress'?\\" Not understanding what I was getting at, he answered \\"yes\\" to all of three questions. I went on to expound that these are fascist ideas and nothing new to our modern civilization.His response was that I lost the argument because I called him \\"fascist\\".Sigh! The questions came from observations of this book's author and they are spot-on with what modern liberals really believe -- though modern liberals would not agree with the connection with fascism. And this is why books like this are needed. Jonah Goldberg does not so much mourn the existence of liberalism per se, but the total inability of its adherents to engage in any sort of self-critical introspection. There is no more dogmatically moralistic person than the committed liberal. No one is more certain of their own correctness; their own intellectual purity; and their own sanctity of intent, will, or purpose.Conservatives are aware of the skeletons in their closet and are made to atone even for those for which they carry less guilt than liberals (at the behest, of course, of shrieking liberals nonetheless).This is a fabulous book because it is right. It strikes the beast between the eyes and, like a good scientific theory, provides enough detail to create predictive models of behavior. The book predicts that my friend would have responded the way he did. Goldberg also lays to waste the old equivocating lie that \\"Communism is what happens when liberalism runs rampant, Nazi-ism is what happens when conversativism runs rampant.\\" And demonstrates the author's contention that America itself was once a fascist police state. This is more than adequately accomplished through thorough research and the many footnotes citing primary sources from around the world and throughout history. Not only is this a good read, but it is an excellent collection of resources: essays from Woodrow Wilson, the Nazi Party platform, how regulation favors and entrenches big businesses due to economy of scale, legal research on Hillary Clinton, newspaper articles on Mussolini, musings from Margaret Sanger, historical economic research, the role of Christians in the creation of America's first police state -- get this book, and you get this veritable treasure trove of raw historical data that directly challenges some of the most unfounded yet primal assumptions held by people today regardless of political leanings.Finally, this book has made me question my own political fervor. When conservatives constantly focus on laws and politics, we concede to a fundamental yet untenable liberal belief: that society can be changed and controlled through government. You cannot legislate morality, or make laws forcing people to be charitable. Laws will always reflect the beliefs of society and the government can only hope to change the way people think. The story of the lamenting Wilsonian socialists (\\"we planned in war\\") serves as a valuable parable: Culture will always trump law. Legalize whatever immoral behavior you like, if the society in general does not condone it, it will not be widely practiced. The true battlefield for our future is not in the hands of stuffed-shirt politicians but in the hands of the everyman, Joe America."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"[Number one and number two may be useful also!] First, every section of \\"Liberal Fascism\\" gives the reader oodles of really interesting stuff. Even readers who disagree vehemently with the theme of the book will like much of the historical material. Better, the author actually writes in an interesting style, a refreshing compliment to a gent who is considered sort of an \\"academic.\\" I.e., his style is neither heavy nor stuffy.The second thing to know about this book has to do with Goldberg's sometimes maddeningly casual use of the terms \\"fascism\\" and \\"fascist.\\" Now, this kind of problem would kill most books. Not here. Mentally you just tell the author that he can \\"get over it,\\" and so can you. In spite of other reviewers claiming that he doesn't actually define \\"fascism,\\" Goldberg does so several times through the book. The best one shows up early, page 23 (hardback), and it's a good one.This self-stated conservative writer actually ended up unintentionally (partially) making a case for neoconservative fascism as well! Goldberg gets partial intentional \\"credit\\" for this with his concluding chapter. In fact, in his last chapter he liberally - meaning \\"frequently\\" - names well-known neoconservative personages and politics, and shows their similarities with the many politically progressive individuals throughout the rest of the book. The reader can easily connect the two seemingly different philosophies. In the longer run, this almost certainly will be the book's most important contribution."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Goldberg knows his subject matter, knows it cold. Makes you wonder why more intellectuals haven't probed this same rich vein. Most things I've read on the matter were informative of institutions like the Frankfurt School, or of Frantz Fanon's \\"the Wretched of the Earth,\\" or of 'the Ten Planks of the Communist Manifesto,' with a coda concerning the Russian Revolution and the fall of the Rachmaninoff's. And where the Russo-Japanese War weakened the Czar, the 1st World War finished him off. But not much have I seen on Il Duce besides the newsreels of his final demise. And Hitler and the Nazi's? They were seen as quasi separate from Mussolini other than as a convenience for aiding in protecting the underbelly of the Nazi takeover of the European continent. Of course I jest a bit, but never have I encountered a tome quite like this one.That so many reviews here have done such a wonderful job of outlining the featured aspects of this book makes me want to weigh in from a different perspective. That is the timing of the rise of the utopian instinct in so many people, the one that blinds them to reality while animating their unfettered compassion with other peoples money. After all, Goldberg's assertions imply that the ideas of Georges Sorel, Martin Heidegger, Antonio Gramsci, Marx, Robespierre and Rousseau could only gain traction because of the surpluses created by free-market capitalism. In my research, thoughts of the collective are pretty sparsely spaced prior to Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" and his \\"Theory of Moral Sentiments.\\" But once the internal combustion engine helped spawn the steam locomotive, the railroads were born. And once Whitney's cotton gin increased the output capacity of a single cotton picking slave by as much as 50 to 1 in a given unit of time, a surplus of never before seen wealth was created making everyone both rich and poor increasingly better off.Goldberg's subtitle, 'the secret history of the American left from Mussolini to the politics of meaning,' draws a connective line from Mussolini's Italian fascism and Woodrow Wilson's dictatorial actions through Hitler's Nazi Socialism and Lenin's Communist Revolution, on thru parts of the soft-R Republicanism of George H.W. Bush, all the way thru to the Clinton administration. He dubs each one, including FDR's follies, in a continuum along a sort of piano-forte scale, as a version of a harder to softer totalitarianism. They all share common characteristics and that's the point of the book. None of this is new.In brief it's about putting every unit of society inside the State, one that's ruled by command and control experts who will decide how resources are allocated in direct contravention of the efficiency's of a free market pricing feedback mechanism. The State will also feature a dictator type with God and religion replaced summarily. One could offer an excuse for Teddy Roosevelt's progressive tendencies and for Wilson,Hoover, and FDR, perhaps even Nixon and Ford, but the rise of mainframes and their increasingly powerful computing capacity should inform any thinking statesman of the truth or falsity of utopian attempts to order society. It doesn't work. It depletes the surplus, the experts in the room do better, the middle class does worse, and the poor are merely bought off for the minimal sheckels they'll settle for. Net new job creation slows to a grind, and world trade slackens. And who will patrol and protect the sealanes?This book is timely as we're at a crossroads as a country ne as western civilization. We're borrowing to meet our operating needs and not to expand our economic surplus. If the entitlement pie continues to expand concommitant with a shrinking surplus, our problems will really escalate. Is there a way to pour the contents of 'Liberal fascism' into the collective heads of the masses? Silly me"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a most unusual and extremely important book, for it tells the true story of today's Liberal, a.k.a. \\"Progressive,\\" heritage. In doing so, it clearly tells the \\"rank and file\\" liberals (i.e., the \\"useful idiots\\") more than they know about the things they think they believe in, and certainly tells us MUCH more than today's Liberal elitists would ever have us know. The most unusual thing about the book, at least to me, is that it is one of the very few books which I have ever read which has something interesting and important to say on virtually each and every page. The most important thing is that it lets its readers in on the secrets of the Liberal movement, its fascist/socialist ideology, and the ongoing radical methods which that movement has used, and is using today, to destroy America as it was founded.Here are a few things of the many revealing things which you will learn by reading this book: Today's Liberalism and Fascism, Communism, Socialism, Progressivism, and Nazism all stem from the same roots, but there are differences --- some subtle, some extreme. Benito Mussolini originated fascism but remained an avowed socialist throughout his life. Progressives came up with the idea of a \\"living constitution\\" in order to further their ends and promote \\"crises\\" (economic, education, environmental, global warming, save the children, etc.), because crises demand immediate action without critical thought. Based on its definition and characteristics, the United States was the first nation to have a fascist dictator, Woodrow Wilson. Wilson's progressivism was rejected by the American people following World War One. America's Progressives supported Benito Mussolini's Fascism and Adolph Hitler's Nazism in the 1920s-30s, and vice versa. Joseph Stalin, the far-left socialist leader of the USSR, coined the term \\"Right-Wing\\" to denigrate what he considered to be Adolph Hitler's far-right wing \\"socialism.\\" Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) essentially resurrected Wilson's progressivism in the 1930s, but under a different name, \\"The New Deal.\\" Many of those in FDR's administration felt that people living in the Soviet Union \\"were the freeist people on earth,\\" but by their definition of freedom. The first minimum wage law, enacted during FDR's progressive administration, was proposed in order to price the Negroes out of the workforce. Black leaders during FDR's administration referred to his National Recovery Administration (NRA) as \\"the Negro Run Around.\\" Progressive intellectuals recognized a problem following World War II, in that they had steadfastly supported both fascism and Nazism prior to the war, so they dropped the term \\"progressive,\\" redefined \\"liberalism\\" to their satisfaction and began calling themselves Liberals. At the same time, they began calling \\"Classical Liberals\\" \\"Conservatives.\\" Then, picking up on the term Joseph Stalin used to describe Hitler's brand of \\"socialism,\\" they tagged \\"Conservatives\\" as \\"right-wing,\\" thereby falsely associating conservatism with Hitler in the public mind. (Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.) Lyndon Baines Johnson created the \\"myth\\" of Camelot in order to further his progressive agenda (doing FDR one better, with his \\"Great Society) and, by doing so, turned \\"Progressivism\\" into a full-blown religion. And finally, many progressive elitists are so firm in their beliefs that they consider anyone who disagrees with them as either ignorant or insane, and therefore, undeserving of debate. (You may have noticed --- Al Gore's \\"The debate is over,\\" for example. What debate?)Needless to say: This book has much to say which is not \\"politically correct.\\" But these are things which, for the sake of America and its people, must be said and which should have been said a long time ago. I hope everyone who reads this somewhat long-winded review will also read the book. It's quite good and, strangely enough, a real page turner."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Without hyperbole, LIBERAL FASCISM is one of the more important books on political theory to come out in a long time. It ranks up there, again without hyperbole, with some of the better works (not the average ones, but the better ones) of Thomas Sowell, and constitutes the best understanding of how totalitarian ideas enter society on the backs of the well-intentioned since the writings of Hayek. Yes, it is that good.Tell a lie enough times and people believe it. That fascism is a movement of the Right has been repeated so often and so reflexively that it simply constitutes assumed knowledge, the type of idea that is so clearly true that there is no need to discuss it. We simply take it as true and then continue with whatever conversation we are having that might touch upon fascism. As Jonah Goldberg demonstrates, however, this is a very false history.That the American interpretation and experience of Leftism shares common intellectual and ideological roots with those European ideas that coalesced into fascism may seem counterintuitive to us after decades of obfuscation. Yet such a commonality of ideas did not seem odd at all, either to those Leftists in America or those in Europe, when those ideas were actually taking shape and being used to implement social change in the name of progress. Although fascism was always controversial, it was not until its name really got dragged through the mud, primarily due to Hitler and the Holocaust, that fascism started being \`reinterpreted' as right wing. Yet such an interpretation is false. And despite fascism's bad name, many of our current policies and even assumed ideas, are directly traceable to the fascism of the Left.Goldberg goes deep, right to the actual ideas themselves, what those ideas were meant to achieve, and how those ideas were implemented into policy, to demonstrate that fascism was, and primarily still is, a movement of the Left. Particularly illuminating is Goldberg's exposition of the verbal and rhetorical tactics used by fascists to bypass meaningful debate and marginalize their opponents, as such tactics are still in wide use today. Fascists themselves are never ideological but are \\"beyond ideology;\\" they are pragmatic, without concern as to where an idea comes from but instead only concerned \\"with whether it works;\\" and want to move \\"beyond politics\\" in order to actually \\"do something.\\" Anyone who is familiar with modern Americans of the Left and Right will notice the continuation of this trend: Those on the Right recognize that they are on the Right even if it is only a slight tilt off-center; those on the Left, however, believe they are moderate, even if they are so far to the Left as to constitute an intellectual freak show. (My Leftist friends would call me an extremist for voting for Republican presidential candidates who actually win elections - thereby demonstrating that they are not far from the mainstream - while considering themselves moderates for supporting Ralph Nader or some Green Party nobody who was able to pull in maybe 3% of the vote)It would be nice to refer to this book as one of history. But, by one of those 'wonderful' coincidences life sometimes gives us, right as the book was going to print, the themes contained here came right to the foreground. A political leader shot right into public view with basically every single trope used by fascists to elevate themselves to power. Although not in the hardback edition, Goldberg adds an afterward to the paperback on the fascist themes paramount in the rise of Obama, and how he and his supporters fit the American interpretation of fascism almost to a T. Rarely has a book been so unintentionally prescient.LIBERAL FASCISM is too significant a book to be given justice in any single review here on amazon. Goldberg has achieved something very significant with this book. He has changed the terms of the debate. Given the frequency and consistency that those on the Left call those on the Right fascist simply for holding different opinions, that alone would be enough. That the fascist impulse is still alive, well and going strong, the understanding of the ideas underlying the trend towards fascism are still, unfortunately, deeply relevant today."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I read Jamie Glazov's \\"United in Hate.\\" Then came \\"Liberal Fascism.\\" These two books changed my thinking and my life.

The third chapter is especially enlightening about the current administrations motives and method of operation."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I finished reading \\"Liberal Fascism\\" by Johan Goldberg. This was an interesting read after reading Amity Shales, \\"The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression.\\" As I suggested that Shales' book is not quite in your face enough, Goldberg does this quite well. He may turn off some readers who have beliefs from the other side but overall he gets his points across in a pushy but not too insulting stile. Of course my favorite part was about Fascism and Economics. He devoted a whole chapter to how fascism and corporations are connected. Obviously, the point of the book is to say that fascism is something that is always blamed to be right wing but is not. Some people may not be sold until they get to the chapter on Economics.This book adds well to the debate of what is left and what is right. How most people my age and some much older and younger can sometimes believe that Republicans and right-wingers are the racists and the people that are only trying to hurt America. That if you want progress, you vote Democratic. If you are old and set in your ways (out-dated) you vote Republican. It is a shame that this book came out when we have a President who isn't the true conservative that Goldberg describes. Instead the reader may have a hard time comparing our idealized conservative and whom the media calls a conservative. This by the way is not the media's fault it is definitely our President's and many other Republicans who give right-wingers a bad name.The only problems I found with the book are, why dedicated a whole chapter to Hillary Clinton? If she were president I would understand. Now she is just a washed up first lady/senator who tried to run for President. This chapter was good at showing how Hillary's rhetoric is very much like Hitler and other fascist types but that could have been shown throughout the book. I believe that this book may in fact be lost in history because of this chapter. Who would want to read this book in 20 years if Hillary never progresses past Senator? The only other part of the book I didn't like was the grouping of Anarchists with leftists. Anarchy by definition is people who do not want government. That is what is truly extremely right wing. How can you group complete government control and no government control together? What I believe Goldberg means is Communists. This is because Communists believe that the process after Socialism, which is complete government control of the economy. That Communism would take place when people lived communally and the state dissolved away. This is of course what is in theory. Most people do not see it this way because of the way Communism and Socialism has been portrayed in real life. The government never faded away so people considered Socialism like 70% government control and Communism 100%. That is for another post.Overall, I was very impressed and hope that this book is passed on people who want to really know about the history of our great nation because Goldberg never says this but I believe it 100%. We are at a point in time where government is growing and growing. We haven't learned from our mistakes because we do not completely understand them. Goldberg does an excellent job of setting history straight so that Conservatives, Libertarians, and those ideas from our founding fathers can be brought forth again."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"It is about time someone wrote a factual account of the slime that is liberalism, and exposes these people for who they really are.

Fascism and its brethren aren't left wing in the slightest and the fallacy put forth that Mussolini was a stealth socialist because of his affiliations in his early years is just ludicrous and ignores the reality that he later went and smashed the presses at his old paper and had socialists, communists and liberals rounded up en masse.Horrible book unless you like being told you're right regardless of the facts."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"A sure way to make money and get air time on FoxNews is to write a book that tells the rabid right just what they want to hear.

According to the author the fact that Mussolini was once a socialist makes Fascism a form of socialism. According to this logic, since David Horowitz was once a Maoist and is now a Neo-Conservative, then Neo-Conservatism must be a form of Maoism. The fact that Nazism was also called National Socialism does not make Nazism a type of Socialism but that the term is a misnomer like the Russia's Liberal Democratic Party of Zhirinovsky which is actually an ultra nationalist party. The Nazi founder Anton Drexler used to be apart of the Fatherland Party which had recieved funds from the German military. Although the Nazis used some leftist rhetoric for a while they recieved heavy support from big industrialists and it was the right wing nationalists who formed a coalition with them helping to bring Hitler to power. The leftists in the Nazi movement were purged in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 after Hitler came to power.Contary to Goldberg says Liberal academics are not the heirs of fascism, such academics were suppresed under Hitler and Mussolini, much like what Horowitz is trying to do now. Also, under Hitler, religion was not purged from public policy. Both Hitler and Mussolini signed Concordats with the Pope and in Mein Kampf Hitler wrote that he was an agent of the creator. German soldiers during World War Two wore belts buckles that read \\"Gott mit uns\\" (God is With us). The head of the fascist government in Slovakia was Jozef Tiso a Catholic Priest. It is extremely deceptive of Goldberg to link FDR and other liberals with Fascism. The Liberty League and other American Fascist groups of that era hated FDR and even tried to overthrow him in a coup.Both Hitler and Mussolini supported the free market and their policies hurt the working class. Under them Unions and Strikes were abolished, state enterprizes were privatized, minnimum wage and safety regulations wer eliminated. In Italwy child labor was reintroduced and in both countries workers worked longer for less pay. Taxes were lowered on business, the inheritance tax was abolished in Italy while taxes were increased for the average person.

If not, I'll respect your diversity anyway."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The truth of the matter is that in terms of ideology the differences between Communism and Fascism are very, very small. Fascists are often mislabeled as \\"right-wing\\" because during the rise of Stalin all ideology that deviated from the Moscow approved line of Communism was dubbed \\"right-wing\\". Leon Trotsky, who was by no means a Nazi or right-wing conservative, was accused of trying to stage a Nazi coup and was labeled a \\"right-winger\\" by Stalin after his fall from favor. While in Germany the term \\"right-wing\\" usually referred to the different elements of the Weimar Republic of the time. An example of Fascist programs enacted by the Nazi party and Fascisti in Italy were: guaranteed employment for all citizens, confiscation of WWI profits, shared profits of labor, expanded old age pensions, communalization of department stores, outlawing of child labor, universal health care, and anti-smoking programs to name just a few. None of these programs can be called \\"right-wing\\" or Anti-Communist. Communism is an international struggle and as Karl Marx put it: \\"Working men have no country.\\" Fascists believed that the dreams of Communism can be made INSIDE a country, and did not need to be part of an international struggle or subservient to Moscow.Fascism has strong corporatist elements without completely subjugating industry under state ownership. While Communism, on the other hand, advocates the collective ownership of property and the organization of labor for the common advantage of all members. Fascist governments do maintain a significant control over private enterprise, but do not entirely co-opt it (as in, say, Communism). The German NAZI party, for example, considered themselves a \\"Third Way\\" between laissez-faire capitalism and socialism, in that rather than completely nationalizing industry and taking over the means of production, the government had a very powerful influence over it. That was the principle difference, as all Communist regimes have embraced corporatism in some aspect in their history. Hitler and Mussolini both wanted to create Volksgemeinschaft or \\"peoples (workers) communities.\\" Communism and Fascism are two sides of the same coin, extreme but separate visions of the same ideology, with Fascism not being as controlling to private business as Communism but still very totalitarian. Keep in mind the Nazi (NSDAP) party was called the National SOCIALIST party, if that is any indication of their true leanings."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonah Goldberg's first full length literary effort \\"Liberal Fascism\\" carefully examines the ways in which the history of fascism diverges from the commonly held myths on the subject. While it doesn't read like a \\"homework assignment\\", neither is it typical of his other work where he uses his acerbic wit to delight his fans on the right and enrage his opponents on the left. This is no Ann Coulter book; it's not designed to get anyone's goat. It's a serious work that clearly demonstrates a continuous line of logic from Italian Fascism, and German \\"National Socialism\\", straight to the American Left of today.He so effectively challenges such a fundamental piece of liberal dogma, that his critics on the left will no doubt accuse him of heresy. But such a substantive work is not going to be dismissed so easily. In the end they will have no choice but to actually read the book and attempt to critique it on its own terms. I don't envy them their task. It's such a well documented work that's going to take a true philosophical contortionist to refute it without many obvious and undermining logical contradictions.By treating the subject seriously he's raising the dialog between left and right, even if some would prefer it otherwise. And years from now this book will be viewed as a cornerstone moment in the political conversation between the left and right. By adjusting the placement of the current political labels, he's revealed a little more of the truth rather than obscuring it, as his more disingenuous critics will certainly claim.It's a great effort and well worth the read by both his fans and detractors."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Fascism has historically been associated with the Right, meaning an Authoritarian system of government, acting in league with corporations.

While I am not one, I am a political junkie, and enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Over the past decade, the ideological battle between liberals and conservatives has been fought on the internet and in the local bookstore. Whether it is Al Franken calling conservatives liars, or Ann Coulter imploring her followers to refrain from speaking to liberals, the public has been inundated with many opinions from which to choose. Conservative writer Jonah Goldberg has recently joined the fray with Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left from Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning. Though Franken, Coulter, and others like them are long on opinion and short on truth, Goldberg's contribution is well thought out and based on facts. In Liberal Fascism, Goldberg traces liberalism from its origins in the nineteenth century through its maturity in the twentieth century while cleverly showing how it fed off the European Fascism movement. He then brings the reader to the Liberal Fascism of today.Although this is Goldberg's first book, he is no stranger to the written word. According to his biography on the web site National Review Online, where he is an editor,Goldberg is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, and his syndicated column appears in the Chicago Tribune, New York Post, Philadelphia Inquirer, and many others. He also appears as a political commentator on a number of television shows including \\"Good Morning America,\\" \\"Larry King Live,\\" and \\"Special Report with Brit Hume.\\" Though a writer since his college days, his big break came when he wrote about the media frenzy surrounding his mother, Lucianne Goldberg and her role in the Monica Lewinsky/Bill Clinton scandal of the late 1990s. She advised Linda Tripp to tape record her conversations with Lewinsky and to convince her to save the now-infamous \\"blue dress.\\"From the introduction, entitled \\"Everything You Know About Fascism is Wrong,\\" Goldberg grabs the reader's attention. He quotes the late George Carlin, \\"When fascism comes to America, it will not be in brown and black shirts...It will be Nike sneakers and Smiley shirts.\\" (1) This statement should remove any question about the artistry of the book's front cover: a large yellow smiley face complete with a Hitler mustache. While lengthy, the introduction spells out exactly what Goldberg is going to tell the reader in the remainder of the book. It is no mystery that he believes we are living in a time where the fascistic bent of Italy's Mussolini and Germany's Hitler are being blended with the quasi-socialistic policies of presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Lyndon Baines Johnson.After the introduction, Goldberg leads the reader through a fascinating history of the rise of fascism in Europe. Although Benito Mussolini, the leader of Italy, has been vilified, mostly due to his association with Hitler and the Third Reich, we are reminded that for the good part of a decade, he was considered a great leader. In 1923, the New York Times boasted that, \\"Mussolini is a Latin [Teddy] Roosevelt who first acts and then inquires if it is legal. He has been of great service to Italy at home.\\" (27) Noted Americans such as humorist Will Rogers, Hollywood mogul Lionel Barrymore, and legendary journalist Lowell Thomas proclaimed his greatness. On the international scene, Sigmund Freud and Winston Churchill were quite smitten with him. In addition, James A. Farrell, the president of U.S. Steel Corporation, said he was \\"\`the greatest living man' in the world.\\" (29) Goldberg concludes the Mussolini chapter with a brief description on how Mussolini gained his beliefs, first as a socialist then as a fascist, ending with his ill-fated attempt to flee to Switzerland in 1945 when he was captured by Italian partisans and executed.Mussolini might have been remembered more favorably had he not associated himself with the subject of the next chapter, Adolph Hitler. Goldberg leads the reader on a brief history of the rise of Hitler and how he became so enamored with socialism. Students of history will be familiar with the 1923 \\"Beer Hall Putsch\\" and his subsequent imprisonment where he wrote the infamous Mein Kampf, as well as the efforts to promote Germany in the 1936 Olympics and the murderous \\"Kristallnacht\\" of 1938. Here, Goldberg begins to paste together how today's liberals use the term Nazi to describe those who call themselves conservatives. He says that the left \\"cherry-pick[s] the facts to form a caricature of what the Third Reich was about...[with] the desired effect to cast Nazism as the polar opposite of Communism.\\" \\"[The] roles of industrialists...[are] greatly exaggerated, while the very large and substantial leftist and socialist aspects of Nazism...\\" are minimized. (57) Rather than being a right-wing conservative as many on the left would proclaim, Hitler should be considered a leftist because Nazism \\"...emphasized many of the themes of the later New Lefts...the primacy of race...an emphasis on the organic and holistic - including environmentalism, health food, and exercise - and...the need to \`transcend' notions of class.\\" (59)Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt are the subjects of the next two chapters and each provides a bridge from which fascism in Europe crosses over to the United States. One could argue, as Goldberg does, that Wilson was the grandfather of modern liberalism in America. Back then, liberals were called progressives and Wilson led the way with a progressive agenda, including proclaiming the Constitution's series of checks-and-balances as outdated and by furthering the Darwinian cause of a \\"living Constitution.\\" Wilson also formed the \\"West's first modern ministry for propaganda\\" in the Committee on Public Information (CPI). This group implored Americans against protesting the country's involvement in World War I. Another Wilson organization, the War Industries Board (WIB), was fascist in that it dictated to the business community what would be produced by the nation's industries under the banner of nationalizing the people for war. Throughout the section on Wilson, Goldberg paints a bleak picture of how America was nearly swallowed up by a type of benevolent dictatorship. Goldberg is equally repulsed by the Roosevelt years. He reminds the reader that Roosevelt was the only president to break with the tradition of George Washington by serving more than two terms. Moreover, he compares Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration with Wilson's WIB, saying that the former was modeled on the latter. Throughout these two chapters Goldberg deftly cites example after example of how these two presidents, considered great by many - Wilson for his Fourteen Points and Roosevelt for supposedly ending the Great Depression - did more than anyone up to that point to introduce socialism and fascism into American culture.Before bringing the reader into the latter half of the twentieth century, Goldberg shifts to the decade of the 1960s. On its face, the chapter is important because it lays the groundwork for upcoming criticism on John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Unfortunately, for the reader, it is here that he provides minutia that keeps an otherwise informative and entertaining book from flowing by chronicling the histories of radical organizations such as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Black Panthers, and the Weathermen. If one were to skip this chapter, however, one would miss the author's wry sense of humor that was disbursed throughout the book. For example, Goldberg laments the fact that one of Fidel Castro's closest compatriots, Che Guevara \\"...has become a chic branding tool... [representing] a disgusting indictment of...American consumer culture.\\" (193) He goes on to say that Guevara's likeness has made its way onto shirts and even toddler onesies. Depending on one's viewpoint, Guevara could be described as a misunderstood revolutionary or a mass murderer, but he is popular with the left because he is associated with an idol of the left, Fidel Castro. He arguably killed more people than Mussolini and was as despicable as Nazi SS Chief Heinrich Himmler. Nevertheless, Goldberg wittingly asks, \\"Would you put a Mussolini onesie on your baby? Would you let your daughter drink from a Himmler sippy cup?\\" (194)John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, the two presidents from 1961 to 1969, are thoroughly dissected and each given their own chapters. Johnson's \\"Great Society\\" certainly gives Goldberg plenty of fodder for blasting a program that was built upon the New Deal. No political commentator who wants to keep his conservative credentials supports Johnson's program in any way, and Goldberg lives up to the task of describing how the Great Society has been detrimental to the country.Tying fascism to modern liberalism is the task of the remaining third of the book. Chapter Seven discusses the subject of eugenics. One of the staples of modern liberalism is the support for unfettered abortion. Margaret Sanger, the woman credited with the founding of Planned Parenthood and who is one of the heroes of the Left, \\"...sought to ban reproduction for the unfit and regulate reproduction for everybody else.\\" (271) In 1939, she created the \\"Negro Project\\" where she attempted to control the black population's ability to reproduce. Her plan was to eventually allow the black race to die out. One could find similarities in her ideas and those of Hitler's Nazi Party.Hillary Rodham Clinton, the current junior senator from New York, former first lady, and recent presidential candidate, is the focus of Chapter Nine, \\"Brave New Village.\\" When this book was published in 2007, she was the likely Democratic Party nominee for president. As of this writing, it does not appear that she will meet that goal. Her competitor, Barak Obama, a senator from Illinois, will take her place on the ticket. Goldberg must have been sure that she would get the nomination (Barak Obama is only mentioned on two pages) as he chronicled her history and picked apart her designs on moving the country even farther to the left. It would be a stretch to call her book, It Takes A Village, her version of Mein Kampf, but Goldberg does emphasize that part of her plan for America includes early governmental involvement with children and reeducating them in the elementary and secondary public school system, similar to the plan that Hitler used in 1930s Germany.For the student of the period's historiography, Goldberg does an excellent job of highlighting the ways that liberal scholars have been able to slant history in a way that puts the New Left in the best light. With over fifty pages of notes and hundreds of references, his documentation is sound. He has successfully demonstrated that much of what has been accepted American history has been distorted. Students of an earlier generation were taught that Woodrow Wilson died of a broken heart because the Senate did not ratify his League of Nations. Goldberg teaches us that we nearly went down a path that changed the Constitution. Similarly, we had been taught that Roosevelt got the country out of the Great Depression. Again, we learned here that Roosevelt's initial plans were not that much different from those of Hitler and Mussolini. In Liberal Fascism, the myths are exposed and the foundation upon which modern liberal fascism has been built is shown. Goldberg, of course, is an anti-Liberal Fascist and would like to bring the country farther to the conservative side. He is saying through his book that the only way to understand how to dismantle the New Left establishment is to know how it was first put together."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I first borrowed this book from the library thinking it would be a quick read from another Fox News political pundit providing moral encouragement to those facing a world of lefties. I quickly realized that Goldberg has authored a scholarly work with hundreds of references tracing the common philosophical origins of Italian Fascism, German Nazi-ism and American Progressivism. I purchased Liberal Fascism for my personal collection.Lefties: you will hate this book, but the left has tarred conservatives for years as being fascists, so you can't blame the guy for using actual history to counter those accusations. If you'd stop seething long enough to understand what Goldberg is saying, you will find that he is not condemning all progressive policies, nor is he saying that American progressives, Democrats, or liberals are equivalent to the evil regimes of Hitler and Mussolini. Set aside Hitler's racism and the atrocities of those regimes, and look only at the underlying economic and social policies. They will look familiar to anybody who's read the Democratic platform. Besides, Goldberg says we're \\"all fascists now,\\" pointing even to Bush 44's compassionate conservatism.My critique of the book is that it drags out in the ninth and tenth chapters as Goldberg struggles to make the book relevant for the day's politics, which, by time I read the book in 2013, were dated. Chapters one through eight are gems, although there is some redundancy as he repeats prior-mentioned themes from different angles. Finally, readers should think critically of Goldberg's arguments and go back to the original sources. By way of example, I disagree with Goldberg's characterization of Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum. Leo did not propose \\"corporatism or syndicalism in response to the dislocations of the Industrial Revolution,\\" although Pius XI certainly did in the 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, even by name and with a textbook definition. It's an important distinction in the timeline, because attributing \\"syndicalism\\" to Leo in 1891 would suggest the church blazed the trail for fascism, whereas attributing \\"syndicalism\\" to Pius in 1931 would suggest the church was influenced by the early successes of Mussolini's fascism. I suspect that Goldberg may have gotten a few other things wrong, too, but the preponderance of evidence is there to agree with his general thesis: Italian Fascism and German Nazi-ism were left-wing socialist movements and have the same philosophical origins as American Progressivism.The critique notwithstanding, I loved it. Goldberg, taught me much that I didn't know, provided me with an endless list of supplemental reading, and entertained me along the way with his fast-paced, easy writing style."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Excellent primer on the political scales (far left - statism, far right- anarchy) and the history of the far left progressive movement in the US.

Heavy handed title for a narrow synopsis of the origins of modern American political thought. Essentially, somebody finally connected the dots and published what has been a recognised fact in academic circles for years in a format that the general public can access.The title is, however, misleading.Both American Conservatives and American Liberals have, within their parties, a basic connection to the social and philosophical movements of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from which have grown the recognizable political systems of the modern industrialized world.Although other authors have covered similar ground before, this book is geared for the general reader and will not require a professor to explain it, simply a library card to research it. Read the book, take notes, research the notes and make up your own mind; pablum is for infants, Kool-Aid is for kids, and critical analysis should be implemented by adults.Although furious debate has already sprung up over the book, the real questions concerning it's impact are the following two:1) Will the people that won't buy this book, due to the title, read any of it objectively before heaping condemnation upon it?2) Will the people who are gleefully buying it, for the title, read any of it with an open-mind before they blithely ignore it's implications and mis-quote it?"},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This was an easier read than I expected.

Intellectually lazy reviews, since they are obviously \\"right\\" and the author is obviously \\"wrong?\\"I smell a lot of bad motives in those reviews.

I believe it was Ferris Buehler who had something to say about ism's during his day off, if I recall correctly, he was quite right \\"one should not believe in an ism, they should believe in themselves\\" Goldberg, to this point, is really stating that people on the right (if we even know what directions are what after reading some of this book) believe in citizens helping themselves and accomplishing their goals without the government stating what their goals are. The left, believes in everyone providing for each other and a gurantee of some type of success, a collective society. So, you can't help people that don't want to help themsevles is what I believe.

Of course, most people are versed in neither (witness the otherwise inexplicable election of a continuous, oozing flow of leftists); therefore, this popularization of arguments advanced more forcefully elsewhere is welcome.The single, although significant, downside of the book is its utter futility.

IF you can answer that question correctly, you will know that Socialism is not much different than any form of Communism or Fascism. So what is the difference? The only difference between Socialism and Communism/Fascism is that Socialist governments will pay, individuals; whether business or not, for what the government takes. IN Communism/Fascism, the government takes anything without payment. In any form of Socialism, government control and individual rights are squashed. Just study history... Suggestion: If you like socialism, vote for a Democrat/Liberal... But beware; it is not different from Communism. Because the one common denominator of Communism, NAZI, Fascism, Socialism is Socialism itself! Each and every socialist government through history is dressed a little different but it is the same dress when stripped of all the black and white lace. And just for clarification for the uneducated, black means bad and white means good.Here is a definition of fascism that does not mention dictator: A social and political ideology with the primary guiding principle that the state or nation is the highest priority, rather than personal or individual freedoms. &lt;...>That explains the fine line between socialism and communism.... Don't you think?If you want confusion by liberals, Google: define: fascism... you will have several answers to choose from and some actually are opposites. LOL I suggest that several were written by socialist/liberal professors. I wonder if Noam Chomsky wrote any of the definitions. He is a socialist/liberal professor who hates capitalism. He makes all his money from capitalism and is wealthy. He also hates the USA but makes much of his money from government contracts. He doesn't admit that in his books, which advocate socialism/communism.Just consider the social differences between socialism, communism and fascism. Basically everything is controlled by the government in socialism, fascism or communism... So what is the difference? Think about it... When stripped of the fluff... they are almost the same. Total control by the government: IE: Your girl children given birth control without your permission. You are not allowed to pray in public. (Communism, Fascism or Nazi), High taxes... Socialism, Communism and Fascism all have high taxes... Liberals do as well... Interesting similarity there... Your children taught in public schools about sex, Evolution, hate for capitalism... and taught that God does not exist! Those are mantras of Communism and Fascism... How can they not be alike?Now here is what is really interesting...Why would a wealthy person such as Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, Teresa Heinz Kerry, Warren Buffet, Noam Chomsky and George Soros (to name a few) want socialism and more taxes when they made/make all their money utilizing free enterprise and Capitalism? There is only one answer. Power!Imagine a socialistic society: 100% Free health care, 100% unemployment benefits, 100% Free Education, your wages controlled by government... (Minimum wage and restrictions on how much you can make or acquire) 100% entitlement from cradle to grave, etc. etc. etc. Five percent of the people will still have 95% percent of the money. And they (the five percent) will not have any competition. In other words, opportunity for the 95% (most of you) will be zip, nada, nothing.... IE: North Korea, Cuba, Iran, France, Germany... In France the socialists passed a law that prohibits employers from terminating any employee 25 or younger, so employers don't hire young people... So much for socialist opportunity...Capitalism like socialism... 5% have 95% of the money... However, I am happy to say that capitalism allows the 95% to have the opportunity to climb into the 5% bracket... I promise you that socialism in any form will take that opportunity away from you. If the USA is so bad, why do so many people strive to live here from other countries? Many have risked life and limb to come to a country that stands for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But I guarantee you, history proves that socialism is not the answer, but do you think the socialists will admit that? In the late 50s, before he had the power, do you think Castro told anyone in Cuba that he would control all the money? Well don&iexcl;t expect the liberal politicians to put it that way either! LOLNow for your information, I have not read the book yet. So how could I possibly understand the term \\"Liberal Fascism? When I went to school, we were taught government and history of those governments during the 5th thru 12th grade. I learned in school the true differences of each type of government. Again, the ONLY common denominator among all socialist governments, no matter what you call them: Is Socialism! I suspect it is not taught in school anymore. Who's in charge of the schools? Ah, the socialists are! Oh, I'm sorry, I meant liberals. And considering their reactions to the book, I would submit they do not want you to know they are socialists.I submit this question to you: Why does this book piss off all the liberals? The liberals have been condemning this book for months before it was published. Alan Combs is infuriated by this book. Why can't anyone, especially liberals, admit that Welfare, Medicare, Social Security, Unemployment Insurance, Minimum wage, limited incomes, more taxes, entitlements and such; are socialism? Liberals start talking about the atrocities sanctioned by Hitler and Stalin to derail you from thinking about the Common Denominator: Socialism. Hitler and Stalin's governments were socialistic as is Cuba and North Korea. Germany, France, Canada and Great Britain have become socialistic and they are not dictatorships. And all those countries are struggling economically compared to the U.S. All socialistic governments lead to decline both economically and socially. Name one socialist government, past or present that is as successful as the USA. You cannot do that!Am I against helping someone, of course not? That is another matter which I would gladly address if you request my solutions to Welfare and such.If someone will not do for themselves, why would they do more if there efforts are for the benefit of others? They will do less, and that is why socialism is a poor choice for America. Do you want America to do less?Here is a letter that socialists/liberals may hate if they understood it. It is called:\\"A Message to Garcia I suggest you read it. And think about it next time you want some \\"whine and cheese! &lt;...>If you would like to contact me, please do at &lt;...>.

For decades, liberals denounce everything they dislike as \\"fascist.\\" Now the left is in uproar when they are on the receiving end.The great merit of Liberal Fascism is that Jonah Goldberg uses liberal icons' own words and deeds speak for themselves. Liberal fascism is a term created by H.G. Wells. Wells used it approvingly. Goldberg provides a chilling quote from the first modern liberal president, Woodrow Wilson that the leader provides the power while \\"others supply only the materials on which that power operates ... It is the power which dictates.\\" The next modern liberal president, Franklin Roosevelt, who established the model for liberal economics, said that his policies were more \\"orderly\\" than what Russia and Hitler were doing. New Deal and Fascist officials praised each other.Their deeds were even worse than their words. Wilson jailed thousands whose only crime was criticizing the war. Wilson denied mailing permits to 400 periodicals, effectively putting them out of business. Wilson prosecuted a man for saying in his own home that he did not want to buy Liberty Bonds.Both Wilson and Roosevelt pursued fascist economics. Under Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration (NRA), businesses were given a Blue Eagle to display. The government encouraged informants to monitor businesses. On one day in 1933, the NRA shut down much of New York for a Nuremberg type parade. Roosevelt jailed an immigrant dry cleaner, Jacob Maged, for three months for charging 35 cents to press a suit. Roosevelt wanted dry cleaners to charge 40 cents. Roosevelt ordered the slaughter of six million pigs and paid farmers not to grow crops while people were starving.Here are the common features of liberal fascism:- Creating a crisis atmosphere to panic the public into accepting an agenda- Worship of the state- Use of socialist economic policies, though usually through regulation rather than direct ownership- Mobilizing society to cooperate to solve national problems (\\"the moral equivalent of war\\")- Obsession with identity politics- Demonizing certain groups (Jews, white males)- Undermining parental authority so that children are more loyal to the state- Limiting debate through regulations (examples include McCain-Feingold and codes against \\"hate\\" speech) and dominating communications (academia, entertainment, mainstream media)Goldberg's book is often prescient. Recently Senator Clinton proposed a five-year freeze on interest rates, a typical example of fascist economics. The racial and gender discussions in Democratic primaries show that identity politics is alive and well.Goldberg goes after some types of conservatism, criticizing The Weekly Standard's \\"National Greatness\\" advocacy and President Bush's compassionate conservatism.What's now called conservative should be call \\"classical liberalism.\\" A better term for modern liberals is progressives, or socialists.Given the title and cover page, it is not surprising that Goldberg attracted a lot of hostility. However, Stanley Payne, perhaps the leading historian of fascism said inA History of Fascism, 1914-1945that fascism is a heresy from revolutionary Marxism. This confirms a key point of this book.Modern day fascist tactics have nicer motivation than that of the dictators; but the road to hell is still paved with good intentions. Unfortunately, fascist tactics often work. Fascist politics have a demagogic appeal. It is much easier to expand government than to cut it back. The power government accumulates can be used to shut up critics and give more power to government. Those who only want to run their own lives are at a disadvantage when dealing with those determined to boss others around. The good news is that thanks to our founding principles, America is much better placed than other countries to resist liberal fascism.Update (February 2013):I added the information from Stanley Payne's book in a paragraph above. Since the original review I've checked some of Goldberg's research against his sources. It always checks out.At a popular online encyclopedia several editors seriously object to a quote from Harold Ickes' diary about the New Deal's sources. At first I cited this book as a source. An editor removed it, saying that it is unreliable because even the title didn't pass his \\"BS detector.\\"To satisfy myself I went straight to the horse's mouth. I bought Ickes diary on Roosevelt's first term,The Secret Diary of Harold L. Ickes, the First Thousand Days, 1933-1936. In the entry for October 5, 2012, Ickes and Roosevelt talk about the beginning of the New Deal. Roosevelt tells Ickes:\\"what we were doing in this country were some of the things that were being done in Russia and even some things that were being done under Hitler in Germany. But we were doing them in an orderly way.\\"Using the Ickes diary as a reference I put the quotes back in the New Deal article. Guess what? It was removed under the encyclopedia's policy against primary sources. This was in spite of the fact that the article used several primary sources to support several block quotes nearby. It didn't matter to the editor that the encyclopedia uses Ickes' diary in other artles related to the New Deal. Even though the encyclopedia allows exceptions, liberals don't tolerate accurate quotes they dislike.One editor said that secondary sources from academia are best. So I went to JSTOR and found the quote in an article by Lewis Feuer. Feuer was a highly regarded professor. The article was in a Johns Hopkins publication. I was confident that no one would question an impeccable secondary source. Next came the silliest excuse for censorship I've ever seen. The quote was removed. The reason was that the quote was \\"ominous.\\" On the talk page the editor said that high school kids would read the quote and think it was a reference to \\"FDR's atrocities,\\" whatever they were. The article is about economic policies in the 1930s, not atrocities, real or imagined. I hope high school students and teachers aren't as bad as this editor thinks they are. I can't imagine a real encyclopedia editor behaving this way.I'll keep trying. The behavior of the encyclopedia's editors vindicate Goldberg."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Somewhat over the top, but the author sticks pins into a lot of hypocritical balloons. Definitely worth the price."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Jonathan Goldberg the author of \\"Liberal Fascism\\" is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times and a contributing editor to the William F. Buckley Jr periodical \\"National Review.\\" Goldberg is a conservative who has researched the rise of liberalism and statism in the body politic in the United States.Summary of Contents: In this 405 page work the author discusses his thesis that:a. Fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany were both stepchildren of Marxism-Communism. These movements promise utopia on earth and foster the growth of government at the expense of individual liberties.b. Woodrow Wilson, FDR and the Clintons have sought to make government more intrusive into the lives of ordinary citizens while at the same time adding strength to the power of the federal government.c. Many progressives such as Teddy Roosevelt were also bellicose seeking the growth of the American empire. There were also many progressives such as TR, Margaret Sanger, H.G. Wells and others who were Anti-Semitic believing in the superiority of the white race.Goldberg defines fascism as a secular religion which invests power in a strong central state. Religion is given short-shriftby those in power. The State replaces God. Shades of Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Huxley\\"s \\"Brave New World\\" are palpalbe.The book may infuriate, frustrate or inspire the reader. It will, however, get you thinking about the future of the United States and the need to protect our Constitutional liberties. Well done."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I have just finished reading this book and found it very interesting. I'm originally from Latin America and the thesis of this book is in agreement with what occurs there today: the re-edition of military rule policies from the 60/70 (not to say its state of mind) in today's left ridden LA - the case I'm most familiar with is Brazil.What I take from this book (and Jonah doesn't say it explicitly) is that people who want to reach harmony and well-being at any cost will think alike and end up creating the same type of fascistic state of mind. I say that by observing the Health & Safety regulations in the office where I work (and never had one accident). It starts well intentioned, but it is a task taken with gust particularly by the most callous, unpleasant and authoritarian personalities (in my case, the person is also a vegetarian and environmentalist). In the end, this type of people tries to control every aspect of your work live.Irrespective of what you might think of the thesis the Author presents, it is worth for the historical information J. Goldberg describes while defending it. Particularly interesting are the biography of Mussolini, the accounts of life under Nacional Socialist German Worker's party and the revolts in the American universities during the 1960's. The chapter about Hillary Clinton is probably the most enlightening and shows how much I didn''t know about the intellectual background of most of politicians.Jonah Goldberg exposes his ideas in a logical and consistent way, and they are well referenced too. I suppose several books could be written (or read) about each chapter - and that I plan to do anyway. I look forward to read other books by this Author."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a terrific book that I almost missed. Frankly, I was going to pass on it because I had viewed Jonah Goldberg as a bit of a wise acre and didn't realize he had a book like this in him. And the title and the cover art, while attention getting, contribute to the idea that this is going to be a lightweight attack piece. I guess the title and cover art got a lot of attention and helped the book sell well, but I only read it because a friend told me I shouldn't miss it. I am glad my friend brought it to my attention because it is a valuable book and will provide great information to anyone who is willing to actually read it rather than surmise what it says one way or the other.If you have doubts or objections to what you think the book might be saying, I encourage you to start with the Afterword in which he anticipates many of the likely criticisms of the book and also shows where he believes conservatism can run off the rails. This is not the one sided or wild-eyed attack piece some have claimed it to be. Goldberg shows us what an imprecise and slippery epithet fascism has become. He then takes us back to the father of fascism, Mussolini, and shows how it grew out of the Progressive movements alive in American and Europe and uses the writings of intellectuals of that movement to show the linkage and their praise of Pre-Hitler Mussolini.Goldberg then demonstrates how Hitler was a man of the Left and how the accusations of his being \\"right wing\\" have to be understood as accusations against a nationalist socialist movement from the USSR's internationalist (read Moscow dominated) communist-socialist movement. The author is CLEAR and says many times that he is not saying that the left wing in general and especially that the left of today is NOT guilty of the holocaust nor is he saying that their policies would lead to such a monstrous outcome.We next move to Woodrow Wilson through to Franklin Roosevelt and the ways in which they introduced fascist policies within America and in our foreign policy. The kind of public suppression of individual liberty and thought under Wilson is swept under the rug today and I hope the events Goldberg describes in this book get brought back into popular awareness. We would be horrified at someone being shot for refusing to say the pledge of allegiance, but in that time it was seen as a justifiable and heroic act!Franklin Roosevelt's true history is getting broader play today and the all but universal praise he received in my youth is justly being reconsidered. This book does a fine job in setting those policies in a clear context of the worldwide progressive and fascist movements. Remember, you cannot use your present suppositions about what fascism means to judge this use of the term. It was a term that was used with praise prior to World War II and the holocaust.Chapter 5 takes us through the 1960s and the cultural revolution that revived many of the fascist notions and spread them into the radical youth who are now striving for power in our political (and economic) institutions today. Chapters 7 reviews how eugenics was originally stated and how its echoes remain in present left-progressive policies (without their advocating the kind of eugenics policies that seemed so useful to intellectual advocating social and racial hygiene a century ago). Chapter 8 tours the economic bargains the participants in various progressive economies were willing to strike with fascism. Goldberg shows clearly why big companies are no longer capitalist and why they work for state protection from competition, for tax breaks and subsidies, and end up supporting progressive-left state policies.Chapter 9 is a useful and clear headed analysis of the kinds of policies Hillary Clinton and her progressive compatriots advocate and how they have changed the techniques of persuasion in order to sell the old progressive nostrums in the name of \\"the children\\". We see clearly our own acceptance of these old fascist notions and how the old-time religion of individual liberty and limited government is weakening under the administrations of BOTH the Democrats and Republicans, especially George W. Bush.This is a very useful book and I hope it is widely read and discussed seriously. We don't need any shouting down, spitting, or claims about what the books says or proves that it doesn't say for itself. In any case, Goldberg has my sincerest praise for his accomplishment. Superbly done. Thanks, Jonah."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"I have family who grew up in Nazi Germany, dodged communists, crossed the Iron Curtain and came to America so my knowledge of what fascism and communism are comes directly from people who have lived history. Goldberg knows what he is talking about.To better understand his premise and thesis you have to realize what the political landscape was before WWII on both sides of the Atlantic. In the teens, 20s, and even 30s, Progressive Americans looked to Europe--communist USSR, fascist Italy, and Germany--and admired the \\"progress\\" the Europeans were making. The editor of \\"New Republic\\" pined \\"Why should Europe have all the fun remaking the world.\\" American administrations felt similar. The \\"classical liberal\\" style of governance with limited government and maximum personal liberty was beginning to be viewed as antiquated, failed, and inefficient. People and American administrations were looking for something to envigorate, enlarge, and empower government. That method was fascism and communism in Europe and Progressivism in America. In fact, Wilson and FDR enacted policies either picked up later by European fascists or inspired by them. Mussollini himself looked to Woodrow Wilson and said, \\"He's one of us,\\" so the cross Atlantic admiration was very mutual.The fascist/communist connection and similarities in Europe can clearly be seen in their platforms, beliefs, and tactics. Goldberg goes into considerable detail here. Mussollini said, \\"Everything for the State. Nothing outside the State.\\" This is quintessentially fascist. Replace \\"State\\" with \\"Race\\" and you basically have Nazi fascism. You also have the tool, the vehicle of labeling that which is outside the state or the race as \\"The Other.\\" And \\"The Other\\" must be opposed and fought.Now, who made use of this \\"Other\\" labeling other than Mussollini and Hitler? Stalin, of course! Trotsky, according to Stalin, was labeled a fascist, deported, and assassinated not because he was truly a fascist but because he was NOT a Stalinist! He opposed Stalin! Therefore he was \\"Other.\\" We see this tactic from the left again and again in the 60s protests (and more recently). How many times were opponents to the protesters labeled \\"fascist?\\" Too many times to count. Contemporary protests, politics, tactics have far more in common with fascist/communist politics and tactics than you might think.Other examples abound: Why was the Nazi flag primarily a red field? Because the Nazis wanted to persuade communists to join them by slightly altering an otherwise red/socialist/communist flag. Communists as well as fascists looked upon fascism as a step towards communism \\"First brown, then red,\\" was the socialist mantra prevalent in Europe at the time. Communists attended fascist meetings and fascists attended communist. Before they became contenders for national power, the members were interchangeable. Once they became contenders. . .then the conflict intensified. So this was not a conflict of polar opposites but of sibling rivalry. They are both phenomenae of the left. And Goebbels in his diary credited Wilson's Croly and Bernays with teaching him about propaganda--one of the most powerful tools of populist/fascist/progressive politics--so again, the cross Atlantic admiration was very mutual.Goldberg's book places the left/communist vs. right/fascist political spectrum squarely on the chopping block where it belongs. His research follows pretty closely my own research into my own family's history and experiences. It is an excellent start for anyone scratching their head and wondering how the American founders like Washington, Franklin, and Jefferson could possibly reside somewhere on a political spectrum bookended between a socialist left (USSR) and a socialist right (National Socialists). Answer: The spectrum is broken. It doesn't fit. It's wrong. Read history and discover the truth."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"In the intro, Goldberg discusses the confusion surrounding the term 'fascism' with reference to Roger Griffin, Emilio Gentile, Gilbert Allardyce, Ernst Nolte, Stanley Payne, Roger Eatwell et al. The phenomenon has many variants & names whilst the manner of its expression is influenced by the national culture. Nowadays the term is loosely applied to 'anything not desirable.' The author investigates the characteristics of the movement, its roots in American Progressivism of the late 19th and early 20th century, manifestation during the New Deal and similarities with the agenda of what is today called Liberalism in the USA.First he examines Mussolini, a favorite of the New York Times, New Republic, Hollywood and many intellectuals until his invasion of Ethiopia in 1934. This chapter includes sections on Jacobin Fascism with observations on the French Revolution, JJ Rousseau, Georges Sorel and Napoleon, and War, which deals with populism and pragmatism as forms of relativism. National Socialism predated Hitler, competed with communism for the same support base, used identity politics and was not identical with Italian Fascism as Goldberg points out in the 2nd chapter. Further information on the similarities, differences and the danse macabre of shifting alliances in 1930s Europe is available inSinisterismby Bruce Walker.There's selective amnesia as regards Woodrow Wilson during whose 'progressive' presidency censorship, economic regulation, militarism, propaganda & corporatism dominated the USA. Unimaginable crackdowns on the media, restrictions of civil liberties & other outrages took place. During Roosevelt's New Deal the term Liberalism replaced Progressivism; it was the leftist author HG Well's who first advocated 'liberal fascism.' Goldberg shows how closely the programmes of Roosevelt, Mussolini & Hitler resembled one another. Fortunately, democratic parliamentarianism is an Anglo-Saxon tribal institution so the global trend didn't gain totalitarian power in the UK or USA.The third fascist movement exploded in the 1960s with the student riots, assassinations and terrorism of groups like the Weather Underground & Black Panthers. This tumult flowed from the writings of European academics like Paul de Man, Herbert Marcuse, Michel Foucault, Carl Schmitt and Derrida whose 'deconstruction' was a direct offshoot of Heidegger's variety of existentialism.The Reckless Mindby Mark Lilla takes a closer look at these intellectuals and what they promoted. They in turn influenced Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin & Hillary's mentor Saul Alinsky. A wide chasm separates the aforementioned from the classical liberal, conservative or libertarian thinkers like Adam Smith, Montesquieu, Burke, Locke and Hayek. Classical Liberalism focused on the individual whilst its collectivist opponents favored the group, whether based on race, gender or whatever. In other words, Multiculturalism.The author traces the seeds of the 'god-state' idea from Hegel, Darwin and Bismarck's Prussia through the Frankfurt School and the marriage of psychology & Marxism by Adorno, Marcuse & Fromm. Its chief propagandist was Richard Hofstadter. The Kennedy Myth underpinned Lyndon B Johnson's idea of the 'Great Society.' In truth, the 1960s tumult was aspiritual phenomenonthat transpired simultaneously on campus and in government with its vast spending sprees that resulted in family breakdown, the escalation of crime and street violence. The notion of 'unity', neutral in itself, is easily hijacked for the purpose of irrational groupthink.Earlier in the 20th century, Eugenics was promoted by progressives like the Fabians, George Bernard Shaw, HG Wells & Maynard Keynes and opposed by traditionalists like GK Chesterton. The author quotes Nietzsche on eugenics and investigates Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood & the birth control movement. In the economic sphere, the Italian & German collectivist states enforced corporatism (co-ordination) and the New Deal was the same. Government meddling, regulating and corporate lobbying limit competition, are detrimental to small businesses and consumers, and resemble the corporatism of Mussolini's Italy, Nazi Germany and Bismarck's Prussia. Hillary's 'politics of meaning' is a theocratic concept since it claims that the collective can solve all problems via the state, leaving no room for voluntary associations. Polanyi's Science, Faith And Society provides valuable insights on this matter.Today's culture wars echo Bismarck's Kulturkampf, with liberals as the aggressors. Then as now, the enemy is traditional religion and the battlefields are identity, morality, the family and nature, including environmentalism and the cult of the organic. By undermining truth, tradition and reason, ideologies like deconstruction, existentialism, postmodernism, pragmatism and relativism pave the way toward dystopia as Stephen Hicks argues so eloquently inExplaining Postmodernism. Liberalism in the USA is really Leftism, a secular salvationist ideology. No matter how 'nice' it appears on the surface, it has been subverting Enlightenment standards for many decades. And without those standards, society decays into the Nietzchean abyss where brute force supplants reason.In the Afterword, Goldberg looks at the tempting of American conservatism which is a blend of cultural conservatism & classical political liberalism. He examines the writings ofPatrick Buchanan, the most notorious champion of tribalism on the Right and looks at 'compassionate conservatism,' a well-meaning policy that nevertheless extended state powers. Finally, Goldberg observes that transforming the USA into a European welfare state is not the end of the world (although there's plenty of evidence that the real thing is unsustainable, nearingimplosionand civilizationalcollapse). He warns against what might come after a welfarist America. The Western European utopias so beloved of American liberals will show the way in the next two decades. Claire Berlinski's Menace in Europe and Bruce Bawer's While Europe Slept offer intriguing glimpses into the continent's current condition & possible future. The causes and effects are highlighted by the philosopher Chantal Delsol in her illuminating books Icarus Fallen andThe Unlearned Lessons of the Twentieth Century.This well-researched and brilliantly argued book concludes with an appendix (The Nazi Party Platform), 54pp of bibliographical notes and an index. For further reading, I recommend United in Hate by Jamie Glazov, A Conservative History of the American Left by Daniel Flynn, Unholy Alliance by David Horowitz,The Road to Serfdomby FA Hayek and Leftism Revisited by by Erik Von Kuehnelt-Leddihn."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This is a must read because one would not be taught this in school.Pick it up new or used and share with all you know."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"The traditional left-right concept of political beliefs is incorrect. Understanding this is key to understanding Goldberg's thesis that modern liberalism is the intellectual heir to Rousseau's ideas, the French Revolution and is, at the very least, the intellectual cousin to both fascism (especially Italian Fascism) and Soviet Communism.To fully understand this you have to understand that measuring political philosophy with a one-dimensional left-right line lack the depth to measure both social and economic political philosophies. A quadrant map used to measure political beliefs will more accurately show depth of support for government involvement in economic issues, political rights and social issues. Anarchists lie at the edge of one quadrant, Libertarians a little more toward the center of that same quadrant but totalitarians lie in the opposite corner. Search the web to discover more about the grid concept for yourself.Knowing this and actually knowing the stated goals of the fascist states (not including the racial discrimination of the Nazis), one can easily see that those goals are more in line with those of modern liberals and not with those of the Right, despite the popular belief that Fascists are nothing more than extreme Conservatives.On the political grid, one can see that Fascists and Communists are really nearly the same thing, or at the very least political cousins of one another. They are both Totalitarians. Totalitarianism it the opposite of the Enlightenment philosophies that America was founded upon (see John Locke) and they are the opposite of the views of Classical Liberals.Goldberg's thesis is that modern liberals are not Adolph Hitler death camp fascists. Rather, they are akin to Mussolini's pre-World War II vision of fascism. Goldberg likens Mussolini's fascism to being very masculine and he likens modern liberalism to being more of an \\"eat your vegetables\\" nanny-state style of fascism, a more feminine model, if you will. Not classic Totalitarianism, but with clear Totalitarian features. The government is getting more and more involved in your daily life. The government tells you cannot smoke in your own business (Indianapolis), the type of grease you can cook with (New York City) and what types of grocery bags you can use (San Francisco).None of those things belongs in the realm of government in the view of Classical Liberalism, which is more concerned about protecting you from government intervention, not in protecting you from yourself. While a nanny state is clearly not a Totalitarian state, it also is clearly closer to fascism on the quadrant grid than it is to classical liberalism.Goldberg uses an impressive array of quotes and sources to back up his arguments. Goldberg is not afraid to go after Republicans as well. He's not happy with Karl Rove or George W. Bush for their own fascist tendencies. Mind you, his complaints are not those that the hyperbolic bloggers on the Left obsess over. He is bothered by the faith-based initiatives and the tremendous reach of No Child Left Behind into areas that were once left to local and state government.Liberal Fascism is often dense reading, more like a political science textbook than the typical political stuff put out by partisans like Michael Moore, Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity. A strong working knowledge of political philosophy and political science vocabulary is a must with this book.Goldberg provided tons of endnotes to document his work which is a strength and indicative of the quality of work that he has created. It was also quite annoying. Not the notes themselves, but the fact that they were endnotes with commentary requiring the reader to constantly flip back and forth to the end of the book and to keep two sets of bookmarks- one for the text and one for the endnotes. If a writer plans to write additional commentary in his or her notes common decency would suggest that footnotes are better for the reader. The continuity and flow of the main text is not broken by constant flipping to the back of the book. Shelby Foote did this to great effect in his gigantic 3 volume Civil War series. Tom Holland uses both in his book \\"Rubicon\\" - notes at the end, additional commentary at the bottom of the text."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"This well researched book reveals what many historians have known for decades - and not spoken about. Namely, the direct connection between European Fascism and the political philosophy of the American Left. What this book reveals is that Communism, Fascism, Socialism and the American Left are all versions of the same general political philosophy and that they have for decades stood in direct opposition to the founding principals of our nation: individual liberty, free enterprise and limited government power."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"Selective reasoning is not only at the crux of the tenets espoused by conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg, the editor-at-large for National Review Online, in his controversial book but also in how readers, me included, are receiving them. When new, contrary information threatens our deeply held beliefs - or vice-versa - we choose to either reject the new information or change our beliefs. Either end of the spectrum of feedback should please a writer whose central treatise is based on how much liberalism and fascism overlap one another in their guiding principles. While Goldberg avoids the hyperbolic, media-baiting screeds of fellow conservative pundits Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin, his theories, often cleverly stated, are clearly designed to provoke in terms that are rationalized through taxonomy. From these connect-the-dots presumptions, he makes the startling conclusion that liberals must account for a history built upon a fascist architecture. The author feels that liberals cannot help being totalitarians by nature.Goldberg roots his argument in some compelling observations based on what he sees as the common intersection of progressivism between modern liberalism and fascism. Prior to World War II, fascism was widely viewed as a progressive social movement with many liberal and left-wing adherents in Europe and the United States. Progressives, and in turn, both fascists and liberals according to the author, favor a minimum wage, an expansive social safety net, heavy regulation of industry, and redistributive taxation. At the same time, they do not quite advocate the abolition of private property. He then leads us to believe that fascists and liberals have a common enemy in the ideology of the American conservative movement. Both share passions in economic populism to spread the wealth to the working classes and in an abiding trust in the U.S. Constitution to guide government actions. Liberals and fascists are at odds with the conservatives with their bourgeois values and their adherence to traditional religion.These intriguing points lead to what I see as the book's most serious flaw, specifically that Goldberg surmises that motivations which appear the same on the surface lead to the same ideologies. It seems a nave proposition despite the impressive compendium of historical research he presents. For example, he shows how Nazis and today's liberals both share an interest in healthy living because the Third Reich supported organic farming and animal rights. This is the level of deductive reasoning behind the intellectual heritage that dictates the author's findings. Following highly suspect genealogical metaphors, he seems to feel ideas beget other ideas, and if the original ideas resemble each other, then the end result has to be inevitably the same ideology. Thus, in true ad hominem fashion, Goldberg concludes that liberalism today has an \\"embarrassing family resemblance\\" to fascism. However, even if progressivism did lead to liberalism, as opposed to merely preceding it in time, there is still no real evidence that liberalism would ever lead to fascism.Probably the most critical point of intersection between liberals and fascists is a tendency toward what Goldberg calls the \\"totalitarian temptation\\", specifically that there is a hidden agenda that liberals have to dismiss abstract arguments involving universal moral principles. It is this relativism that the author positions as most threatening to our society, and he spends the entire book oversimplifying the genesis of liberalism to support his conclusion. However, he resists the obvious temptation to become a Coulter-like firebrand by acknowledging that some conservatives also suffer from \\"totalitarian temptation\\". If that's the case, then the question arises as to why pronounce such an innate connection between liberalism and fascism. Goldberg leaves us thinking this book is payback for all the liberal thinkers who have branded conservatives as fascists. That's a brazen reason but a fair one that the conservative academic writer Allen Bloom would support. He said \\"The relativity of truth is not a theoretical insight but a moral postulate, the condition of a free society.\\" I think Goldberg would agree as would I."},{"Title":"Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning","review":"A startling look at 20th century American politics from a very different point of view. Never before - at least, not in a work of popular history - has anyone explored the Totalitarian Temptation on the left as thoroughly as it is done here, and the result is just eye-opening. While liberals continues to make - often wildly exaggerated - accusations about the totalitarian predilections of the right, this book exposes the long-hidden skeletons in the left's own closet. It argues quite convincingly that what we today call fascism, like communism, has its roots in the very ideas and policies advocated by the early progressives, and that fascism itself was born as a byproduct not of conservative values, but of progressive ones - indeed, many of the most prominent early progressives viewed fascism as another form of socialism. In essence, fascism is here viewed as a phenomena of the left, not the right. Counter-intuitive and unsettling for most modern day liberals, which is why so many of them dismiss this book without even reading it. But despite their objections, this book is becoming an increasingly important part of the political science curriculum being taught at universities across the country, used by both liberal and conservative professors. And it is the thoroughness with which Mr. Goldberg approaches his subject that is the reason why.Oh, and Mr. Goldberg's wry sense of humor will have you in stitches. A bonus.Read this book. When you are finished with it, read it again - because it is so dense with research that chances are you'll need to reread it just to digest it all. After that, buy five copies and give them to your friends. Believe me, they won't regret it.Possibly the most important book on political science history released in the last few years."},{"Title":"If I Can You Can Decipher Germanic Records","review":"I remember the dread with which I first faced German genealogical records written or printed in Gothic script.

It then provides handwritten script examples of common genealogical words and their German and English translation. Handwritten symbols and common abbreviations found in Germanic records are also covered.Sections are devoted to showing side-by-side comparisons of Latin, English, Danish, and handwritten German script for common genealogical terms, occupations &amp; titles, and diseases.

That is why I gave a four star instead of five star rating.Pages are color coded by topic, [ genealogy terms, illnesses, occupations, Latin terminology etc ]. ] which is nice, and the Germanic - Latin terminology section is helpful with Catholic Church records in Script.

If you do a google on figuring out German script, this book constantly turns up as a valuable reference.An outline of the book's major sections:Alphabets - This is fascinating, because she gives you Old Gothic standard and then many (like 30 for EACH letter) handwritten variations that she found in different documents.Common terms - This covers a lot! For example, one part is Relationships. For each term, she shows you the handwritten script, the typed German word, and the English meaning. The first word in this section is \\"angenommenes Kind\\" = adopted child. In the German script shown, the capitalized K in Kind (in German, you capitalize nouns) looks like a capital R, which is also illustrated in the alphabets. I never would have guessed that it was a \\"K\\".Common terms also includes genealogical terms (such as two words for ancestor), abbreviations (ex, \\"b.v.\\" = beide von = both from), church and feast day terms, months and days.Common Latin terms are included, with English, Danish and German Script equivilents, because many records may be found in Roman Catholic Parish records. (The Schleswig-Holstein area was, at one point, under Danish rule.)There's a glossary of illnesses found in German church records with the German word, German script, English, Latin and Danish equivilents.Next is a large list of occupations and titles, first in the German word, then German script, English, Latin and Danish. Sometimes, she'd found more than one word with the same meaning, such as Barbier and Bartscherer for Barber.The next section is an informal time-line. Starting in 1300, and ending in 1930, it lists major European occurances that would have affected Germany, in the spheres of Religious & Political, Music, Art & Literature and Daily Life. A 4th column, titled Ancestors, lets you fill in your family information.

It remains a milestone study on Crane, and in American literature studies generally for its acute insights. It stands up quite well to most Crane studies since; though more \\"facts\\" have emerged, they do not greatly alter the essential portrait. A good complement to Berryman's book is Robert Stallman's, which sets Crane in the context of his fantastic end-of-a-century day. But to get at the core of the creative genius it really takes another, and while some of Berryman's views are still controversial, there can be little arguing with most of it.Crane wrote two short novel masterpieces, Maggie and the Red Badge, and several of the best stories in modern English to date in a short span of about 8 years. Berryman deftly mixes biography with literary criticism of these works in a sound scholarly way unfortunately no longer fashionable. His bow to the ethos of his own times is a Freudian chapter at the end, which you can take or mostly leave. Its placement is simultaneously shrewd and cynical; an obvious bow to Berryman's teachers' demands, but to any other reader as detatchable as a coupon. It therefore does not mar the otherwise deep meditation on this mercurial personality, who Berryman characterizes as a \\"volcanic\\" natural talent from whom words flowed like lava. Berryman believes Crane was likely to have dwarfed most other American novelists had he lived and produced beyond his mere 30 years. While such speculations are often a distraction, his affinity with Crane turns them into a compelling meditation on where American literature was shortly to go: to World War I and Paris.Berryman, even without his subsequent poetic output, was an important critic, and this book also serves as the proper starting point to his own double career. Work on Crane still needed to be defended when Berryman wrote in 1950 -- he has lasted 50 years since his writing, Berryman pronounces, setting a yardstick and defense. Now, ironically, his own fine book has met the same test of time."},{"Title":"Stephen Crane (The American Men of Letters Series)","review":"John Berryman ( Dreamsongs) was one of America's finest poets. He began as a literary critic and this thorough work on the life of Crane contains both a solid biography and considerable literary criticism of Crane's work.He writes of Crane as a young , rebelious genius, who had his own way of seeing things. He traces in detail the journalistic career of Crane which led him not simply to the Bowery and East Side, but to battlefieds in Greece and Cuba. He analyzes to a degree Crane's masterpiece ' The Red Badge of Courage' Here is his brief description of the work. \\"The Red Badge of Courage is the story of the mind of a new young Northern soldier as it accustoms itself to war during two days in and out of his first battle. There is a preliminary debate within himself as to whether he will run away or not. When his regiment is charged a second time, hye does, and hides resentfully in a wood, where he meeta a rotting corpse in a chapellike place. He joins the march of wounded away from the battle and comes on a friend hurt horribly, a tall soldier, whom he accompanies to his extraordinary death.A tattered man has befriended him on the march, this man, whose plight is very bad, his mind wandering, the youth deserts in shame, on the question reiterated, of where he is wounded. Then in a flight of the troops he is clubbed with a rifle when he tries to ask a panic- stricken man a question. An unseen man finally helps him back to his regiment.Since it has got scattered during the battle his shame is unknown: he says he was shot and is cared for by a friend, a loud youth who bandages his bloody head.He sleeps. Next morning he feels no remorsek and is full of \\"self-pride\\" even, when the loud youth reluctantly and shamefacedly has to ask for the return of a packet of papers given the youth in fear, before the battle.\\"He had been possessed of much fear of his friend, for he saw how easily questionings could make holes in his feelings.\\" Now \\"his heart grew more strong and stut.He had never been compelled to blush in such a manner for his acts' he was an individual of extraordinary virtues.\\" In the battle of this second day he is a war devil.During the charge, when the color- bearer is killed, he wrenches the flag free and bears it. In hard new fighting he and the loud youth are commended. The regiment takes a fence and a flag, and rests. \\"He had been to touch the great death and found, that after all, it was but the great death . He was a a man ...Scars faded as flowers\\"One of the great praises of 'The Red Badge of Courage' is how Crane who had never experienced war, managed to write of it more realistically than so many who it had. This ' ironic realism' of Crane, this daring way of seeing and imagining reality were distinctive of his genius.This is a very good book. And it also contains Berryman's critical readings of Crane's quite strange and wholly unique poetry."},{"Title":"Kama Sutra: The Perfect Bedside Companion","review":"this kama sutra is true to the original. lots of reading about how to love and your roles before and after becoming a spouse.

Gorbachev's relatives lived in areas occupied by the Nazis in WWII. Sheehy shows why this, combined with residual Stalinist Party paranoia, lead to Gorbachev's career and rise in the hinterlands, instead of Moscow. This permitted Gorbachev to see the flaws of communism in ways that were hidden from other Party leaders. (The other leaders were almost cloistered among themselves, and lost touch, much as the heads of the Big Three car companies in Detroit are clueless about the larger car market.)Seeing the flaws of communism lead Gorbachev to his policy of perestroika, or openness. Openness to admitting flaws is needed to correct them. Gorbachev, however, was a Marxist-Leninist true believer and idealist. He did not see that the glue that really held the USSR together was terror of the secret police and of Red Army tanks rolling in to protect the status quo. Thus, once his perestroika took hold, and brute force was removed, the USSR crumbled before the flaws of Marxism-Leninism could be repaired - as if the flaws were repairable.It seems that Gorbachev himself, at the close of the book, never realized what actually happened in the hearts of his countrymen, or why.Sheehy writes clearly and convincingly."},{"Title":"What to Do After You Hit Return: A Computer Games Book from People's Computer Company","review":"This is the first computer book I ever purchased, back in the late 70s.

Most of the original artwork is also there, but in case of some of later released adventures, some of the original artwork has been replaced with new one.FULL CONTENTS:* Alpha Complexities* Das Bot* Me and My Shadow Mark 4* Robot Imana 665-C* Send in the Clones* Trouble With Cockroaches, the* Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues, the* Vapors Don't Shoot Back* Three 'Code 7' mini-missions* Pre-Paranoia orientation missionBut should you buy it? It depends. If you are seeking good compilation of older Paranoia material, book is goldmine. If you are searching something for one-shots, book is also very good choice though some of the longer adventures can take even three gaming sessions to complete. But if you don't really care for pre-made adventures, there is probably nothing here that would interest you, though most book's adventures have terrific ideas for killing Troubleshooters."},{"Title":"Paranoia Flashbacks (Paranoia Xp)","review":"These adventures all stand the test of time, still being funny and terrifying after all these years.The other reviewer did a bang up job of detailing the contents.

What I mean by this, is that most of the contained missions are not quick, easy-to-run missions for the occasional Paranoia game session. Granted, there are several \\"mini\\" missions, but the majority are pretty heavy hitters; missions that will take both significant prep time (simply to digest all the information) and game time. If the members of your group are real Paranoia fans, then this is probably a good fit for you. If, however, you are looking for quick, easy-to-run missions for the occasional foray into Paranoia, you'd probably be better off with \\"WMD\\" or \\"Crash Priority\\".That said, all the \\"classics\\" are here; you certainly get a lot of content for your 40 bucks."},{"Title":"7 Strategies for generating ideas.: An article from: The Futurist","review":"7 Strategies for generating ideas.: An article from: The Futurist~ Robert B.

However, this story about the hunt for Soviet serial killer Andrei Chikatilo is fascinating, despite not being particularly well written. I had never heard of Chikatilo, but from the late '70s to late '80s he killed at least 53 women and children in the Rostov province of Russia. His methods and predilections were particularly gruesome, as he favored slowly stabbing or hammering his victims to death before eviscerating them, masturbating over them, and sometimes cooking and eating part of them. This is a man who left the house every day with a knapsack containing a knife, change of clothes, and small cooking pot, just in case the opportunity presented itself.Longtime Russian expert Lourie tells the story mostly through the eyes of Issa Kostoev, the special investigator who led the years-long quest to bring Chikatilo to justice. The investigators were hampered by the randomness of the killings, the relative lack of research into DNA in the Soviet Union, the lack of criminal psychology as a discipline, as well as the laziness and sloppiness of local police, who had botched previous efforts (at one point they had actually arrested Chikatilo, only to release him). Since Lourie relies on interviews with Kostoev, it's hard to know how accurate the picture of the investigation is, but the story he tells is compelling and will certainly appeal to those with an interest in the procedural aspects of criminology. The investigator's own life story is fascinating; an Ingush from the Caucuses, his family was deported to the Kazakh steppe during WWII by Stalin. There, he lost brothers and sisters to famine, and his thirst for justice was bred. By the book's end, he has been made a General and is being asked by his countrymen to come home and lead the political struggle for full restoration of the homeland.Lourie's reliance on the single source is sometimes a fault, as Kostoev's own preoccupations are given precedence. There is rather an overemphasis (and occasional repetitiveness) on the thought processes involved in the interrogation and getting a confession from Chikatilo. A writer more experienced in writing about crime would likely have cut some of the fat here. One also feels like there might have been a little more drama wrung from the hunt, not to mention a greater vividness to the details. These might be found in one of the three other books written about the case (none of which I've read): Comrade Chikatilo: The Psychopathology of Russia's Notorious Serial Killer by Mikhail Krivich, The Killer Department: Detective Viktor Burakov's Eight-Year Hunt for the Most Savage Serial Killer of Our Times by Robert Cullen, or Red Ripper: Inside the Mind of Russia's Most Brutal Serial Killer by Peter Conradi. There's also a film called Citizen X that's been made about the hunt, although it's hard to to imagine Irishman Stephen Rea passing himself off as Ingush!"},{"Title":"Hunting the Devil","review":"This is a fascinating detective story that happens to be true. It would be hard to write a dull book about Andrei Chikatilo, but the way the author drew his characters really gripped me -- as did his horrific examples of the corruption and incompetence within the Soviet criminal justice system, which among other things lead an innocent man to be convicted of one of Chikatilo's murders and executed.A word of warning: the book is as much about Inspector Kostoev (who was in charge of the task force to find Chikatilo and who eventually wrung a confession out of him) as it is about Chikatilo and his crimes. It goes into great detail about Kostoev's background, childhood, etc. I found it all very interesting but others may just want to read about the murders. Most of the Kostoev biography can be skipped if you really don't want to read it."},{"Title":"Hunting the Devil","review":"Andrei Chikatilo was the most infamous Russian serial killer of all time, and with good reason. His reign of terror was as long as his court antics were bizarre. He is in the first rank of cannibal killers, right up there with more familiar monsters like Jeffrey Dalmer and Ed Gein. Although within the police state of the Soviet Union he was able to operate much longer. But this book is as much about the pursuer as the pursued, indeed Inspector Issa Kostoev really takes center stage. The story is told from a cop&#65533;s perspective and even details the politics that surround the investigation. Especially interesting are the appearances of other less well-known deviants that Kostoev encounters along the way (like Anthony Slivko). Also of interest were the cat and mouse techniques that Kostoev used to break Chikatilo during interrogation, and how the killer&#65533;s party affiliation helped him early in his career. There is a lot of interesting stuff here, but those seeking understanding of the why of what Chaikatilo did must look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Huntsman, What Quarry?","review":"I feel that anyone who gives this collection less than 5 stars hasn't given it a chance. This is the only book of poetry out of the many that I own that I have read cover-to-cover several times. My copy is dog-eared, sun-tanned, spilled-on, underlined... showing all of the signs of a book extremely well-loved. Why? Because Millay says things like the phrase I used for the title of this review, as well as:\\"Above these cares my spirit in calm abidingFloats like a swimmer at sunrise, facing the pale sky.\\"-- from ABOVE THESE CARES\\"My heart is warm with the friends I make,And better friends I'll not be knowing;Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take,No matter where it's going.\\" -- from TRAVEL\\"Ashes am I of all that once I seemed.In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed.\\"-- from THE SUICIDE\\"Oh little leaves that are so dumbAgainst the shrieking city air,I watch you when the wind has come,--I know what sound is there.\\" -- from CITY TREESThose are just the first few that sprung out at me from the several phrases I marked in my own copy - there are so many more that I wish I had the room to share here, but since I do not, I will close with this fitting lyric from THE POET and HIS BOOK:\\"Stranger, pause and look;From the dust of agesLift this little book,Turn the tattered pages,Read me, do not let me die!Search the fading letters, findingSteadfast in the broken bindingAll that once was I!\\"I sincerely hope you \\"pause and look\\" at Millay's COLLECTED LYRICS - it is like a script of wonderful lines describing life."},{"Title":"Huntsman, What Quarry?","review":"I own an earlier edition of this book (published by Harper &amp; Row) and it is through this single volume that Ms. Millay has become one of my favorite poets. Her masterful use of meter and rhyme produce sentences and line breaks that are profoundly satisfying. By way of example I offer the opening stanza from the beautiful poem of spiritual awakening, &quot;Renascence&quot;:&quot;All I could see from where I stoodWas three long mountains and a wood;I turned and looked another way,And saw three islands in a bay.So with my eyes I traced the lineOf the horizon, thin and fine,Straight around till I was comeBack to where I'd started from;And all I saw from where I stoodWas three long mountains and a wood.&quot;The pieces included in this collection are taken from seven different sources, originally published between 1917 and the 1940's respectively. The themes of love, sorrow, nature and the human condition in general - coupled with Ms. Millay's intelligence, insight and sharp wit - make all of the pieces in this book timeless and perfect poetry."},{"Title":"Huntsman, What Quarry?","review":"Her lyrical works are among her best.Great depth of passion.

It was my good fortune to take home &quot;Fatal Interview, Sonnets&quot; from among the books offered. Never having read Ms. Millay's poetry, I was unfamiliar with even &quot;Renascence,&quot; the first stanza of which is so well known. Having some difficulty relating to the sonnets, I persevered because she was a Nobel prize recipient. At length, the connection was made and resulted in a poem of my own, &quot;Bravo, Ms Millay.&quot; Her search for love and especially for Source reminded me of &quot;The Hound of Heaven.&quot;Enter rescue in the form of Edna St. Vincent Millay Colleted Lyrics. I found the poetry enchanting. Oddly, none of the sonnets from &quot;Fatal Interview&quot; were included. From the very beginning, her poetry is indeed a search for God. She is very good at rhyme and meter and excells at unusual points of view that in themselves make evident what she is sharing with her readers.

She applies for a position ghost-writing Isabel Krug's life story - the fact that she has no idea just who Isabel is, or how notorious her story is, is the subject of the book. Harriet goes to live with her at Cape Cod and in fact it is the growing relationship between these two women which was for me, the most interesting part of the book. As we learn more about Harriet we also have more of Isabel revealed. Its all done in context of the novel and some of it is quite startling. One thing I'll say for Elinor Lipman is she really knows how to tell a story without over-killing points - but she is also wonderful at providing great twists to the story at various points.It really is an 'engaging' read, but it might take you more than 10 pages to get into. I certainly didn't find I was grinning for a week - but I found it a great read and I think itsworth perservering with if you aren't immediately grabbed by it."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"Isabel's Bed looked like a great read &amp; it's gotten great reviews, but in all honesty I was diappointed by it. The writing is great, I would give Elinor Lipman 4 *'s for her writing talent, but this story just never took off for me. Harriet Mahoney is a 40 something year old woman who finds herself alone after her live-in boyfriend of 12 years meets someone else. An aspiring writer, Harriet takes a job working for Isabel, living in her mansion &amp; helping her to ghostwrite a novel about Isabel's scandalous life. Where this book fell short for me was in the character development-I never got to know or care too deeply about any of the characters. I will still give Lipman's other novels a try as she is a talented writer. This novel wasn't terrible, but I felt it was a little flat."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"What a wonderful novel! This book had everything - romance, intrigue, friendship and revenge. Such a great combination. I really did love this book, a second for me by Elinor Lipman, and much better than the semi-drivel that was The Inn at Lake Devine. One thing bothered me about Isabel's Bed - the absence of you-know-who by the end of the book. The Itzy-Hare-Pete-Costas combination should have ended with a collective bang! Needless to state, I highly recommend this book! It's a light and fast read, packed with humour and realism."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"ISABEL'S BED by Elinor LipmanOctober 10, 2004Two women bond and become unlikely friends in ISABEL'S BED, my introduction to the writing of Elinor Lipman. This book has made me a fan for life, and although I've been told most of her books are as good as this one, I can imagine that a \\"bad\\" book by Lipman will still be a passable read.Harriet Mahoney finds herself going nowhere in the world of writing. Her dream is to have a book published, and she is currently writing a novel based on her parents' life. She belongs to a writing group, where she does not feel she totally belongs, and she is in a long-term relationship with a man that only cares about his bagel business.Harriet soon finds herself without a boyfriend and without a place to stay. She and Kenny had been together for twelve years, when he tells her he's met someone else, the love of his life and they are now engaged to be married. Out of the blue, she gets an offer to ghost write a story by an infamous adulteress, Isabel Krug, and Harriet finds herself moving into a mansion in a New England town called Truro. The neighbors despise the mansion for being \\"more Malibu than Cape Cod\\". But Harriet loves her new home, and is now on her way to getting to know her new employer, who was in bed with her married lover when his wife shot him to death.Isabel Krug is a woman of mystery. What's not mysterious about her is her need for attention and drama in her life. It is evident in her choice of men (two of whom were married at the time she got involved with them) and her desire to write a book about the murder that made her famous. Harriet suspects that she was hired not just to write this story for Isabel, but to be a companion to this woman, who lives alone with her handy-man Pete, and a man Harriet later finds out is her husband, Costas. Isabel needs Harriet just as much as Harriet needs Isabel.As Harriet learns more about the murder of Guy Van Fleet, the more she learns about Isabel and her wild and crazy past. Lipman has a knack for writing witty and intelligent passages and I found myself laughing throughout the book. Lipman also does a wonderful job building up the character of Isabel Krug, who was larger than life but yet written in quite a believable fashion. What I loved most of all was the friendship that developed between Harriet, the very insecure writer with low self-esteem, and Isabel, who was beautiful and glamorous and belonged with the rich and famous. Lipman paints Isabel as a woman in need of attention, but someone who is compassionate and understanding, too. Harriet grows with the help of Isabel, as she slowly gains confidence in herself and finds out truly what makes her happy, and it isn't her \\"passion\\" for writing. ISABEL'S BED is highly recommended by this reader!"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I read The Inn at Lake Devine and enjoyed it so decided to try other Eleanor Lipman books. The reviews here were all very favorable so I gave Isabel's Bed a try. I'm surprised to 'report' that I was quite disappointed. There was no real development of characters and the plot twists seemed contrived. The relationships were there on the page, but about as flat. Without giving any of the storyline away all I can say is I really didn't 'know' any of the characters even by the end of the book. The end was a bit abrupt too, though I'm not sure what may have been left to say.As a light summer/beach read it's not too bad but fell short of my expectations by a long shot. I have another Lipman book to try (Then She FOund Me) so we'll see :-)"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"Isabel's Bed is elegantly written but would be more satisfying to the reader if the characters were more fleshed out.Someone told me not to miss this book because it is so funny. Well, it IS funny. Elinor Lipman has set up an interesting situation with unusual characters and manages to make some rather unsavoury people look surprisingly appealing. But Isabel turns out to be much nicer than she should be. A twist at the end of the plot vindicates her somewhat, but the reader wonders how a woman in her forties with so much self confidence and potential could get into so much trouble. When she turns out to be so doggone nice, it almost lacks credibility.Still, the author concludes with a satisfactory ending and the loose ends of the plot itself are pleasantly and firmly tied up. If there is a nebulous thread or two, it applies to characters whom we have come to view with jaundiced eye.This was the first Lipman book I have read and I don't intend it to be my last.

Be warned: Isabel's Bed is crammed with sterotypical, over-exaggerated characters whose predictability becomes palpable with every page. The heroine of the novel, Harriet Mahoney, is filled with so much self-pity and lack of confidence you feel like slapping her and screaming ,&quot;Get over yourself.&quot; I had no sympathy for her constant self-undermining drivel. Harriet shacks up with Isabel, in order to ghost write her life story. Isabel seems to have ten-fold of everything Harriet lacks. One can only assume her brash, self-righteous behaviour are attempts at keeping readers amused. But Isabel merely grates with her self-indulgent comments and pathetic fashion sense. Other characters, mainly men, are again sterotypical and unbelievable. The storyline itself is uninteresting and trite. If you can find it at half-price, Isabel's Bed may be worth it---just."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"While I really enjoyed Elinor Lipman's Inn at Lake Devine - I felt that Isabel's Bed did not quite live up to my expectations. It got rave reviews so I was looking forward to reading it but it was slow going and once I got into it the book ended.Isabel's Bed is the story of Harriet Mahoney, a middle aged, recently jilted, unpublished writer who finds a job and a home with Isabel Krug - the &quot;other woman&quot; in a scandoulous murder. Isabel hires Harriet to ghost write her story.The novel is about their friendship and how it helps Harriet (and Isabel) put her life back on track.The book meandered for a while and finally got rolling about 100 pages or so before it ended.

The back cover of this novel, Isabel's Bed, offered an intriguing setup: unpublished, 41 year old \\"novelist\\" Harriet Mahoney agrees to ghost-write a memoir for Isabel Krug, the other woman in a deadly romantic triangle that was a top news story some two years before.I'm happy to report that I made a good choice, as I can honestly say that this was one of the most enjoyable novels that I have read in some time. Harriet's reason for taking the job with Isabel is that she has just been dumped by her long-time, marriage-shy, co-habitating boyfriend--so that he can marry someone younger, of course. At 42, Isabel is actually a year older than Harriet, but the two women couldn't be more different. Although Isabel certainly fits the definitions of blond bombshell and femme fatale, she is by no means a stereotype, and the friendship which develops between her and Harriet is one of the best aspects of the book.I have read some reviews comparing Lipman's voice in Isabel's Bed to novelist Anne Tyler. I like Tyler and have read many of her novels as well, and in some ways, I agree--Lipman does share Tyler's penchant for quirkiness at times. But whereas I've often found Tyler's books to be at times bizarre and even sometimes downright depressing, Isabel's Bed is a fun, humorous read. I definitely enjoyed spending time with these characters, and I walked away from this book with a smile on my face."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"This is a book I find to be wonderfully layered with truth.

Harriet Mahoney comes to terms with her writing ability, her relationship with her X-boyfriend; she finds new friends and a new home. Through her struggles you see that it isn't necessary to write a published book or have a high paying job or a degree in a University to make you happy.

I reccomend it to anyone who is stressed out and wants to read about a modern woman and her thoughts, vulnerablities and needs."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"It is 12am and I have finished the last pages of Isabel's bed. Though I have always been a fast-reader this was definately a page-turner. There is something for everyone in this novel. You laugh and smile and see a bit of yourself in the both Isabel and Harriet. This book was given to me yesterday by a relative and it was the first I had ever heard of Elinor Lipman and I definately do not want to stop here. Isabel's Bed wasn't challenging nor a real brain-picker but it nevertheless was enjoyable. Charming and personal, it was a breath of fresh air into the life of a teenage college student, trying to escape the pressure of mid-terms and stress. Congratulations, Ms. Lipman for such a wonderful, playful, and welcomed novel. Please do not lose that flair you showed in Isabel's Bed"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I read Elinor Lipman's latest novel, The Inn at Lake Devine, last summer and was a little disappointed. A friend had recommended her to me as being &quot;fun.&quot; I persisted by getting ahold of Isabel's Bed and have to admit that this one is what my friend must have been talking about. This novel is contemporary, witty, smart - and really hard to put down. Not only does it provide commentary about our current culture, but the characters - especially Harriet, Isabel and Pete - attach themselves to you fast."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly for the first 100 pages. And I read the whole thing in less than a week of minutes grabbed here and there (that's fast for me). And while it was an easy and enjoyable read, I found it disappointing in the end. It never really takes off-- she sets up all these fascinating situations that are never fully explored or taken to their limits. As far as funny-- it was, but nowhere near say &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; or &quot;Thank You for Smoking.&quot; A great airplane or beach book, but don't expect it to take you somewhere greater."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I truly enjoyed reading Isabel's Bed, it made me laugh out loud and fall in love with the characters.

Great Find!"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"If you're hungry for a good read, this book might leave you feeling like you've eaten a sack of day-old bagels. The book is heavy on cliches, and in the end, you wonder if it was worth your time. The story has potential, but lacks character development and the location of Cape Cod is completely wasted as the author does not bother to elaborate on anything in a descriptive way that would really give the reader a feel for the charm and beauty of The Cape.

On the surface, this book is about Harriet Monhoney's adventures as a ghost writer for Isabel Krug in Isabel's mansion on the Cape. If you take a deeper look, this wonderful book is also about Harriet stepping into the flow of life and learning what REALLY makes her happy. Harriet was fighting against her life, living with a man who didn't love her and struggling to be a published writer. Once she stopped pretending to be anything but herself, life took it's correct course."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I loved this book. It's real, it's fun, it's romantic and optimistic without being sappy and ridiculous. There are so many mediocre, barely readable books about single women looking for love (and career fulfillment), and it's nice to find a book that addresses these issues in novel and believable ways while also providing ample comedic twists and turns to keep us chuckling. Bravo, well done!"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"This book looked interesting enough to read, but by about page 40 I knew the plot was not going anywhere. I'm not sure how this book got such great reviews! I could not even finish it. I ended up reading \\"The Glass Castle\\" instead,which I would recommend to everyone. Made this book seem all the more silly and boring. I just couldn't ever get into the characters or with what was going on with the plot. Really a waste of time!"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I loved, loved, loved this book! The characters are beautifully drawn...from the passive aggressive narcissist (Kenny)...to the perfect, eccentric Greek, (Costas)...the amazing unfolding of the glorious Isabel...the absolutely recognizable and loveable Pete...and the compelling, struggling Harriet. I found it to be flawless. Great story, great wit, and tremendous insight and warmth abound. Thank you, Eleanor Lipman!"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I loved Then She Found Me, and decided to try another Lipman story. Isabel's Bed was just as enjoyable. The characters and the setting kept me turning the pages (after reading this I wanted to go straight to Cape Cod). I tried reading the Inn at Lake Divine before Isabel's Bed, and I couldn't get into it. I'm glad I didn't give up and gave this a try."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"This is a wonderful comic novel with a great plot. It is about two seemingly different women who bond and form an alliance -- and ultimately learn some life lessons from one another. I found myself relating most with Harriet's character, but was certainly entertained by Isabel's antics. I love that it pokes fun at the world of publishing -- most specifically the tabloids and the ever fickle public. Also, the scenes depicting Isabel, Costas, and Harriet watching the &quot;soaps&quot; were priceless.This is my second Elinor Lipman novel, after &quot;The Inn At Lake Devine.&quot; I recommend both and plan on reading her others."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I could not disagree more with people calling this book a &quot;disappointment.&quot; I found it an entertaining, uplifting romp through two women's very different lives. I thorougly reccommend it!"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"If you enjoy satire and irony, check out Isabel's Bed. It's clever, and Ms. Lipman achieves an over-the-top yet understated effect derived from an outrageous plotline balanced with very clean writing. This book is funny -- laugh out loud funny at times -- and the prose is both rich and sparse, which takes an uncommon skill. You won't find dull, page-long descriptions of the scenery. Yet the author paints word pictures that take little effort to visualize. Some readers have called the book lightweight, but it's really quite intelligent, considering both the care with which the plot is crafted and the difficulty of pulling off compelling satire for 387 pages."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"While I agree that the characters were easy to get to know and fairly well illustrated, I felt less than satisfied with the final chapters. With quite a bit of build-up to the main plot, it seemed the book then took a quick turn away from the plot and the author quickly jotted an ending leaving me wondering what had just happened. There were loose ends, but what really bothered me is the time I invested in the plot, only to have it unravel with no real purpose. It was less a surprise ending than a 'why would you do this' ending. Lipman has done better, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"Isabel and Harriet--what a divine combination these two characters create. Admittedly, I am a Elinor Lipman fan and would probably read, with relish, an account of her brushing her teeth, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. With a bizarre murder in the background, it was great fun to see two distinctly different female characters grown from strangers to friends. And as a 'would-be' writer, it was great fun to read about another 'would-be' realistically. More Elinor, please."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I picked up this book upon a friend's suggestion and reading a few reviews about it. I was definitely not disappointed. I have not read from Elinor Lipman before, but I definitely don't believe this will be my last!The book is entertaining, funny and a very easy read. The characters are very well set out, though sometimes I did expect to find more detail about them. The relationships between the characters are very clear, logical and sometimes, as in real life, unexpected. The book mainly portrays a woman who has been 'dumped' by her boyfriend of 12 years for another woman who is much younger. The story unfolds as she decides to seek fulfilment rather than sit around and feel sorry for herself. She decides to pursue her long time dream of writing a book and meets Isabel Krug, who is so much different than Harriet. Their relationship go beyond employer-employee in a shor time and they become friends. The ending is unexpected but satisfying, all lose ends are tied. It makes the reader realize, no matter what your age, sometimes you look for satisfaction in all the wrong places.Obviously, I DO recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"It started out okay. I kept thinking it would get better--it didn't. The characters were not that interesting. There were a few funny lines but nothing that would make me laugh till I cried. The story line was lame and predictable. When I finished it last night I threw it on the floor in disappointment."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"This book was great reading for not only relaxing on the beach but for more serious readers as well. The quirks and foibles of the group of characters living at Isabel's house on the beach should appeal to many readers. Isabel, Harriet, Costas, Pete and even Kenny were so real - the reader almost feels she/he knows them personally. It was hard to say goodbye at the end of the book. I will be looking for other Lipman books ASAP."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"Harriet is a woman in search of a life.

After a few days, Isabel and Harriet warm to each other, becoming friends as well as collaborators.What I liked:A la the Seinfeld television series, IB is essentially a novel about not very much. The central theme is the relationship between two women, one excessively conventional and the other excessively quirky. Not much writing is going on, but learning takes place on a consistent basis. It is pleasant to watch their friendship develop.There are four main characters, and I liked Harriet, Isabel, and Pete (the handyman who is the only person on the scene with a grounded sense of reality.)The setting.The occasional surprises.What I disliked:The character of Kostas, who is extremely narcissistic and just plain obnoxious.The ending, which seemed rushed and \\"tacked on.\\"I listened to the audio version of this novel, and it's doubtful whether I'd have finished it if reading it in print."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"At the age of 40 Harriet after having spends years trying to write her own book.

The dialogue is great, the story unfolds rapidly, and the book is impossible to put down. While &quot;Isabel's Bed&quot; might never be classified as serious literature, it is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable books I've read in a long time. I think the author is one of the most talented contemporary writers of fiction that I've come across in awhile. I have to say I like her even better than Barbara Kingsolver."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"Witty and tender, Lipman's third novel treats lightly of love, mid-life crises, failure and new beginnings.The narrator-protagonist, Harriet Mahoney, a Jewish-Catholic New Yorker transplanted from Boston, is jilted at age 41. &quot;There went twelve years: my youth. In three months, he was married.&quot;Floundering, she overhears a stranger on the subway, &quot; 'There are no guarantees in this world, but chances are that people who take out ads in the New York Review of Books aren't idiots or crooks.' &quot;And that's how she ends up in Truro, Mass., in winter, sharing an ultra-modern mansion on the ocean with glamorous Isabel Krug who needs a ghost writer to capitalize on her one claim to fame - her intimate connection with murder. Isabel's rich and older lover had been shot by his wife when she caught them in her bed.Harriet is confident of her ability to write this book - eventually. First there's the research, which may take a while. Harriet is a long-term veteran of writing groups whose members' idea of success is an encouraging letter from an agent.Meanwhile, Harriet is meeting the other denizens of the house. Pete, 36, the man of all work, is a local fisherman, complete with (irritating after a while) accent. Harriet finds him attractive but is painfully aware of the difference in their ages. Costas, a mildly sinister, repugnant and brooding figure, is Isabels' husband. A prominent painter, he was disgraced in the art world when it was discovered that his photo realistic paintings were, in fact, photos touched up with paint.Harriet, a rather conservative, self-effacing creature, is soon cooking all the meals and fretting over her ambiguous and unpaid position. Encouraged by Pete, she makes tentative steps towards self-assertion. Then &quot;With Pete gone I was free to be apologetic. 'Is that okay with you? If we discuss some things?' &quot;But Harriet is open to influence. With Isabel's flamboyant urging, she gets a haircut, modifies her wardrobe, becomes just daring enough to call a man from her former writing group.However, failure isn't through with Harriet yet. Despite the engaging banter and dizzy characters, Lipman has her gaze firmly fixed on reality and Harriet gets another dose of it. If this lighthearted and clever novel has a flaw it's the ease with which Harriet adjusts to devastating disappointments - she reacts more like a 25-year-old than a woman in her 40s.Lipman's writing is snappy and quick, her characters outrageously loopy but with enough mystery to make them believable. Within the convolutions of a spiraling plot, Harriet grows and blossoms, leaving the reader satisfied and vastly entertained."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"Having been mildly charmed by several of Lipman's other novels, most notably &quot;Inn at Lake Devine,&quot; I picked up &quot;Isabel's Bed&quot; in preparation for a long flight. I wasn't disappointed. After a slow start (during which you will struggle to figure out whether you actually like the two main female characters), the novel settles into a brisk, funny exploration of a friendship between two disparate fortysomething women. One has just been ignominiously dumped by her boyfriend of 11 years; the other is the former mistress of a man murdered in his bed by his wife--and who was there to witness the murder!But this novel is not a drama--the tale of the murder is played for laughs. And seemingly flighty Isabel comes to be a well-rounded, compassionate character in the middle of the novel--not to mention one who has a few tricks up her sleeve.Aside from a small twist at the end, the novel moves along predictably but pleasingly--it is a funny, easy novel of manners. Even though you know the heroine will find love and career satisfaction at the end of the novel, getting there is no less pleasurable."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"Isabel's Bed by Elinor Lipman was on of the best novels I have ever read. Elinor Lipman is such an incredible writer. Elinor Lipman writes in such a manner that is so easy to read and absorb, but so funny, touching, warm, pleasant. This story is a perfect escape from the real world. This is a definite must-read."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"In this book Isabel, was in the wrong place at the wrong time and has decided to write a book about it. Not knowing the first thing about writing she hires a ghost writer. The lives of all of the charterers intertwine in a weird set of events that lead everyone to find themselves a different place in their lives then where they started out. If you are the kind of person who reads the first ten pages of a book to see if they will like it or not then this book is defiantly not for you. The first chapter or two of this book are very boring and poorly written but like in the book itself the author finds their grove and it is well worth the read. I love the interaction between the characters and the personal growth that they all go through. I would recommend this book if you like, Chick Lit, romance or a bit of fun read when you have nothing better to do."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"The writing was good, the author kept me interested. There were some secrets being revealed but it just seemed like they were nonchalantly exposed. No fire works, no big bomb dropping. It had all of the key elements to be exciting. There was adultery, murder, marriage to a previous stepfather, the struggle to become a successful writer. With all of this stuff hanging out there the books heroine just all of sudden decides she isn't a writer she is over her past love and she is going to open her own business, the end. It was like sitting in suspense waiting for the climax and being left hanging. I guess I just felt let down by the ending. But I will definately try more of her books this was my first read by Elinor Lipman."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I have read Isabel's Bed two times, and both times I was fully entertained!

It's a great novel- I highly suggest it!"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"This was a quick and easy read, but lacked substance and depth. It felt like a mindless &quot;trade romance paperback&quot; that one would read when they were unable to be near a t.v. and watch a soap opera. I'm really surprised this book is getting such high marks."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"I read most of this book on an airplane, which is meant to be a compliment--I was captivated by the story not trapped with no other entertainment options. Lipman's characterization shines, a grand mixture of slightly unbelievable yet totally &quot;real&quot; and sympathetic people. I laughed at Isabel at the same time I loved her for supporting Harriet. The ending was the only part that bummed me out: Harriet needed a career counselor."},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed: A Novel","review":"...but it wasn't.

I have read every one of her novels and especially loved The Ladies Man and Inn at Lake Devine. So I expected more than I got from Isabel's Bed. Elinor Lipman has a unique talent of putting obnoxious, sometimes weird characters into bizarre situations and making you enjoy every minute until somehow it all works out in the end. But this time, by page 300, I felt I still didnt know or care much about Harriet, the narrator. I think this book was too long and involved with too many things going on. The result was characters that were flat and forgettable and a plot that stalled. Lipman's usual formula might have worked better if she had just told Isabel's story and cut out Harriet and all her baggage. Maybe Isabel should have dispensed with the ghostwriter and written her book herself. Still,Lipman's writing after this one has been fantastic, and I can't wait for her next book. I guess this one is the exception that proves the rule."},{"Title":"How to Talk to Teens About Really Important Things: Specific Questions and Answers and Useful Things to Say","review":"This book was a used purchase and looked as though it were brand new.

One of the points I got out of it is that everyone is \\"preaching\\" a message, whether its the relativist position that there are no absolutes, or whether its the absolutist position that there are clear, objective standards of right and wrong - its just that the absolutist admits it. Well done."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"The basic premise of the book is straightforward. Two people are talking about the ideas of moral relativism and moral absolutism. The \\"Isa\\" character is a Muslim who believes that there are moral absolutes. The \\"Libby\\" character is a feminist who believes there are not moral absolutes.Moral absolutism is a position in which it is believed that the whole of humanity is obligated to act in certain ways. Moral relativism is the position in which there are no moral universals, or principles that compel all people.Some of the philosophical concepts that are of interest in this book include: 1) There is a definite connection between epistemology and ethics. If we cannot know moral truths, we should not be expected to live by them. 2) Are the differences in cultures around the world a proof of moral relativism? 3) Which one is more oppressive politically and socially when it becomes the majority paradigm: relativism or absolutism? 4) Can a relativist \\"preach\\" about, or attempt to spread, the idea of moral relativism without compromising their ideals?I couldn't put the book down once I had started it.

Absolutism has bad consequences. 2. Different cultures have different values. 3. Values are socially conditioned. 4. Relativism gives people freedom. 5. Relativism is tolerant. 6. Morality is relative to changing situations. 7. Morality is relative to changing intentions. 8. Morality can be explained by evolution as a survival device.As a moral relativist, even I find that not one of these is a worthwhile argument in favor of moral relativism, and thus \\"refuting\\" them is completely beside the point.Kreeft either ignores or is ignorant of the core of the true relativist challenge: No one can provide objective support for a claim to have an absolute foundation for moral values. Kreeft certainly can't. His argument in favor of absolutism rests primarily on what he calls the data of moral experience, which comes down to the claim that \\"Conscience immediately detects real right and wrong, just as your senses immediately detect real colors and shapes.\\" He believes that this proves that absolutism is \\"scientific\\" and empirically verified. He doesn't realize that two distinct propositions are involved. The following Proposition A is obviously true: Peter Kreeft believes he has a faculty--a conscience--that can immediately, absolutely, and objectively detect right and wrong. The following Proposition B is not necessarily true: Peter Kreeft has a faculty--a conscience--that can immediately, absolutely, and objectively detect right and wrong. The truth of Proposition A might be considered self-evident, even \\"scientific,\\" if by that one means that it's based on experience and evidence (if Kreeft says he has a particular belief, it's reasonable to acknowledge, lacking strong evidence to the contrary, that he does have that belief), but Kreeft never addresses why Proposition B should be considered true (i.e., that his belief is correct).In other words, Kreeft believes that just as he can know that the sky is blue merely by opening his eyes, so too he can know whether any given moral proposition is true or false just by considering it and allowing his conscience to come to an unmediated instant perception of its rightness or wrongness. His claim that this ability to make judgments that he believes are absolute proves that absolutism is \\"scientific\\" shows what a poor guide he is to moral philosophy.Kreeft's view seems to be that he and Christians like him with the proper interpretation of the revelation to Abraham and its subsequent revisions (\\"God [came] down to Abraham with the real religion\\") have a way of knowing when a moral position is objectively correct, but he fails to mention what guarantees the correctness of his organ of moral judgment, which leads me to assume that he knows his conscience is correct because he knows his conscience is correct.Here's an example of how Kreeft, who claims that his book offers \\"respectable logical arguments\\" from a \\"clear and very intelligent\\" viewpoint, in fact abuses language and logic. To defend the idea that changing situations \\"change how you should apply the rules, but they don't change the rules,\\" he gives the example of lying to a Nazi searching for hidden Jews: \\"The Nazis had no right to know that truth\\" so it wasn't wrong to \\"deceive\\" them. \\"Lying is always wrong, and that wasn't wrong, so that wasn't a lie.\\" To safeguard the absoluteness of the rule that says \\"Lying is always wrong,\\" Kreeft redefines \\"lying\\" from \\"the speaking of a falsehood\\" to \\"the speaking of a falsehood when it's not permissible to do so,\\" and so the rule becomes \\"The speaking of a falsehood when it is not permissible to do so is wrong.\\" Besides the irony in a professed absolutist ignoring the common meaning of a word to suit his purpose--and in particular redefining \\"lie\\" in defense of a belief in absolute truth--this raises the problem of how we're to judge, by objective standards, when \\"speaking a falsehood\\" is permissible and therefore not lying; otherwise, this rule is completely empty. If his semantic juggling is to be of any use, Kreeft's needs to prove that he has objective standards for making such a judgment, and he fails to. In fact, Kreeft's arguments in favor of absolutism are as follows:1. Absolutism has better consequences.The issue of whether relativism or absolutism has better consequences is irrelevant to the question of which view is correct, and, besides, it simply brings us back to the initial problem of deciding which moral framework to use in weighing what consequence in a given situation is \\"better.\\"2. Common consensus: \\"nearly everyone who has ever lived has been a moral absolutist.\\"He acknowledges that this is only a \\"probable,\\" not a conclusive argument. It's hard to see what this could prove, even probably, even if were true. A majority vote doesn't establish something as eternally valid.3. Moral experience. \\"The first and foundational moral experience we have is always absolutistic. Only later do you get relativism--later in the life of the individual or of the society ... we can all remember what moral experience was like before we became sophisticated. It was absolute.\\"Children are told what they must and must not do; early societies ruled by priests and kings laid down the law and demanded obedience. What this proves is that people and societies are told that moral rules are absolute; it doesn't prove that they actually are.4. How we use moral language.a. According to C. S. Lewis, we speak as though we believe that there are moral absolutes.Even if it were true that \\"we\\" (and who are these \\"we\\"?) speak in this way, it wouldn't prove that the things spoken of actually exist.b. Kreeft follows Lewis in claiming that, in essence, all moral arguments are about how to apply, in particular situations, what everyone agrees are certain universal, objective, and unchanging principles.In addition to the weakness already mentioned of basing conclusions about the actual nature of something on how \\"we\\" supposedly talk about it, this version of the assertion relies on an appeal to principles \\"everyone\\" supposedly agrees on. In fact, it turns out that by \\"everyone,\\" apologists like Kreeft and Lewis mean people with values close enough to theirs for those people to be considered morally competent or reasonable. What they're really saying is, \\"Everyone agrees on what is right and wrong, except for people who disagree with me (e.g., relativists, fascists, feminists, fanatics of religions other than mine, sociopaths, mental incompetents, etc.), and such individuals or groups can be discounted because their views are obviously unacceptable to reasonable people like me,\\" which begs too many questions to support an argument for the existence of common principles.That's pretty much the substance of Kreeft's \\"refutation.\\" He also throws in quite a bit of invective against people and principles he disagrees with, but he never addresses the following question: What are your objective, universal, and timeless reasons for claiming that your foundation for absolute values is true? This failure, taken in conjunction with the rest of Kreeft's falsely triumphal performance, raises the question of just what qualifications are required to teach philosophy at Boston College."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"This is a classic example of a debater setting up a straw man, and not a very good one, and then proceeding to tear it apart. There is no explication of what the author understood relativism to mean, and which aspect or version of relativism the he is attacking. The use of an interview in which two fictitious names are used in place of the author is a trite too clever. I am not a relativist as in one who believes that everyone's views of morality is right whatever that view might be. Neither am I an absolutist in professing that morality admits of only one way of discerning it. Whether there is one truth or many truths, or none at all, is a matter that is still open to intense philosophical debate.

Kreeft's style is unique to most reader's not introduced to the Socratic method of dialogue. In easier to understand language, it means that the book is written more like a play than prose. Kreeft has two main characters, a Muslim absolutist and a liberal African American woman. The two debate, discuss and dialogue about all aspects of morality. Kreeft, as usual, is easy to read and yet remains challenging in his intellectual mastery of the subject.

I knew the recent election of Barack Obama had put such a drain on my life with all the reading I did on him and finding out how much a downward spiral the US, as well as the world, was in. I'm not a tinfoil hat type of guy; there are signs everywhere. Just open your eyes and minds and you will see them.As a 4th year college fraternity guy, I was in the stronghold of moral deviance and liberalism; a member of a typical illicit drug using, tripping-over-condoms-every-few-steps, lying, cheating, stealing from your own brothers rooms type of frat and also a destructively liberal institution where kids are brainwashed day in day out with what the professor wants- university. Everyone on campus is a Democrat, I was raised Democrat, and Jewish, it just made sense to follow the crowd, right? I never did that though. I always questioned things of argumentum ad populi, and seeked the truth in what was actually going on. I always set my own path, and when I would try to tell people the light I have found in the fallacy of moral relativism and how wrong it is, people would just shrug their shoulders or blow me off.Moral relativism is the source of all our societal problems today, hand in hand with atheism and political corectness.I was the posterchild of moral deviance at one point of my college career. But I found the light, and I discovered what was the cause of all this wrong. And I'm changing my ways, going to the Church, and doing incredibly better now.Read this book, and I pray and hope you receive the same meaning and feeling I did from this book (there are a few other good books on moral relativism too, that could accomplish the same thing).

I must say that I was thoroughly impressed by this work and would recommend it to anyone who finds his or herself on either side of the figurative fence created by today's culture and it's precarious - and sometimes adversarial - engagement of religious absolutism.Religious absolutism has gained, as Kreeft notes through the \`interviews,' a rather polemical stigma in recent history. Closely tied to fundamental trends in the minds of many, absolutism is neither fundamental (in a pejorative sense) nor simplistic (in the idiotic sense). Kreeft does a fine job articulating that and helps to bring a refulgent tone to a formidable position.A page-turning synopsis of a timely philosophical topic."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"Kreeft structures his book around a series of interviews with a black moral relativist and activist, Libby, and a Muslim absolutionist and professor, 'Isa.

As a beginning philosophy student, I wanted background on philosophers like Descartes and Kant, and I really enjoyed learning about those two philosophers through Kreeft's series \\"Socrates Meets ....\\". But I found \\"A Refutation of Moral Relativism\\" even more enjoyable than his other books and I believe it would appeal to a much wider audience than those who wish to learn some philosophy. To begin with, even though the title is misleading and suggests a dry essay, you should \\"try it, you'll like it\\". It is actually a lively entertaining dialogue, or, more correctly, an interview by a Black radical feminist reporter of an Islamic philosophy professor about moral relativism, and they cast many humorous barbs against each other. The interview is divided into ten sessions, each on an aspect of moral relativism. My favorite two interviews are the two in which the reporter offers 8 different arguments for moral relativism, and the professor offers an average of 4 different refutations for each of her arguments. One point worth repeating that he (and Aristotle) makes is that if your opponents terms are clear, his propositions true, and his reasoning valid then his conclusion is TRUE, not \\"true for him, but not true for me\\", but TRUE. And if you wish to preserve your self respect, you should gracefully concede the argument.The professor's conclusion in the tenth interview seems outrageous but entirely plausible, so I won't give it away."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"This is an absolutely delightful read. I don't want to salt the dig, but there are a couple important things to know about this work:1) It's not really Kreeft. It's a series of transcriptions of taped interviews where he's 'moderating'. If I knew that up front I probably would have made the mistake of not buying the book.2) The gentleman being interviewed possesses a truly exceptional mind and is impressively articulate. Unfortunately the interviewer... not so much. I'd love to hear a conversation on these topics between him and an intellectual equal, or at least someone playing in the same league. The downside is that there's a fair amount of rehash of obvious arguments, keeping Isa shackled down to the level of his interviewer. The upside is that you'll laugh when you hear the same hackneyed points posited by moral relativist illiterati in the wild.None of that can ding it below 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"It's nice to have all the arguments set in an interview format.

The result is a surprisingly readable and educational give-and-take on the still-current debate between moral relativism and moral absolutism as appropriate philosophies for life.Kreeft tips his eventual destination in the title, and partisans of moral relativism may reasonably disagree that their side gets equal treatment. However, the general reader will find much useful, authentic discussion here, of the kind rarely found in today's main stream media. Partisans can find something to chew on that may freshen a long-held perspective, even if they ultimately are unlikely to be swayed.

That's why I gave it four stars."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"As a book in philosophy, this work fails. Kreeft presents unoriginal arguments in a largely incoherent fashion and consistently refuses to examine their flaws. To compound these errors, he relies heavily on equivocation, straw men, and guilt by association, among other fallacies. In fact, he doesn't even make the trivial effort it would require to ensure a fair representation of his opponent's view: the voice of relativism is, from the start, the villain of the book. Relativists (and philosophers in general who have respect for their craft) should be offended by this book's philosophical content.However, relativists should also be worried. While this book utterly fails as a philosophical treatise, it succeeds admirably as propaganda. Untrained readers will surely accept his constant claims that the \\"debates\\" represent unbiased philosophy. From there, they'll readily accept that relativism will be the downfall of mankind. If anybody doubts its effectiveness, simply read through the other reviews. For this reason, I encourage relativists to take this book seriously and review its arguments online, for free (and with considerably less irritating one-sided banter) at [...]To be sure, if you're interested in this debate, you'll hear these arguments again and again. In that way alone does Kreeft perform a public service by printing this drivel: there is no better way for a budding relativist to develop a strong foundation for his belief than to read these arguments and tear them apart."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"In terms of craft, this is a pretty thin piece of work. Kreeft probably thinks he's walking some kind of tightrope of \\"political correctness\\" by pitting an ethical \\"relativist\\" (Liberal! Black! Feminist!) against a Palestinian ethical \\"absolutist.\\" This supposed practicing Muslim philosopher is curiously reluctant to cite the Koran and curiously eager to quote Jesus and Socrates. I think there's one mention of Mohammed by name in the book, but without an index, I can't be certain. It's as though Kreeft is so tangled in his Catholic beliefs that he's afraid of earning afterworldly demerits by putting realistic words in the mouth of his character. It would have been better had he dropped the slapdash artifice and simply presented the discussion in his own voice. It would have been even better if he had bothered to express opposing views with more precision and force, but I wonder whether he's capable. A witless caricature might be the best he can manage in capturing the so-called relativist position.The book fares only slightly better as philosophy. Kreeft shows that relativism is contradictory because it claims, despite its own central tenet, to cling to an absolute truth, viz., that there are no absolute truths. Great! It follows that relativism is not a coherent position; it is not a valid move in any philosophical contest; it is no one's actual view because it can't possibly be; every careful interrogation of a so-called relativist unmasks an absolutist in disguise. It follows that Kreeft has devoted an entire meandering book to debunking a view that no one holds and that, for all intents and purposes, does not exist. At least we can understand why he needed to invent a straw-man.In refuting a non-position, Kreeft has actually shown that some people are fuzzy about their philosophical commitments. Libby (Kreeft's straw-man) is shown to hold to a set of enduring moral postulates that she's not very good at articulating, so she mislabels her ethical outlook as \\"relativism.\\" Again and again, her interlocutor, Isa, allows her to do so in order to call attention to the contradiction and deflate this \\"relativism.\\" Despite Kreeft's chicken-little routine, Libby's shortcomings (misapplication of the \\"relativism\\" label, inattention to philosophical matters) do not herald the imminent decline of civilization, no matter how widespread they may be. Her trivial mistakes typify what should already be blindingly obvious, that people don't commonly take an avid interest in the philosophical classifications of their everyday thinking. How terrible is this? Not very. This book force-feeds the trivially true and indulges in histrionics.The histrionics are interesting and important reading, though not in a way Kreeft intends (hence two stars). This book is packed with insights into the philosophical shibboleths of the contemporary religious right in America and beyond. Early on, he tells us that the enlightenment should be called the \\"endarkenment\\" since it privileged reason over faith, and by the book's end, he has connected supposed errors in Ockham, Hume, Kant, and others with the rise of deconstructionism, Nazism and -- yes, it gets even worse -- the sexual revolution. (Kreeft's supposed refutation of evolutionary ethics is embarrassingly shallow and inept; I do not exaggerate to say I would expect better from a Junior High essayist.) No doubt the self-proclaimed ethical \\"abolutists\\" in Tehran, Mecca, and Kabul would find plenty of common ground with Kreeft's denunciation of the \\"endarkenment,\\" and would nod along with Kreeft's call to shun reason and get back to the prayer mats.Sorry, Mr. Kreeft. The dark ages were dark, and the enlightenment has been better.

I had to give up about 3/4s through because it was just so awful. It was obvious what side the author was on, because the absolutist was always calm, composed and full of examples and theory, while the relativist was childish, petty and awed by the inability of her philosophy to provide counters to the arguments.

This book is an imaginary dialogue, in which the existence of moral absolutes is emphatically affirmed, and relativism and relativists are cast into outer darkness. Kreeft does not have the epigrammatic gift like his great predecessor G. K. Chesterton did. In fact, GKC summed up much of this book's argument in a single quip: &quot;One can no more have a private religion than one can have a private sun or a private moon.&quot; But Kreeft accurately spots and calls to account much lazy thinking that's out there. For instance, if all values are &quot;culturally determined&quot;, what are we to make of people whose values impel them to resist and denounce their own culture? Plus, he is quite funny in places, and sympathetic readers will enjoy the protagonist's zest in making his arguments. Throughout, Kreeft--through the fictional mouth of 'Isa the absolutist--insists on the primacy of people's experiences and reactions over any philosophical system, and of the pre-existence of a discoverable Truth. This book settles nothing, as such things can never be settled. But it _is_ a big morale booster to Christians who may be becoming fatigued under the amoral onslaught of our culture nowadays.

I just finished reading Peter Kreeft's &quot;A Refutation of Moral Relativism.&quot; I couldn't imagine a more thought-provoking, eye-opening, and genuinely meaningful book.Kreeft, a professor of philosophy at Boston College, examines the definition, history, and importance of moral relativism. He makes an impeccable case that the current controversy over the nature of morality -- that is, whether it be relative or absolute -- is THE most crucial debate of our time.The book opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about Western culture. We are so conditioned to believe that morality is relative that such conditioning affects our thinking, our language and diction, our schooling, our media, and (obviously) our morality -- our very way of life (and thus, maybe, our afterlife?). Kreeft makes the case that, with so much at stake, we cannot afford to be wrong.A master logician and philosopher, Kreeft takes on the arguments for moral relativism one by one. His refutation is devastating; he demonstrates that most arguments for relativism are logically self-contradictory and, indeed, that morality cannot be anything other than absolute either in theory or in practice. (He even shows that tolerance--often an explicit reason for belief in relativism--is a virtue only achieved through moral absolutism.)Afterwards, Kreeft turns his exacting lens on absolutism, its assumptions and its role in reality. He is, if nothing else, supremely objective and fair-minded.But don't let the thought of reading about logic and philosophy turn you off! Professor Kreeft as much for the average reader as he does for anyone else. His writing is accesible, reasonable (in the most literal sense of that word), and, above all, ENJOYABLE. As his subtitle indicates, the book is in the form of several interviews, or debates, between a moral absolutist, 'Isa, and a moral relativist, Libby.&quot;A Refutation of Moral Relativism&quot; should be required reading in all philosophy courses dealing with morality.

But if you know a young person, or an old one, who needs a good lesson in how to argue and debate, how to open their mind up and wrap it around a subject and take it apart and put it back together again, I can't think of a better intro off hand. Bravo, Dr. Kreeft."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"Fantastic book, a tough read for those unwilling to give truth a chance; like a good philosopher, Dr. Kreeft makes you think. This book will challenge your relativism and help you see that absolutes are not a thing of the past! Great read if your willing to take an honest look at your moral disposition. Perhaps it will change you, perhaps it will not. Reward yourself, approach this book with an open mind. Don't pay attention to the critic who wrote the review: \\"One-sided and poorly written\\". Read the book and decide for yourself. This person reminds me of Plato's cave- once confronted by light all he can do is recoil from it. Don't simply claim that the book is one-sided and poorly written, prove it, refute the ideas in the work. It is very easy to dismiss, but not so to refute! If your looking for an author that will challenge you with ideas in a clear, brilliant, and easy to read style, Dr. Kreeft is for you. His style embodies the phrase: \\"If you can't say it simply, then you don't know it\\"- Dr. Kreeft knows his stuff! He introduces very complex ideas in simple terms- how many philosophers do you know who do that!"},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"For me, this book is very tough to review. It's approach is unique, and this tends to impact how the subject matter is addressed. I think the uniqueness of its approach had great potential, but ultimately, I found that it was this unique approach that kept the book from getting over the hump.The book represents a fictional dialogue between a moral absolutist and a moral relativist. The book contains a series of fictional interviews where each side presents their own case, while attempting to refute the other's case. If done right, this is a very vibrant and intriguing approach to dealing with a highly charged subject. But in order to do this right, one must adequately and fairly represent the views of each side, in order to avoid strawmen and incompleteness. And it is here where I thought the book did not totally succeed.There are a few sections of the book that are super. I felt that the best chapters, by far, were the ones where the fictional relativist makes her case for relativism, and then watching the fictional absolutist dismantle each positive assertion for relativism. I felt that this section was very fair to the relativist view, and that the positive assertions offered for relativism are indeed commonplace assertions that accurately reflect the thinking of many relativists. As indicated previously, the integrity of the book rests almost entirely on presenting an accurate and adequate picture of each side of the debate. In this particular section, Kreeft succeeds and I felt that this section alone makes the book good enough to read.However, I personally found much of the remaining material to be both mediocre, distracted, and confused, thus the 3 star rating I've given the book. I found Kreeft's extended arguments for experience as a proof of absolutism to be weak and on shaky ground philosophically. I think that it does make sense to appeal to 'experience' as an argument for moral absolutism, but this must be done very carefully. I felt that Kreeft did not adequately sharpen his experience argument in such a way as to make it a concise proof for absolutism.In regards to the 'distracting' concept identified above, I felt there was simply too much needless banter from both sides of the fictional debate that served no useful end. I'm aware that some readers may view the ad hominems from both sides as being entertaining, but I found it to be very distracting and disrupting to the flow of the book. The ad hominems emanating from both sides could have served a useful purpose had these ad hominems themselves been refuted. But many were not, and appeared to have been inserted into the fictional dialogue for entertainment value, rather than as legitimate points for debate and refutation.Lastly, I felt the book was confused about what it was trying to do. The dialogue at times delves into philosophical theory, both past and present, but also clearly delves into layman arguments as well. As a result, I felt as if the book couldn't make up its mind as to whether the emphasis was going to be on debating philosophical concepts, or down to earth opinions of everyday people. It tries to dabble in both, but I found the result to be an inadequate examination of both. I think Kreeft should have clearly decided at the outset who he was trying to talk to here - a philosophically and logically oriented group, or a layman opinion-based group. The issue of moral relativism is one where significant and lengthy treatises could be written to either audience. But in this book, Kreeft writes a very short book that tries to reach both, and I think this confused the analysis and examination and shortchanged both sides.In summary, a number of chapters were quite good. But for the reasons outlined above, I thought that the book could have been much better, and thus represents only a partial success."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"Peter John Kreeft is a professor of philosophy at Boston College, a prolific writer and an engaging educator and public speaker. My first exposure to his writings came through his bookA Shorter Summa: The Essential Philosophical Passages of Saint Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica, which was first systematic introduction to the writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Kreeft is definitely strongly influenced by Thomistic thought, and this \\"Refutation\\" reflects some of that, as the dedication too strongly implies.The book is structured as a series of dialogues between Libby Rawls, a prototypical modern liberal relativist, and \`Isa Ben Adam, a stand-in for a philosophically well versed moral absolutist. Both of them are figments of Kreeft's imagination, and maybe even parts of his own divided personality. The dialogues are deliberately fashioned after Socratic dialogues, and they serve as a vehicle through which Kreeft crafts his arguments in favor of moral absolutism.I have had a chance to listen Kreeft give a lecture on this very topic, and based on that it would make sense to write the arguments in a form of dialogues. Kreeft is a very good public speaker and great at interacting with audience and thinking on his feet about even the most arcane topic. This is clearly reflected in the book as well, as some of potential intellectual minefields are avoided with masterful grace. Furthermore, it is quite unusual nowadays to come across a book written in a form of dialogue. The academic writing tends to be very technical and impersonal, and that sometimes detracts from otherwise a very interesting topic. However, reading a page after page of interpersonal argumentation can get overbearing after a while, especially if the give-and-take can be rather confrontational on an occasion. However, this is easily compensated by lucidity of the prose and cogency of arguments. If you have ever had to argue with a moral relativist, this would be an ideal book that can be used to refute most of their arguments. It is an exercise in absolutist apologetics."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"Peter Kreeft is absolutely brilliant. This book does alot to point out what is wrong with our culture. Many today justify their actions with the excuse, &quot;What's right for me isn't necesarrily right for you.&quot; This book puts an end to this mindless blabber. Buy it. Read it. Re-read it. Recommend it to a loved one."},{"Title":"A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist","review":"My first sample of this writer's exposition, and I am an avowed \\"fan\\". Actually got this book from my local library, read it a bunch of times, referred to it frequently in debates with confreres interested in the \\"essential questions\\", and decided I needed it on my shelves permanently.Truly imaginative, as the characters involved in this rigorous and sometimes sensitive debate are all in Prof. Kreeft's mind. They come alive, though, because the \\"types\\" they so ably represent are clear reflections of people you and I all know - especially those who just don't recognize that their arguments fail the most basic logic tests.For example, as I write this (Spring, 2003), a murder case in California charges that the alleged killer has taken two lives - one, his wife, and another, their unborn child. California has decided to pursue both deaths as murders, thereby making it possible to seek the ultimate sanction on the alleged killer - the death penalty.Meanwhile (and it is hard to believe these legal decisions are taking place in the same country), the legal system of the state of Connecticut has determined that an unborn child is not functionally different from other body parts - teeth, hair, skin, etc. - and therefore does not qualify as a person within the context of the law, so the judges ruled that there is no case to bring against a man who was being charged with attempted murder of an unborn child.Only a moral relativist can successfully hold these two contradictory positions without conflict: either the fetus/unborn child is a human being/person and therefore covered by the protections of the law, or it isn't, in which case, a person cannot be charged with a crime for killing it.Perhaps we can encourage our judges to read this work and straighten out this mess they've made. Well, we can dream, anyway ..."},{"Title":"Mabela the Clever","review":"I enjoy storybooks adapted from oral storytelling. This story is from the Limba people in Sierra Leone, Africa. The illustrations are simplistic but not meant to be completely realistic. The mice are purple, green, yellow and gray. Mabella, being the main character mouse, is red. All of the mice have ping-pong ball eyes that give them a foolish appearance. She is different than the other mice because she pays attention to the advice her father's advice of listening, looking and paying attention to her surroundings. He also recommends fleeing quickly from bad situations. How will these lessons come into play when the mice meet a pleasant cat inviting them to join a secret cat society?I really like the last line of the story, \\"Limba grandparents say, \\"If a person is clever, it is because someone has taught them their cleverness.\\""},{"Title":"Mabela the Clever","review":"What does it mean to be clever? Does it mean that when you attend cocktail parties with a chosen circle of friends you're able to whip out a series of timely bon mots? Does it mean that you have the ability to finish every Sunday crossword puzzle that appears in the New York Times? Or does it, perhaps, mean that you use the full range of your brain at all times, thereby saving yourself from harm in the long run? My vote is for the last. And, as the delightful \\"Mabela the Clever\\" by Margaret Read MacDonald concurs, not much more need be said on the subject.Says the book from the start, \\"In the early times, some were clever and some were foolish. The Cat was one of the clever ones. The mice were mostly foolish\\". Mostly. There are exceptions to every rule and in this case the exception is named Mabela. Mabela comes from a loving family, one that has given her much good advice in the past. Says her father to her, one should always keep their ears open to listen, their eyes open to see, pay attention to everything you say, and \\"if you have to move, MOVE FAST!\\". A sweet little red mouse, Mabela finds use for this parcel of wisdom when a large charming orange pussycat persuades the mice to learn all the secrets of the cat. To do so, they need only walk in a line with the cat in the rear, singing, \\"When we are marching, we never look back! The cat is at the end! Fo Feng! Fo Feng!\\". It's Mabela who realizes, at the front of this line, that something is amiss. Especially when the voices of the others behind her becomes softer.... and softer...Fear not, little children. Though I'm sure that the original folktale of this story had the cat eat every one of the foolish mousies, it does not do so here. Instead, the cat wears a red bag on its back, into which it scoops and drops each mouse that it hopes to eat later. Fortunately for all (except the cat) Mabela intercedes. In her Author's Note at the beginning of the book, acclaimed storyteller extraordinaire, Margaret Read MacDonald, explains that she adapted this tale from one found originally in Sierra Leone. People reading this book are encouraged to sing the marching song with initial gusto and then, as each mouse slips away, softer and softer. She even provides a tune, though she points out that it's perfectly copacetic to create a melody of your own.What I found especially endearing about this picture book were the illustrations by Tim Coffey. An artist who has only produced one or two books in his lifetime, he's given this tale just the right amount of whimsy to make it a classic. The mice may be foolish, but they're also lovable. Mabela, set apart from the others by deint of her berry red fur, sports a lovely little pair of buck teeth that make her especially adorable. And the cat is an excellent source of beautiful malice. It is a hunter and a charmer. You have no difficulty believing that the mice would follow this coy leader wherever it might ask them to go.The moral of this story is an excellent one for children. Don't act without thinking and always keep your wits about you. A lovely lesson for one and all. The final line in the book reads that, \\"If a person is clever, it is because someone has taught them their cleverness\\". In this case, Margaret Read MacDonald is that person. She, therefore, is the one to thank."},{"Title":"Mabela the Clever","review":"A good story with an unusual moral - at least, I've never heard \\"Pay attention and THINK about what you're saying!\\" presented as a moral before, although God knows it ought to be.No mousies are harmed in the reading of this story.

And what will Mabela, the clever hero of the title, do about the situation?This is a suspenseful story that is well enhanced by Coffey's whimsical pictures.

This is a very disordered work, and at times seems to be doing its best to instill the reader with the same kind of wild confusion the writer often confesses himself suffering from. True the last part of the book seems to me anyway far less satisfactory than the first. True also that there is something sort of contemptible and dismissive in the author's attitude to most of the people he meets.But against all this is one more powerful truth. Exley could really write. His language is alive, and his characters are real characters, crazy originals who he gives a strong feeling of the presence of. He too within this all has a kind of moral outrage a stance which I think comes out most strongly in what for me is the best part of the book his writing about his brother. The tone of outrage and anger with which he tells the story is fierce and deep in feeling.His brother 'The Brigadier', ( This is a nickname as the brother has worked himself up from the ranks to 'Chicken Colonel' only) a veteran of three wars, the Second World War, Korea, the Vietnam War is diagnosed with cancer at the age of forty-three. The opening chapters of the book describe the author -narrator 's plane-trip with his mother to say farewell to the brother, and as it turns out attend his funeral. In the course of this Exley meets on the plane a stewardess who will become his off and on-mistress in the years ahead, and is another of his spectacularly crazy and original characters. She will turn out to be such an inveterate liar that nothing she says or for that matter which is said about her, can be relied on. This by the way applies to the whole story as Exley himself it is clear is a tremendous fantasizer, whose gift is not only fictionalizing reality but in letting his fantasies become his reality. The bottle apparently helps him in this.But the story of the brother is a moving one. Exley's description of the unit his brother is apart of coming to the Yalu river and looking out at vast wastes of Manchuria in the Korean War is a gripping one. His claim in the course of this that MacArthur actually knew the Chinese would make a counter- offensive that would decimate a large share of this unit is so far as I know not substantiated by evidence. But part of Exley's outrage is his sense that his brother and the grunts like him were betrayed by the military higher- ups .In fact one other fascinating side of Exley here and in his work is in general is in his involvement in and description of a very male world, the worlds of fighting and violence. This is brought out in other sections of the work when he is involved in bar- hopping with a character who proves to be incredibly violent. There is one description of a bar- fight in which this character goes overboard beating up and incapacitating two drunken construction workers.Clearly part of the charm of Exley was his toughness, a certain macho quality in his language. His work is in the tradition of Fielding's Tom Jones and is like Donleavy's 'The Ginger Man' and Malcolm Lowry's \\"Under the Volcano\\" in being a kind of alcholic's picaresque. Only in Exley's case the elements of failure and disorder are so great as to make it clear that this is no celebration of self , but rather a kind of rough fight in which he most of all beats up on himself.But again at its best the work can be both moving and hilarious. There is tastelessness in it and a degree of vulgarity beyond that which I am accustomed to or really like. But there is also some kind of redemption here , or rather the reader's wish that somehow it would turn out all differently and that Exley 's life and this book would turn out better than it does.In any case. This is a real writer and one whoever cares about him can be proud of."},{"Title":"Last Notes from Home","review":"A Fan's Notes was so good, I should have known that the subsequent contributions would not hold up.

I think what helped was going in with such low expectations.Here's Mary Cantwell, of the NYT: \\"Last Notes From Home\\" (1988) is a sad book, less because of its subject matter -- its center is his brother's death -- than because of the franticness with which its author tried to impose order on a stubbornly inchoate narrative.\\"Exley is rightly regarded as having written one of the best debut novels ever:A Fan's Notes, but the two books he published after that,Pages From A Cold Island, and this one, are widely considered self-indulgent junk. Not hard to see what critics such as Jonathan Yardley mean by that: \\"Last Notes from Home\\" contains about 50 pages on the all the niggling annoyances of a plane flight, for example.Well, I knew all that but was determined to read it anyway. I like Exley's voice, see. It's sinewy, masculine, hilarious and searing by turns. Exley is always fully in command of the language, and I guess that in this book he's just one of those people like Adam Carolla: he's not saying much, but nevertheless it's enjoyable to hear him complain and deprecate himself. It's also refreshing to hear a voice from the time before PC.Here's Alan Bisbort: \\" [...] I recently read 'Last Notes from Home,' the final volume in the autobiographical trilogy by Frederick Exley, a writer I once greatly admired. As I read it, I was aghast at how bad it was. Not the writing--no, Exley was one of the most talented writers of his generation--but the spirit that infused it: broken down, self-pitying, repetitious, and not funny in the least.

When Exley writes about Watertown in this final novel, it is as good--indeed, likely better--as anything he has written, but when he goes too far afield from there, his work unravels.

A London detective agency has been found to be involved in espionage and its owner has been picked up--but government authorities want to keep the agency open in hope of tracing its illegal activities. How would Tommy and Tuppence like to take on the task?This set up provides the frame for a series of short stories in which Tommy and Tuppence handle various legitimate calls upon the detective agency even as they hope to make contacts that will break the spy ring. There is Lawrence St. Vincent, whose lady-love has agreed to marry him... but only if he can solve a unique riddle. There is a stolen pearl, the odd scam, and a few murders as well--and, of course, espionage constantly in the background.Along the way, Tommy and Tuppence have fun by adopting the methods, with considerably varied result, of famous fictional detectives such as The Old Man In The Corner, Sherlock Holmes, and even (albeit briefly) the celebrated Hercule Poirot. It is all very light hearted, lightly written, and as always when Christie elects to trot out Tommy and Tuppence the great attraction are the characters themselves--sharp, witty, and having a good time.This collection of short stories comes no where near the brilliance of THE TUESDAY CLUB MURDERS, featuring Miss Marple, or THE LABORS OF HERCULES, only slightly less fine and featuring Hercule Poirot.

The Beresfords jump at the opportunity, with Tommy augmenting his sleuthing abilities by studying the great fictional masters, like Sherlock Holmes and even Hercule Poirot. Many of the stories are interconnected, such as \\"The Clergyman's Daughter\\" which begins with a tale about a possible poltergeist forcing a poor young woman to sell the house she inherited, that then ends in The Red House\\" when Tommy and Tuppence discover the natural reason behind the supernatural events.

Tommy and Tuppence are definitely likable characters, and while the stories are rather dated, the wordplay and sheer fun that these two characters have is infectious.

I get the idea that maybe if I was more familiar with some of the older mystery books it would make more sense, because evidently Tommy and Tuppence are attempting to copy their methods.So, this was an enjoyable book with some of my favorite characters of Christie's, but I liked their first book, The Secret Adversary, better in the end."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"A Tommy & Tuppence Adventure.

I love the way Tuppence is portrayed, especially since it first came out in 1929!"},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"This book was so sweet amd so fun too. I like Agatha Chrisite books but sometimes she just wrote the same plot with different names and a different title. This book was original and pretty funny too."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"This book is a good book to read if you like mystery books. I would want someone else to read this so that they can understand that detectives do all they can to solve the crime. Tommy is like my sister's boyfriend. He's like a very shy and cautious person. While I was reading this book I could not believe that the mystery's were about divorce cases. Tommy and Tuppence are middle aged people who are married. Another reason I would reccomand this book is because it has a lot of humor and excitement. Its just a great book about a Russian mystery. I learned some things about the book. Im going to go get more of her mystery books from the library to read."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"I like Miss Marple, I like Hercule Poirot, Superintendant Battle, Mr. Satterwhite, et al, but I do not like the Tommy and Tuppence stories.

It's great to go back and see their earlier work."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"Met T&T late in their life. It was good to read the start. Ol' Aggie set the standard for the age."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"Great reading by chapter. It is enjoyable to read stories by chapter and end up with the finale. Easy reading, although confusing a times."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"First appearing inThe Secret Adversary, Tommy and Tuppence are now a happily married couple looking for their next adventure. Contacted by their old friend and intelligence agent Mr. Carter, they agree to take on an amateur detective agency. With the real owner found to be involved in espionage, Tommy takes on the identity of Mr. Blunt in the hopes that by keeping the business open, the international spy-ring will continue to believe that it's a safe rendezvous point for the exchange of secret information. They're told to keep a lookout for a man who will come to them with a particular code-word - until then, they're to run the agency as though it were a real business, as taking on real cases will help their cover story.This is the framing device for a collection of short stories about what Tommy and Tuppence get up to in the wait for the mystery man. There are thirteen altogether, some of which are summarized by Tuppence herself: \\"one jewel robbery, two escapes from violent death, one case of a missing lady, one young girl befriended, an alibi successfully exploded, and alas! One case where we made utter fools of ourselves.\\" It's an eclectic mix of stories, and one gets the feeling that they were crafted from random notes that Agatha Christie had lying around the house or stuffed into a desk drawer. Seeing the opportunity to revisit two characters she enjoyed, they were cobbled together in order to create a short-story anthology that has the wit, banter and liveliness of Tuppence and Tommy as its main attraction. They are certainly appealing characters: both deeply in love with each other and with life, and having a great time throughout.Along for the ride is their friend Albert, who enthusiastically takes to the role of a receptionist for the agency - he provides a couple of laugh-out-loud moments in the way he embraces his new calling. Likewise, many of the stories themselves serve as parodies of other famous detective novels: Tommy and Tuppence adopt the methods and idiosyncrasies of various other sleuths in a rather tongue-and-cheek way throughout the stories. Much likeThe Labors of Herculeshad each story correlate with one of the legendary tasks of Hercules, each of these stories in some way channels the tone of another mystery writer. As such, it contains a lot of references to other works, many of which are obscure to the modern reader. In fact, as I'm not a voracious mystery-reader, the only one I recognized was Sherlock Holmes (obviously) and Christie's cheeky use of her own Poirot.This isn't Christie's best - in fact some of her mysteries and ideas are downright bizarre, including Tommy outwitting an assailant by pretending to be blind, and one mystery that boils down to solving a simple riddle. Some aren't even mysteries at all. It's clear that \\"Partners in Crime\\" was an experiment or a bit of fun on Christie's half, but anyone who enjoys the duo of Tommy and Tuppence will appreciate this. The touching thing about their appearances both here and in subsequent novels is that they age alongside Christie. By their final appearance inPostern of Fatethey are in their twilight years, but here at least, the book ends with Tuppence making a special announcement that promises an entirely different adventure for the two of them."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"A sometimes quirky, sometimes deadly serious mystery anthology. In my humble opinion, this is one of Agatha Christie's best outputs. It takes the reader through a series of interrelated yet \\"stand alone' short stories that tell of a couple of former spies and mystery buffs, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford. Once again they take up the mantle of protecting the British Empire while also pretending to be private detectives in an agency that British intelligence suspects is an enclave for enemy spies. In each crime they solve they act similar to one of their favorite detectives from fiction...in some cases with hilarious results. i think this is a must read for fans of Ms. Christie."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"I enjoy Agatha Christie mysteries and of all the ones I've read,I like the Tommy and Tuppence stories the best."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"Agatha Christie's continuing adventures of Tommy and Tuppence. I originally got interested in them watching shows on PBS and found one of their stories in a book of five of Christie's works. While this is not Christie's best work the stories are interesting and very readable."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"I wish that Agatha Christie had written more stories around these two. Tommy and Tuppence are amongst her most attractive characters. Tommy is a pleasant young man who tries to be serious and responsible, but is also the perfect partner for Tuppence whose exuberance and willingness to take risks moves the action into some hair-raising situations.Here we see them in the second book in the series, where each chapter is a parody around a famous fiction detective of the time. Many of these \\"detectives\\" are long forgotten, but the style of each one is mirrored in the activities of Christie's characters in a collection of credible but interesting situations. Agatha Christie was not only a good writer of detective fiction, but she was also a very clever woman. Nowhere is this more evident that is this volume.The Kindle format is great. This book loses none of its vivacity in this presentation."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"Tommy and Tuppence are once again on the trail of Russian spies. They are commissioned to take over a detective agency that will be used as a front to try and trap said Russian spies. Posing as a detective and his \\"confidential secretary\\" the Beresfords take on all sorts of cases. Some are not very difficult, and Tuppence repeatedly proves herself to be the superior detective. The two go through all sorts of machinations to try and prove their importance to their clients, claiming to be called away to important cases by Scotland Yard. They also mimic the methods and habits of famous literary detectives. There are even several bows to Christie's own Poirot, as they attempt to use \\"the little grey cells.\\"I must admit that Tommy and Tuppence are my least favorite of Christie's detectives. Still, a lesser Christie is still better than a good many other mysteries. Short stories rob Christie of some of her best attributes- complex character development and relationships, and that is certainly the case here. Still, while Christie's short stories are rarely as good as her novels, this volume is still worth a read."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"This is a collection of short mysteries in which Tommy and Tuppence work their way through posing as detectives owning their own agency, as asked by Scotland Yard, to catch a mean suspect. Tommy and Tuppence are wonderful characters. They have great humor and love to pick on each other. I really enjoyed the teasing of each other. And this lovely couple act out different detectives for each case, based on what they know of the case. You really get a small glimps of how they see other detectives in the books."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"I love Agatha Christie books but had never read the Tommy and Tuppence series. I read Thje Secret Adversary first and then ordered the rest of the series. Partners in Crime is really a bunch of short stories featuring Tommy and Tuppence and their various adventures. The two sleuths remind me of Mr and Mrs Peale from the old TV series. Very entertaining and fun to read. I especially like that the stories are short ---- I read every night to relax into sleep.I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"The first time I read Tommy and Tuppence, about 30 years ago, they were my least favorite Agatha Christie characters. However, when I reread this book recently, I loved it. It is a collection of short stories about cases handled by T & T, each one mimicking the style of other fictional sleuths. Some of the clues and solutions to the mysteries were brilliant. The one in which their clerk Albert lassoes the bad guy made me laugh out loud, nearly scaring my cat off the back of the couch. I absolutely loved the one about the clergyman's daughter whose inherited fortune was mixed up with potatoes. Christie takes ordinary events and everyday occurrences and turns them into imagined fantasies. All of the stories are puzzles, of course, challenging you to try to figure out the solution. None of them contain graphic violence, irrelevant sex, or profanity. Great entertainment."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"A very enjoyable read. The small size of the paperback makes it good for travelling while the story takes your mind off the delayed flight."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"My oldest daughter started checking out Agatha Christie novels from the library. She says they are cool. She left a couple books in the van last week. I brought them in and started reading Partners in Crime.Partners in Crime is a collection of short stories tied together with an overall story arc. The partners are a husband and wife team who solve mysteries. Tommy and Tuppence Beresford are asked by the Secret Service to take over a detective agency in an effort to flush out a master spy. The Beresfords agree. As detectives they have several adventures. Every chapter or couple chapters has a single mystery. With the last chapter being when they capture the master spy that no one else had been able to get a handle on.The stories take place in the early 1900's in England. The mysteries happen at various locations and different levels of society. I figure my daughter is learning a little bit of history as she reads these stories.They are fun. If you haven't read an Agatha Christie book before, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"Partners in Crime is an enjoyable collection of mystery short stories involving the droll Tommy and his cheeky wife, Tuppence.The stories are bound together by a main thread, in which the Beresfords battle against boredom by taking up a Detective Agency under assumed names. As they tackle each case, Christie lampoons various detective fiction by having them solve the case \\"in the style of\\" a popular fictional detective, starting with (of course) Sherlock Holmes.A clever, rewarding device, especially since Christie finishes with having her characters poke fun at her own famous hero, Hercule Poirot.As with the other Tommy & Tuppence book I've thus far read (I'm reading Christie's fiction in the order of publication, so I believe this is their second appearance), the writing is light and whimsical and just a lot of fun. You might think of Agatha Christie's novels as being one undifferentiated mass of mystery fiction wrtiting, but you'd be wrong: within her genre, Christie wrote all sorts of types of stories in many different styles. What sets Tommy & Tuppence apart is a light, ironic sense of humor about itself and mystery fiction, in general.A fun read. Four stars."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"While waiting for the spies from Moscow to show their hand, Tommy and Tuppence, aka Mr &amp; Mrs Beresford, took over a detective agency known to be associated with the Moscow spies and masqueraded as the real owner Mr Blunt and staff. A fair number of legitimate cases unrelated to the spies came their way, and the two played the game by pretending to be famous fictious detectives, including Father Brown (creation of GK Chesterton) and Sherlock Holmes (creation of Arthur Conan Doyle). They solved the cases with more than an element of fun, typical husband-wife oneupmanship, female intuition etc.While entertaining, the backdrop of the detective agency being a Trojan horse for counter-intelligence was rather naive and unrealistic. It presumed the Russians did not know the faces of the English traitors they recruited, and once the trap was exposed, they would prefer to spring it rather than leave it alone."},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"Tommy &amp; Tuppence Beresford take over a detective agency for Scotland Yard, and delve into a variety of mysteries, domestic and international. With almost every adventure, Christie users other literary detectives as inspirations for the Beresfords to solve crimes, including her own Hercule Poirot.

My favorite thing about Agatha Christie's works is her ability to portray human nature in all its details, thereby providing clues to motives. I learn a lot from her books!"},{"Title":"Partners in Crime","review":"No one does it better than Tommy and Tuppence. Amateur sleuths in their own way, they were not to be underestimated because both have their own ways to solve crimes, and even more interesting banters in between crime-solving.

These charactes are a bored couple who desire to give up the doldrums of normal life to go fight crime. The husband is a bit of a straight man and the wife is a witty hellcat. They often attempt to solve crimes using the M.O. (method of opperation) of famous litereary detectives...with varrying degrees of sucess... However, even when they dont solve the crime its still a delightful romp...this book is set up into about 17 short stories...each one a new adventure that will leave you satisfied...Well Done Ms. Christie."},{"Title":"Rotary Cutting and Speed Piecing (Rodale's Successful Quilting Library)","review":"I purchased this book when I first took up quilting over a year ago. I feel that it really INTRODUCED well all of the new ways that quilters are making quilts faster and easier. I never thought of returning it, and I'm surprised with the previous reviewer's comments. While there are a few unhelpful hints -like alternating pieced blocks with whole squares for a faster quilt top(duh!), I am not at all disappointed with the lack of patterns as I prefer to design my own. Don't we get enough of those from the plethora of magazines we quilters hoard? Patterns often take up space in a book that I would prefer be used to instruct more on technique, color choices, or quilter's diary for inspiration. Perhaps that's just a matter of personal choice. I own several Rodale books that I am always pleased with.PROS:chapters on Accuracy Guaranteed,Rotary Cutting Unusual Shapes,Building Strip Piecing Skills (only interesting for a beginner, like piecing different strips of fabrics together and cutting out shapes from there),designing blocks with Triangle Squares,Double Stitches Triangle Squares - an interesting way of stitching strips on both ends, then cutting out triangle squares and you're done,Fun with Half Rectangles (I liked learning about the idea of tipping your blocks on an angle, then filling with half rectangles),Foundation Piecing (tips for designing your own and combining it with applique, curved piecing,Strip-Pieced yardage,Clues for Cutting and Piecing - encouraging you to disect the quilts you admire and showing you how to copy themUNHELPFUL, FILLER CHAPTERS:streamline your workspace,speedy scrappy nine patch - obvious and boring,fast faux mini quilts,speedy big quilts - that's the one with the suggestion to add empty blocks,the buddy system - obiously two people work faster than one, if you can find one!BOTTOM LINE: BEGINNERS,WELCOME TO THE WONDERFUL NEW WORLD OF MUCH EASIER QUILTING!"},{"Title":"Rotary Cutting and Speed Piecing (Rodale's Successful Quilting Library)","review":"The one-star reviewer obviously didn't read the description - this is NOT a pattern book!

It's a very clear, picture-filled with accurate descriptions of different techniques that are used across a huge variety of blocks. This book in particular introduces the beginner quilt to strip-piecing and techniques to make point-matching during block construction easier and more precise. An intermediate quilter may pick up a new technique or two; an advanced quilter has little to gain from this book. I highly recommend it to beginners, though, as the techniques covered are invaluable to a lifetime of quilting."},{"Title":"Rotary Cutting and Speed Piecing (Rodale's Successful Quilting Library)","review":"If you want to make the quilt on the front cover, don't buy this book.

Together with an Accurate Statement of the Most Remarkable Transactions and Events Recorded in Ecclesiastical History\\" by Rev. Charles Buck, with a forward by Rev. George Bush. Originally published 1802, numerous reprints; may have been reprinted in more than one volume. (From a seller's review of the 1831 ed.): \\"Despite a stated reliance on the plain meaning of the Bible and the dictates of common sense, antebellum evangelicals required methods to create international consensus in a trans-denominational movement. Buck's Theological Dictionary, first published in London in 1802, sought to provide a textual basis for the evangelical community. By combining brief essays on orthodox belief and practice with historical entries on various denominations, Buck provided an interpretive lens that allowed antebellum Protestants to see Christianity's almost two millennia as their own history. American evangelicals rapidly seized on Buck's dictionary, ceding to it an almost canonical status as the textual interpreter of what it meant to be evangelical. Unfortunately Buck's Dictionary, as well as evangelicalism, amplified aspects of Enlightenment ideas about objectivity and history. Such notions validated the very concept of an evangelical dictionary and the tenets of reasonable Christianity. Ultimately, though, the Dictionary contained its own downfall. Unorthodox groups like the Universalists used Buck's Theological Dictionary to launch a theological assault on evangelicalism. By codifying former heresies and modern sects, Buck's Dictionary provided a potential voice to those sects, while by validating evangelical consensus it made the consensus itself vulnerable. Aside from that, Buck's Theological Dictionary still contains some interesting material, especially when it comes to Religious Sects. Some of the more obscure ones that you will find in this book include: Beareans, Brownists, Cereinthians, Circoncelliones, Dunkers, Hopkinsians, Illuminati, Joachimites, Libertines, Manicheans, Marcionites, Materialists, Monophysites, Moravians, Muggletonians (no, I did not make that one up, and it has nothing to do with Harry Potter), Novations, Origenists, Pelagians, Petrobrussians, Philadelphian Society, Photinians, Picards, Pricillianists, Rellyanists, Sandemanians, Serpentinians, Socinians, Supralapsarians, Swedenborgians, Theophilanthropists, Valentinians, Waldenses, Waterladians and others. There is also some good content on Quakers, Shakers, Universalists and others as well. As for the various Protestant denominations, Judiasm, Catholicism, Islam (Mahometanism), etc. there is plenty on that as well.\\""},{"Title":"A theological dictionary, containing definitions of all religious terms: A comprehensive view of every article in the system of divinity: an impartial ... events, recorded in ecclesiastical history","review":"I have a copy I got 30-some years ago, and I have read it through. It contains clear summaries of a vast array of Christian and non-Christian subjects. Don't know if it is worth $450; that would have to be judged by rare book fans. Pretty much all of its content can be found somewhere else, but not all in one book. It is worth reading just for the article on Supralapsarianism and another article containing a hilarious account of church dedication gone out of control. The tone of the articles is generally unbiased, with an occasional scold at what the editor considered way out of bounds. This book is a supreme example of the clean and rigorous nature of American Protestant thought in the 19th Century. Read this - your religion will never be the same when you are done."},{"Title":"The Illustrated History of Canada: A Canadian Classic, Now Completely Revised","review":"This is an excellent history of a fascinating country. The editor, Craig Brown, uses different chapter authors to bring a variety of perspectives to Canadian history while still editing the chapters into a cohesive whole with a consistent voice and detailed internal references. The ability to turn these diverse perspectives into a sensible history is a significant achievement, and this book deserves its status as a classic.In part, the need for cohesion does limit the ability to pull in some perspectives -- there is not a detailed analysis by an economic historian, for example, or an analysis of some particular component of history by someone from a clear Marxist tradition. Similarly, there are criticisms that can be leveled against each chapter for its breadth, depth or perspective, as with any history. But, for the intelligent reader, these short falls can produce fodder for further thought, and help build a framework for that thought.Best of all, this history has enough analysis and detail to satisfy an academic reader while being accessible enough for the casual reader - making it, in many ways, an ideal survey. While ultimately I would like a bit more detail in the footnotes and a bit of additional higher level analysis, there is far more in this book than you'll find in most historical surveys."},{"Title":"The Illustrated History of Canada: A Canadian Classic, Now Completely Revised","review":"I have family roots from the 17th Century in Quebec and from the 19th Century in Ontario.

Using the index, I can easily skip around and read the pages relevant to my genealogy.

Even what they were wearing, from the illustrations. Yes, lots of illustrations. I appreciate the effort gone to to provide such classic ones of people, places, maps, and events.

As a rather shy girl who inherits a great deal of money at a young age, Lydia is surrounded by young men anxious to please. But instead of settling on just one, Lydia soon finds that she can enjoy two or three young men buzzing around her as long as she likes. She plays them against each other and allows each one to think that only he has won her heart. But all the while, her own lifestyle is growing ever more reckless and self destructive.The sex scenes in this book are very steamy. Deep down Lydia is the type of girl who really just can't get enough. But she's also very good at pretending to be cold and haughty when dealing with her gentleman friends. When dealing with the well to do lads who offer marriage, she can be quite stiff, yet the secret flings she has with local working lads are very sexy and raw.The narrator of this book is honest and true. He is the only young man in the village who sees Lydia for what she is. The sad thing is, he can't help loving her. But finally he walks away. When that happens, Lydia becomes truly heartbroken. There are more parties, and more wild affairs, and of course there is more drinking. Lydia smokes and drinks and is the very picture of the glamorous young, always having fun and being quite scandalous.Yet all the time, there is a hollowness in her life she can't understand. The last chapters of the book show Lydia really reaching a decision to reach out honestly to the man she loves. Of course you don't see that right away. At first she just feels blue without knowing why. It's so touching the way she has one jazz record that reminds her of that honest young love, and she plays that record only when alone in her room. You see her lying around after a late night, resting in her room and listening to the music, and thinking. Is this all she wants from life? Gradually she drops off to sleep on the bed, and the faces of all the young men she's kissed come back to her. But when she falls asleep she pictures herself with that special young man, not dancing to hot jazz or making out in a car, but the time he taught her how to ice skate on the frozen river.Lydia knows what she has to do. But does she succeed? LOVE FOR LYDIA is a sexy book with some really romantic moments."},{"Title":"Love for Lydia (An Atlantic Monthly Press Book)","review":"This book is so exquisite. I've never read a book where the landscape and seasons were so vital. Bates' descriptions are poetic and beautiful. For this reason this is one of my top 10 favorite novels of all time. It transports the reader to rural England in the 1920s."},{"Title":"Love for Lydia (An Atlantic Monthly Press Book)","review":"To celebrate my 150th review for this site, I thought I would turn to another of my favourite books. Like a number of British authors writing in the early twentieth century, H. E. Bates was greatly influenced by the work of Thomas Hardy. He shared with Hardy not only a deep love of nature and of the English countryside, but also a talent for vivid verbal descriptions of that countryside. There are also thematic links between the two writers. Bates's \\"The Feast of July\\" has a similar plot to that of Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\", and \\"Love for Lydia\\" makes employs two plot devices much used by Hardy, love between people of different social classes and two or more men in love with the same woman.All of Hardy's novels are set in the South-West of England (or \\"Wessex\\" as he called it), especially his native Dorset. Bates too concentrated on certain regions of the country as the setting for his novels, typically Northamptonshire, the county where he grew up, and Kent, the country to which he moved in the 1930s. (Some of his wartime stories, such as \\"The Jacaranda Tree\\" and \\"Fair Stood the Wind for France\\" are set abroad).Like \\"The Feast of July\\" and \\"Charlotte's Row\\", \\"Love for Lydia\\", first published in 1952, is one of his Northamptonshire novels, set in the small industrial town of Evensford, possibly based upon his home town of Rushden, a town where the main industry is the manufacture of shoes and leather goods. The story takes place during the late 1920s and early 1930s and is narrated by the main character, Mr Richardson, a young apprentice journalist on the local newspaper. (We never learn his Christian name). The novel may be semi-autobiographical; Richardson is around the same age as the author would have been and, like him, works both as a reporter and as a warehouse clerk.The title character is Lydia Aspen, a girl from a once-wealthy but now impoverished aristocratic family who, after the death of her father, moves to Evensford to live with her elderly aunts and her eccentric uncle. Richardson first meets her when he is sent to their house (a crumbling mansion isolated from the rest of the town behind a high stone wall) to get a story about her father's death. Lydia, a seemingly shy girl, has led a sheltered existence, and her meeting with Richardson allows him to introduce her to the pleasures of ordinary life; for instance, he takes her skating on the frozen rivers, a popular local pastime during cold winters.Lydia and Richardson fall in love, but he realises that he is not her only admirer. She has at least three others- Alex Sanderson, the son of a local businessman, Tom Holland, a young farmer, and Bert \\"Blackie\\" Johnson, a car mechanic. Richardson realises that Lydia is not the shy, innocent girl for which he initially took her but can be wilful and fun-loving, and that she greatly enjoys the attentions of so many young men. His position is made more difficult by the fact that Alex and Tom are both close friends of his, and of each other. The Hardy novel with which \\"Love for Lydia\\" has the closest affinity is perhaps \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" with which it shares a serene ending following earlier tragedy. The impetuous Lydia has something in common with Bathsheba Everdene, and Tom recalls Gabriel Oak in his temperament as well as his profession.\\"Love for Lydia\\" is one of Bates's best novels. As I mentioned earlier, the author had a great talent for conveying the beauty of nature in words, and that talent is much in evidence here in his descriptions of rural scenes at all seasons of the year. Northamptonshire (and, indeed, the East Midlands in general) is not normally regarded as the most spectacular area of England, but Bates here shows that even relatively unspectacular landscapes can have a beauty of their own. Similar descriptive powers can be found in Bates's other writings, but this book also demonstrates qualities which are sometimes lacking in some of his other works.In some of his earlier novels, Bates's handling of his plots is not always satisfactory; an example is \\"Charlotte's Row\\" which, although it has some interesting themes, is let down by a weak ending, involving a clumsy shift of emphasis away from the main characters. \\"Love for Lydia\\", by contrast, is much more focused on its main storyline, that of Richardson and Lydia, and brings it to a satisfying resolution. The use of the first-person mode of narration adds a greater emotional power and immediacy to the work. Bates is able to make us empathise deeply with his hero as he experiences both the joys and the sorrows of young love and of friendship, as well as the pain of the tragedies which affect him and those close to him. This is one of the finest love-stories in twentieth-century English literature."},{"Title":"Love for Lydia (An Atlantic Monthly Press Book)","review":"Donna Lewis' song I love You Always Forever was inspired by this book. It is the best song!!!! The book is very good....I just want to say you should read this!!!!!1"},{"Title":"PROFESSOR KEITH SIMPSON , AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF MURDER.","review":"As British Home Office Pathologist, Professor Keith Simpson spent forty years in the investigation of both famous and obscure murders. The violent death of King Ananda of Siam was one of his most famous cases. At the opposite end of the notoriety scale was an incident involving the murder of a Shoreditch girl whose sister flung a bread knife at her. As a pathologist, Simpson saw it all and wrote about it in clear, robust prose that does not spare his reader the gruesome details.The introductory chapter to \\"Forty Years of Murder\\" is \\"Why choose Pathology?\\"Professor Simpson goes on to answer his own question with a great deal of relish, even quoting John Wesley: /Ah, lovely appearance of Death, /What sight upon earth is so fair? /Not all the gay pageants that breathe /Can with a dead body compare./If you can imagine the autobiography of Sherlock Holmes as ghost-written by Rabelais, you will acquire a good notion of Professor Simpson's style. However, the best way to get an impression of the man and his methods is to read \\"Forty Years of Murder.\\" (Skip the black-and-white photographs if you are squeamish.) Simpson concentrates on several interesting cases, but also gives his reader a fascinating overview of homicide investigations as practiced in Great Britain (with a few side trips to Thailand, Portugal, Canada, and the Caribbean) from the late 1920s through the 1960s.In Chapter 19, \\"The Innocence of Dr. Bodkin Adams\\" there is an eerie foreshadowing of the recent case of Dr. Harold Shipman, the most prolific serial killer in British criminal history. This Greater Manchester doctor was sentenced to life in prison for murdering fifteen of his middle aged and elderly women patients by lethal injection. The police believe he may have killed as many as 150 patients during his thirty-year career.Dr. Bodkin Adams in \\"Forty Years of Murder\\" proved to be innocent of killing his elderly patients, but Simpson says doctors are in a particularly good position to commit murder and escape detection. \\"Their patients, sometimes their own fading wives, more often mere ageing nuisances, are in their sole hands.\\" A sudden \\"grave turn for the worse\\" or even death is for them alone to interpret.One wonders whether the murderous Dr. Shipman would have escaped detection as long as he did, if Professor Simpson had still been the British Home Office Pathologist."},{"Title":"Faces of Infinity: Book 2 of THE GATES OF TIME (The Getes of Time , No 2)","review":"As in the first book, the author illustrates a theory of time travel by having the reader experience it. Since the theory was established in &quot;The Whispers&quot;, &quot;Faces of Infinity&quot; is free to add to it, which it does in an intriguing fashion. The pseudo-science remains internally consistent, so I'm willing to extend it poetic license to deviate from actual science.The overall plot is basic, it involves a villian and his henchmen versus various heros, attempted heros, people who think they're heros, well-meaning folk who tried their best, and people who have no idea what's going on. The author continues to have fun with the possibilities of time travel and absurd incidents with a wayward tractor-trailer.The characters, weak and 2-dimensional in the first book, have slipped further. They're not believeable as individuals or even as named reference points. There's a catastrophe elsewhere in the world (in the present); no casualties are mentioned but I have to assume millions or billions are dead. The narrative mentions the event in passing, the characters seem not to notice it. Inconceivable!"},{"Title":"THE DIARY OF TRILBY FROST","review":"I read this book years ago first, and it always stayed with me. It's wonderful. I STILL love it and now I'm in my thirties. It will make you very happy at times and it will make you cry buckets of tears too...and it's worth the tears. Most of the time, I can't abide things, books or movies, that make me cry...I hate sentimental nonsense that's obviously engineered to tug at my heartstrings. However, this book feels so authentic, even this old cynic can't help but love it still. I hope you will too."},{"Title":"THE DIARY OF TRILBY FROST","review":"I read this book in seventh grade and loved it! Trilby is a wonderfully endearing character.

I love romantic suspense and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! It was an excellent, steamy and action packed story! I bought &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; as soon as it was released and read it in one day. Cherry, your books just keep getting better! I am now waiting &lt;not patiently ;&gt; for your next book."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"The fast-paced story of Delanie Eastman and Kyle Wright is entertainment at its best. The pathos of their history emerge amid the blazing action and torrid sex woven through a well-crafted story. Thanks, Ms. Adair! Looking forward to the next Wright Brothers' story."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Back away and do not pick up this book...and I can't emphasize this enough...do not pick up this book if you have anything pressing to do. This most recent novel of Cherry Adair's should come with a warning lable because once you have it in hand and start reading you can forget about getting anything else done until you have read through to the last page.The opening sentence sits the stage for the red hot, explosive relationship between sedate Delanie Eastman and sensual Kyle. They are surprised to meet up with each other 4 years after a very brief breathless sensational episode that left each misunderstanding the intentions of the other. The firey attraction they were broadsided by initially is still in place, but this time, if unleashed, it could cost them their lives.There's nothing this book doesn't have. The author has somehow taken every emotion known to man and meshed with a riveting plot, dynamic adventures and dramatic conclusion yet doesn't leave you feeling the whole package was 'overkill'. A lot of readers are going to be chomping on their bookshelves waiting for Ms. Adair's next book to hit the stands. I'll be one of the first in line."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"...I'm sorry to say. The characters were pretty good, but the plot was barely passable. It would take a healthy dose of suspended disbelief to buy this one. For one thing, the idea of the intrepid heroine being hired as a &quot;companion&quot; to a homosexual man is quite a stretch to avoid the romance novel taboo of having one of the characters sleeping with someone else during the novel. She is a virgin four years before when she picks up a stranger in a bar, then, after three days, she remains loyal to him for four years, even when posing as a &quot;kept woman&quot;? Come on. It's ludicrous, to say the very least.There are all the curve balls thrown in towards the middle or end of the book. Delanie's pregnancy and miscarriage, for instance. It didn't add anything to the characters, it wasn't necessary to drive the plot, so why is it even in there? More words, perhaps?Then there are all the minor characters, who, with the exception of the villain, are cardboard. They appear and disappear at a whim, friend and foe both. An otherwise weak book can be saved by secondary characters, but these are flimsey and apparently expendable.The only reson this got any stars is that it was a fairly entertaining story. Still, I'd buy it used or skip it all together."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Wow! I really enjoyed this book. This is the second book I've read from this author. The first was \\"Kiss and Tell\\" which is tied into this book. Both books are filled with action, passion and humor. The characters are so well written you can actually picture them. The secondary characters bring the whole thing together smoothly. Even the evil people made this book worth every penny of it.This is the story of Delanie and Kyle. Kyle was briefly heard from in the first book. He is the brother to the heroine in that book. In this book he is undercover as an assassian and working with a mad man who wants to sell bio-chemicals to the highest bidder. While on assignment he runs into Delanie. He and Delanie have a past and its soon apparent that they didn't finish everything 4 years ago. Delanie is pretending to be a spoiled girlfriend of the mad man while she searches for her lost sister. Kyle and Delanie are thrown together and soon they have to give into their passions. They must work to gether to save the world and find her sister.This was an exciting tale that kept me glued to the pages. I couldn't wait until I found out how it all would end up. I hope Cherry Adair continues the series and soon."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Ms. Adair has it all in her books \\"Kiss and Tell\\" and \\"Hide and Seek\\". Her books are extremely well-written with strong characters and steamy sex scenes. Alpha males run loose these two books and it provides a great basis for a good read.In \\"Hide and Seek\\", a T-FLAC member and a kindergarden teacher are thrown together..both working undercover for different reasons. Four years ago, as virtual strangers, they had a 72 hour affair that left her emotionally scarred and him with wonderful dreams. They meet each other by accident at the house of an internationally wanted man and the lust/love is rekindled.These books have the perfect blend of violence and sensuality."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Loved Kiss and Tell, and this was just as good. Cannot wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Cherry Adair is the author of the year! I couldn't put down her first book KISS AND TELL and I only received her second book HIDE AND SEEK yesterday. I finished it this morning and all I can say is...when is the next one! Delanie and Kyle are wonderful characters that clicked 4 years prior in a 3 day sex romp. Now they meet again but on different turfs. The plot...well you don't really notice the plot with all the excitment going on. I would have prefered that they both give into each other and not Delanie begging Kyle but hey, it was still great. I just hope she has a story for all of Marnie's brothers."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"You're in for a heck of a ride with Hide and Seek, the newest book from Cherry Adair! Cherry just keeps getting better and better, and this book sizzles with fun, excitement and sexual tension.Kyle is a hero among men, a man capable of taking care of himself and everyone else around him. Delanie is spunky, fun and determined, and the fireworks between the two kept me turning the pages, long past lights-out! This is a don't-miss book!"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Kyle and Delanie have been playing games since the day they meet four years earlier at a bar. Neither of them expected to see each other ever again, and especially not in some remote Latin American jungle at the home of a notorious despot.From the very beginning of the story, Cherry Adair sets the tone for the ripe, gritty story of her edgy heroine and even edgier hero. And she delivers! Kyle and Delanie take one step forward and two steps back as they seek to achieve their individual goals while fighting an intense attraction. The sex is as hot as the jungle heat and the plot is as intricate as the jungle foliage. The dialogue is sharp and witty and every word choice conveys the mood. Nothing about this story is a let down. It delivers a walloping punch then drags the breathless reader on a riveting journey to Kyle and Delanie's equivalent of happily ever after."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Another great read by Cherry Adair. This book is the second of a growing series. \\"Kiss and tell' wa the first and there is a third one 'in too deep' which is soon to be published.The story is about Delanie, a responsible kinder garten teacher who is searching for her missing sister in a remote mountain in south America. Her sister was last seen in the company of a drug lord- Romero and Delanie's plan was to act the bimbo, and go to where Romero lived and search for her sister. There Delanie meets Kyle Wright with whom she had a one night stand 4 years before. Both are shocked to find each other in that place.Kyle is in the middle of a secret mission and he is not at all pleased ot find Delanie involved in it. HE knows that Romero is a sadistic, and viloent man and he is worried for what might happen to Delanie if Romero gets to know her real reasons for being with him. However Delanie is too set on finding her sister and saving her to even think of leaving.Both Kyle and Delanie will have to fight and struggle for their lives in this incredibly fast-paced book and fight their attraction to each other. This book is not a gentle romance and certainly not for the weak hearted - but if you want action ,passion, a romance that never falls into a boring spot then this is the book for you. I never wanted it to end. Its like watching a movie no...its much better!YEs maybe the story line is a little far fetched but thats the beauty of books - they take you to an enjoyable ride and make you dream. Ms Adiar makes it sound as if everything can become possible and you will not find it far fetched as you read it."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"This book was different from her previous one (Kiss and Tell), but great nonetheless. It was refreshing to read a subsequent book by the same author and not be able to predict the next page. In this book we meet \\"Doc\\" Kyle (brother of Marnie from Kiss and Tell) and Delanie a kindergarten teacher. She has gone \\"undercover\\" as the girlfriend of a drug lord/terrorist to find her missing sister. Kyle is a brilliant doctor working undercover for an anti-terrorist group to stop the distribution of viruses for chemical warfare. Kyle and Delanie met previously and after a one night interlude part ways (to their mutual disappointment) and unexpectely meet on the drug lord's island. Kyle and Delanie must maintain their cover to stay alive while dealing with their anger and attraction for each other. This is a fast paced, action/adventure romance which is chock full of great sex scenes, witty and funny dialogue and lots of surprises. A must read - you won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Having loved &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot;, I couldn't wait for &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;. Unfortunately, the book does not live up the the promise of the first.I think the reason is that the main characters are pretty rude to each other from the very beginning. Neither one exhibits any softness that draws the reader in, unlike &quot;K&amp;T&quot; where although Jake was a bit of a hard***, Marnie was adorable and sweet. Kyle and Delanie are fairly hateful and mean to each other, putting up huge barriers between them. These barriers also prevent the reader from really caring about them.There are also some huge leaps of logic and pacing that sometimes makes the dialogue a bit hard to follow.I also have a bit of a problem with the fact that they spent three days together four years ago, but Kyle kept the memory of those few days with him, in his words they kept him &quot;alive&quot;. As if. There's no evidence that they have any deep feelings towards each other, other than perpetual sexual heat. There are a few mentions of a special &quot;connection&quot; between them that goes beyond sex, but I never saw it.The sideline of Delanie's pregnancy does nothing for the story and makes me wonder whether the characters in this author's books EVER use protection.Cherry Adair demonstrated enormous talent in her first book, but this one is a bit of a dud."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"The jungle was hot, the hero was hot, the heroine was hot, the sex was hot, the premise was not. I realize romance is fiction but must be a bit pausible. If our hero, Kyle, can stay away from a one weekend stand for 4 years why can't he, with numerous lives on the line, keep his zipper up for 5 days? Delanie was suppose to be the brains of her family, a scary thought. Why did she do everything possible to foil a mission, risking a lot of lives to do absolutely nothing of value? She hated playing the bimbo yet she did so without any prompting. I bought this book right after reading Kiss and Tell. What a disappointment, whereas in K&T the hero and heroine are both competent in H&S this is not the case. I'm still looking forward to ST John's book but I hope his heroine shows more common sense and likeability."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I rated Ms. Adair's first book, Kiss and Tell four stars, her second effort here rates only three. I will give her top marks for hot sex scenes, she writes them steamy and wild. However it would have been nice if their motivations had been more believeable. It was a real stretch of imagination to have Kyle and Delanie doing all that they did and frankly, Delanie was quite annoying most of the time. This wasn't a bad effort but a bit of a disappointment after Ms. Adairs first book. Most of the humor that marked the first effort was missing here as well."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"This newest by Cherry Adair, Hide and Seek, was absolutely riveting. I very seldom am interested in writing reviews, but I do read approximately 20+ books per week. I can tell you that this one kept me up 'til 3:00 a.m. and I wouldn't put it down. I fully understand the character, Delanie, because I am a lot like her. And I found her counterpart, Kyle, to be the man to die for. The tension is high, including sensual. But then, lately, I have been really focused on Special Forces romances. I have a brother-in-law Navy Seal, and a son on homeland defense - and they have a sweetness towards women that is extraordinary these days. I have read of disillusionment with guys in the military, but that sure hasn't been my experience. Keep writing them, Cherry and Suzanne Brockman, and I'll keep buying them!"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"After her stunning debut KISS AND TELL, Cherry Adair packs an invigiorating tale HIDE AND SEEK to her credit as her latest offering. Deep in South America, Delanie Eastman braves high and low to locate her missing sister Lauren who was previously linked to the virulent drug-lord Ramon Montero. Assuming her dumb blonde persona, she enters the lion's den as Montero's interest. Little did she expect her plans to explode when Dr. Kyle Wright, her one-night stand years ago to appear as Montero's assassin. He has a secret agenda - to save the world from Montero's destructive plans in bioterrorism. Together Delanie and Kyle are gripped by treachery, propelled into present danger and even a frigid and emotional passion....What action and high-flying passion! HIDE AND SEEK blends seamlessly propulsive drama and rollicking adventures as they survived through anacondas, piranhas, bugging devices and even the evil Isabella, a prostitution ringleader. Delanie is endearingly vulnerable yet a suitable candidate as Charlie's Angel with her ballet kicks. Kyle is a sexy and strong hero, fierce in his passion. Their chemistry is a exploding effervescence, especially in the sex department. HIDE AND SEEK is blazingly sensual and explicit.In all its cloak of fast wits and cynical humour, HIDE and SEEK no doubt loses its predecessor's warmth and tenderness. Yet it reigns as this year's best contemporary romance so far. The heart-stopping action and steamy sex is enough to justify Ms. Adair's uncompromising talents in scripting a good read."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Well, ALMOST unspeakably. When I finished I had to just sit there for a second and take in the entirety of my bad judgement. Okay, so this ... sounded similar to Linda Howard and so I got excited enough to buy it.As I was reading through this I found a ton of things that I disagreed with, didn't (as a fairly intellegent woman) understand and things that I just disliked. I wanted to pick up a pen and list them all but I still wanted the use of my wrist later on in life. Ms. Adair seems to be aiming at a cross between Linda Howard's basic prototype of hero and heroine and Elizabeth Lowell's Donavon series except not as subtly and skillfully. If you're a person who gets annoyed at a hero and heroine who are just to damn perfect, leave this one be. The hero was not only involved in the military but he was also a prodigy in more than one medical field. He also had no scars, neither physically, mentally or emotionally and had the patient of a saint when the heroine did some of the stupidest things that I've ever read about--and believe me--there were some really stupid things in there. The reason that you get annoyed with her so called perfection is because her stupidity is chalked up to loyalty, and her strong personality is just stubbornness and overall ridiculous.Here are some things I remember:-It takes money to fly all the way to Brazil and an enormous amount of resources--thousands of dollars (U.S.) So how did the heroine get there again?-There was never any explanation of why the hero continuously called the heroine \\"jungle girl\\" unless I was too busy berating myself mentally for still reading this and it flew over my head. I mean, no 'graceful movement of her walk' or 'cat-like eyes', no reason AT ALL.-There just weren't enough details on the villain. Whatever detail there was is too general. Why would an international terrorist be tried in MAIMI and not by the world court? At least say that was where he'd blown up a naval base or something, (just for the sake of making the fiction more believable).-Also, the arrival of the hero's brother-in-law who had just had a baby daughter. Why would a man who had just had a child leave to help a perfectly competent grown man?Yet another question is why a kindengarten teacher would fly to Las Vegas and pose as a casino showgirl and cozy up to her missing sister's last flame who is purposedly gay so that she could get close enough to him to find out where, oh where, he'd stashed her sister. The answer must be that Ms. Adair was looking for the most implausible plot she could ever hope to concieve.In conclusion, if I ever hear the expression \\"rat's patoot\\" again--which the heroine seems to use on a sickeningly regular basis--I'll go insane. I found it extremely irritating that I can't remember the heroine once cursing while I can remember the hero doing just that. Overall, the book's plot had just way too much and was too overdone.I'm sorry but, I can't apologize for my standards or my geniuine displeasure when the book was done.In truce I'll offer the one thing that I DID like. When the hero's cheering the heroine on at that fight in the end and he shouts: \\"Damn it, stopping hitting like a GIRL. Hit HARDER!\\" LOL. It's going down in my Annals of Greatest Contemporary Romance Quotes. That's what the second star's for."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I liked Cherry Adair's last book - Kiss and Tell - and had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I found the story contrived, the suspense forumlaic, and the sex just distasteful. Yeah, let's consummate the relationship while she's on serious drugs about 100 times. Great.This heroine had no rational basis for her choices. With hundreds of guards around and a psycho for a host, with the assurance that no other woman is there from the psycho's mother, the intelligent heroine would have left - not had sleazy sex. And the hero was just plain ineffectual.I do not recommend this book. Yuck."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"After having read Cherry Adair's Kiss and Tell, I was eager to read another one of her T-FLAC books. I admit the synopsis gave me pause, but I thought, nah, I'm sure it will be a good book. Always trust your first impression! This wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, it was worse!Hide and Seek was completely far fetched, ridiculous and full of over the top shenanigans all crammed into one book. Our heroine Delanie was the type of heroine that makes you want to scream! Her determination to save her sister was overdone and her devotion to her family was eye rolling. She's the only one who can save the day and so she must hang around the dangerous piranha infested, anaconda laden estate of a psychopath drug dealer hellbent on world domination who plans to release a dangerous bio-weapon. Does any of this deter our fearless heroine? No. She doesn't care, because she's only here to save her sister. Never mind the fact she doesn't know where to look or if her sister is still on the estate, never mind the fact that if the world dies, her precious sister dies too, never mind the fact her sister is a big girl who made her bed, never mind the fact she's in way over her head. Nope, she's not budging. Besides, it's not so scary. The guards on the estate know she's the pretend sex toy of the super scary psychopath so they leave her alone to wander about the estate poking into all the nooks and crannies. Also, she's under disguise as an easy tart complete with pink flamingo earrings so no one will put two and two together and think she's up to something nefarious. Until Dr. Kyle Wright shows up and is stunned to see her. Apparently these two had a wild and crazy sex fest four years ago and neither one has forgotten it. Kyle has been working undercover since he left Delanie and when he sees the innocent blonde calmly sitting next to one of the most dangerous men in the world, he's adamant she leave immediately. Not without my sister, she says!Dr. Kyle Wright has been working undercover for so long that he has nearly forgotten who he is. Delanie represents all the goodness that he is fighting for so he's understandably frantic to protect her without arousing the suspicions of anyone. Luckily for Delanie, Kyle is a super spy, super doctor, all around expert in all types of weaponry and transportation plus he's a hunk with a perfect physique and perfect hair. With his amazing CV her safety should be assured but of course our intrepid heroine knows better and blithely blazes her own trail. When he tells her to stay put, she wanders, when he tells her to meet him somewhere, she pops up at a different location, when he tells her to hide, she of course bumps into the bad guys and ruins four years of undercover work.He loves this girl?! I would have shot her and buried her out back. Or fed her useless corpse to the piranhas.There was just entirely too much going on in this book. I could have forgiven a few of Delanie's TSTL moments. A few of them. But she has so many that this book descends into a farcical mess. Kyle is also too much. His patience and understanding knows no bounds until the last part of the book. When Delanie and Kyle find her sister I was finally okay with her worry and protectiveness. Her sister was in pretty bad shape and of course I would choose to be with her, but Kyle suddenly draws a line in the sand and it's either now or never. Her sister or him. Huh? What happened to that endless understanding? This is the woman who busted up a four year long undercover sting operation and now your getting pissy because she wants to leave you a day early and meet up with you later on?Grrrrr.Don't bother with this book. You'll just hurt yourself. >:("},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Cherry Adair is my favorite author, after reading 'Kiss and Tell', I couldn't wait to read 'Hide and Seek'.

Alas, it did not make me want to continue once I began it, so I came back to it again and again, just because I had it.Pity, for such a good writer, who can write relationship so well, to do this book, where things seem factice, adventure pushed too far but not deep."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Book #2 in Adair's series about the Wright family, this one is even better than the 1st book (Kiss and Tell)! Take Kyle Wright, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases and put him undercover for an anti-terrorist government organization. Take Delanie, a Kindergarten teacher (who had a 1-night-stand with the \\"Doc\\" a while ago) and have her go undercover as the bad guy's girlfriend in her own private search for her sister. AND have the two meet pool-side with her nearly nude... Yes! The Sparks are sure to fly! This one sizzles with intrigue, action, and romance. A truly enjoyable page-turner. Like Ms. Brockman and her SEALS, Ms. Adair has me hooked and ready for IN TO DEEP! (Book #3)"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"The sequel to 'Kiss and Tell' was explosive as the first and filled with tension, romance and danger. The bad guys are truly bad and make you wince.I have to be honest here though, I don't know what it was, but I think I enjoyed the first one more, even though I LOVED Hide and Seek. This one was more the male lead going after the female lead, it was the opposite in Kiss and Tell. In this one, the female lead, Delanie Eastman is the 'loner' and 'the strong one'.After awhile I got tired of her always trying to be in charge and getting into trouble, which in turn causes the lead male, Kyle Wright to get tangled into very dangerous situations. But all in all, that was my only complaint.Delanie Eastman is posing as the very pampered and spoiled girlfriend of an international crime lord and terrorist. Forcing herself to not cringe or let her cover be blown, she suffers the rigors of the South American jungle and the crime lord's remote mountain top retreat. Her mission? To find her missing sister Lauren. The last person she expects to come walking into the retreat is the guy she had a very steamy and torrid affair with four years ago back in California!Kyle is deeply involved in his own mission that will save millions of lives, what he doesn't expect to come across at this crucial moment is the beautiful blonde bombshell he left behond in a hotel room in California four years ago!The unbelieveable attraction is still alive and well and begins to sizzle and burn hotter than the jungle around them as things heat up.Kyle has to get her out of there ASAP! But how? She is as stubborn as ever and needs to complete her own secret mission. He can't blow this...he has been working on this for too long to be distracted by one crazy woman getting into something she has no idea about! He will use any means nessasary to get her out, even seduction and callousness...he just doesn't expect his heart to get involved...again...Running for their lives and trying to keep their heads, they play a dangerous game with each other and the enemy...A sure keeper!!! This is the second book, the first is 'Kiss and Tell and the third is 'In Too Deep'.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Holy cow this book is hot! The first sentence is guaranteed to make your eyes pop and your mouth fall open. This one is much hotter than KISS AND TELL (also a five star book), and I really think I liked it better. More action, more steam - and not just from the jungle location! A little too close to home with our present terrorism problems but if we had a hand full of Kyles at our disposal, our country could rest easy. My one complaint is the cover. Where did they come up with that male model. It looks like he's been waxed and hasn't seen the sun EVER. Come on! There are so many male models out there who would have fit Kyle's description to perfection. Just goes to show, you can't judge a book by its cover. A KEEPER!!

I ended up reading this from 10pm lastnight until 10 am this morning when I finished it - I should have known once I started to read this book, that I would be in trouble since the same thing happened when I read Kiss and Tell.

I liked the hero and the love scenes just as much, too. Unfortunately, this book has a heroine that nearly ruined the story for me. She was alright in the beginning, but by the end her attitude was a big annoyance. No matter how much the hero did to help her, no matter how many times he saved her neck, she refused to show him the slightest respect or gratitude. \\"I don't need anyone\\" was repeated far too often. Worse, she knowingly did things that not only put his undercover case in jeopardy, she also knew she was risking his life and possibly thousands of others world wide. I couldn't just overlook that. The heroine brought this 5- star- worthy story down to a 4- star.Kyle Wright is the most brilliant, and the youngest, of the 4 Wright brothers. After graduating high school early, he attended medical school as a teen. When his vast intelligence attracted the attention of well- known terrorist Ramon Montero, T-FLAC approached Kyle with an offer of a job in undercover work. Montero wanted him to create viral weapons. T-FLAC hired him to accept the terrorist's offer undercover. For 4 years, Kyle has carefully laid out a case against Montero. Just days from wrapping the case and leading a T-FLAC raid on Montero's land, Kyle found an unwelcome surprise in Montero's home.Delanie Eastman recognized Kyle right away. 4 years ago, they had a weekend long fling. She never heard from him again. Now he has shown up at Montero's mansion. Shocked, Delanie can only assume that Kyle is a terrorist like Montero. Whomever he is, Delanie will not allow Kyle to get in her way of rescuing her sister from Montero's evil hands. She will stay and pretend to be Montero's guest until she can find Lauren and get her safely home.4 years of hard work are at stake. Kyle can't allow this mission to go up in smoke. Too many lives are depending upon Montero's demise. Hard as he tries, Kyle can't get rid of Delanie before the raid on Montero's property is unleashed. When Montero gives Delanie to Kyle as a \\"gift\\", Kyle uses it as his chance to keep Delanie under watch. Eventually, Kyle has no choice but to break his cover for Delanie so that she will trust him. He'll do all he can to keep her safe from Montero, and from her own stubbornness. Delanie's first concern is finding her sister. Whatever the cost she will not give up on saving Lauren.Kyle has never stopped thinking of that special weekend years ago. Now that he has found Delanie again, he looks forward to having time with her after Montero is stopped. When he openly admits to Delanie that he loves her, she turns him away. Delanie believes love is for fools. In the end, Kyle worries that he may have to give her up in hopes that she will realize what she has lost.The story kept me turning pages, \\"Delanie\\" kept me irritated. All in all, \\"Hide and Seek\\" is an exciting addition to the T-FLAC series.There are a couple of things in the series that make me think \\"Oh, brother...\\". For one, the heroines are usually everyday women with jobs such as Kindergarten teacher, computer programmer, shop clerk, etc..., but when evil men are shooting at them they suddenly become thrill- seekers. They are ecstatic about the possibility of being killed. They have \\"never felt so alive\\" as when they are in the middle of a full- scale terrorist war. After Delanie and Kyle run through a sea of bullets, her comment is \\"That was awesome!\\" Huh??? I know it is supposed to make the women seem brave, but to me it just makes them seem brainless.The other \\"Oh, brother\\" is the names Adair tends to choose for the women. In a word, \\"sappy\\". \\"Marnie\\", \\"Tally\\", \\"Delanie\\", etc... Oof!Those things vented, the series is addicting. Adair can write an action scene worthy of \\"Mission Impossible\\", and a love scene worthy of Rhett Butler's passionate kisses mixed with modern daring descriptiveness.Want to read the whole series?

They have all of the depth of a shallow pool and are completely unbelievable. We are supposed to take as gospel the demure ballet dancing school teacher turning croupier and femme fatale, sun bathing topless in the middle of a jungle with a dozen body guards and just happening to meet the guy she had a three-night stand with as she, a virgin, picked him up in a bar and locked herself in her hotel room with him for that long.Add to that fact that she would not be glad to see him since he is such a jerk, and you have all the makings of a really gross novel in which he treats her like an object on a continual basis. The ending is so ridiculous as to not even be credited as she decides she is going to fight the villain and the supposed hero just allows Delaine to be carved up with a knife. Give us a break. Entertainment is one thing, ... stupidity with no basis in reality and not the least bit of sensuality or romance is quite another."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"This book was so so. The plot was dragging and some of it not quite believable. But they wind up together and beat the bad guys. But there are so many people around all the time there is very little sex. So if you buy it do so for the detective story part."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"A kindergarten teacher and the glue that holds her family together, Delanie Eastman has hared off to the South American compound of the drug making, gun running, sadistic sociopath Montero after her baby sister went missing while in his company. Now she's neck deep in nasties and way out of her element, no clue how to even find her sister and naively...stupidly...sure she can handle the monster responsible for her disappearance.T-FLAC agent Dr. Kyle Wright has been working undercover with Montero for four years, and just as he's ready to spring the trap and bring in the massive multinational task force that will finally end him, he arrives at his compound and practically trips over the one woman who, four years ago, picked him up in a bar in San Francisco and etched herself indelibly on his mind and heart...then left him after giving him her virginity.As if four years of work that scarred his soul and sole responsibility for the operation that includes a world of different anti-terrorist groups isn't enough, now he's got the uncontrollable, intractable, and unbelievably stubborn Delanie to save, too. And she's just as determined to not be saved as he is to make sure she gets out alive.While I thoroughly enjoyedKiss and Tell, the first of the full length T-FLAC novels featuring the Wrights, I had an intensely difficult time getting through this one.It's written with Cherry Adair's typical aplomb, three dimensional and layered, with a steady narrative full of pleasant description and dialogue that seems organic to the characters and has a natural conversational flow. The action scenes are taut, gripping, and very clearly defined, and the sex scenes between Kyle and Delanie were smokin' hot. The bad guys are definitely bad and their crimes atrocious, and the coldly clinical way they engage in those crimes is horrifying. I totally sympathized with Kyle and supported his actions to put an end to them.And despite all of that, this book fell apart for me on two very basic points: the concept of the plot and the character of the female lead.I was, in the end, incapable of garnering, let alone maintaining, a willing suspension of disbelief in a book that suggests it's conceivable that a character such as Delanie Eastman, kindergarten teacher and just this side of naive virgin, would think for even the briefest nanosecond that going up against a man such as Montero on her own, with no back up, with no one knowing where she is, in a colossally idiotic attempt to free a sister it is illogical to assume is even alive, was feasible. Let alone actually do it.The entire premise for Delanie's presence at Montero's compound was ludicrous. And her actions while there, including her reactions to Kyle, were absurd and foolhardy beyond the extreme. Not to mention she was stubborn, stupid, and obscenely obtuse at every turn and with every layered plot thread. There was absolutely nothing to redeem her to me as a character.I'll be the first one to admit, Adair writes the hell out of this book. Her skill as an author is impressive and I respect her work. But the concept forHide and Seekwas just too grievously flawed and one of the two main characters completely irredeemable. No amount of excellent authorial skill could have saved this one for me.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"First of all let me say I am a huge Cherry Adair fan.

I didn't like this scenario. Both characters are strong and there should have been more of a mutual surrender.

Unfortunately (IMO) he's saddled with heroine Delanie Eastman, a kindergarten teacher who doesn't fair as well in her damsel in distress role. I had difficulty connecting with her and found her tiring more often that I should.For this outing, Delanie is secretly on the trail of her missing sister and ends up in the Mexican rainforest; as fate would have it, Kyle who has secrets of his own ends up in the same jungle makes it his mission to protect and rescue Delanie. Well of course that is too smooth so they each are plagued by scorching memories of a semi-anonymous passionate weekend they shared 4years ago that leaves them wistful for what may have been.The sinister villain and requisite minions were multi-dimensional caricatures that were very interesting and kept the drama and suspense quotients high as the star couple was perpetually on edge in taking their next steps. Also interaction with other T-FLAC characters helped with the continuity for the series and kept them tied together while being independent stories, this could be a turning point for the series. At this point I still don't think you would need to read the books in order to enjoy the series.

Also enjoyed the plot and how it took Kyle and Delainie to new heights of love and trust. Enjoyed the sex scenes as well.

I really enjoyed the story and have been eagerly awaiting the next book from her, HIDE AND SEEK.It is about Kyle Wright (the brother of the heroine from K&amp;T) and Delanie Eastman. They were lovers several years ago and had not seen one another since then. They meet up in a secluded fortress owned by a suspected drug lord. Delanie is pretending to be the lover of the drug lord. Kyle doesn't know whether to trust her or not. She doesn't trust him either and so does not tell him the real reason she is there.Kyle and Delanie strike sexual sparks together immediately in the story and like KISS AND TELL, it has lots of action. There were times I got a little squeamish, but it was not gory. Just a suspenseful story that you don't know where it will go next. The love scenes are plentiful, and hot, especially the one in the bedroom after Delanie drinks spiked wine.I will admit I preferred KISS AND TELL more, but putting comparisons aside, I admit this is just as good and deserves my 5-star rating. I am looking forward to the next installment about the Wright family.

Like in the first book, this one features a very likeable and extremely sexy male character, Dr. Kyle Wright. But the heroine is nothing but an annoying bimbo, who simply gets in the way and messes up the anti-bioterrorism mission. Being a female reader, I was hoping the Delanie character would pick up somehow, develop brains and show some common sense. She never did! Her only true asset was a great body and incredible, steamy sex. This book could've been written by any chauvinistic macho author out there.And speaking of sex.... c'mon! Kyle Wright is a highly trained anti terrorist agent, about to complete a mission that has taken 4 years of his life. Do we really want to believe he spends most of his time drooling over Delanie, rolling around and making love to her every three hours in the middle of the jungle, while being chased by the bad guys? Uh-uh... I don't want to think our US special forces boys would act like that. At least I hope not!"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"This book is super HOT and very fast paced romantic action adventure. This is the 2nd book from Ms. Cherry Adair that I have read. This is a spinoff from the &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; novel. Kyle Wright has been working undercover for 4 years for T-FLAC to help stop a terrorist/drug lord. Delanie Eastman, a kindergarten teacher, has gone &quot;undercover&quot; herself in hopes of finding her missing sister, Lauren.Kyle and Delanie have a history - a steamy one-night stand 4 years ago (before he was shipped off to start this current undercover job). Fate brings them back together under very tense and hostile circumstances. Their love and lust for each other is rekindled.Jake the Tin-Man resurfaces in this book (the character from Kiss and Tell). Plus its obvious the next book/series will cover Kyle's boss, Darius and Delanie's sister, Lauren.The book is very intense, very steamy and very good. I read the book in 24 hours. Its a keeper to be re-read again and again."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I am somewhat at a loss with Cherry Adair's action/romance books. On the one hand, they are extremely well-written, engrossing reads with strong characters and hot sex scenes (which is why I gave her 4 stars). On the other hand, after much thought, I feel they are just too violent -- at least for me (which is why I did not give her 5 stars). HAS has multiple scenes of violent death and torture, including scenes of torture of the heroine by the sadistic lesbian mother of the terrorist kingpin. The problem, for me, is that Adair is so adept at painting scenes with words that I felt like I was WATCHING a particularly violent action movie -- especially horrible when the terrorist Ramon executes a young boy and then feeds him to an anaconda. So, if you don't mind violent action movies and want a good read, this book would be an excellent choice for you -- as long as you don't read it right before going to bed! (Note to readers: Hide and Seek is much more violent than Kiss and Tell.)"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Take a ditzy, blond, bimbo who is the girlfriend of an international crime lord with a hidden agenda. Throw in an agent posing as an associate of the crime lord really to take him down after four years of carefully setting the stage. Throw in three passionate nights over four years ago that neither has forgotten and watch the sparks ignite. Delanie Eastman is a kindergarten teacher who assumes a persona of a sex kitten while searching for her sister. Kyle Wright is a man of many faces; doctor, scientist, agent, and commando all rolled into one. She'll stop at nothing to find her sister. He'll let nothing stand in his way of stopping an international incident. Nothing can stop either of them, that is until they find themselves face to face after four years. Throw in disreputable crime lords from around the world, the sadistic mother from hell, and you have an attention-grabbing read in store for yourself.This is my second book by Cherry Adair and I have to say I enjoyed it just as much as the first. Ms. Adair has the most fascinating characters. I love the way they interact with each other. The characters ooze sex appeal and the dialogue flies between them. The heroine, while clearly out of her natural element, displays a spunk that can match anyone. The hero is tough, sexy, tender, and smart. The plot? Well, the plot is pretty lame. But you know what? You won't notice it or care with all the suspense, excitement, and sex that flow throughout the book. When I buy a book by Ms. Adair, I know I am going to be entertained!"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Dr. Kyle Wright recognizes the breasts of Delanie Eastman, a woman he shared the best sex of his life with four years ago but has not seen since. Both are shocked because San Francisco is very distant from the isolated South American mountaintop above San Christobol where they renew their former acquaintance. However, they coincidentally meet at the fortress of drug cartel chief and terrorist Ramon Montero. Delanie claims to be a bimbo dancer, but in reality is a kindergarten teacher, searching for her missing sister last seen with Ramon in Vegas.Kyle needs to get Delanie off the mountain before the deadly confrontation between his side and Ramon occurs. Kyle has worked undercover for the anti-terrorist group T-FLAC for four years by pretending to be developing a small pox virus that will cause many deaths. His benefactor Ramon is about to unleash that virus on the world. Now Kyle finds himself falling in love with the one woman who could inadvertently destroy his and his cohorts plan to stop a potential pandemic conflagration.Cherry Adair follows up her RITA finalist, KISS AND TELL, with another strong romantic suspense novel. The story line is fast-paced and loaded with nonstop action that enhances the growing attraction between the lead couple. Though having two civilians, even if both are volunteers, in the war with Ramon seems stretched, readers will find HIDE AND SEEK a total joy, rooting for this couple to not only be victorious in battle, but in their relationship.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I really enjoyed Cherry Adair's first effort Kiss and Tell, mostly because of the flirty and genuine interplay of Jake and Marnie. I liked that Marnie knew what she wanted and was willing to gently seduce the loner hero with her saucy sense of humor and loyal caring. Even when the cloak-and-dagger stuff stretched credulity, it was the likability of the two main characters that had you rooting for them, and Adair showed a wonderful flair for writing engaging teasing byplay.Unfortunately, this doesn't translate so well into her second effort. Kyle and Delanie, the hero and heroine of Hide and Seek, are so hostile to each other for the first half of the book that you don't see what their attraction is, to each other or to the reader. So what that they had amazing sex 4 years before in what amounted to an anonymous one night stand? They didn't seem to learn anything about each other enough to like, and as the whole first half of the book they both impersonate bad guys, you wonder at their taste.Furthermore, the whole drug kingpin adventure backdrop tends to overwhelm in this one, to the point where I just kept thinking Delanie was too dumb and naive to deserve to live. The extreme contrast between the goodies and the baddies is laughable -- Delanie is a kindergarten teacher, practically virgin, who takes on the burden of caring for her whole entire extended family, willing to risk certain death to save her sister (she woulda made a good nun); Kyle is such a genius that he skipped 8 years of school so that he could attend keggers in med school (he would have been, what? 14); and the villain is so evil, he is the richest drug overlord/terrorist/arms dealer/random murderer in the world with an incest thing for his mom and he's -- gasp! -- gay, as well. I mean, come on! Even Delanie's sister coming out alive at the end seemed a little ridiculous. I'm willing to suspend disbelief, but honestly, it was all too groaningly awful.Now Kiss and Tell had some of these problems too, but because the romance was center stage, and Jake and Marnie so engaging, all the shootin' and fightin' were less of an issue. Here, unfortunately, Kyle and Delanie aren't very likable and there's no sense of them knowing enough about each other to build any sort of long-lasting relationship. It seems like the only attraction is sex, and that gets pretty boring after a while.Despite this criticism, Cherry Adair has talent and when she focuses on the romantic interplay between the two main characters, she shines. So even though this one's a miss, I will still look forward to seeing her coming efforts."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I'm a big Cherry Adair fan, loved the first one and couldn't wait for the others. This book was very enjoyable until the last few chapters. Apparently Kyle and Delanie met four years before the action in this book takes place, and he relieved her of her virginity without bothering to use protection (or at least to ascertain that the incident did not have consequences). He had to take off on a long mission, so it seems he had no intention of starting anything with Delanie, who became pregnant as a result of their first encounter, and then miscarried. Not unnaturally, this was pretty traumatic for her. So what does Kyle do at the end of this book? He makes Delanie come after HIM, because she needs to prove to him how much she really cares. Any man who just assumes that it's OK for him to walk away from a one-nighter, but the woman has other obiligations, is a 24-carat jerk. AND he NEVER apologizes to her for having gone through the miscarriage by herself! It's also unclear whether or not he's been with other women since, but I would suspect that he has. Double-standards are standard in romance fiction, but this one is over the top. She gives him her virginity, loses his baby, has slept with no one else in FOUR years, AND she's supposed to come to South America to get him at the end? When the hero proves himself to be such a putz, it kind of throws off the whole happy ending thing."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"If you're like me, and you love those action packed thrillers, who of course have hero's to die for, you'll love Cherry Adair. She's got a place on my keeper shelf right next to Linda Howard, she's that good! In Hide and Seek, Dr. Kyle Wright is on a covert mission of huge magnitude when he sees a...face from his past in the home of a huge drug lord. A face he's never been able to forget...And the adventure starts here! This is a not to be missed read if you're a fan of suspense--Ms. Adair keeps us on the edge, and although we know who the villain is, there is no lack of thrills and suspense. I can't wait for the next one!!"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Cherry Adair writes another thrilling story. We meet one of Marnie Wrights brother from Kiss and Tell. Kyle and Delanie have a hot and steamy time of it in the jungle. A must read."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"&quot;Hide and Seek&quot; by Cherry Adair may not be as good as her former &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; but you'll find this to be one sensuous book! Great storyline, hot love scenes, and, of course, a source of conflict for the Alpha male. I won't go into the subtleties, as that's already posted, but suffice it to say, a good read."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I'd read and heard a lot of good reviews about Cherry Adair, so when I had a chance to pick up a couple, I did. I spent a total of $1 at a thrift store and I regret even that. The plot was atrocious, the characters unlikable and the writing awkward. Ms. Adair referred to the heroine's 'hoo-hoo' in the middle of what was supposed to be a serious love scene. I mean, really, people. That's the word you tell your two-year-old daughter to use."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Adventure story featuring another of the Wright brothers (stands alone from the others of the series, but I think reader benefits from knowing of his brothers and sister). This time Kyle, the intelligent doctor turned spy, is about to see the culmination of 4 years work. His \`boss', international crime lord Montero, is about to go down. Montero has had Kyle working to manufacture the smallpox virus, which Montero plans to sell to the highest bidder. But Kyle isn't the one doing the manufacturing by chance.Co-incidentally, Delanie Eastman's sister has been kidnapped by Montero - or so Delanie (rightfully - although it's for his mother's project) believes. Even more co-incidentally, Delanie and Kyle had a brief but brutal fling directly before Kyle began working for Montero. Neither knows the other's agenda now that they meet again. Against this background of distrust and danger, each must try to achieve their own objective and attempt to put aside the strong attraction they have for the other. Oh yes, and get out of the compound alive.High action and drama abound here in the very nature of the rather fantastical plot. That Kyle is on one side super intelligent, and the other a dangerous mercenary type (in image terms - he's one of the good guys) makes for a very attractive if highly-unlikely-in-real-life hero. Hey, the plot doesn't shout \`real' to me either. And that's really not the point.Delanie is very likeable, and both characters have a determination to do their best for their family (Delanie) and country (Kyle). As the attraction between them leaps high once again, the erotic aspects of the story come to play in a suitably highly charged atmosphere. Phew! Quite a story."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I purchased this book based on a recommendation from a friend. I expected it to be a typical plotless trashy novel. I can honestly say that I've been quite pleasantly surprised! The main character Delanie Eastman is incredibly likable, and her love interest Kyle Wright creates a very special chemistry both in and out of bed. The love scenes are good, and to my surprise, so is the plot! The only complaint I have (which accounts for the four star rating rather than five) is that towards the middle of the book when the plot just starts to get really suspensful and intersting, the love scenes almost completely shadow the actual plot of the story. It almost takes away from the book itself giving it a parallell plot instead of a subplot.Overall I really did enjoy the book. I would definately recommend this book for a read, but be prepared to be patient, you'll be biting your nails waiting to find out what's going to happen next."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I simply loved this book. It had it all - mystery, suspense, romance - and it's HOT! Believe me, the heat is not just because it takes place in a tropical rain forest. The two main characters steam things up from the first page.I read a lot of contemporary writers, but I have to say that this is the best I've read in quite a long time. I just hope Ms. Adair is working on another book."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"My second Cherry Adair - and I'll be looking for more! Strong characters in Kyle &amp; Delanie made this book well worth the read. Cherry Adair seems to have the knack for drawing her readers into the characters' lives, and leaves you turning page after page just to see what happens next! Delanie poses as a silly 'bimbo' type, but doesn't fool Kyle, who knows this woman from an intimate encounter 4 years before. A few romps in the jungle lend a little spice and makes this book fun as well as an interesting read."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I couldn't put this book down! The characters of Delanie and Kyle had me hooked from the first sentence to the last. Delanie was a woman of the new millieum not allowing any to solve her problems was but in a haunting position posing as the &quot;blonde bimbo&quot; of the crazed sicko drug-dealer Montero to save her sister. Imagine her shock of finding the only man shared passion with as Montero's closest friend. Kyle, who was dangerous as well as sexy, had his socks knocked off by seeing Delanie again and right smack in the middle of his four year deep cover. The characters had everything together including a smoldering intense passion. Kyle was rough and tough when he needed to be yet gentle with the woman he had never forgotten. Delanie was powerfully stubborn yet her story and pain had me rooting for her all the way.Cherry Adair did a fantisic job and I can't wait to see what she has in store for Kyle's brothers. It was also nice to see &quot; The Tin Man &quot;--from her other story.The is is must read."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"This book was entertaining, for most of the time; however it was kind of confusing, and very hard to believe. The sex scenes are pretty good, if not a little random. I liked how the characters were linked to KISS AND TELL. Jake Dolan, as well as another character from KIISS AND TELL appear briefly in this book. I was very happy about that. Many of the other characters were mentioned, also. I think I would have liked this book a lot more if Kyle didn't have a long braid; that whole thing really put mr off, I had to block it out every time she mentioned the thing. i supose, it did have a purpose, symbolliclly. Well, I would recomend reading this book, just for the sex scenes, and for the relATion to KISS AND TELL."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"Another T-Flac adventure, this book is about \\"Kiss and Tell\\" Marnie's brother Kyle Wright and Delanie Eastman.

Ms. Adair obviously worked very hard on this title--the story is tight, the characters have human failings and their sexual chemistry translates effectively.

I loved the characters and I thought the plot was both exciting and hot!"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I gave this book 3 stars because it's not all bad. Some of the sex scenes are good, some are repeated too often. Some phrases are over-used. I'm not quoting here, but you'll get the idea. \`She had a huge lump in her throat, her heart was racing, his shoulders were broad and tanned, her body arched violently, she shivered despite the oppressive heat, she wanted more,...' These things were repeated over and over and got old.The bad guys were pretty decent in their roles. The plot was okay, but the situation was really close to ridiculous. Kyle Wright is a genius and an ass. Delanie is unbelievable and becomes irritating. The way she carries on is unrealistic. Dare, who is an interesting character, develops a deep dedication to Lauren, Delanie's little sister, on sight--which is odd and unlikely.I was disappointed in this book and at how silly the heroine behaved, and how unlikable the hero is.I guess I'll read the next book in line, however, and hope the next one is better than HIDE AND SEEK.Shelley Dawn, author of,Sweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"After being declared prudish by her fiance and discovering him in bed with another woman. Delanie Eastman spent a passionate night (well, three nights) with sexy Kyle Wright n an effort to shed herself of her pesky virginity. Four years later, she finds herself in his company again as she has infiltrated a gay South American casino owner and drug lord's island lair, posing as his girlfriend as she searches for her missing sister Lauren.Ramon and Kyle have a history; both attended college together, and he recruited Kyle to help him develop biological weapons for sale to the highest bidder. As a gift, he offers his mistress to Kyle, who willingly takes him up on the offer. Unbeknownst to Delanie, Kyle has spent the last four years in an elaborate undercover sting operation, culminating in the prosecution of sadistic Ramon Montero. Her presence is a distraction he's not willing to gamble on. As he tries to get her to flee to safety, she continues to ignore him and get herself into trouble. But it looks like the Montero family is making more than biological weapons, as Delanie finds herself on the receiving end of a powerful drug (rohypnol meets Spanish fly) that causes her to lose all control, much to Kyle's delight.

I was barely able to finish this book for several reasons but most prominent was that I found many things completely unbelievable. Such as.....how a woman (Delanie) could easily get so close to one of the richest men in the world in just a few weeks. How she would just happen to run into Kyle on a secluded mountaintop in South America?????? Etc. The sex scenes or interactions were not my cup of tea (particularly with Isabella).

It was an especially big risk as I did not like Kiss And Tell; I found both the hero and heroine in that book annoying for different reasons and the whole book more than a bit stilted. Needless to say, I donated it to a charity shop.Anyway, Hide &amp; Seek was a really good surprise. Yes, it is completely unbelievable in places. But this is more than compensated for by non-stop action, hot romance and humour. It's very much tongue-in-cheek, but *very* enjoyable for that.

Buying them for their covers alone is well worth the money (the guys on the covers are amazingly gorgeous. These hunky military alpha heroes will make you salivate & the romance will make you sigh. Pair them up with those spunky ...heroines & you've got spontaneous combustion everytime there is a scorching love scene. And I mean SCHORCHING! I tell you these heroines are like the old TIMEX watches, \\"Takes a Lickin & Keeps On Ticken\\". The gals get beaten up and even tortured sometimes, yet they always manage to come back & kicked the [heck] out of the bad guys. The story lines are fast paced and you go on this roller coaster ride of non-stop action. There is always one spot in the storyline in each of the books where I gasp outloud because I am so shocked!I highly recommend all three of these books in this series. Each one is about a brother or brother-in-law in this close knit family of 4 brothers & one sister. Each hero is so gorgeous, you won't be able to decide which one is the hottest."},{"Title":"Hide and Seek","review":"I don't care what some of the other readers wrote.

You will definitely hate the drug lord and grow quite a fondness to the main characters. Is the story believable?
