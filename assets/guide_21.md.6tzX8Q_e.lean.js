Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale. But no such ending was provided."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The essence of the book can be summed up when Dorian Grey wishes that his portrait to age, get old and decay but he should remain young and beautiful for ever! He not only accomplishes it but convinces others to this remarkable feat. He is so conceited, self absorbed and without any conscious that after he murders his true friend, he goes to bed and has a good night sleep. Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses. Lord Henry, the quick witted,brilliant companion is none other than Oscar Wilde. Aremarkable book. If it were written today, there would be lot ofcontroversy as the male charecters bond so freely.

The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

Certainly, it is dated insofar as many other Edwardian novels out of Nineteenth Century England seem trite and shallow (faring badly with what was coming out of Russia at the time: Gripping, universal, human stories from titanic authors like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy). But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years. That is to say, when one thinks of &quot;Twilight Zone-esque&quot; writing one is put in mind of Kafka, Borges or Grabriel Garcia-Marquez. The best in World Literature. But all of these writers take their cues from Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was so well written and covers so many important, seemingly timeless dilemmas that I felt guilty while I was reading it. Even though there is no explicit language, there was a subtle sexual undertone throughout the work that was frightening. It is one of those books that people love to hate and hate to love because it hits so close to home for people in so many walks of life. I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author.

I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book. It is a great way to start discovering Oscar Wilde's workthrough this book full of mystery, which still asks today this valid question: \\"What are peoplewilling to sell to get eternal beauty?\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It arrived very quickly.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!

Couldn't be happier with the purchase."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have seen the old movie several times, and it tempted me to order the book. Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through. Lots of old English and lots of footnotes describing what the words or phrases meant. I struggled through about 3/4 of the book, but then it picked up and I managed to get it read. In the end, it was worth the time and effort but does take some patience to get through. Not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It makes one think what would happen if one were to remain young/immortal. Part of our lives revolve around aging, preparing for that, and what have you, while Dorian doesn't have to. It's really interesting to see how his inside goes on decline while his outer self remains young. It's overall a good read, and I'd recommend this to anyone who is in need of a good, classic read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was difficult to read at first. I accept that the great ones always take a while to hook you as they build the characters. It has been a while since I read this book and yet much of it is fresh in my mind. Not a beach read. It's too deep. A story like no other I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While this is Oscar Wilde's only foray into novel-writing, I must say it is justifiably called a classic. The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice. I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism. He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow.

It may be fiction, but truth lies within the pages of this book. Oscar Wilde has painted a truly perfect representation of the human species with his character Dorian Gray. A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools. I doubt that it will, but I feel the character of Dorian Gray and his 'life' would be an eye opener for many.I highly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely curious about it. I honestly cannot understand why this has a single bad rating! If your still not sure after reading the reviews, check with your local library about borrowing it. If you like it, then buy it and save it to read for later. I've re-read mine several times now and have yet to grow bored or tired of it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is absurdly good-looking. Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time.

Based on this merit alone it is worth reading. If you're a connoisseur of literature it's mandatory, and if you're not, it's highly recommendable.It tells of the life of Dorian Gray, who, upon meeting Basil Hallward (his painter's) friend Sir Henry Wotton, begins to fret over the ephemerality of his youth, and makes an involuntary wish for...Well I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll leave that out.

For one it is an easy read, it can be enjoyed whether you are sitting at home or travelling. In another it is thought provoking, you could pull about two hundred quotes out of it and apply them to your daily life (and I'm not exaggerating). And lastly, the story line is gripping.If you're approaching this after experiencing Wilde's plays then I should warn you, there is no comedy here, in fact there is barely even a resemblance to the tone of his plays (although some of the dialogue is fairly similar).Either way, this is a damn good read and I certainly recommend it.If you're interested in gothic literature, this is highly, highly recommended, as are the above titles."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story is pretty standard.

Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most elegant novels in the Gothic canon; that it is also one of the most sinister is hardly surprising given Oscar Wilde's curious aptitude for tempering the macabre with the sensuous and the frivolous with the fatalistic.A considerable scandal upon its publication in the early 1890s, the novel still reads as slightly homoerotic, even if only in the most clandestine and aphotic of ways. Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nothing that can be said of this book will truely do it justice- you must read it to understand it.Some books are so clearly written that when a character voices a thought all you want to do is agree and quote it so others can see what you didn't even know- but have now relized- you were thinking. This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be. Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one!

If you enjoy really good quotes that make you think, this is a great book for you. It made me think of ideas and concepts that I had never thought about before. Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life. I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Loved this story in school and it just gets better with rereading.

His journey to corruption which he ultimately blames on the portrait."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time. It was the way I think a book should be written. The plot was both intriguing and unsettling. The ending to this beautifully told story would be - in itself - reason enough to read it.Although, the plot is not even the best reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" Lord Henry Wotton, one of the main characters, hold beliefs so incredible that they actually prove to be quite credible. They are very interesting to read, and you may find yourself agreeing with the majority of what he says, as I did.Make sure not to skip over the preface. It is also quite interesting. The whole book in very fascinating and enjoyable. But, be warned, chapter eleven is quite difficult, so make sure you are able to concentrate on it when you read it (although, it does not exactly play a large role in the plot of the book)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is the version I read while first discovering the many talents of Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray is captivating, though the actual storyline is not intricate. The descriptions are extraordinary and left me wondering why he hadn't written more novels? Very short, very effective. It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour. (He once commented that there never was an immoral or moral book, simply badly written or well-written) For insight into Oscar Wilde's very colourful life, pick up a copy of Richard Elmann's biography; it is not a happy read but very readable nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was known for his outrageous takes on life (in terms of aesthetics, superficiality, beauty and the like). This book seems to both explore and satirise them. It is about the decadence and superficial pursuits of Dorian Gray, who is \\"ruined\\" by Lord Henry Wotton who teaches him that beauty and youth are the only true values. When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as.

While years pass by, the portrait starts to reflect the man's sins and wrinkles while he remains as young as it was at that moment.

Until one day, he cannot stand it anymore..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this just to read Dorian Gray, and read the whole thing. Never read any Oscar Wilde before, and didn't think I would love it. Truely witty dialogue and great morality tales are both fun and though provoking. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This sophisticated but crude novel is the story of man's eternal desire for perennial youth, of our vanity and frivolity, of the dangers of messing with the laws of life. Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production.

This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into.

I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant. Wilde weaves a story like few authors could ever dream of doing, and of course his wit is played out beautifully in this book as well. full of quips and quirks, this book is a must read for anybody who has a love of sharp, intelligent writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an entertaining, short novel, with a very honest moral to it. A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled. The novel consists of mostly &quot;mindless&quot; dialogue and the true story does not really occur until the book is half over. then the story picks up pace until Dorian's descriptions of a book (totally unrelated to the rest of the novel) drag on.

Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions. Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship. His notes, which run alongside the text, exceed it in length, and he also provides lavish illustrations and other resources. I heartily recommend this edition for readers seeking a scholarly edition for research purposes. I frankly cannot see how it can be superseded.\\"A very generous endorsement, but for those who are seeking a scholarly edition, you will only find it in the original hardback."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was looking aimlessly for books in a bookstore and my boyfriend happened to have heard of this and picked it out for me. I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by. All in all, I am currently parousing more Oscar Wilde books to add to my collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle. In sum, while the formatting is annoying, the book is still totally readable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a novel by Oscar Wilde. The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work.

Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was one of my favorite reads as a pre-teen so I was eager to read it again 50 years later. What I learned was how differently I understood the story. As a young person, I enjoyed the premise and the supernatural aspect of the subject. Wouldn't that be cool sort of thing. But now, I see the struggle between good and evil, self-indulgence versus altruism, hedonism versus retraint and self-respect.

The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A bit of an odd read, but I enjoyed it a lot.

Throughout the book, Dorian Gray becomes very popular and attracts all sorts of attention just by waltzing into a room. People find him so innocent and pure, he's alluring (which soons turns sour.) But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness. Because it covers most every subject, its a wonderful classic, and a must-read.Though because its written in England in the 19th century, some of the vocabulary is bewildering. Its best to read with a dictionary near by or atleast some knowledge of English Literature and diction."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A comely, vain, innocent young man named Dorian Gray gets his portrait painted and hides it away in an unused room in his house. After a love affair with an actress goes terribly wrong, he notices that his portrait has altered itself in a curious way. He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point? This is an intriguing novel that combines elements of gothic horror and social satire, but it is marred by too many moments of unintentional goofiness."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In London, the well-known artist Basil Hallward meets up with a wealthy young gentleman, Dorian Gray.

The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans.

Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man.

A classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar WildeI have downloaded this ebook and have found it to be the most well thought out in terms of navigation."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's classic gothic tale of a man who is granted his wish to remain forever young is still a fine and compelling read. Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

Dorian teaches me a very important lesson:You can never escape the consequences of evil and regardless of how fortunate you are in some areas of your life, there are always lurking in our souls those moments of shame and regret.I know that the book has many messages about narcissism, beauty, art, conscience, friendship, social classes and other topics, but Dorian's inability to shake his evil actions is what I will remember the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wow. This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is. I skipped over some of Dorian's ranting about 60% through. I've never skimmed like that... Even in Anne of Green Gables.

Nice ending, but I feel like it was a bit abrupt.SIDE NOTE ON TECHNICALLY EBOOK ASPECTS:The chapters are not recognized by Kindle. You cannot advance by chapter as in other books."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rather impressed as I have never read this one. Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post. It looks like an aged piece of literature--which it is.

The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book.

It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being.

However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I ordered this book some months ago for my love, and it arrived quickly and was in phenomenal shape; exactly as the description stated, and was priced very fairly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Only read three pages.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book.

A well known but still interesting book. If you look for something to get you away from your current thinking and relax your brain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book is a fairly easy read and there are some clear morals offered from the story and a reflection on our culture's obsession with appearances and such. Some of the characters are interesting, particularly Lord Henry, who really captivates many readers of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My mother had recommended this book to me awhile ago, saying though she'd never read it, I'd probably like it. I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel! The introduction has a few spoilers for the book, though it doesn't explicitly say what happens. However, it was much easier to understand already knowing everything that happens.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"An absolute classic. This has always been my favorite. I highly recommend this book. It gets better everytime I read it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is a classic. Mostly because it was the one book that Oscar Wilde wrote and it express a philosophy of the time in a fictional setting in a very unique fashion. The covert homosexuality is clear, for my personal taste, tolerable. It was an important part of his life. Also, the price was right: free."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review for the Penguin Classics hardcover edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", ISBN: 0141442468. Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome. Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded. The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition. However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures. Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book. The crude, merely glued together pages make this volume little better than some cheap paperback in deceiving, meretricious garb. I will not again be purchasing a book from this line, and would advise anyone else to avoid doing the same."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is a young man of pure beauty. He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself. For the rest of this review, it will probably be enough to suggest you read it if you haven't, and include some quotes from Lord Henry:There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.

Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly.

This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like.

This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's. I saw the old movie many years ago, and decided to get the book. It was just as good as I recall the movie as being....or better."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If I had read this book decades ago, I would rate it higher. Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however. I suspect the general public could invest their time better with another book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a great book... slow read, drawn out... just like i remember.

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me. That is what I hate to hear."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I expected Dorian Gray to be rather dry and restrained when I picked it up. However, it is anything but! This is an enjoyable fast paced novel.Basil Hawthorne paints his masterpiece inspired by (and the portrait of) Dorian Gray. In the blush of innocence, Dorian begins to spend time with Basil's friend, Lord Henry who revels in making shocking statements and defying social protocols. A quick study, Dorian takes this to new levels as he - spurred on by Lord Henry and his own vanity - winds his way down a road of moral corruption all the while horrified at the changes on the canvas. When Basil decides that he would like to exhibit the portait (unaware of what has become of the portait while hidden away by Dorian), Dorian can no longer hide the flaws that have been for so long protected from outside eyes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When I first bought this book, I expected it to be one of the best novels I had ever read.

If all that excess in the middle had been deleted, I would have given the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the &quot;choose-life-before-art&quot; message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I think Dorian Gray is a book that is different for different people. For me it was a new experience, because I haven't read many books from the 19th century. I would believe that at the time when it was first published, it was a very different book for everyone. You can definetly see that the book contains lots of homosexual stuff. I think it's amazing that Oscar Wilde had the courage to write about that at such an early time. The book touched something deep in me even though it didn't have anything to do with my life or my present situation."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray was written by a man who was egocentric, socially polished and forever looking for the quiticential colloquialism. Notwithstanding, this book was a pleasure to read! It was easy to understand and was smattered with references to events and literature which were likely considered posh by English nobility in the mid-ninteenth century (i.e. Shakespeare, Greek Mythology, etc.). As stated above, this book is very reflective of the author in both spirit and style. I would definately recommend this book to a beginner reader of the English classics, due to its length and lack of confounding implicies which are common for this type of literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I wish I could give this book more stars but I can't.

It does ask some &quot;deep&quot; questions but it doesn't make you really care about the answers; the characters are one-dimensional and transparent. It's hard to seriously relate to any of them, or this story. The writers' language is beautiful in a flowery way. If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about &quot;ART&quot;. Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Informative, deep analyis and fascinating to see Wilde's own annotations in the text. Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

All throughout you want to rush through the pages to see how the story concludes. What will happen to Dorian? What will become of the hideous painting?The book's three main characters are Basil Hallward, the painter; Dorian Gray, the paintee; and Lord Henry, the intellectual mind behind Dorian Gray. It seems as if all of Dorian Gray's evils are inspired by his sidekick, Lord Henry. So, throughout the story, the reader is left asking: &quot;Is this guy a villain?&quot; As to the answer to that question, it still remains uncertain to me.And the ending - oh! - flawless, impeccable, divine! I dare not give it away, for you must venture into those pages to find out where all the events lead to. The last page of the book is truly the climax. You'll be left shivering with sweat trickling down your forehead just to see what happens.&quot;Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature,&quot; Lord Henry claims in one part of the story. Nay, they don't, I must say - for it was an Englishman that produced this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self.

There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading.

Interesting story as well, definitely worth the read. I recommend taking a spin through the book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out. I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read. You might walk away feeling a little dirty inside, and questioning yourself as well."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Occasionally one reads a book that leaves a lasting impact in one's mind for the duration of a lifetime, and crops up at the most curious of times. \\"Dorian Gray\\" by the brilliant Oscar Wilde is such a one for this reviewer. While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world. The language and attention to detail envelopes the reader and at times seems to go on for pages with no end in sight (the section on jewels and music for instance). I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading.

The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters).

But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It deals with a commonly met theme in literature, the wish of men to stay forever young.

Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression.

His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first read The Picture of Dorian Gray in my senior year of High School. I was pretty sure I would hate it, because I've been forced to read all manner of \\"classic\\" books that were just ho hum dreary.However, Wilde did an amazing job! I just think its sad that he got such harsh reviews in his time. The book is full of mystery, and asks a question that is still valid in today's society. \\"What are you willing to sell for eternal beauty?\\"So, ask yourself that as you read this book. How far will you go for beauty?(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone.

This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas. So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nota Bene: Once purchased, my Kindle download page contained this note near the download button: \\"This title has complex layouts and has been optimized for reading on Kindle DX's larger screen, but can still be viewed on other Kindle devices.\\" This message disappeared after a few minutes.Regardless, the formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others.

I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read. This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great book to read and discuss with a friend or a book club."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm a sophomore in high school and usually I don't go for these older, classic books. Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A change from Oscar Wilde witha touch of the fantasy and the pursuit of eternal youth.

The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think.

As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\"."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination. The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head. This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever. The best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself. My favorite of the classics. ."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are. If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together.

He tries one good act but the picture reflects what this act is, one of vanity and hypocracy.Terrific story"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel is one which everyone has heard of and many are compelled to read it as part of school curriculum. I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

So beautiful, in fact, that only the best artists can capture his charisma and perfection in a painting. When Dorian looks into the eyes of a portrait of himself, he is overcome with jealousy. Jealousy of the eternal youth and beauty of the masterpiece; youth and beauty which will one day vanish from Dorian Gray's perfect face.It is at this moment that Dorian makes a wish to stay beautiful forever, while the painting ages in his stead. However, his youth corrupts him, a corruption which can be seen on the face of his painting. Beauty, which was once Dorian's greatest attribute, may become Dorian's greatest flaw.Oscar Wilde wonderfully paints the story of The Picture of Dorian Gray. His simple language and sentence structures makes the story easy to read and follow, yet adds a certain level of depth to the plot. The character of Dorian Gray instantly captures the attention of the reader, and Dorian's development throughout the story provides a deeper significance to the novel.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a timeless classic, relating the tale of a young man whose wish to be forever young becomes the greatest mistake he has made in his eternal life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is simply amazing.

It is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What for most of my life I knew only as the answer to a trivia question, I've now read and enjoyed thoroughly, thanks to Amazon Kindle. His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more. I need to know and it still bugs me that I don't know what Wilde was alluding to."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful and lyrical told with biting wit.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals. No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's amazing how Wilde's words continue to ring so true in this day and age.

Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character.

I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \\"portrait\\" in our minds as well."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"great book hard to read because print was so small"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Review by Jason LushOne hundred and ninety pages of political masturbation disguised as a supernatural suspense story. Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing.

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

It's about Lief, the son of a castle escapee trying to save the world of Del from the shadow lord, a corrupt leader who wants to take over the world.Lief has to find the stones of the belt of Deltora, a weapon that he hopes to use to defeat the shadow lord. The stones are what give the belt its power. Along the way he meets Jasmine, the girl from the forest who has many connections with nature. He also meets Barda, who is a skilled fighter and he's also good at staying unheard of. This story keeps you hooked and has realistic characters.

Along the way, they run into trouble and are captured by the inhabitants of a mysterious city called Noradz. In a place with so many strange rules and customs, it's only a matter of time before the three companions make a mistake and are punished.

Now, Lief, Barda, and Jasmine must survive the brutal onslaught of rats at the city's entrance, and if they make it through, they must face the horrible Guardian of the city.

Patton. Patton's wonder-filled &quot;The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot; also echoes the footsteps of a VERY human being.

Translated by William Whiston (1667-1752)who was a mathmatician and church historian, and who succeeded Sir Isaac Newton as Lucasian professor of mathmatics at the University of Cambridge.All who read Josephus will learn more about the subject of Jesus than Gibran could have written in a dozen lives."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man,: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","review":"This book was incredible. I am getting it for gifts for family. I find it amazing that he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, it seems to be in line with a more modern understanding of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book, if they were not so threatened by opposing opinions which this book is, being how it is written from the opinion of @80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man,: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","review":"Through his book, Gibran suceeds in providing a truly unique and totally believable perspective of Jesus &quot;the man&quot;, through the eyes and emotions of those who knew, loved and betrayed him during his ministry on earth. Like the broadway play &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, this perspective is at times divergent from the more traditional Biblical personna of Jesus. But therein lies the charm and intrigue of this book.The story consists of a series of short chapters, each offering a vision of this man-God by individuals who would have observed him conducting various aspects of his public and private life. Each story is a gem in and of itself that leaves the reader pondering their own relationship with &quot;The Son of Man&quot; and the impact his short life on earth must have had for those who lived within the region of Jesus's ministry.This is a book that should be on the shelf of every introspective seeker of truth and inner peace, regardless of one's particular religion."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man,: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","review":"Gibran has masterfully rendered, through vignettes, the impact Christ had on the many people he touched during his life on earth.

It would be best to only read this book if you have already read the New Testament. In this way you will know what Jesus actually said and what Kahlil Gibran made up in a poetic fashion. I did enjoy this book as it made Jesus even seem more beautiful to me. Kahlil Gibran really does capture the essence of Jesus' teachings. He also really had a gift for telling the reader what they wanted to hear. Most of the accounts in this book are positive but a few are negative. Some of the people discussed really lived and interacted with Jesus and others seem born of fantasy. Some of the details are a little incorrect like Jesus was actually born in Bethlehem not Nazareth. I think you will enjoy this book because it is very poetic and it leaves you comforted and in a state of peace and joy.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man,: His words and His deeds as told and recorded by those who knew Him","review":"This quote is from Wikipedia - Thompson reported Gibran later saying that all the way through writing \\"Jesus, the Son of Man\\", he thought of \`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;.

The authors also didn't do a very good job of staying on topic; there are many long digressions that are neither interesting nor useful.

As with \\"Leo\\", the title character in \\"Milton the Early Riser\\" has a problem. It's not a huge problem, nor a particularly tragic one, but it bugs him just the same. Milton (an adorable panda cub) has woken up early and there is no one else up and nothing at all to do. To amuse himself Milton attempts to watch television (only the color bars are on), to jump up and down, to dance and do tricks, and finally to sing. It's the singing that wrecks the most damage to the other drowsy animals in Milton's neighborhood. An unexpected repercussion of Milton's little song is that the very mountains and trees themselves shake and tremble and a huge whirlwind blows the other sleeping animals hither and yon. Patiently, Milton puts everyone back in their proper place, tiring himself in the process. When his parents wake up Milton is fast asleep, a small smile on his face.The Aruegos are especially talented at making you feel sorry for their picture book creations. Though Milton is never put through any particularly dire straights, you feel really sorry for him when he plods about, alone and lonely. Fortunately, he's a bit of a card. By amusing himself with funny body positions and clever balancing tricks he also amuses the child reader. The book is infused with the regular fabulous colors and creations one has come to expect from this artistic duo. Not only beautiful, but also funny. Milton is particularly amusing when he thinks up original ways of schlepping animals from place to place to place.The story's good too. I should probably mention that. But I love the Aruegos and for me they're the whole reason to pick up this book. It's a sweet story, sure. But it's also a fabulous book to flip through. Lovely looking. Lovely reading."},{"Title":"Milton the early riser","review":"It's the best book I ever saw. The colors are very bright. I especially liked when the animals were camoflauged.

Alverson Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School and a frequent contributor to The Negotiator Magazine. Professor Craver has taught courses in Legal Negotiating at several Law Schools over many years. Additionally, lawyers will know him for his continuing legal education courses on the negotiation process and alternative dispute resolution and well as for his many books and articles on labor relations, alternative dispute resolution and negotiation. He is, therefore, a true expert in negotiation.Effective Legal Negotiation and Settlement was first published in 1986 and with revised editions every four years or so it has been tested in over sixty law schools and by thousands of lawyers as a negotiation resource. In that time, it has been polished and updated repeatedly and this latest edition is no exception. It is as close to a \\"must\\" for every negotiator's reference shelf as you will find.Craver has an easy to read style, bereft of mysterious Latin terminology and legal mumbo-jumbo. It is a practitioner's book exploring the phases of the negotiation process and providing the \\"nuts and bolts\\" for moving successfully through any negotiation. It is also a comprehensive guide to the special areas of the field and focuses on them and integrates them into the negotiation spectrum. You will find clear and valuable discussions of negotiating with government agencies, international negotiations, assisted negotiation through mediation as well sections on ethics and a variety of negotiation issues.The book is truly a compendium of information, advice and carefully crafted illustrations. You will find the entire family of who, what, when, how, where and why always brilliantly represented no matter what the topic. Easy access to the material is through a carefully constructed index as well as through the table of contents.Want to know more about: how to ask questions, reading the meaning of non-verbal signals, opening a negotiation, or crafting and carrying-out a concession strategy in various stages? It is all here and I do mean all. Facial signals? Twenty-nine are described. Negotiating techniques? Twenty-nine separate techniques are described, their risks illuminated and defenses appropriate to each tactic are suggested. Negotiating via e-mail, telephone, letters? Advantages, disadvantages and risks of each method are clearly spelled-out.All that suggested, let me focus briefly on a single area in Professor Craver's work by way of illustration of what you will find in this book. Every negotiator and every sales manager, corporate executive, government or non-profit leader, every union leader needs to know: how to conduct a meaningful and instructive post-negotiation assessment. There is no single area of more importance to managing one's organization than improving its negotiation performance.Professor Craver is correct when he writes that \\"win or lose ... it is only through objective post-mortems focusing on every negotiating stage that individuals can continuously enhance their negotiating capabilities\\" (p. 308). Now, here is the real stuff of improving the results of your organization. You must know, whether or not you got the agreement, if you did the best possible in the negotiations. In these times of fractional point margins, you have to know the answer to that question about this deal and from it learn how to better prepare and conduct the next deal.Craver tells you how to conduct that essential review, the questions to ask, the areas to focus on. The rest of the book is, of course, the prescription, but first you have to have an accurate diagnosis.The author guides the reader quickly through the essential aspects of a professional evaluation process. First, we explore the stages of the process and then we move into specific topics of importance in evaluating the performance. He suggests that focus should be placed on some specific elements. For examples, Craver directs the evaluator to a review of the concessions; an assessment of the impact of time pressures; a look at the techniques used, including deceitful ones; an assessment of which party got the most beneficial results; and of course, and study of the mistakes made and new tactics employed. Readers will find a valuable three page checklist for post negotiation reviews at the end of the section.Readers should recognize that although this book was primarily crafted as a law school text and is dauntingly lengthy, it is a rich trove for all negotiators. They may also be surprised that according to research cited by the author, most attorneys settle over 90% of their cases through negotiation and yet have no formal training in negotiation. Additionally, we learn that successful litigators may have no more of negotiation skills than any other effective negotiator.This is, therefore, a book for every negotiator, enriched by the author's experience as a negotiator and a teacher, requiring no legal training for its precepts. It is based on the best of psychological and social science research and, of course, seasoned by legal reason.There is an Appendix with several negotiation training exercises that readers may find most interesting and consider employing for training purposes. Additionally, there is an extensive and carefully updated Bibliography.Best book in the field of negotiation.John Baker, Ph.D.EditorThe Negotiator Magazinewww.negotiatormagazine.com"},{"Title":"Effective legal negotiation and settlement","review":"There are a lot of books which deals with the the subject of legal negotiation. Since I am currently writing the first book on this subject to be published in Norway, I have read basically all of the books available. Some books are not so good, some books are quite good. Professor Craver's &quot;Effective Legal Negotiation and Settlement&quot; (Fourth Edition) is simply excellent! In my view, both as a Supreme Court Attorney and partner in one of Norway's biggest law firms and as a scholar/author, this is by far the best book on the market. Why? I have three main reasons: 1) Contrary to many other books it does not loose itself in the world of academics or theories. This book is written for lawyers and others who are negotiating in the real world. As a former lawyer, professor Craver has been there himself. He knows what the lawyer is facing and how the lawyer should negotiate both to obtain the maximum result for the client and to be a value creator. 2) The book is backed by references to studies and examples which show that what the author is saying is correct and backed by real life studies. 3) The book is very well-written. It is clear, it is concise and it is easy to follow what the author means, why he means it and where he is going.I could not have competed with professor Craver's book even if my book had been written in English. I have read his book many times, and I will read it again. This is an outstanding book and superb reading.

For example, if plaintiff attorneys hope to get $300,000, they can begion with a demand in the $500,000 range to keep their $300,000 target in the middle.'One would hope that anyone who has gotten as far as law school would not need to be told such obvious things."},{"Title":"Shakey & Me","review":"I laughed so hard when I read Burt Wilson's book Shakey and Me. It is fast paced and it brings out how \\"off-the-wall, original, and funny\\" Sherwood (Shakey) Johnson was. Every time I eat pizza or listen to jazz it will remind me of this legendary man. I highly recommend this book for a great read."},{"Title":"An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek","review":"Moule's book is a classic reference that brings out the shades of meaning expressed through colloquial terms found in the Greek New Testament. This book is a must have if the serious student of the bible is to grasp a deeper understanding of the intent of the New Testament authors. Indexed very well by verse. Brief explanations that add greater understanding in exegesis."},{"Title":"An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek","review":"This book gives an overview of Greek grammar with relatively few examples from the Greek text (as compared to Wallace or Perschbacher). It could possibly be a good help to determine in between two differing opinions of a certain detailed debate, but would not be my first reference tool."},{"Title":"An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek","review":"The author describes the book as not being a syntax book but rather an unsystematic collection of idioms, despite its layout on the discussed topics similar to a syntax book. With the ease of computer for searching the GNT one would wonder what value this book could offer. This is an excellent book despite its high command of basic Biblical Greek. The reader ought to have read a decent portion of the whole Greek New Testament though the author has given quite enough translation for his quoted collections. The reader is expected to do his own comparison and search for further study on each discussed topic. The author does not give \\"THE\\" answer but discuss alternative translations for each sampled example. Significance of each translation is often highlighted and discussed. The aim is to understand the true meaning of each verse on sound grammatical ground. Its treatment of each grammatical particle is much more detailed and in-depth than an intermediate text on syntax would provide. Many ambiguous grammatical particles are thoroughly discussed with good examples.Moule's book may well provide a preparation for the reader to proceed to the Advanced work by Robertson after having mastered the intermediate level text written by Wallace. Robertson is quite often referred for further study in the book. This is a book for serious GNT students."},{"Title":"An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek","review":"For New Testament Greek read Koine Greek, the common spoken language shared by most in the Roman Empire - including Paul and the Christian Evangelists- and \\"re-discovered\\" by Cambridge's C.FD.

Since Greek was very old at that point, the Romans, among others, added many idioms to their Greek and these are the subject of this little book. It's meant for Bible exegetes doing it the hard way, in the original Koine Greek, This book is referred to by Bill Mounce in his popular Basic N.T. Greek Texts. You do need some Greek to enjoy this erudite book. Some of the Bible passages might not mean what you think they do."},{"Title":"An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek","review":"To enjoy this erudite book, ya gotta know some New Testament (Koine) Greek.

If you're studying the Bible, or taking Bill Mounce's exegetical Greek Classes, you need this book."},{"Title":"Best Dives' Snorkeling Adventures : A Guide to the Bahamas, Bermuda, Caribbean, Hawaii & Florida Keys","review":"This is the best book for snorkeling I've ever found. The other books are so vague, they don't tell me much of anything. This one describes all the neat places to walk in from the beach and go snorkeling, how rough or calm the area is, how to get to various snorkeling beaches once I get there, whether the kids can safely swim in each area.

Most, but not all are Caribbean islands. There are also descriptions of other &quot;traditional&quot; snorkeling places, such as the Yucatan Penninsula and Hawaii. And there are two large sections on snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef and the Galapagos Islands. Several snorkeling sites are listed at each separate location, and useful advice and information is given for most. All sites are rated on a 1 to 5 &quot;starfish&quot; point system. About the only criticism I have of the book is that much of the hotel information seems to be pulled directly from the hotel's advertising about themselves. A little more independent commentary would be nice. The information is still useful as a starting point. Finally, for each location, there is useful information on weather, how to get there, and when to go. If you have the first edition of this book, I see little reason to purchase this new edition, however. I do wish a few other sites or activities had been included, in particular snorkeling with whale sharks off Northwest Australia. That's something that interests me, but there seems very little information on it out there.

It was a fantastic learning aid, very comprehensive and well written. The entire scope of the various possible research types are here, from grounded research to image data to focus groups to feminist methods to Foucauldian knowledge inquiries. There is even a chapter that deals with conducting research on race issues by showing how even the seemingly straightforward racial categorization of \\"white\\" needs to be challenged. It really forced the class to come to terms with their own assumptions.My favourite chapers were:- Prior's chapter on text and research, \\"Following in Foucault's Footsteps\\",- Miller & Crabtree's chapter on \\"Depth Interviewing\\"- Guba & Lincoln's chapter on how a researcher's personal ontology affects their methodology in \\"Competing Paradigms in Qualitative Research: Theories and Issues\\".- Charmaz' chapter on \\"Grounded Theory\\"The only quibble I have with the work in here is the chapter on online methods. It is rather outdated and based on old assumptions about the Internet. For example, when dealing with how to do research using email, it tells the budding researcher that they need to learn HTML in order to properly format their emails in an attractive manner and makes no mention of the online web-based survey tools widely available for online questionnaires. This small quibble aside, the book is great and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is starting to explore qualitative methods or to someone who is looking to expand their repertoire of research methods but doesn't want to have to take an entire course."},{"Title":"Stage Lighting","review":"Stage Lighting the CD-ROM contains all the information you could ever need not only about the techniques of stage lighting, but also about the equipment used.

Provides an easy to read, description of the field, its methods, applications and utilization. Covers everything: 'ab initio' quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics and dynamics, modelling of biological macromolecules with a short introduction to sequence analysis, QSAR and computational pharmacology.While it won't provide an in-depth view of the methods, it manages to convey enough detail to understand the basics. A must have for anyone desiring to enter the exciting field of Molecular Modelling."},{"Title":"Computational Chemistry (Oxford Chemistry Primers, 29)","review":"What this book does, it does reasonably well. Its real strength is in the basic quantum mechanical principles that bind atoms and that cause molecualr interactions.The authors carry this forward, using concise mathematics, to derive electron distributions and small-scale molecular conformations. The third chapter addresses conformations of larger molecules, starting with rigorous computations of each conformation's energy, then backing down to some approximation techniques. The fourth chapter packs in a number of concepts, prehaps too many: solvation, statistical mechanics, and a little bit of molecular mechanics. Chapter five skims over protein and DNA folding, and chapter 6 discusses small-molecule (drug) interactions with proteins.Although the authors start the book noting the intense computational requirements, they never give explicit techniques for performing those computations efficiently. The math is the abstract form, close to the quantum mechanics, and rarely the form of a practical computation. In fact, the math is abstract enough that I'd be hard pressed to come up with real limits of integration in many cases. The authors make some effort to use their equations to support intuitive understanding, but sometimes focus too much on the formulas themselves instead of their meanings.I can't fault the book for being written in 1995 - by the standards of computational chemistry, that's a bit dated now. Still, almost all of its references date from 1990 or earlier. They weren't the freshest even when the book was written.The book does give a broad view, high-level survey of the quantum mechanical view of chemistry. It omits many more modern practices though: finite element approximations to molecule structure, grammar-based analysis of RNA folding, and Markov models for structure prediction. It also omits the knowledge needed to reduce abstract physics to practical calculations. Use this as an introductory survey, but use other books for knowledge you can put to work."},{"Title":"Computational Chemistry (Oxford Chemistry Primers, 29)","review":"Good to get an introduction to the topic.

I later took up an Eastern pathway; but the author does not exclude anyone who is able to feel inspired from gaining her message. Or, rather His message, because as these things come in their own special ways so it has apparently come through the author/scribe. I recommend the book for the reason that it is a quiet uplifting message all throughout its pages. Yes, it is Christian, but the author has a comparative background. Her pathway is Jesus', but she wants everyone to know about a special message that has God reaching out to humanity--once again.It is a gentle message of God's love and desire to commune with us. I firmly believe that this work could become a classic work of devotion. It could stand well on a shelf of books on mysticism, devotion, spirituality, and metaphysics."},{"Title":"BELOVED: Parts I - II The Garden Message & In the Still of the Evening","review":"Beloved is a book unlike any other to date.

Here are just a few of your inaccuaracies:You write: &quot;No more carefree laughter..Agnetha sings mournfully on Knowing Me Knowing You&quot;...well, it was Frida who sang lead on this one- a fact that was even mentioned in the liner notes on the &quot;Arrival&quot;-album.You write:&quot;At the end of their 1979 tour ABBA knew they would never tour again...well, Mr Oldham, tell me then, who toured Japan in spring the following year- impersonaters???You write: Opus 10 died of boredom before delivery- but the one track they recorded for that album- I Am The City shows that ABBA had lost none of their vitality...well Opus 10 was never recorded because such a project didn't exist and I Am The City was recorded way back in 1982- and not in 1986.Dear Mr Oldham, you don't even know the bare facts that one can look up in any &quot;Gold&quot; compilation inner sleeve. A man who doesn't even know who sang lead on the worldwide hit Knowing Me Knowing You is surely not the right person to write an in-depth biography.Save time and effort next time !"},{"Title":"Abba: The Name of the Game","review":"I don't like this book at all! First of all, I don't think that interfering of the authors of the book into private lives of Agnetha, Frida, Benny and Bjorn was very nice of them. And then I don't think that these people really can know what they are talking about. I mean, it can be interesting to read about the behind-the scene lives of ABBA members but how can these people write what Agnetha was thinking about sitting alone in her hotel room? No one but Agnetha can know it , and I don't think it was she who told Andrew Oldham about her feelings. I suppose that the authors really did a big research before writing this book but there things they just couldn't know about. They give their idea of private lives of Frida, Agnetha, Bjorn and Benny, told some gossips and rumours but most of those things can't be proved. You may think that I think so \`cause I'm ABBA fan and I just don't like reading some rather unpleasant things about the members of the group. It isn't so. Being ABBA fan I'm interested in knowing as much as possible about their lives, even if sometimes I don't like what I hear. But it should be facts, not rumours! Though I have to admit that this book can give you a lot of fun if you don't take it seriously! I gave it 2 stars only because of the pics. Some of them are really cute!"},{"Title":"Abba: The Name of the Game","review":"To this day, the original Swedish Fab Four -ABBA- remain one of Europe's most popular music groups. Not bad for a group that hasn't recorded together in over 15 years. Their albums continue to sell well, especially in the UK, where their ABBA Gold/More ABBA Gold albums have remained in the top 40 album charts for close to 5 years! And with the success of the smash London musical Mamma Mia!, co-produced by Bjorn Ulvaeus and chock full of ABBA's greatest hits, which has played to sold-out performances since its debut in April 1999, ABBA's popularity is nowhere near ending. The book, ABBA: The Name of the Game, provides the ABBA fan with a great detail of the behind- the-scene lives of Agnetha, Benny, Bjorn and Anni- Frid, some of which could be debatable as painstakingly honest or tabloid trash. Obviously written as an unauthorized biography, the book places a great deal of emphasis on the &quot;feud&quot; that seemed to exist between Agnetha and Frida, a far cry from the happy smiles and wholesomeness you'd see in their videos. (Agnetha Faltskog went so far as to write a book of her own in 1997, &quot;As I Am&quot;, to deny those allegations.) While praising most of ABBA's songs, the authors' criticisms of the few songs &quot;they&quot; didn't like was the equivalence of catty office gossip. At times, the book can be factually informative, but a good deal of it looks like it was written with a poisoned pen."},{"Title":"Abba: The Name of the Game","review":"This is a triumph of style over substance. The research is very poor with the result that there are a lot of factual errors in this book. I counted three in the first chapter alone (an example is the scoring system used in Eurovision in 1974). The main one, of course, is the repeated reference to Frida and Agnetha hating each other, which simply wasn't (and isn't) true. Nevertheless, this book is a fun quick read and the author's opinions, which range from comments on ABBA's music (which, in general, they rave about) to pop lyrics in general and musicians in the movies, are lively and entertaining. If you just cut out the personal stuff between the girls, the rest of this book will tell you as much as you ever need to know about ABBA, unless you're more than a casual fan. For those wanting more, 'Bright Lights, Dark Shadows' fills out the details, in a less tabloid fashion - but that still has it's moments of wrong-headedness (the comments in regard to the failure of Chess, in particular)"},{"Title":"Abba: The Name of the Game","review":"Just as the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; puts it, this book is &quot;outrageously entertaining&quot;. I've had my good laughs with it. There is no question about it, these people know what they are talking about and they are not just talking. They might be a little exagerating at times, but they definitely know the music business and I do believe they also know what went on in ABBA throghout the group's life. It has to be true, simply because it fits. When this book first came out in 1995 it was rejected by many ABBA fans as a complete misinterpretation of the actual situations within the group's circle. I can tell you this right now: this book is not written by ABBA fans and is not for ABBA fans. It is written objectively (sometimes a bit sarcastically) by three people who did their research and are also connosseurs of the music business. In the book there are separate chapters for each of the four members, and even one for their manager Stig Anderson (now recently passed away), a character it studies extensively. On each biography there is not only the description of their lives, but also their mentality and (very important), the historical context. Chapter 2 does an excellent comparison between ABBA's music and most other legends and comes up to the conclusion that Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson are the greatest songwriters in history. The book is polemical, but nevertheless a very interesting read and very well structured. If you want to have one book about ABBA, which also allows you the possibility of insights into many other artists, then get this volume which becomes even more mouthwatering every time you read it."},{"Title":"Abba: The Name of the Game","review":"I am an avid Abba fan, and I found thisbook to be a very worthwhile read indeed.This humorous rock-bio gives a rare behind-the-scenes look at the Swedish QuartetSupreme's days before the formation of thegroup, during the rocky timespost-Eurovision 1974, at the height of theirfrenzied world success, and the events andtensions that led up to their disbandment inthe early- to mid-eighties.The matter-of-factness of this work willdeepen the die-hard fan's connection to thegroup, its excellent prose will convince thewould-be or novice of Abba's true popsupremacy, and its satirical edge will keepthe non-fan or even the headstrong Abba-hater in stitches.

Easily identifiable as a Mosley novel, with obsessions which show what a disciplined writer he is when he's doing Easy Rawlings or other kinds of fiction, for you simply wouldn't know from those books what a thoughtfully philosophical writer he can be (the same social observation is here, of course).

Mosley's story offers the reader an alternative way of thinking about the Creator, life, death and how the lives of all creatures are woven together in a beautiful tapestry."},{"Title":"The Wave","review":"When Errol Porter is woken by night after night of strange phone calls, he has no idea how much his life will change. At first the calls are unnerving, a voice bemoaning, \\"Cold...naked, cold... naked.\\" Night after night the calls come, in the waning hours of the morning. His divorce imminent, Porter is still recovering from that emotional trauma, his well-paying computer job a thing of the past, along with his broken marriage. Currently, Errol is working at Mud Brothers Pottery Studio and living in a garage-cum-living space. The only light on the horizon is a burgeoning romance with Nella, a lively Caribbean ceramicist at the studio, who inspires Errol to look beyond the painful past year with an eye to the future.The calls are increasingly unsettling to Errol, especially as the voice becomes more familiar, eventually claiming to be Porter's father, dead for the past six years. When the voice calls him Airy, a childhood name, Errol is hooked, unable to resist rushing to the cemetery where his father is buried. Once at the graveyard, Errol discovers a stranger who is not a stranger, a man who will challenge every assumption Porter has known, thrusting him into a surreal world where the impossible is increasingly viable. The stranger draws others into Porter's life, implacable men on a mission that is both stunning and brutally efficient. His simple existence no longer relevant, another dimension offers an amazing possibility, along with a frightening pursuit by those who fear what they cannot control.Drawing on an imaginative premise, this supernatural story transcends the acceptable boundaries of reality, fascinating and thought-provoking, a call to look beyond out petty daily concerns and question the rigid, frightened society we have wrought. Crossing the line between the known and the unknown, The Wave is a parable for our times, informed by a deep concern for the direction of humankind driven by a fear of difference and a shocking disregard for individual rights. At the heart of Errol's quest to unravel a world far beyond his ken lies his capacity to transcend the ordinary, thrust into a future of infinite potential.

Someone addressing him by his childhood pet name, \\"Airy.\\" Someone who claims to be his (long deceased) father. Then it gets even stranger. Errol goes to the cemetery and finds a naked, incoherent young man who claims to BE his dead father. And knows all kinds of things about him and his family that only his late father could possibly know.So, has the late Mr. Porter been raised from the dead? Nothing as simple as that. No, indeed. Mr. Porter's DNA and his memories have somehow been incorporated into something called \\"The Wave,\\" a life-form that goes way beyond anything we know. A life-form that brings everything into mystical unity, and--well--I can't explain it. You'll just have to read the book.If the first half of the novel builds upon familiar elements of Mosleyana--home, family, sex, race--the second half soars into another dimension--stocked with alien life forms and paranoid government agencies, and builds to an unbelievable conclusion.Author Walter Mosley is a literary genius, and I consider myself a fan, but this is not his best work. The plot doesn't hold together well enough to ever be believable. Who or what--really--is G.T.--the young man who claims to be Errol's father? The book explains all that--but not really. Not in a way that's convincing. Still, it does read easily, flows like music, with overtones of love, betrayal, loss, sadness, and--of course--sex.If you love Mosley's work, you'll love this one. If you're not familiar with him, this is probably not the book for you to start with. Reviewed by Louis N.

As the calls keep coming, Errol begins to wonder if he might be a bit deranged as the person on the other end is beginning to speak and sound just like his father and more frightening the man knows insider information that only he and his father Arthur Bontemps Porter III could know.Unable to resist Errol agrees to meet Arthur, but is stunned when he sees his dad's face, albeit a much younger Arthur than he remembers. He wonders if GT (\\"Good Times\\") is a con, but has no idea what the person would benefit from this ruse or could he be a ghost? US Army officer Dr. David Wheeler places Errol under house arrest until he can figure out how to persuade his superiors that we have been invaded by \\"demons from hell\\" and how to combat them. While David expects the invasion of the body snatchers, Errol trusts no one especially the Feds or his so-called dad, but admits while he ponders what next as the sex with David's wife is good.As he did with FUTURELAND, Walter Mosley displays his vast skills with this superb science fiction thriller. The story line focuses mostly on Errol who keeps digging one step at a time only to find that next stride even more convoluted and confusing. Like the hero, readers will wonder what is going on until suddenly the 200 plus page novel is finished in one delightful sitting.

I am a fan of his new \\"Fearless Jones\\" series, which does a lot to explain racism in 1950s Los Angeles.Nothing I've read about Walter Mosley explains why he would want to write this piece of trite. This book is the worst rehash of bad 1950s sci-fi movies that I've read in years. I've been reading sci-fi for forty years and this is about as bad as it gets. The story is totally trash, you know the ending before you get past the beginning, the characters are ridiculous, and the sex scenes are even worse (hard to ruin sex, but he does it).If this was by anyone else it never would have gotten published. It would be a favor to him and all his fans to buy back every copy that exists and bury them."},{"Title":"The Wave","review":"Mosley fans will find much to like in the character development of a black out-of-work computer programmer turned potter, and the wierd turns his life takes when a young man claiming to be his reincarnated father appears. Science fiction afficionados, on the other hand, may be disappointed in the development of the science fiction ideas, which are a strange blend of \\"B\\" sci-fi movie and mysticism. The science fiction revolves around the idea that an intelligent life-form, developing within the earth since it was driven deep below the surface by a meteorite impact billions of years ago, has emerged to the surface and is making contact with humanity in a most bizarre and interesting way. So far, so good. But unfortunately the great science fiction that I found myself expecting to emerge from this idea fails to materialize. Instead, the story gets bogged down in mad scientist paranoia and mystical revelations of an approaching god-like being from across the galaxy - somehow drawn to mate with the new life-form from within the earth. The mysticism reminds me of Mosley's earlier science fiction attempt, Blue Light, and makes me wonder if there's some underlying story or message there that Mosley is still struggling to figure out how to tell. Definitely worth a read by Mosley fans such as myself, and even worth a read for non-Mosley fans for the \\"teasers\\" of science fiction ideas contained within the story, even if those ideas never get fully developed."},{"Title":"The Wave","review":"\`\\"... naked, naked...

He soon realizes this \`creature' is, in a way, his father, yet at the same time a much more disturbing and wondrous being whom the American government is frantically after. Errol tries to help GT and in the process finds himself captured by the secret authorities. While captive he's shocked with one stunning revelation after another about the identity of GT and others like him, and witnesses acts of unspeakable ignorance, fear and evil by his own people.The Wave is an interesting read, to say the least.

If you're expecting this, The Wave will disappoint but it is certainly not a disappointing book. Mosley can write and he can write science fiction very well, as this novel proves. Mosley's hero, Errol Porter, is a middle aged black man trying to cope with life. One night he's awakened by an eerie telephone call from someone claiming to be his long dead father. Errol visits his father's grave and finds a younger version of the man he remembered as dad who tells him he's his father but also actually part of an ancient race of single-cell creatures making their way from under the earth to meet their fate. Errol's amorous adventures with a free-spirited girl friend, imprisonment by a mad government scientist and his military minions and the slaughter of a benevolent race plus much more makes this quick reading story (only 209 pages) a pleasure.

It's his 19th novel, and I've lost count of his awards, an O. Henry, a Grammy, a Sundance Institute Risk-Taker Award. There seem to be few writers who can switch genres as flawlessly as he does. Simply goes to prove what we've known all along - Walter Mosley is one terrific wordsmith.With The Wave we meet Errol Porter who is receiving what he believes to be crank phone calls. Perhaps, he thinks, someone in a mental institution has gotten his number and put it on redial. With the first call all he heard were moans and grunts. It was a man's voice. With the second call he heard single words - cold, naked. There's cause for concern when the caller claims to be Errol's father who died and was buried in 1996.It is only when Errol visits the site of his father's grave that he begins to learn of \`the wave,' an incredible force that can bring corpses back to life in great good health with their minds and memories intact. What then would happen to our world as we know it? To further complicate matters Errol is grabbed by a psychotic scientist and taken to a frightening underground world.Narrator Tim Cain's deep, resonant voice is particularly appropriate for this tale of suspenseful horror.

This particular book, The Wave, had an interesting premise...and, while reading it...I found it had a good pace. However:The alien plan wasn't clear. It seemed like it was going to be commentary on the U.S. government, since they were holding aliens against their will, as well as the main character (based on Mosley himself?) who comes into contact with an alien who may or may not be his father reincarnated.Also, the aliens learn to kill, not just for self-defense, but survival.Now, who am I to root for? Who am I to care for? The aliens became just as bad as the humans who want to kill them off. Too, the aliens use animals for food and pelts. And, this further goes against the idea that these beings, who we really don't get to fully understand, are not as benign....or at least, no different from humans.(So, why should we care for them?)Other question(s): What was their purpose on Earth?To be reborn?To multiply?To take over the world?It wasn't clear.** out of *****There was a good idea here.

In this slim volume, Mosley has managed to write an effective, melancholy SF story while maintaining an air of magic reality and social allegory. There are thematic echoes of Greg Egan's \\"Blood Music\\" and even Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" in this, but the voice is pure Mosley, with deceptively simple language unfolding to reveal layers of meaning; the story told in first-person by a character about whom we discover as much from what he leaves out of the tale as what he puts in.

Errol takes him home for a shower and a change of clothes, if nothing else (Errol's girlfriend, Nella, thinks that is a bad idea).Along the way, GT tells Errol things about his family and about growing up that no one else could know. Errol's first thought was that his father had another family, and this is his illegitimate son. GT also points Errol to a handwritten confession written many years previously. Errol's mother was having an affair with a local man. Errol's father murdered the man, and buried him under their garage, where his body is found. Slowly, but surely, Errol is convinced. One night, GT disappears, and Errol thinks that this is the end of the story.That is, until Errol is kidnapped by government agents and taken to a secret facility. There, he is shown hundreds of people, risen from the dead, all with amazing powers of recuperation. He watches as what looks like a six-year-old girl regenerates an arm that has just been amputated. The head of the facility, Dr Wheeler, is convinced that this is the beginning of some sort of alien invasion. GT returns, and Errol learns that millions of years ago, a cellular intelligence came to Earth via a meteor. It recently found a life form it can use, dead people, and wants to peacefully coexist with the people of Earth. It also wants to give humans a storehouse of ancient wisdom, which looks a lot like a pool of black slime.

He has also from time to time taken a detour outside of mystery/crime fiction to write very speculative stuff in SciFi and other things; for example see \`The Man in My Basement' for a really startling view of race relations.This little volume has some really fine writing, but some problems with the plot.

I can't believe I've waited so long to read one of his books. THE WAVE: this book has me totally hooked. It was an action-packed story that grabbed me from the start. I am enamored with all of the elements of the story: sci-fi (dead coming to life and alien creatures), love (girlfriend who without question strongly supports and stays by his side until the end of the journey), and the surrealism of the world Errol finds himself in. The only thing I didn't like was how loose he seemed to be (he slept around quite a bit). Since reading this book, I've now researched his other writings--sci-fi, thrillers, mysteries.

Has his father truly been reanimated? And if so by what force? Should Errol embrace his second chance with his father or proceed with caution? Determined to get to the bottom of things, Errol ventures out to the graveyard and so the adventure which entails eluding the government begins.This sci-fi is told from a prospective that is unusual. It makes the government the antagonist, presenting a unique dilemma. With whom does one side, the creatures that are merely trying to exist or the government out to protect mankind from what it does not understand?Although the d&eacute;nouement was not as climatic as I hoped, I truly enjoyed this thought-provoking, entertaining novel.

The gist of it seems to be that there's some shared memory/intelligence running through all creatures in the universe and that it may be accessible by making contact with a vein of goo down in the earth somewhere. A vector for this intelligence is a tiny flagellate critter that can invade the human body, changing the living and reanimating the dead. The hero of the novel is led to the goo by a creature having the essential characteristics of his late father. There, he encounters other creatures resembling prehistoric beasts and various people. A U.S. government agency, unidentified, is hounding these creatures, apparently fearing their superiority. Most are destroyed, but our hero helps spirit away some of the magic goo, which he hides in a hollow statue, whence the goo ultimately makes a great ascension to freedom in the universe at large.Were it not for my respect for Walter Mosley, I probably wouldn't have gone beyond the dust-jacket notes in this book, but it turned out to provide an enjoyable couple of hours."},{"Title":"The Wave","review":"Walter Mosley is always a challenging thinker, forcing the reader to see life, history, and future possibilities, in a new light.

The story is so well written I was surprised to find such a cliche, cartoon-like presentation of the \\"mad\\" government scientist from such an accomplished author. In spite of this, however, the novel is worth reading for all the moral questions it raises.Armchair Interviews says: The book can be read in a day or two yet haunts the reader with these questions for many days afterwards."},{"Title":"The Wave","review":"First, this is not Walter Mosley's best book. It's pretty good but it's not the kind of book that you particularly need to read. Second, many of the reviewers of this book note that the PLOT has been done before or at least every element of the plot has been pushed forth by writers since the pulp era. The mad scientists and the armies trying to destroy things that they do not understand. The concept of an amoeba-like intelligence that can resurrect people and has a group mind is either a ripoff of Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Buddhism, depending on your perspective.However, what the book lacks in plot it makes up for in the characters. Errol Porter is a believable man who is trying to get his life in order after his wife leaves him for a white man. He has hit the point where his career has soured and he is looking for something else. The fact that the Wave comes to him in the form of his dead father puts his life in sharp relief and forces him to see how much his life was always crazy in a way. Family revelations and past history combines to make for a heady novel concerning both our individual lives and our places in the universe.The entrance of the mad scientists does detract from the book and there's a lot of running around that isn't necessary. Still this is a fine book and a short book that can make for a pleasant afternoon."},{"Title":"The Wave","review":"I gave this only four stars because of the quality of the product. It started off by saying it was by \\"Robert Mosely\\" I know it's in the science fiction genre, how that was caught in editing I'll never know. I knew immediately by the style that it was Walter Mosley, so I continued to listen. Like I said it's different, from most of his writings, but I enjoyed the provocative concept and it would recommend it."},{"Title":"Testimonios del exilio","review":"The making of the modern states required of a large dose of burocratic brutality in order to sweep off all opposition to government power. This process is very clearly seen in the transition of Spain from a loose feudal federation to a centralized monarchical state, process which was driven by the new kings of Spain once the House of Habsburg had to leave the throne.There were many victims during that process, notably the Jesuits, who had to abandon all Spanish dominions with only a very short notice. On the day that happened, all culture and education suffered, especially of the poorest and most forlorn of people. And yet, the Jesuits obeyed without as much as a sigh of protest.This book is about many things. First, it is about the powers the government is endowed with. It is a warning against excessive state control and an argument for freedom. Second, it is about wrong governmental decisions. No one, but the people, should decide what is good for the people.But most it is about the courage and bravery of the persons which are most affected by the burocratical brutality. It is an exemplar essay on civil resistance, on breaking the will of the powerful by subtle and pacific means."},{"Title":"WAVE GENERATION AND SHAPING (McGRAW-HILL ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING SERIES, BROOKLYN POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE SERIES)","review":"This book gets into really useful time domain applicaitons (e.g. signal generators, multivibrators, etc) using generalized amplifier models, focusing on semiconducting devices. It's aimed at people familiar with fundamental EE circuit theory, non-linear passive diode devices, and active devices including MOSFET's, FETs', and BJT's. This type of material is really the next level beyond your EE analog devices course(s). If you want to get into the real guts of analog and digital circuit design using passive and active electrical elements, then this book is for you. This whole series of books put out by McGraw Hill, on Electrical Engineering from the 1950's-1970's, provides a very firm basis for the electrical sciences, before the advent of digital circuit simulation tools."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament theology","review":"Walter Kaiser, does an excellent and very convincing job of tying the Old Testament together by showing the consistent, conscious, and continual theology of God's promise throughout the entire Old Testament. When I began reading this book I was skeptical, thinking that Kaiser was going to force the Old Testament into a convenient boxed way of thinking. I was actually hesitant to even read it, not being that interested in its contents. Now I am convinced that the authors of the various Old Testament books consciously understood the progressive revelation and fulfillment of God's promise of which they wrote.I have to say, the first 70 pages will turn off many. In these pages Kaiser sets out to explain the history behind Old Testament theologies and why he believes many fall short and in which ways. Then he sets out to define how his theology of the Old Testament developed and what hermeneutic he uses (a defining difference between Kaiser and many others is his focus on authorial intent and the message's intent within the context it was written). He ends the first part with a summary of the continuity of the blessing of promise throughout the Old Testament. These pages are very heavy reading. You will probably find yourself dozing. If you are really having a hard time with this section, my recommendation: Read chapter 4 of Part 1 and then move on the bulk of the book, Part II (you can always go read part 1 later). I do not think that Part I is superfluous but it is not necessary to understand and appreciate the message of the book.Part II defines the Old Testametn theology in almost 200 pages. The Chapters are as follows:5. Prolegomena to the Promise: Prepatriarchal Era6. Provisions in the Promise: Patriarchal Era7. People of the Promise: Mosaic Era8. Place of the Promise: Premonarchical Era9. King of the Promise: Davidic Era10. Life in the Promise: Sapiential Era11. Day of the Promse: 9th Century12. Servant of the Promise: 8th Century13. Renewal of the Promise: 7th Century14. Kingdom of the Promise: Exilic Prophets15. Triumph of the Promise: Postexilic ProphetsFinally the 3rd chapter is an 8-page summary of this Theology's connection with New Testament Theology. I do wish that this section had been more through, but the message was there.The very thorough indices (by authors, subjects, Scripture referecnes, and Hebrew words) are very helpful to help you use this as a reference after reading it.A book that I was not too excited about reading has now become on of the most used and dog-eared in my library. This book has come to help define my Old Testament theology.-Jacob Hantla"},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament theology","review":"This has to be one of the best written OT theology books written from a conservative and evangelical perspective. Trying to study OT theology from a conservative perspective without reading Kaiser's work is trying to study Calvinism without reading Calvin's \\"Institutes\\". This probably being Kaiser's \\"magnum opus\\" book should be read by all students of OT studies and theology. Kaiser writes from a \\"promise-fulfillment\\" perspective and avoids the excesses of both \\"replacement theology\\" and classical dispensationalism. One of his arguments being that the OT authors had multiple fulfillments in mind when writing about the realization of the promises in the future. Thus, though the great promise will be fulfilled in the Church age to a degree, it will be fulfilled in completeness at the Parousia. The book has a nice flow and organization to it. It goes over all the major periods of OT history (Chapters 5-15) and up to the NT (Chapter 16). The first section of the book (Chapters 1-4) deal with OT theological methodology. Many may find these first four chapters dry and technical, but it is a good introduction to get the reader started. It also includes a bibliography and a full index. The only complaint I have is that the pages are made of beige-coloured paper-back novel paper. I hope in a future edition the publishers will print this book with better quality paper. Overall, though, this book is highly recommended to all students of OT theology."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament theology","review":"This book is a great resource for tying together the Old Testament. It is not, however, light reading. I tried just reading straight through it, but it just wasn't happening. I finally read it taking notes as I went. I ended up with about 40 pages of notes and a new appreciation for Old Testament Theology. (Don't get bogged down by the first few chapters. I think you could even skip them if you want to and either do or don't go back to them later. The only reason I continued after these two boring chapters was that I had to read the book for a class.) I thoroughly recommend that anyone who desires to understand the Old Testament take their time reading this excellent book."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament theology","review":"The first few chapter are tough, but the book uses a diachronic (Kaiser's term) to present the theology. In other words, he shows how each successive time period builds on the previous time periods. The books presents an exciting unity of the Old Testament using the promises and the covenants. The books helps place each O.T. book in its historical context. This book is fundamental in understanding Walter Kaiser's approach to theology or O.T. theology in general."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament theology","review":"This is an incredibly insightful book, tracing and understanding the promise(s) of God down throughout history. He picks up where Willis Beecher left off in his &quot;The Prophets and the Promise&quot;, which I also highly recommend if you can find it, and explains it in a more easy to understand manner. Not an easy read...but well worth the effort. It will insert a fresh view into the Old Testment the next time you read through it."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament theology","review":"I wish that I had a book like this when I was in the active ministry. I am retired now, but love the insight that Dr. Kaiser gives into the unfolding history of the O.T. He ties the books together, as they were intended by the Divine author of Holy Writ."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament theology","review":"This book is NOT light reading. It is very academic, and suitable only to those willing to dedicate ample time for serious study. That said, for people meeting those requirements it is a highly useful tool, well thought-out and researched, with sound logic to substantiate his arguments."},{"Title":"Toward an Old Testament theology","review":"This book was extremely difficult to read, but the information in it is great and useful to anyone who wants to know about the entirety of OT thought."},{"Title":"Henry Darger: In the Realms of the Unreal","review":"I just finished a first trek through this remarkable book. What especially strikes me is the way John MacGregor's writing captures the process of thinking through the enigma of Henry Darger's life and work. Reading the book is like watching a great detective at work--MacGregor writes not as though he's already come to conclusions but as though he's coming to them in the act of writing. And he manages to do so while organizing everything in a number of ways--around Darger's life history, his artistic and technical development, and the increasingly violence depcited in his work. Throughout the book MacGregor makes Henry Darger real--as a deeply damaged child and adult, as a tormented believer in God, as a person of enormous inner resources, and as a creative genius. His ways of accounting for Darger's peculiar obsessions (suffocstion, evisceration, male genitals on girls) are pwerfully persuasive, and draw upon considerable research into the circumstances of Darger's childhood and the nightmarish conditions at the &quot;asylum&quot; in Illinois where Darger spent much of his youuth.I've read MacGregor's earlier book in French, Michael Bonesteel's book, and the American Folk Art Museum book, but this book taught me more about Darger than I could've imagined. If you're new to Darger, it's the book to begin with. If you're already familiar with Darger's work, this is the book you've been waiting for."},{"Title":"Henry Darger: In the Realms of the Unreal","review":"Henry Darger was a lonely old man who lived by himself in a small room in Chicago. He worked as a janitor all his life and went to church several times every day, but he never talked to anyone, so no one even knew how to pronounce his last name. When he died, his landlord went to clean out his room. There he discovered Darger's secret life work - around 300 paintings, and 30,000 pages of writing, including a 15,000-page long novel called \\"In The Realms Of The Unreal.\\"It takes a brave man to spend ten years to research such an obscure figure. Apparently John MacGregor was the only man up to the task. This book is the only comprehensive analysis of Darger's life and art in existence.There's a lot to analyze. Darger's novel describes a horrifically violent world war, fought in an unreal world by the virtuous Catholic nation of Angelinia and the evil atheist nation of Glandelinia. Darger's real life was monotonous and isolated, but his inner life was a war, described every night for sixty-odd years with fanatical devotion. Most of his art depicts destruction. And his main symbol of Christian virtue is seven angelic little girls, whom he loves with suspicious passion. It is unnerving, to say the least.MacGregor attempts to simultaneously describe Darger's life, critically appraise his art, understand his theology, and explore his psychology, while presenting numerous samples of Darger's work. This is the only such attempt ever made, so this book gets a good review almost by default. But I want to point out a few things about Darger's art and MacGregor's treatment of it.MacGregor uses many superlatives to describe Darger, like \\"amazing,\\" \\"astonishing,\\" \\"brilliant,\\" and \\"genius.\\" But when he attempts to discuss Darger's writing in detail, the resulting impression is exactly the opposite. He calls Darger's writing \\"autistic,\\" states (accurately, judging from the samples) that Darger was incapable of creating convincing dialogue and characters, and points out the incoherence of Darger's invented geography. Then sometimes he calls it \\"brilliant\\" in the same breath, and argues that Darger's novel is still very readable and interesting.If it is, MacGregor's chosen samples don't do a lot to show it. Sometimes Darger could describe a sharp image, or affect the tone of an epic poet or a Bible prophet. But it's impossible to know if this is really a sign of creativity, or just a random aberration. In 15,000 pages, one can find evidence to support any interpretation.Even when Darger writes something relatively good, one never knows if he really wrote it, or if he copied it from somewhere. MacGregor shows that Darger frequently borrowed whole passages from other works, like Bunyan's \\"The Pilgrim's Progress.\\" To MacGregor, this is a sign of brilliance. Maybe it is brilliant, for an autistic outsider. But I don't want to patronize Darger in that way, I want to try to approach his art as art first. Unfortunately, such an approach does invite the conclusion that the Realms are basically unreadable.Maybe this is MacGregor's fault. He states, for example, that Darger could occasionally depict more complicated characters, like the honourable enemy general Izner Myletze. If this is true, it speaks in favour of Darger's writing, and is worth discussing. Unfortunately, MacGregor cites only one excerpt from the novel to prove it, and never returns to this issue again.MacGregor suggests that one day, the novel might be published in abridged form, and appreciated by the general public. This seems impossible. There's no way to know what to abridge. The Realms have a dramatic situation, but no plot development. MacGregor himself says that the war remains unresolved until the last page of the novel.The paintings stand up much better. Darger wasn't good at free-hand drawing, so he invented a kind of collage technique, carefully explained by MacGregor, in which he would trace stock human figures from books and magazines, and insert them onto his landscapes as he saw fit. He then coloured them in accordance with his setting, adding military uniforms and weapons. The landscapes themselves were of his own creation.This technique is more impressive than it sounds. As in the novel, nature plays an active role in the paintings. The human figures are often caught under wild, threatening skies. The clouds come in all kinds of shapes, always gigantic, overwhelming the people. Darger's sense of scale makes nature into a colossal force.Even the human figures, plundered from disposable popular sources, are turned entirely to Darger's purpose. Sometimes he can use them to create a feeling of motion, like in the one scene where the Vivian girls are running down a railroad track, pursued by enemy forces. And sometimes he comes up with a striking visual image, like the one on the cover of this book, or the one of the heart of Christ in heaven.Then, of course, there are the violent paintings. There are only about ten of these, but the violence is completely unhinged. The most frightening painting of this sort depicts a massacre in a snowfield, where nature is deathly silent. This is the most distasteful aspect of Darger's art. Though maybe we shouldn't be too quick to call him crazy - isn't Mel Gibson making millions out of basically the same thing?MacGregor argues that Darger was a great artist in his own right, but after reading this book, one feels that Darger can never be recognized. And this is depressing. It makes one think that art is useless. Darger's life-long commitment to his art basically destroyed his life, even as it motivated it. He was a very unhappy man. And although this book makes a powerful impression, when it's over, one is somewhat glad to get outside into the sunshine."},{"Title":"Henry Darger: In the Realms of the Unreal","review":"Darger's voluminous work, of which the drawings are only the tip of the iceberg, are inaccessable, literally, except for fragments published in a previous collection. Even if the full opus was available it would still be a alien monument due to it's sheer size, attracting only the peculiarly curious and those who have aquired the taste for Darger's vision. This said, MacGregor's work is a valuable description by a voyager to a dark continent who is capable of expressing the awe, fear and wonder that he experienced when immersed in this strange land. The book is lush, in design and writing, and each chapter tackles a different aspect of the Darger mystery. I imagine attempting to read all of Darger would cause the odd combination of shock and boredom that de Sade's work elicits, trangressive scenes compulsively written ad nausiam. MacGregor distills the major themes of Henry's work, avoids the mind-numbing repetition, yet preserves the vertigo of scale that Darger achieved, intentionally or otherwise. An odd masterpeice written about an even odder masterpeice."},{"Title":"Henry Darger: In the Realms of the Unreal","review":"For anyone looking to enter the unreal realms of Henry Darger, his writings and his artwork, MacGregor's book is essential. He has both exhaustively researched and reconstructed Darger's life as an isolated, perhaps mentally disturbed individual working as a dishwasher and janitor in Chicago and delved deeply into the often gruesome content of Darger's fantasy realm. The book itself is a wonder - it is like a great independent film, unflinching, provocative, well-constructed."},{"Title":"Henry Darger: In the Realms of the Unreal","review":"The the Henry Darger fan this is a welcome addition to the growing number of books on Darger. It is easily the biggest book in number of pages. The essay is very informative and there are great reproductions not found in other books. This and the Henry Darger: Art and Selected Writings are my 2 favorite Darger books. But beware book collectors, because the book has so many pages (500 plus), the pages start to come loose from the binding. For some reason, the binding just can't hold the pages securely. Maybe that's why the book is a bargain for the number of pages. So you may want to get an extra copy if you're a book collector."},{"Title":"Henry Darger: In the Realms of the Unreal","review":"As fans of The Simpsons should know, \\"Outsider Art\\" is art that is made by a hillbilly, a mental patient, or a chimpanzee. Anyone who is interested in art like this should know about the great Henry Darger. His story is fascinating, heartbreaking, and deeply deeply disturbing, on all levels. The image on the cover of this book is one of the best examples of what Henry Darger is all about. Huge disembodied flame-colored hands hover menacingly over a group of little yellow-haired girls cowering in their beds. One is running away screaming. Another peers up in cool curiousity... Darger's cult of fame is based on the mega-voluminous epic he wrote throughout his solitary life, based on the often incredibly violent adventures of his imaginary \\"heart's darlings\\", The Vivian Girls. Choking and disemboweling were particular obsessions with Darger, and the \\"battle scenes\\" can be very hard to look at. Really, keep this book AWAY FROM KIDS, or they might be scarred for life. I admit I found myself seriously creeped out whilst reading this book alone late one night. But that's Darger! And you'll find just as many images of fanciful , wild, and utter beauty. His use of color is truly skillful, for someone so -- \\"unskilled.\\" Unable to draw, he used a variety of creative techniques to achieve the results he wanted, such as collage, tracing, and color washes. The story of Darger is amazing, and this book gives him the detailed and in-depth treatment he deserves."},{"Title":"Henry Darger: In the Realms of the Unreal","review":"This wonderful edition is a welcome supplement to Jssica Yu's documentary subtitled &#34;The Mystery of Henry Darger.(wher the sketches ate animated!)."},{"Title":"Henry Darger: In the Realms of the Unreal","review":"This is a very cool and interesting person who happened to have a rare gift just now being recognized.

The story of her work and the photographs of Fifi, Flo, Flint, Gremlin, David Greybeard and the rest were so enthralling. Many of those photographs, such as the one of infant Flint watching his mother Flo fish for termites and showing that man is not the only tool-using animal, are collected in &quot;The Chimpanzees I Love: Saving Their World and Ours,&quot; which Goodall uses to introduce her exciting work to a new generation of young readers.When she was a child Jane Goodall decided she wanted to go to the jungles of Africa and study its animals. Today she is one of the most renowned and respected scientists on the planet, having dedicated her life and work to the study of a community of chimpanzees at the Gombe National Park in Tanzania. In this fascinating book Goodall recounts her exciting adventure in making ground-breaking discoveries regarding chimpanzees and their profound similarities to human beings. She also talks about her struggle to protect this endangered species and their vanishing habitats.Most of &quot;The Chimpanzees I Love&quot; looks at the Goodall's study of the generations of these chimpanzees, where we follow individual chimpanzees from babies to adulthood. Goodall provides simple descriptions of her discoveries, and often points out her own mistakes (naming her subjects was not exactly a scientific practice). Chapters are devoted to how she first made contact with and was accepted by the chimpanzees, how they communicate within their community, the relationship between mothers and babies, what a day in the forest is like, and the mind of the chimpanzees. At that point Goodall gets into the plight of the chimpanzees, including a distressing look at their lives in captivity and how they are being sold in markets in Afrcia. All of the proceeds from the sale of this book are donated to support of Goodall's international grassroots educational program, &quot;Roots &amp; Shoots.&quot;&quot;The Chimpanzees I Love&quot; is both informative and inspirational, which is what you expect from Jane Goodall, who is one of the people who truly defined idealism for a lot of young kids in the Sixties. The idea that Flo's daughter Fifi, who was a little infant when Goodall began her studies, is now around forty years old and has had her eighth infant astounds me. But the one I miss is Flint, the first wild chimpanzee whose development was documented from birth through death, who turned out to be as much a child of the Sixties as the rest of us."},{"Title":"Chimpanzees I Love: Saving Their World And Ours (Byron Preiss Book)","review":"beautifully design and illustrated work by a woman who has devoted her life to chimpanzee rescue and understanding...(...)--this is for all children"},{"Title":"Chimpanzees I Love: Saving Their World And Ours (Byron Preiss Book)","review":"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS A BS IN BIOLOGY AND IS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER.

I liked this book a lot and highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it yet"},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"This is definitely one of those books you really can't put down. (I also couldn't get the song Mister Sandman out of my head.) Each character has such distinct personality traits. So bizarre yet so real. The story line flows into each chapter. I would recommend this book to anyone who reads."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"The thing about this book that really caught my attention was the authors amazing ability to write about sex in a very real, uncontrived way.This is not what the book is about though, it is about people's inability to communicate and what impact that has on the family. The characters are sharp and interesting yet dreamy.I found myself unable to put the book down.The ending is a bit tied together, but it is not unsatisfying either.The story will suck in and gently send you back."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"Reminded me of Geek Love by K. Dunn and The World According to Garp by Irving, but loved this book even more! Couldn't put it down--made me laugh and made me wish I could entertain as well as Gowdy can! Full of plot twists and strange yet lovable characters; and the finale is a work of genius. Discovered this gem at a bookstore on small Lopez Island, WA, and can't believe my luck in finding it (often books by unknown writers are a letdown). I'm recommending this book to every fiction reader I know!"},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"This is one of the greatest books I've ever read!

Every member of this family has severe physical and/or emotional and/or psycological problems. Yet, they still enjoy a rich family life that, in many ways, is defined by love, loyalty and devotion. And this fact is the underpining of this book and, probably, society at large. For while they suffer mightily, they do so, largely, together and, in remaining together, forge the bonds that ultimately allow them to survive and, in some ways, flourish.This is a rich, deeply spiritual book in many ways, though the prose can, and often does, take on a coarse, often vulgar character--again, a lot like life itself.In the end, the books is a study of the difference between happiness and contentment in working through the difficulties of life.I heartily recommend the book. One is well warned, however, that at times the coarseness of the manuscript can be unsettling."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"And I thought my family was one for the books!

My company, however, disagreed. And that's the way people react to it. I read it in one huge gulp and promptly read it again. I've given it to friends and recommended it to strangers. My advice: Ignore the blurb on the back (it's tarted-up tripe), ignore the cover, and just jump in. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"This book is painfully good. As a parent of a child with autism, I watched Joan carefully and felt a familiar, sometimes chilling, closeness with her. It ripped at my heart at times but the sheer audacity kept me flying through the pages. Definitely on my gift list for every psychologist I know."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"This is a very modern novel dealing with such topics as reincarnation, homosexuality, promiscuity, unwed motherhood, brain damage and agoraphobia--almost all of which were taboo in the story's timeframe of 1955-74. Like many works of modern art, this book will not appeal to everyone. My complaint was not the subject matter, but the lack of resolution. Many of the themes are begun in an interesting manner and are then dropped as if forgotten. The central character is a genius doll-like child named Joan who comes into the world screaming \\"Oh no, not again!\\" Then, after 18 years of silence as a mute, Joan is finally able to communicate to her entire family their individual best-kept secrets. What the point is, I'm not really sure. Definitely an individual choice in book reading, it might be best to wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"I have not finished reading 'Mister Sandman'and I find myself wondering how it will all end. There is so much that could yet happen to suprise me. It is a strange story indeed and at times I find the peculiarities of the characters almost too preposterous to bother myself with. But the overall texture of the writing holds the book together and there is enough happening for me to carry on wanting more. I find that it goes deep into the recesses of my mind, down into the dark closet where absurd little Joan shuts herself and once I am down there it is perfectly plausible to confuse version with aversion, Al with All, Sonja with Joan (though Joan is much too exquisitely unique) and wanting to come out of it with wanting to stay there."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"I bought &quot;Mister Sandman&quot; on the strength of its cover. A garish mosaic of cartoons of, apparently, the characters who made up a family unit. I thought it'd be a pastiche of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; or something similar. What I got was all of that and much much more. Gowdy systematically dismembers myths of families and of the 50s, that &quot;kinder, gentler age&quot; so many seem to yearn for. We never really know our families, and the past was never really as we remember it. But there is some hope for redemption. &quot;Mister Sandman&quot; is a disturbing, life-affirming triumph."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"Barbara Gowdy, Mister Sandman (HBJ, 1996)Mister Sandman was a Publishers' Weekly Best Book of 1996, and it's easy to see why. Gowdy's third novel (and fourth book) is an engaging look into a world the is both completely warped and so close to the surface of reality that sometimes it's hard to remember that what's on the page is fiction.Mister Sandman is the story of the Canary family, who are your basic everyday family. At least, they would be if life were a David Lynch film. Gordon, the patriarch, is a closet homosexual in a house full of women. (Perhaps it's more odd that he isn't a transvestite than it would be if he were.) His wife Doris is exploring her own enjoyment of the members of the fairer sex. They have three children: Sonja, fat, housebound by choice, and rich from her job as a pin clipper; Marcia, somewhat nymphomaniacal, able to converse with the aphasic; and Joan, dropped on her head as an infant, considered brain-damaged by her doctors and family but actually a genius. Joan, we find out in the first few sentences, is actually Sonja's daughter, but for the sake of propriety (Joan is born in the late fifties), she's passed off as one of Gordon and Doris'.The book looks at the life of the family, mostly as it relates to Joan, but also in other snatches at various times in their lives (Sonja's seduction by Joan's father, Gordon's lovesickness over a redheaded plumber, etc.). Joan's inability to speak and propensity to spend her time in small dark places makes her the perfect confessor, and we spend our time snickering at the revisions the pentitents make when they get to the alter. Joan, though, is a bit too smart for them, as the book spends its time making clear. How she ends up making it clear is truly a beautiful scene, and quite worthy of the accolades from PW. I don't think it would be too much of a plot spoiler to say that the book's climax takes on Biblical proportions.Gowdy's reputation in America didn't start growing until the novel after this, The White Bone. Thus, some Americans who are already familiar with her may have missed this little gem, I urge you to take a step back and give it a look. Those unfamiliar with Gowdy who like their family sagas more insane than dysfunctional are sure to get a kick out of it. Highly recommended. ****"},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"This is an amazing book! I have read it at least six times. The characters are so strange and bizare but yet so real and human. I could not put this book down. The most facinating chapter is the one that describes how Joan, a mute savant, sees the world. Prepare yourself, it's a strange tale but well worth the read!"},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"I was suggested this book by Amazon's recommendations engine and then was convinced by all the 5 star reviews to add it to my wish-list. So then I got if for Christmas and finally got to it a couple weeks ago.I wouldn't call it a waste of time. There are some very funny parts (mostly in the beginning and the end) and it's definitely unique. But... the story didn't really hold together well for me. It was more like a bunch of short stories set in the same place, as Gowdy takes one character at a time and exposes their strange (though I'm sure more common than most people think) lives. I wasn't disturbed by the amount of sexual material in the book but anyone that thinks this book is about some cute, angelic child should definitely beware.Another reviewer mentioned purpose and resolution. I would have to agree, the ending didn't really explain much or give you any idea about the future of the family members. I don't think there really was a point Gowdy was trying to get across, unless it was &quot;life is stranger than it looks at a glance&quot;."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"I first came upon this book when I had the pleasure of hearing Ms. Gowdy speak. Two paragraphs in to her reading, I knew this was a novel of extraordinary humour ... and delicious weirdness. The Canary family is odd - Mom's an actress, Dad can't bear to come out of the closet, the eldest daughter bobby pins her way to emotional strength and independence, the younger daughter is too smart to survive her family with her sanity entirely intact and Joan (the baby) is, well, unusual. Joan however becomes the lynchpin to keeping this family together and, at the same time, giving all of her family members a chance at independence.Barbara Gowdy is a master of the weird. This is a book that I handed to 15 people and they either swallowed it whole - often finishing it in one orgy of late night reading - or gave up sometime after Mom's escapade with &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;. (You'll have to read it.) Give it a shot - it'll be painless. Trust me.Mary Henricksen (threescr@istar.ca) Vancouver, Canada"},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"In this beautifully written novel, the reader is introduced to each member of the Canary family. Early on it becomes clear that a great deal of how this unconventional family functions is through deceit. At first, it seems like this is a family doomed to destruction and angst. Afterall, the truth can only be buried so long. And, don't most contemporary novels featuring highly dysfunctional families end sadly?Happily, in \\"Mister Sandman\\", what ultimately shines through each character's obvious flaws is a genuine love, protection and devotion to each other that is endearing and comical. Joan, the family's ethereal and mute youngest member, becomes the sounding board to whom the rest of the family divulges their secrets. She is a silent observer, a gravitational force that pulls the family inward and keeps it together. Later, she is also the catalyst for moving everyone together towards greater honesty with themselves and each other.In Nancy Pearl's \\"BookLust\\", \\"Mister Sandman\\" is recommended as a \\"Coming Out\\" novel. Gowdy's story is indeed frankly sexual. But whatever a reader's comfort level with honest sexuality, I have seldom read a book with stronger characterizations, whose every sentence - nee, every word - is purposeful, thoughtful, and necessary to the story.Though this is a family inherently averse to truth, it is their duplicity that gives them authentic dimensionality. While their dishonesty is never overtly approved of, neither is it the means to the Canary's destruction.\\"Mister Sandman\\" reminds me of John Irving's early books minus the angst. I definitely want to read more of Gowdy's books. I recently purchased \\"The White Bone\\", a story told from the perspective of an elephant. With such far-reaching literary abilities, Gowdy deserves to become better-known in the United States.\\"Mister Sandman\\" was an absolute pleasure to read. Despite such a vastly odd cast of characters and strange family mix, this is an uplifting story of a family whose devotion to each other rises above everything else.\\"They could be a family spending a day at the beach together. If they were on a beach. If it was day.\\""},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"This book is fantastically quirky in a way which blends familial strangeness, hilarity, and utter human empathy to create a mini-masterpiece of many fabulous characters, their loves, secrets, lies, and travails. There are few books I find myself returning to my bookshelves to read each year, and this one is among the few. It never ceases to entertain me! If you enjoy quirky seriocomedy, pick this up!"},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"Gowdy has quite an imagination. This is the most dysfunctional family I've read about (right up there with &quot;Fall on Your Knees&quot;). There is homosexuality, promiscuity, lies, secrets, and the silent Joan, who is the youngest daughter, thought to be brain damaged but extremely intelligent, and aware of her families betrayals in her own way.I am still trying to decide if I liked this book. The characters were interesting and they did draw my interest. But the story is way out there...certainly not a mainstream read. Gowdy's style confused me a bit at first by changing timelines often, and once that settled down I could follow the plot much easier.An interesting and somewhat shocking read...not sure that I would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"Barbara Gowdy's Mister Sandman is a wonderful find. It is amazing to discover how much fun and quirky the book and the characters are and, yet, somehow the writing always reaches deeper just when the reader does not expect it. The book creates emotion out of chaos and pieces together a novel of the heart that a lesser writer would have made straight forward and senimental. The author has simply made it strange turning into unusual turning into delightful turning into moving and then coming back again. These are characters that are hard to forget, particulary the baby Joan, a truly unique creation. It is great to find a Canadian author of such talent."},{"Title":"Mister Sandman (Harvest Book)","review":"This is an amazing book!

Or it might be called a biography of the spirit of America.In AMERICA, a poet's intuition has sensed the mystical ebb and flow of human thought and yearnings which were the moving factors behind the Jamestown experiment, behind Valley Forge, behind John Brown at Harper's Ferry, behind the great westward migration.Superficial statistics form the major part of most histories: How many miles did Stonewall Jackson's foot cavalry march around the swamp at Chancellorsville? What was James G. Blaine's popular vote? What was the value in pounds sterling of the cargo dumped overboard at the Boston Tea Party? Not this one -- for what, after all, is the metric weight of a crushed dream? And what is the price of freedom per cubic foot?You will find here the underlying spiritual and economic and political forces upon which are builded the statistics of formal history. You will find these precious elements which have nurtured democracy and made America great.AMERICA, then, is the essence of United States history, caught and dustilled by a poet's insight and written by one of the greatest masters of modern literature.AMERICA is an inspiration and a reassurance in these times that try men's souls.It is a reassurance that democracy is a hardy tree which has survived drought and frost and hurrican in the past and that if we, its keepers, nurture it as our forefathers nurtured it with their blood, it will continue to grow and shelter us and our posterity."},{"Title":"Valley of the Amazons","review":"I read this book years ago and once again more recently. It is hilarious, just flat out funny -- especially so for any woman who survived the uptight politcally correct stages that feminism and lesbian feminism went through. Those happy days when feminists didn't want to associate with lesbians, when lesbians picketed drag queens and every body spent way too much energy criticizing everyone else's lack of activism. Not only does Valley of the Amazons shine a spotlight on the (in hindsight) ludicrous PC wars, it makes room for a tentative romantic entanglement that takes a shy lesbian through all the stages of coming out. The sequel, Who Was That Masked Woman? is worth a read, but not nearly as good as this one."},{"Title":"INSIDE THE HURRICANE: FACE TO FACE WITH NATURE'S DEADLIEST STORMS","review":"&quot;Inside the Hurricane&quot; is far more interesting than several other recent weather books (the horrid &quot;Tying down the Wind&quot; and the ho-hum &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;). Author Pete Davies provides an exccelent account of Hurricanes Mitch and Floyd and the horrendous damage they wrought. He also sounds a dire warning about the near certainty that the Gulf or East Coasts of the U.S. will someday experience a catastrophe of epic proportions. Imagine, writes the author, if Mitch had followed the same storm track as Hurricane Irene, a Catagory 1 storm that deluged Miami not long after Floyd made headlines.A lion's share of author Pete Davies's narrative involves the stories of the forecasters and storm chasers who track these meteorlogical beasts. And while their stories are somtimes interesting, they don't have the same power as the descriptions of the hurricaines themselves. Overall however, &quot;Inside the Hurricane&quot; is a decent book for weather-philes."},{"Title":"INSIDE THE HURRICANE: FACE TO FACE WITH NATURE'S DEADLIEST STORMS","review":"&quot;Inside the Hurricane: Face to Face With Nature's Deadliest Storms&quot;, is worthwhile for anyone interested in learning more about hurricanes. This book concentrates on following the 1999 hurricane season, with an examination of the horror inflicted by 1998's Category 5 Hurricane Mitch, which killed at least 9,000 people in Central America. The author gives a riveting account of the power of Mitch, telling of its absolute devastion to the nation of Honduras.The author concentrates on the Hurricane Research Division (HRD), the scientists who try to learn more on these powerful storms, and who fly into them for first-hand scientific observation,and the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the people responsible for making the forecasts as to where these dangerous storms will go. This is interesting stuff, especially when the scientists fly into the storms.Unfortunately, it seems that that the author simply took info off his tape recorder and stuck it into the book, beacause a lot of the heavy science conversations which are included in this book do not have enough explanation or context.This book is also hindered by certain editorial decisions. This book suffers from the lack of maps showing the tracks of the hurricanes the author discusses, especially because the author spends a great deal of time discussing the meandering nature of the hurricanes.The book also contains some minor errors, some of which can be chalked up to the author not being a native American (e.g., describing as one of the highest points in Florida as &quot;Disney's Magic Mountain&quot;, when everyone knows that he meant Disney's Space Mountain.) While these minor errors do not really detract from this book, and the above-average number of typos is not much of a problem, the real problem comes from the feel that there are times when this author does not go into needed detail. For example, the author talks about the rapid intensification of Hurricanes Opal and Camille, but while the author examined the rapid intensification of Opal, he made no such prior mention of Camille.The author fails to provide detail in other areas. While expalantions are provided for some criticism of the media, we really don't know why the huuricane jocks at HRD are so critical of the Weather Channel's staff, especially weatherman Jim Cantori. This book has a slap-dash feel.However, the descriptions of the hurricanes themselves surpass the author's limitations in other areas of writing. As a native of New Orleans, I've seen my share of hurricanes. One of my earliest memories is of Hurricane Betsy. I lost family in Hurricane Camille. I was one of the tens of thousands of people who evacuted, with my family, from 1998's Hurricane Georges, which was a near miss. I've done research on hurricanes for school, so I have a bit more scientific and personal knowledge than the general public. There are flaws in this book, but the postives far out weigh the negatives.The author has not written the perfect book on hurricanes, but he is to be commended for spelling out the dangers these massive storms pose, for pointing out the lack of funding which goes into hurricane research, and for his skill in relating the tragedy which is inflicted on hurricane victims, especially the devastation of Hounduras."},{"Title":"INSIDE THE HURRICANE: FACE TO FACE WITH NATURE'S DEADLIEST STORMS","review":"Pete Davies spent the 1999 hurricane season with the scientists of the National Hurricane Center in Miami as they studied a series of fascinating and intense hurricanes and struggled with budget limitations that are, in these times of surplus, increasingly inane and unforgivable. Davies' writing is vivid and gripping; his descriptions of the devastation of Hurricane Mitch and the experience of people in the midst of the storm are absolutely unforgettable. Davies also flew missions with the NOAA's P-3 hurricane hunter aircraft and gives a good feel for the combination of raw excitement, pure terror, and occasional boredom of these epic flights. One thing missing from the book were any charts, maps, or diagrams; an appendix containing the Saffir-Simpson scale would have been nice. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in hurricanes, which should be anyone who lives in the United States. Even if your state is out of the reach of hurricane damage (and few actually are), the devastation caused by these vast and increasingly dangerous storms can cause economic disaster and human suffering on a scale not exceeded by any other natural disaster. And after reading, contact your congressional representatives and express to them your dismay that funding for important research remains at pittance levels. Too often Americans brainlessly run around chanting &quot;We're Number One!&quot; when what is really needed is a good long look at how money is spent in this country and who truly benefits from government funding."},{"Title":"INSIDE THE HURRICANE: FACE TO FACE WITH NATURE'S DEADLIEST STORMS","review":"This book was really well written, but i expected stories about people riding out hurricanes, not research flights.

The story surrounds a man &quot;Bracken&quot; whom is faced with many choices about life, friends, and his religion. Hold in mind this story does not take place in our reality or world, but one very similar. Although at times Bracken's arrogance and indecision was irritating his journey of learning through his mistakes was quite compelling. The book is colorfully written and gives the reader a good image of the world of Ebbern. The end was a bit too fast, but served the purpose of explaining what happened. Great book if your looking for a short book with a warped kind of reality."},{"Title":"Small-Time Operator: The Software/Book & Disk","review":"First of all, this is NOT the original (and famous) Small Time Operator, which is a great small business guidebook. This is a CD (and instruction manual) that will set you up with a very easy-to-use set of business ledgers, identical to the ledgers described in the original Small Time Operator (which does not include a CD). This CD creates ledgers on a spreadsheet program. It works with Excel (part of Microsoft Office and Microsoft Works) and Lotus 1-2-3. If you find complicated programs such as QuickBooks frustrating, I think you'll love these simple spreadsheets. There is no \\"learning curve.\\" You open Excel (or Lotus), pop in the disk, click on the ledger you want (income, expenses, inventory, etc.) and type in your numbers. That's it: Instant ledger, that you can save on your computer or print out. The disk includes 23 ledgers and worksheets. The manual includes instructions how to use the disk (which are about as easy as I described above), shows samples of all the ledgers, explains how to use business ledgers."},{"Title":"Small-Time Operator: The Software/Book & Disk","review":"'Small-Time Operator' is a very good book for the new small business owner, with many anecdotes from other business owners, and a thorough discussion of sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations, the tax laws applicable, and other bookkeeping/finance fundamentals.The early chapters on how to choose a business, dos and don'ts, is not (as I see it) as informative, so don't get the book for that reason. Read it for the (very useful) information on the nuts and bolts of running your business successfully.I think there might be a later edition (1995?) that will be more topical."},{"Title":"Clarinet Method for Beginners","review":"This book is of a good help specially for young players and beginners, giving pictures of positions and explainig rythms and dynamics, but it's very simple for a more experienced player.

(I don't know too many people who appreciate being pointed out how dumb they are weekly.) Then someone who appears to have nothing better to do than solve C++ puzzles jumps in with a 6 page submission on how to solve the problem, which is usually wrong. Then six more self appointed guru's jump in and fill pages of discussion, Then after filling my head with all the wrong answers to a particular problem, Herb smuggly answers the question with the real answer. Anoints another guru and the process repeats. In the meantime I've lost total interest in the discussion. Thank you for Deja news where I can read the first and last postings(The puzzle and the solution).That said, this book is full of those got ya! puzzles. Fortunately Herb is a kind writer and you don't feel too dumb when he points out why a particular puzzle has a problem and what it is. And like Deja news you can skip all the wrong answers, arguments about the arcane and get right to the meat of the problem. Herb also got a chance to make the puzzles more clear, where the language of the original puzzle confused the issue unnecessarily.The best reason to buy this book is that its the only published text so far on how to use C++ Exceptions. There are some articles in C++ Report but not many on the traps and pitfalls of their usage. Stroustrup's book &quot;C++ Programming Language&quot; tells you how the mechanism works, and makes some suggestions. Herb tells you what it will cost you if you don't use them, only partially use them, or totally abuse them. And he shows you how a minor misuse can make you have major problems.I can see why Scott Meyers likes this book. Its just like his books, &quot;Effective C++&quot; series only the format is not in a lecture topic but in a question/puzzle answer format. I prefer the Meyer's approach but you can still glean the necessary information, and while you are reading the answers to the puzzles, say to yourself &quot;Yeah I knew that!&quot;One other reason to buy this book, you can use these puzzles as tests for interviews. First, it will help you know the skill level of the applicant, Second it will teach you something you probably should have known anyway, Thirdly if they get the answers right off it will tell you that the applicants at least read the texts and are trying to stay on top of things. This is not to say you should make applicants take an all day C++ grammer test but by asking a few puzzle questions you can see how they react under a bit of pressure. After all at some point everyone comes up against a problem they haven't seen."},{"Title":"Exceptional C++: 47 Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions","review":"I've been programming in C++ for 12 years, and this is the first C++ book I've read in awhile that I learned significantly from. The section on exception safety is unmatched in any book or article I've ever read. The style and format of this book make it easy to read, even though some of the concepts it covers are very advanced. After you read this book, put it somewhere handy, because I guarantee you will refer to it often as you go back and fix your code to take into account all the new things the book teaches you."},{"Title":"Exceptional C++: 47 Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions","review":"In learning computing, the most prized element is a relevant problem with a detailed, understandable solution. Many studies have indicated that the skills gap between those who program adequately and those who are exceptional is enormous. Unlike some other areas, the gurus of computing are more often than not quite willing to share their expertise with others.This collection of problems, derived from the C++ Guru of the Week newsgroup, collectively form one of the most valuable sources of real insight into the language.C++ is often criticized as being a language that is full of potential problems of the &quot;gotcha&quot; variety. A &quot;gotcha&quot; problem is one where a seemingly logical choice can lead to a disaster. Many of these problems can be placed in that category, but to focus on that would miss much of what they can teach you.The most significant point of the problems is that they teach you how to program many complex tasks in a manner that is truly safe from potential errors. All of the problems are tagged with a level of difficulty, although like most people, I consider that to be of dubious benefit, as there is an enormous difference in what programmers find difficult. In my opinion, the most valuable section of the book is the ten parts dealing with the creation of exception-safe code. While some do have trouble with it, most people find it easy to understand the fundamentals of what exceptions are. However, writing code that is safe from the unexpected consequences of a thrown exception is a decidedly non-trivial problem. Especially when the new and delete operators can throw an exception. The sections that deal with making new and delete exception-safe alone justify the purchase of the book.When asked questions as to how they managed to reach their guru status, a common response is that they simply use coded solutions written by others that are known to be correct. If that were all it took to reach the level of guru, then this book would be a significant rung on the ladder to that pinnacle."},{"Title":"Exceptional C++: 47 Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions","review":"Gosh, this is a nice book.It is based on Herb's &quot;Guru of the Week&quot; column in the comp.lang.c++.moderated Usenet forum: nontrivial C++ issues presented as questions around one or a few code fragments. The electronic column was popular from its inception, but the book raises the quality of the discussion to new heights.A fair number of problems covering a very diverse range of topics (physical code organization, exception safety, const correctness, etc.) are treated in much depth. The focus appears to be mainly on pitfalls to avoid, and how to avoid them, though various creative C++ programming techniques are also taught. As a result, the book contains many &quot;recommended practices&quot;, that are nicely emphasized using boxes and icons.The discussion is generally up to date with the C++ standard, and some fluency in C++ is required to get the most out of this book. However, the details of how things work are expounded with sufficient detail and clarity that you don't need to be a &quot;Guru of a Week&quot; to understand the issues in their entirety.Despite the considerable breadth and depth of the volume, it weighs in at only about 200 pages: a welcome break from the giant C++ tutorials (this is not a tutorial, mind you!). Herb's technical writing style is lucid, and the typography/layout is actually attractive."},{"Title":"Exceptional C++: 47 Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions","review":"Herb Sutter is well known in the C++ programming community for his attention to detail, sound software engineering principles and solid coding techniques. This book gather together in one place an extension of his &quot;Guru of the Week&quot; work that has appeared in comp.lang.c++.moderated for the past few years.What leaped out to me while he did the &quot;guru's&quot; all these years is how much thought he put into them. Now imagine that he revisits them for an additional sharpening! Furthermore, he writes clearly, consisely, and to the point.Herb's writing skill and C++ knowledge, combo'd with C++'s maturity, is really having your cake and eating it too. Programming/design/etc., in/with any language is hard, complex, and challenging. There is no place for haste and never a substitute for thinking. Sutters slaps this in our faces, as a needed wake up call.It is rare for me to recommend a book. But &quot;Exceptional C++&quot; challenges your problem solving skills to a new dimension. This is not just the kind of book that I label &quot;industrial strength&quot;, but it's what I call an &quot;expert book&quot;, a book I've been waiting for since 1985! Yipee!Get ready for many plainly stated guidelines, insights, portability issues, techniques, and coding idioms. It's easy to see &quot;Exceptional C++&quot; becoming a new classic as it covers topics such as exception handling, templates, class design, inheritance, and memory management. It's all there."},{"Title":"Exceptional C++: 47 Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions","review":"This is by far one of the best books on C++ I've ever bought. I am not going to claim that I've read this because this is not a book you 'read' before going to sleep. Even if you consider yourself a C++ guru, you really need to go spend a lot of time on each exercise - if you want to ace them, that's it.If you aren't a C++ expert but at least can find your way, make sure you have Stroustroup's on your table when you get to this. Try to answer every question on this book with the help of Stroustroup's. You will learn *a lot* from the experience, and have a lot of fun, too. Also, if you run everything you do by your compiler, you will find compiler bugs, which for me is a plus because saves time in the long run.As for the exercises themselves, all of them, without exception, are worth every penny. Not a single one has an obvious answer (a perfect one - sure you can give some decent if you know C++ well), and from all of them you will learn something valuable.Finally, a quick list of the topics, since Amazon.com doesn't have one online at this time:Generic Programming and the C++ Standard Library. Exception-Safety Issues and Techniques. Class Design and Inheritance. Compiler Firewalls and the Pimpl Idiom. Name Lookup, Namespaces and the Interface Principle. Memory Management.

Miscellaneous Topic.Each of the topic has 4-7 subtopics, each of them with a few exercises.Don't miss this book."},{"Title":"Exceptional C++: 47 Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions","review":"This book is a very valuable addition to any intermediate or advanced C++ programmer's library. The organization is similar to Scott Meyers' very good &quot;Effective C++&quot; books in that they are organized into brief &quot;items&quot; dealing with specific problems that C++ software developers face. The items are helpfully grouped into sections on generic programming and the C++ standard library, exception safety, memory management, etc. Beyond that its hard to compare this book with Meyers' books; they are complementary in many ways. But I think the &quot;Exceptional C++&quot; books have some advantages over Meyers' books: Each of the items begin with a puzzle to solve. This gets the reader more actively involved in the subject matter and brings it into sharper focus (Meyers tends to lose your focus by rambling a bit). Once you've had a chance to think about the presented problem, there is a clear and concise explanation of both the problem and a well considered solution. Each explanation is highlighted by concise &quot;guidelines&quot; and &quot;common mistake&quot; statements. (I wish these were summarized and indexed in one place for quick reference.) The emphasis is on writing clear, simple, reliable code; not on clever solutions to tricky problems. This book is a distillation of discussions that took place in the &quot;Guru of the Week&quot; Internet forum and so is a product of the thinking and experience of many exceptional minds. &quot;Exceptional C++&quot; will help any serious C++ programmer toward better code design.

Some solutions are not an easy read (although the author has succeeded in making the book reasonably entertaining), but digging through them is a very satisfying experience. In the hierarchy of the quality C++ reading, this book will find its place next to Sroustrup's &quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot; and Scott Meyers' books.The book is NOT for a C++ novice, but rather for a mature developer who strives to excel in C++ design and coding styles. It focuses on the complexities and subtleties of using template libraries, C++ language itself, and the elements of good design.The book is written in the problem-solution style to illustrate many of not so obvious questions.

If you have the Meyers books down cold, this is the next stop in your C++ journey. This book is in a similar format to the Meyers books with sections and items; however, Sutter takes a different approach. He presents you with a C++ puzzle at the beginning of the item. You have a chance to come up with your answer and then compare it to the author's. Some of the items make up a logical series, but beyond that they can be read in any order.As for the content, this is good stuff. My favorite is Item 21 on Overriding Virtual Functions. The contrast that Sutter reveals between the static binding of default parameters versus dynamic binding of virtual functions shows how you can get yourself in trouble and write code that is truly unfriendly. Other items deal with using the STL, exception safety, compilers, namespaces, and much more.I don't recommend trying to read this in one sitting unless you are on the same level as Meyers, Coplien, or Stroustrup.

Not only that, experienced readers will detect a sene of 'cutting corners' in some subject in the book. For example, when it offers tips on how to write 'execption-safe' and 'exception nueutral', it cited problems raised by Cargill's \\"Exception handling: a false sense...', it did not bother to state what the problems are before going into offering tips to solve the problems. All the things the book talks about, are simply a repeat of materials found in books written previously by the 'masters' such as 'Design Patterns' by gang of four, C++ Template by Josutis, and 'the C++ Programming language' by Stroustrup but in a unprofessional writing style suitable only for 'for Dummies' category. If you are a beginner in C++, then this may have some value in that it gives a sense of what you may face in c++ programming but if you have some years in C++ programming with real projects then this book is a waiste of time - in my opinion.

It's pure C++ puzzle set, there are NO &quot;Programming Problems&quot; as such (like in &quot;how do we store a tree in memory more efficiently&quot;).Don't take me wrong though, I don't mean puzzle = useless time wasting thing that you do while resting. It's more of a phylosophical puzzles, like &quot;Why is a sky ?&quot; that make you actually think.The book is dedicated to C++ semantics. Granted, C++ is on the complex side of the language scale, so there is a lot of non-obvious questions you can spend a week scratching your head over.

What is similar is that topics are divided in 47 small items of few pages each. The difference is that the author first ask questions to the readers or propose exercises and encourage the reader to put down the book and to take the time to think about the problem and then come back to read his answer. This format is more or less original as I have seen something similar in Tom CargillC++ Programming Style (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)book.I have read this book pretty fast which is a good sign of my interest in a book but in the same time this book did not leave me a strong impression that will make me remember this reading for a long time. It is hard for me to say exactly why but I think that it is because most items focuses on very small details of C++. Some of these problems are very hard and probably is an indication that the book targeted audience is advanced C++ users which is not a bad thing by itself but I am not convinced that mastering these small details actually has a high impact on someone programming skills. It is probably just a matter of topic choices as I really appreciate much more the sequel than this book.My review will probably not affect your decision to read or not this book.

Its language and presentation of material is exemplary. I learned a lot from this book and suggest to anyone to leverage his/her knowledge."},{"Title":"Exceptional C++: 47 Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions","review":"Herb Sutter's \\"Exceptional C++\\" is the first part of a popular trilogy which has its roots in the \\"Guru of the Week\\" newsgroup series. It explicitly assumes that the reader already knows a lot about C++ and is therefore not as pedagogically oriented as Scott Meyers' \\"Effective C++\\".The Good: it's refreshing to see each Item given in quiz format, especially if you've already read 3-4 short-essay C++ advice books (anyone considering \\"Exceptional C++\\" should at a minimum first read Meyers' \\"Effective C++, Third Edition\\"). Another factor that makes this book pleasant to read is the laid-back writing style. For example, when discussing a confusing piece of code Sutter says in a footnote: \\"the programmer of Derived ought to be taken out into the back parking lot and yelled at.\\" (Item 21); similarly, when he first introduces the pimpl pointer he adds \\"//MYOB\\" (Item 23). Moving on to the themes covered, it should be noted that the book's title is mainly a pun: Sutter includes substantive material on a variety of topics, most notably on containment versus inheritance, the pimpl idiom, and name lookup. At a more fine-grained level, this book contains lots of fascinating tidbits of information. A few examples: a) publicly inheriting from char_traits&lt;char> does not necessarily violate the Liskov Substitution Principle (Item 3), b) private inheritance does not need to keep us from using a derived object polymorphically as a base -- inside the derived object's own member functions and friends (Item 24), c) when calling a function inside a class, if the compiler finds a member it won't bother trying to use Koenig lookup to find free functions (Item 32), d) many of the counter-intuitive aspects of auto_ptr's interplay with change of ownership can be eliminated simply by using const auto_ptr (Item 37) -- of course, in this day and age it's better to avoid auto_ptr altogether, e) comparing pointers into string literals is undefined, so compilers are allowed to store string literals in overlapping areas of memory as a space optimization (Item 38), f) finally, we cannot use static_cast to go from char* to unsigned char* (Item 44). Despite the breadth of the material, there's no denying that one of the finest aspects of this volume is the 10-part miniseries on designing generic containers that are exception-safe (work properly in the presence of exceptions) and exception-neutral (propagate all exceptions to the caller). Regarding the style of the presentation, it's worth noting that certain Items end with a Summary of the lessons learned: this is very helpful when picking up the book months after having finished it. The same goes for many of the guideline boxes that the author has included. Some of these are very good reference material, e.g. the guideline in Item 20 on making an operator a member versus a nonmember function. This box in some senses typifies Sutter's writing: not always easy to read, but well structured and authoritative.The Bad: in many cases the Item titles are completely uninformative (e.g. \\"Writing Exception-Safe Code -- Part 7\\"). On a different note, the writing is often not page-setting aware: Sutter reproduces code or text that we can still see on the facing page (e.g. pp. 4 & 5) or even on the same page (p. 22). The space wasted on duplicating things we can already see might have been dedicated to a few more clarifications (e.g. the return value optimization is mentioned in Items 10 & 46 but is never explained). A similar issue arises when Sutter flat-out repeats material already shown in a previous Item (e.g. Items 31 & 32). A related point is that some of the guideline boxes are too abstract: they tend to generalize the lesson learned and therefore make sense only when you read the entire Item. As a result, different Items sometimes have identical guidelines. This has two unwanted consequences: i) it essentially wastes space that could have been put to better use (as above), and ii) it interferes with skimming, since some of the guidelines are simply too vague to constitute a tangible lesson (e.g. \\"Know about and use design patterns.\\", Item 23). In connection to the latter point, let me note that Sutter (or maybe Alexandrescu) did a better job in the \\"Summary of Summaries\\" contained in \\"C++ Coding Standards\\". At a more detailed level, I also spotted a few more specific (minor) problems: a) in Item 5 the author uses O (that's uppercase O) to denote a template type parameter, a bad practice if ever there was one. b) In Item 23 we read: \\"you can get fancy and make method a nonclass template parameter instead.\\" However, \\"nonclass template parameter\\" is not a C++ term. Perhaps Sutter wanted to say \\"non-type template parameter\\" but that wouldn't make sense either, since in the code he shows a type template parameter. c) Item 33 violates Item 23's guideline to prefer the Template Method pattern over public virtual functions. d) Item 44's guideline says \\"Prefer new-style casts\\" but Item 5 uses old-style casts. e) Item 43 first recommends const pass-by-value in a function definition and then criticizes a function definition with const pass-by-value by saying that this is \\"unuseful and misleading at best.\\" f) Finally, in Item 21 Sutter writes: \\"Some authors even argue that 'void main()' might be standard-conforming. It isn't. It never was, not even in the 1970s, in the original pre-standard C.\\" The problem is, \\"int main()\\" wasn't standard-conforming either in those bygone times (nothing was).Sutter will probably produce a second edition of this book in the not too distant future. Even so, this doesn't mean that the book is out of date: many Items could be re-written in C++11, but most will stand you in good stead for many years to come (a glaring exception being Item 37 on auto_ptr) and would probably help you understand the C++11 simplifications more deeply. Overall, this book is a classic whose author is extremely knowledgeable in all things C++, so it's definitely worth reading. However, despite having been first published more than a decade ago, it does suffer from some presentation issues and minor inconsistencies, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars.Alex Gezerlis"},{"Title":"Exceptional C++: 47 Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions","review":"There seems to be a bit of confusion about what level this book is at. Based on some of the reviews I've read, I was a bit concerned that much of this book would fly right over my head, exploring advanced and obscure features. So let's get one thing straight: this is pitched at the same level as Effective C++, and has a similar structure and style.And it's not just a 'puzzle' book - although it does highlight some tricky issues to do with templates and name lookup, which might conceivably appear in an unimaginative job interview.And it's not just about the language feature of exceptions. All aspects of the language are covered, but the section on exceptions is particularly good.Nor is it 'advanced' in the sense that many practitioners of C++ would consider, e.g. template metaprogramming, or non-portable hacks that take advantage of memory layout of compilers. Instead this is advice at an intermediate level, assuming you know the syntax and purpose of C++, but exploring their most appropriate use.The structure of the book does involve a series of posed questions, but they differ wildly in how specific or general they are. You can see them more as a rhetorical device to frame the subsequent discussion, rather than questions you must answer (unless you want to retrospectively crown yourself guru of the week, of course).Each question is followed by a significant discussion of a particular language feature, and summarised advice and recommended principles. Therefore the book is similar in structure to Effective C++. There is some overlap between the books, although even where similar material is included, there is differences in how much detail is given.To some extent, this book is a victim of its own success. A lot of the advice given here can now be found in other books.

One is technical--how to write correct, efficient programs; the other is style--how to write easy to understand, easy to maintain and well-structured and, if possible, elegant and aesthetically appealing code.Unless absolute performance is critical(as in system programming), I think style is often more important than technical. And in the real world, in the application programming realm, a programmer only encounters a non-trivial and highly technical situation once in a blue moon.Beginner programmers often lack the panorama view of what programming is all about and woo the books that emphasize the technical aspects of programming, because that is all they know.This book (and also its sequel) is, however, only emphasizing the technical parts of programming, which is fine.

A biography of James Wilson was certainly overdue by 1997. Hall does shed light on Wilson's unique epistomology and how he integrated it into the liberal and republican ideology of the time. Indeed, Hall demonstrates how Wilson's belief in a \\"moral sense\\" that existed in all human beings necessitated an optimism toward popular rule, an optimism that surpassed that of many of the other Founders by the late 1780s.Nonetheless, this work has numerous unforgivable mistakes. Hall over-emphasizes Wilson's democratic tendencies, going so far as to actually call him a democrat -- a title that Wilson would have abhored as much as aristocrat. Hall notes Wilson's belief that majoritarian government had to have its power checked, but this aspect of Wilson's ideology he gives slight attention to. He makes a disengenuous argument that Wilson believed that balance of power was needed to check corruption rather than the democracy. This distinction is hollow. To believe that democratic government needs to be limited is equivalent to believing that democratic rule needs to be checked. The truth is that though Wilson did believe that the people could be trusted more than did the other Founders, he also believed in limiting popular power. Wilson disagreed at many points how these checks ought to be achieved and to what degree they were to be implimented. But the same can be said for most of the Founders. Wilson is better classified along with the majority of the other Founders as a republican and a liberal -- a republican willing to allow the people a slightly greater role in authority, but a republican nonetheless, not a democrat.Hall also over-emphasizes Wilson's role in developing the governmental ideology of the new republic. Likewise he often underestimates the activity of others. This work also fails to place Wilson's ideas in the context of broader, external, intellectual activity, therefore giving the reader the impression that he originated more than he did. Finally, this author fails to chart Wilson's intellectual development. There seems to be an assumption that what Wilson believed in 1789 was what he believed in 1768 soon after he arrived in America.This is a book that I wanted to like and it does have some redeeming value, but ultimately it is too flawed to allow any more than a single star. I will be looking for a new biography of Wilson, soon."},{"Title":"THE COMMON LAW.","review":"To anyone that is interested in \\"The Common Law\\" and I mean the Common Law of England, this book is an outrageous misrepresentation of its contents. First of all, the book is a photostatic copy of a 1911 MORONIC romance novel. The publisher has chosen to publish it with pictures of law books on the cover. Since this book has nothing to do with the law, it can only be interpreted as an intentional marketing misrepresentation. If this is not outrageous enough, the book has approximately 40 or more pages of text that is completely unreadable. It is a steaming pile! I immediately contacted the distributor and told them that if they did not immeidately refund my money I would crucify them and they will never sell another book on Amazon.com. However, all of that aside, after sending them a very acidic e-mail about how they violated me, they told me they would refund my money within 24-48 hours (which has not happened yet) and that I could keep the book for starting a fire or whatever. This is absolutely the worst I have ever encountered when buying a book through this website. I have purchased other books which were listed as \\"in good condition\\" and have received them with underlining and highlighting in them, but they were all still very readable. Although the condition was debatable between \\"poor\\" and \\"acceptible\\" depending on your appreciation for books. I no longer purchase \\"used\\" books through any of those distributers. I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, UNLESS YOU NEED KINDLING FOR YOUR FIRE PLACE. HOWEVER, MY ADVICE IS JUST TO BURN YOUR MONEY, THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DELIVERY - IT AMOUNTS TO THE SAME THING."},{"Title":"THE COMMON LAW.","review":"I have to admit that I decided to read this book on account of the very angry review by Mr. Huebner. I'm glad I did. It's a good book. Really made me think. I could understand why Mr. Heubner was upset upon receiving a poor printing of a book that he thought was about a totally different subject; but was the book moronic? In my opinion, it is anything but moronic. I wish I had a book club to discuss the philosophical issues emerging from this wonderful story.It begins with a young woman (Valerie) asking a successful upper class artist (Louis) whether he needs a model. As you can imagine, they fall in love.This book is not an easy read; there are too many monologues and descriptions. But it was fascinating to read about Louis and Valerie's love for each other and the sacrifices they are willing to make. I would appreciate anyone's theory on the title of the book. I'm not sure what it's supposed to mean. See? I need that book club for feedback.- posted by Poore Richard's wyfe"},{"Title":"THE COMMON LAW.","review":"Interesting book brought it for me dad ended up reading it as well so nice I just love to read educational books"},{"Title":"THE COMMON LAW.","review":"Don't download even for free.

His descriptions are great and the pictures are beautiful.As a fly fisherman, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"I have not yet had the opportunity to explore the fishing on the Muir Trail, but I anticipate the experience after reading this book. The pictures, vivid descriptions and ample details are enough to drive any civilized man back into the wilderness! I have explored the Yosemite fishing spots described in this author's first book and found the descriptions to be right on the money. I highly recommend both books to all fly-fisherpeople, especially if you have the opportunity to fish these areas."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"Steve Beck's first book, Yosemite Trout Fishing Guide, was a really fine addition to my library. His latest publication on the beauty that is the John Muir Trail and its fishery is even better. I only wish I could get the book in a hard cover. This book is worth keeping and passing down to loved ones."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"It is clear in this compact guidebook that Steve Beck appreciates the special beauty of the Sierra, that he is a skilled fly fisherman, and that he has some fascination with John Muir. Almost every page has a fine color photo, and often a Muir quote. The scenery is spectacular, but there is plenty of solidly researched information for both experienced fishermen and hikers planning a trip to this area. I bought the book in preparation for an August vacation and it is hard to choose where to go with a limited amount of time. This book provides enough information for many trips!"},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"I'm delighted someone has finally offered some help finding fish in the high Sierra. I love backpacking and fishing - I can always find a trail, but not always the fish! This book provides detailed information on types of trout, their locations and populations in the many waters surrounding the Muir trail, as well as how to catch them in specific locations. Thanks Mr. Beck!"},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"The John Muir Trail runs 210 miles through the spectacular Sierra Nevada mountain range and serves as a connection to numerous trout-fishing waters. The trail passes by forty sparkling trout-filled lakes, crosses another forty fish-inhabited creeks, and follows six of California's biggest, untamed freestone rivers. Steve Beck's Trout-Fishing The John Muir Trail is a complete guide to this magnificent wilderness route, , illustrated throughout with color photos, and includes detailed information on planning and preparing for a trip to the John Muir Trail, fishing along the trail, fishing tackle, hiking gear, hiking tips, the top twenty trout streams, fly recommendations, and a great deal more. Whether novice angler or experienced fly-fisher, Trout-Fishing The John Muir Trail will prove an invaluable, indispensable reference guide."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"Steve Beck's first book Yosemite Trout Fishing Guide is a well done and very helpful sourcebook. I highly recommend it. I can't say the same for his second book, Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail. The coverage is uneven, good near Mammoth Crest, but superficial near Bear Creek, for example. (I.e., not a mention of one of the better Golden Trout lakes, Rose Lake, or Marie Lake, home to some large Brook, both only 1/2 mile from the trail near Selden Pass.) Overall, the impression is that the author made a single trip over parts of the JMT just to write the book.But the principal reason for the low rating is that the book is inaccurate (i.e., reporting Golden Stones in Virginia Lake--Golden Stones are a stonefly that inhabits running water) and inexcusably advocates illegal camping habits. The author, for example, talks about building fires at the JM Pass stone hut, bemoans the lack of wood, and suggests bringing wood up there. He is oblivious to the fact that wood fires are illegal above 10,000 feet. Many years ago the Forest Service did supply wood, but no more. From other comments the inference is inescapable that many if not most of his camps violated the 100' from water rule as well.Sorry, but you have to do basic &quot;homework&quot; to earn any praise. There are good scientific reasons for the Forest and Park Services' regulations for managing the wilderness, especially conservation of wood and woody debris in the high alpine ecosystem. The author should spend more time on the JMT to be more thorough and rewrite this book to clean up his mistakes."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"A fellow that I had met in the locker room at my local gym tipped me off about the great fishingand hiking along the John Muir trail. His stories really peaked my interest but I had no ideawhere to begin researching the \\"wheres\\" and \\"how to\\"s.Mr. Beck's book, Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail was just what I needed. I enjoyed his \\"down toearth\\" approach and the many wise tips he shares regarding not only locations but equipment(be sure to take a backup rod) clothing and essential flies. The book is an easy read at 96pages but chock full of great info."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"This book has been great in preparation for our JMT trip. It has helped us plan our days to ensure we get some quality fishing in. The book does an excellent job of describing the fishing. This allows you to appropriately plan and prepare for your trip."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"This was a great little book. It has plenty of detail for the long distance hiker that is planning to fish on his trip. The author seems to have really done his homework. I wish that I had been there as his study partner.He not only shares what he believes are typical size and species for a given fishery, he also shares which possible fisheries are likely barren. His work is based not only extensive fishing, but also review of Cal. Dept. of Fish and Game and other fish planting reports.If there was a limit to the book in my mind, it was the limited maps. I would like to have seen a bit more detail, including some topo data. It is probably not a shortcoming as he describes the name and location of the fisheries well. A properly equipped hiker should have a decent USGS or other map that would be adequate for locating the fishery with the descriptions provided by the author. Kudos to the author for his work."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"We enjoyed reading this book and look forward to using the information inside on our trip next summer. Would have liked more specific information about thru- hiking/backpacking on this trail such as where you can resupply and how to be prepared for bears, etc, but the fishing info was worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Trout Fishing the John Muir Trail","review":"The John Muir Trail runs through 210 miles of spectacular Sierra Nevada mountain range scenery.

I recommend this excellent story about friends and survival in the Arctic. It was very exciting."},{"Title":"Frozen Fire : A Tale of Courage","review":"Recommendation - This book takes place in the Arctic wilderness. I would recommend this book for the people between the ages of 12-14 because it presents a wide range of survival events in Alaska that were both exciting and intense. A reason that this book was exciting was the things that Matthew and Kayak ran into in the wilderness. For example, when Matthew sees a helicopter coming to rescue them, Matthew says, &quot;It's turning! The helicopter sees us! They're coming to get us!&quot; Another example of the story being intense is when they both notice a bear is approaching. &quot; Matthew and Kayak lay like dead men on the ice, both their heads turned so that they could watch the bear.&quot; In conclusion if you are interested in a friendship and a survival book, pick this one off the self."},{"Title":"Frozen Fire : A Tale of Courage","review":"Frozen fire is a tale of courage about a boy named Matthew and his father go to the Artic circle to find a mineral.

This book is a must-own for any survey methodologist or social science researcher."},{"Title":"Model Railroading With MTH Electric Trains","review":"Model Railroading with MTH by Rob Adelman is an outstanding resource for a beginner!(Actually, this book contains quite a few tips for the experienced modeler too - the kind of tips that one usually learns through the school of hard knocks.)If you are a Lionel fan, don't let the MTH in the title scare you away, the vast majority of what the author writes is very applicable to getting started with any brand of trains. The specific MTH product numbers and specific instructions on MTH's command system are just icing on the cake if you decide to go with MTH products.The chapter titles tell the story:* Planning Your Model Railroad (The author discusses pros and cons of space, size, location, themes, eras, etc.)* Designing Track Plans Using RR-Track Layout Design Software (This software is considered by many to be the industry standard in computer software for track planning and the author explains the software in a way that even beginning computer users can enjoy.)* Constructing A Table/Platform For Your Layout (The author provides step-by-step directions for a 4'X8' platform with clear text and pictures)* Track Laying and Backdrop Construction (Boy, I wish I had the tips on &quot;planning for engine overhang and tunnel portal clearance&quot; and the &quot;how-to&quot; pics for applying a backdrop when I first started my layout.)* Creating Realistic Scenery (The author shows how to use specific Woodland Scenics products. Many consider Woodland Scenics to be the industry standard for scenery products.)* Train Control Using MTH Digital Control System. (This potentially difficult topic is explained clearly and with the number of pictures, drawings and how-to tips, you almost can't go wrong!)* Detailing Your Layout (one of my favorite topics and very nicely done!)* The Dispatcher Game (a multi-level &quot;game&quot; which shows one how to operate even a small pike in a &quot;real&quot; railroad fashion. this help prevent boredom from setting in after the layout is completed and the trains have run a couple of hundred laps around the layout)I especially enjoyed the author's inclusion of dozens of color photographs of each step of his construction of this 4' X 8' layout. Between the photographs and the text, it would be hard to go wrong...The author also included many sidebars (usually identified by yellow boxes) in which he supplies definitions of pertinent terms, safety tips to help avoid injury during construction/operation, construction hints for easier building, brand name products he used and even the specific part numbers of products he used. A beginner will find these sidebars to be an invaluable resource!Lastly, the first couple of chapters deal with the history of MTH Electric Trains. For someone eager to get started on building their own layout, I suggest you just jump ahead to Chapter Three - Planning your layout and begin working. You can always go back, at some later date, to read all about the history of MTH if you'd like.This is a great resource!"},{"Title":"Model Railroading With MTH Electric Trains","review":"Model Railroading with MTH Electric Trains is by far the best book I have ever read on how to plan, construct, and operate an O gauge train layout. As I am just getting into model railroading, I can already clearly see that this book has all the resources I not only need to get going, but to keep progressing in the hobby. I was especially pleased with the chapter on the Digital Command System as the author explained it in an easy, straightforward way that really helped me to understand it much better. Getting started with DCS is a lot easier than I imagined. Not only that, but I also learned a lot about the many (over 200) different features that I had no idea it could perform. I'm really looking forward to trying those out. Another chapter I particularly like was the Dispatcher Game. I had never really given any thought to operating my trains with a purpose and this chapter outlines how to do so in a game-type situation. Plus, since it is based on how real railroads operate, I learned quite a bit. I am certainly looking forward to playing the Dispatcher Game once I am finished constructing my layout. The last chapter is also very good. I found the interview with Tony Lash as well as the pictures of his phenomenal layout to be excellent. Lastly, the book doesn't end with just the chapters--but also has quite a few appendices that contain a lot of useful information. Model Railroading with MTH Electric Trains is a definite must-have in my opinion and is extremely well done. I recommend anyone building or thinking of building a layout to get this book. Heck, even if you have a layout already, the Dispatcher Game chapter alone is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Model Railroading With MTH Electric Trains","review":"This is a great book for understanding the world of MTH trains.

Knew what to expect and it lived up to the expectations."},{"Title":"The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss","review":"Best known of course for his dearly beloved children's books, Theodor Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss) was also an supremely talented artist, as this collection of his paintings and sculptures attests. Far more detailed than the illustrations of his books, the paintings in particular range from gently witty to absolutely dazzling.Many great painters use the canvas to tell a story; Seuss goes a step farther. Each of his paintings are like a portal into an amazing little world. &quot;Cat Detective in the Wrong Part of Town&quot; evokes a seedy 50's mystery story, but with cats. Cats, by the way, are a major theme of this collection. They pop up everywhere, doing everything: Dancing the night away in &quot;Cat Carnival in West Venice&quot;, playing pool in &quot;Cat from the Wrong Side of the Tracks&quot;, even taking a shower in &quot;Cat in Obsolete Shower Bath (Study)&quot;. Seuss packs a lot of feeling into his subjects; &quot;Lonely&quot; sums up isolation about as well as anything I've seen, and several untitled pieces each show one lone bird flying serenely above a stormy sea. My favorite painting is entitled &quot;I Dreamed I Was a Doorman at the Hotel del Coronado&quot;. With its dreamy South American feel and bright colors it reminds me of an old Technicolor movie from the forties.I can't recommend this book enough, the paintings are just wonderful. I never get tired of looking at them. A complete must-own for any Seuss fan, or just any lover of the whimsical. A+"},{"Title":"The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss","review":"While few would contend at the genius Seuss put into his writing, with distinctive meter, use of words and rhyme, sometimes overlooked is the artwork that illustrated this strange world. Theodor Geisel was an accomplished illustrator. Unfortunately, most of what we saw of his work was only what was published in the books. This volume introdues you to a wider range of his work. There are not only his paintings, but his studies in 3-D of some of the whimsical cross-bred characters that were his hallmark. But there is also a sense of the adult audience in these - with jokes and puns aimed squarely above the kid level. For many of us, we delighted in Dr. Seuss as children, and delight with our children today, but this book shows us that Seuss was speaking to everyone, not just the kids, and we are richer for it. An impressive collection of artwork to make you smile."},{"Title":"The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss","review":"I have been fascinated with Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel) since I was a kid and my Mom and Dad would read Seuss stories to me. I had an interesting perspective of Seuss from a young age, though. My father, an English Professor, was writing his Doctoral dissertation on \\"Transformational Grammar in the Works of Dr. Seuss\\". In this treatise (which involved a good bit of math, it turns out: my Dad's undergraduate education was in Metallurgical Engineering) my Dad approached Seuss from a very adult point of view. Even after growing up, I would continue to marvel at the seeming simplicity of the Seuss tales, while grasping the incredible complexity underlying them all. Needless to say, my late father deserves credit for initially exploring these facets with me.With that background, I had been looking forward to a compendium of the Seuss \\"adult\\" art. This is it, and it is glorious. These pieces are at once similar stylistically to his animation for kids (although I really do believe that kids of all ages love Seuss), but on the other hand are much earthier and adult. To my delight many of these pieces feature cats, but some of the cats are decidedly not friendly, witness, for instance \\"Cat from the Wrong Side of the Tracks\\" (1964). I am particularly fond of his more avant-garde paintings like \\"Impractical Marshmallow-Toasting Device\\", a piece that I would not have been able to identify as a Geisel if not for the telltale handwritten inscription.There is no doubt that Dr. Seuss is for adults as well as children (I also recommend checking out his World War Two political cartoons), and I am delighted to finally have this book (with introduction by the wonderful and whimsical Maurice Sendak) available to see what Ted Geisel did in his spare time. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss","review":"One of our local art galleries had several choice examples of the art of Dr. Seuss, not just the cartoon drawings that made their way into his wonderful books, but the paintings and other artistic efforts presented here as &quot;The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss.&quot; This work extends from a series of four pencil and watercolor illustrations about Peru done in 1925 to an ink drawing entitled &quot;The Economic Situation Clarified&quot; in 1975. That means a half-century of art the beginning of which predates his first publication, &quot;And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,&quot; by a dozen years. As I said, these are more than just paintings, including the heads he did in the 1930s, including my favorite, the Blue-Green Abelard. The commonality of all this artwork is the fertile imagination of Ted Geisel. The creatures in these illustrations will seem familiar (you will spot Horton and other beloved visages) but what will strike you is the way Geisel started incorporating brilliant colors and abstract designs into his artwork.I am not pretending that this is serious artwork, but just that Geisel was serious about his art. He was not a great artist, just a beloved artist, who could twist and tangle pictures the way he could words and rhymes. We appear to have run out of his books, but &quot;The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss&quot; give us something &quot;new&quot; to enjoy. You might even find something you would like to get a copy of and put up on the wall in the children's bedroom."},{"Title":"The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss","review":"dr. seuss was more than a children's book author, he was an artist. i had always taken for granted this fact until i saw this as another extension of his work. beautiful pictures and fascinating sculptures...would i love to one of those hanging in my livingroom!"},{"Title":"The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss","review":"Loved it. Loved the art, very human and alive and full of life. You might say &quot;dark&quot; but I wouldn't.

This book shows that he was much more than just a children's author."},{"Title":"The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss","review":"If you think that Dr. Seuss's art is just for children, think again! This collection of oil paintings, watercolors, pencil and ink sketches, and even sculptures show new dimensions in his work. The general style of the figures and background is familiar to us from his children's books, but the dazzling palette of colors goes far beyond that of the books.Anyone who loves Dr. Seuss should have this beautiful book!"},{"Title":"The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss","review":"We all know Theodore Seuss Geisell as a creative author and illustrator. However, many of us have no idea he was an incredibly imaginitive, colorful and captivating non-literary artist. I love this collection, and think it really shows Seuss' breadth of talent. (If you also want to see more to Seuss than his kids' books, check out his biting WWII political cartoons. They're equally a treasure.)"},{"Title":"The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss","review":"Ted Geisel, more widely known as Dr. Seuss, was a consummate writer and illustrator. His children's books have sold millions of copies; it is a near certainty that few children grow up in the United States without being exposed to Seuss books. This book contains some of Seuss's art that has not had a great deal of exposure. Most are paintings, although there are some works of three-dimensional art.There are some very subtle messages in these paintings. On page 67 the image has the title \\"A Man Who Has Made an Unwise Prochess (sic).\\" A sad-looking man is walking from a distant building along a trail where there are sharp drops on both sides. The image caught and held my eye as I tried to determine what was so familiar about it. Then I realized that the man looked a great deal like Adolph Hitler. The eyes, hair, mustache and shape of the face all match.Most of the other works contain characters similar to those that have appeared in his books. They are all well done, exuding a brightness and joy so typical of the Dr. Seuss books. Geisel was just as much an artist as he was a writer, perhaps even more so. If you examine this book, you may also reach that conclusion."},{"Title":"Sri Ramakrishna, the Great Master","review":"Swami Saradananda's extensive biography is essential reading for anyone who is truly interested in the extraordinary life of Sri Ramakrishna.

Yes, parent. It's a great book for children, but more importantly, it is a touching reminder for the adults who need reminding, now and then, that children grow up fast enough without you wishing away childish things.As Humphrey heads to bed, the teddy bear that used to be his father's in hand, he overhears his father suggesting the Humphrey might just be a little old for a teddy bear. Humphrey doesn't want to hear his mother's response, just heads up to bed and off to sleep. In his dreams, he sails with his bear - now grown to adult size - and nearly loses him when a typhoon swamps their boat. Humphrey swims to shore and follows the sound of a banjo to find his friend waiting for him. Suddenly, Humphrey jerks awake, calling for his bear, to find his father standing over his bed, bear in hand. His father understands immediately why Humphrey is looking for the bear and holds him, while he holds the bear.Illustrator William Joyce almost manages to outshine the author, with fantastically bed-time-dark images. Humphrey is surprisingly small in almost every illustration, walking up stairs that are almost as tall as his legs are long, or lying in a huge bed on a gigantic pillow. Most of the drawings are light on details, leaving the very small Humphrey to look that much smaller. Jan Wahl, the author, lives up to those images. The text is as simple and without flourishes as the images, but still manages to tell an exciting adventure story with a wonderful, heart-warming ending. This is one that, even after several reads, with tug at your heart strings.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Humphrey's Bear","review":"Humphrey's Bear is a classic award-winning bedtime tale very much in the style of Mauric Sendak's, Where the Wild Things Are. It is the story of a young boy named Humphrey who, much to his father's dismay, goes to bed with his teddy bear. As he dreams, Humphrey's front yard becomes the setting for a seafaring adventure in which his teddy bear becomes a large and rather bossy shipmate.Humphrey's Bear has a rich and colorful text which makes it perfect for sharing as a read-aloud story. The text is complimented nicely by dark illustrations which evoke a sense of mystery and adventure.My four-year-old daughter really enjoys listening to me read this book. She isn't bothered by the fact that the teddy bear becomes a bossy bloke, and it doesn't bother her that Humphrey awakens to find his father holding the bear, as if he was planning to take it away as his son slept. Maybe these are things that only an adult would notice."},{"Title":"V. I.: Viral Intelligence","review":"I am not much of a SF fan, but this book is so fantastically creative and varied in its structure and subject matter that I fell in love with it. It is not the typical SF setting or story, which works quite well for the book. The use of myth, legend, and popular culture also helped enrich what otherwise would have been an oddly inaccessible fantasy setting.This book is quite funny at times, which helps dispel SF and Fantasy's tendency to stay a little too serious. The characters are memorable, the plot is intricate and well-woven, and the writing itself is pleasant to read.It is not high art, so it shouldn't be held to high art's standards. But for a Science Fiction book, it is one of the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"V. I.: Viral Intelligence","review":"V.I. is not garbage like a certain reviewer has said. The plot twists, turns, and leaves your head spinning in some places. A certain level of intelligence is required to grasp the weaving story.

I.: Viral Intelligence","review":"I can't believe that a publisher actually would publish this thing, I hesitate to call it a book. Every other sentance is '... it was like ...' The story is told from a 3rd party viewpoint but he jumps into and out of the perspective. Not to mention that the main character appears to be a manifestation of the authors over inflated ego. He makes the character a super hero of sorts but it is transpartenly thin by the use of the 3rd person taling about himself that he is only stroking his own ego. The story appears to be a collection of short stories woven together by the thinest of threads. It is a shame that they killed a tree to print this garbage."},{"Title":"V. I.: Viral Intelligence","review":"This book is remarkable in so many ways. Remarkably bad is just one of them.Imagine someone writing a collection of totally unrelated short stories. Stories which were, probably, not bad, but not good enough to get the author published. Now imagine that author putting all of those short stories into a book, changing slices of them here and there to make them at least appear (rather clumsily) to be related to one another.That seems to be what Debrandt has done here. Even the main thread that is supposed to tie all of these stories together into a cohesive whole seems forced, and written more like short fiction than a novel. There is no way to make yourself care about the characters, the worlds, or whether any of the plots even resolve themselves. By the time you reach the end of the book, you're just glad you're done with the thing.The only character in this book who was even worth having a short story about, the ONLY character you will find even mildly interesting, doesn't even make it to the end of the book, and his end is so... so... well. Not impressive. Much like the rest of this novel.All in all, if there were a way for me to go back in time and tell myself not to read this book, I'd do it. The only part of this experience I'll remember is how thoroughly unimpressive, boring, and even unpleasant this book was. This is one of those books that makes me hate being the guy who can't not finish a novel, no matter how bad it is, once I've started."},{"Title":"V.

It had every thing from geneticly designed species to little nono ticks that can rearange the molecular structure of just about any thing, and a amoeba like species called Toolies. Its Nuts!

That is just sad. Specially since Sentry is one of the best charecters in the book. But thats life. But in closing the charecters were intresting and actually had a personality (very vivid personalities)and the book has a plot where you can see whats ahead but you are surprised when something different happens than what you expect.

The models were briefly and poorly explained, with little business context. Might make an okay reference text if you already know the models, and when to use them.

Spain was in a very disastrous predicament in 1936. The Republic was not a democracy anymore. The left was very radicalized. There was very little room for other views and frustration, shortages of foods, shortages of opportunities, along with jailed opponents of the leftist government and the assassination of one of the main oppossition leaders, Calvo Sotelo led to the rebellion that followed.The individual life of anybody who had different opinions to the 5 year old Second Spanish Republic was worth very little.Anarchists, Socialist, Communists and lef wingers of undetermined origin all supported the State in disarray. The so called \\"Popular Front\\" was inducing more animosity than unity and it caused the still young Republic to be an unwelcomed system for most Spaniards.Franco was, for the most part a loyal General to the 2nd Spanish Republic. But discontent was growing since the end of 1935 and even more so in January of 1936, when the Popular Front took power.Franco and a great many other military officers had enough of the caos derived from the extreme left-winged government. Reality became that something had to be done to re-establish political order and get the economy back in order as well.It is true that a great number of the military rebels were pro-Monarchy. And Franco knew about it. Not many were very keen to follow Republican directives.But it was the animosity of the times that brought this conflict into becoming the most bloody blood bath in Spanish history.Franco may have been a dictator, but he saved Spain fron the claws of Stalin and his 2nd Communist International offensive.By Franco taking command in Spain, the country was spared from being invaded by Nazi Germany later on, and the British were able to still keep Gibraltar from Nazi hands.USA was very pro-Republic, and the Lincoln Brigade defended the 2nd Spanish Republic; something that is to be respected, but to the Spaniard, there was more at stake than having to keep a coalition in power that ultimately wanted to surrender Spain to Soviet domination."},{"Title":"Francisco Franco,","review":"lo pude conprar con un buen amigo de Bilbao, tenia a&ntilde;os tras esta obra, la vida, hasta el a&ntilde;o de 1938 del Caudillo de Espa&ntilde;a, ciudadano universal, azote de los rojos."},{"Title":"Francisco Franco,","review":"I was born and lived under this fool!

She says Marxist critics had issues with these films for being too \\"decadent.\\" Pasolini's growing disillusionment with Marxism led to his later movies having different styles than his earlier ones: instead of reaching his audience through dramatic social tales of Italian peasants, he tried to convey his themes by playing up the subtle \\"decadence\\" of his earlier realistic films with more over-the-top metaphor and myth.Films that the author discusses include such varying titles as \\"The Gospel According to St. Matthew\\" and the highly controversial \\"Salo.\\" The later films are all quite interesting, as most of them deal with some sort of taboo or controversial topic.A lot of the author's commentary on Pasolini's works deal with his Marxist beliefs and struggles with his religious convictions and sexual orientation.The chapter dealing with Pasolini's film theory writings is not for the beginner in this subject looking for an easy read. Greene gets into things like free indirect discourse, semiology, and linguistics, which can be a little tough to grasp if you haven't studied film theory before.The book also includes a section of 24 pages of B+W photographs, mostly from Pasolini's movies. Overall, this is a good introduction to a complex director, but the chapter on his theoretical writings gets a little technical for the beginner."},{"Title":"The Allianced Enterprise","review":"The book has some excellent articles, offering invaluable prescriptive insights for those of us mired in the world of interorganizational alliance relationships.

A sudden, thunderous boom silenced them, and everyone watched as the first-floor windows ballooned out and shattered.\\" -- From the bookAt a recent visit to a local bookstore, I asked the sales clerk if he could direct me to some of his favorite mysteries. I was in the mood for some good mystery fiction, especially \\"cozy\\" mysteries.One of the books he directed me to was Leslie Meier's Back to School Murder. I thought I'd give it a try and just finished reading it.I wasn't immediately drawn in by the characters, but then I end up enjoying a comfortable rhythm--reading a few chapters here and there. It's a breezy book. The characters, including the main sleuth/housewife Lucy Stone, are quite believable. I'm the type of person that figures out 'whodunnit' early in the game with both books and movies, but I honestly didn't know who actually planted the bomb--or murdered Carol-- until the end.My only criticism of this book was that the author introduced too many minor characters into the mix, including their first and last names. After awhile, I wasn't sure who I should remember and who was just a \\"passing through\\" character--so that was a bit irritating. (Note to the author: a general decription of \\"passing through\\" characters would have been sufficient without mentioning their full name and, sometimes, a short bio!)I didn't have the benefit of reading earlier Lucy Stone books, but the relationship with her husband and kids seems pretty darn realistic to me.All in all, Back to School Murder was an enjoyable cozy mystery; I plan on sampling more books from this author in the future."},{"Title":"Back to School Murder","review":"The 4th book in the Lucy Stone mystery series starts with a bang. Lucy has started a temporary job at The Pennysaver, the Tinker's Cove weekly newspaper and is enjoying a bit of freedom from home life. As she settles into the daily grind of a full time job and the kids going back to school after a long summer break, she is shocked to hear that the school is being evacuated. Racing over to the school, she quickly learns that a bomb has been found inside the school. Watching as the children are safely removed from the building, it quickly becomes apparent that something is wrong. A disabled student is missing, and assistant principal Carol Crane races in to find him. Sprinting out as the bomb explodes, Carol is able to save herself and the boy...becoming an instant hero. But when her body is found murdered a few days later, suspicions are raised about Carol's life. Was the school bombing and Carol's murder related? And why is a favorite teacher accused of her murder?I am really fond of the Lucy Stone series. I look forward to reading each of the books in the series as I feel that many of the things that Lucy deals with in her life are applicable to many moms. She juggles the demands of motherhood with her own desires to be self-fulfilled. She works to help pay the bills, and struggles to keep her house clean and hot meals on the table. As her children age, she deals with teenage issues, while still changing the diapers of baby Zoe. And in the midst of all this, she still finds time to nose her way into any mystery that finds its way to Tinker's Cove.If you enjoy the Jane Jeffry Series by Jill Churchill, give this series a try.The first book in the series is called \\"Mistletoe Murder\\".

It's very straightforward, intelligent, illuminating and compassionate -- offering a bulleted list of traits in the first few pages, along with a summary and example of the various diagnostic criteria used around the world. While aimed at the N/T partner to better cope and appreciate an Aspy partner's often alternate-universe ways, it doubles as a heartfelt revelation and validation for anyone with Asperger's or possessing a few Aspie traits (I'm faceblind and ultrasensitive to sound, for instance). It offers compassionate understanding on making unlikely relationships work. For anyone who thinks they might be or know of an Aspie and wants to better appreciate and grok their rarefied realities, or better understand the mysteries of human behavior in general, this book's a gem.From her introduction: \\"I believe that someday we will wake up as a civilization and realize that the Aspie traits that now confuse us are part of the core of human progress.\\""},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"In this book a woman tells of the joys and struggles of living with a husband and children who have Asperger Syndrome. She also draws on the experiences of others who have had lived with &quot;Aspie&quot; partners. She honestly describes her own difficulties understanding and translating her husband's reactions into her own more emotionally demonstrative frame of reference.I got the impression that she would have liked her husband to write more about his perspective on their relationship. He does give some information but he is not an &quot;express your emotions&quot; type of guy.I have refered several people to this book. It is good for individuals who are learning to appreciate and deal with a family member with Aspergers. At the same time this book has something to say for any couple who despite vast differences, strive to understand each other and make a long term relationship work."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"I purchased this book a month ago in a last ditch effort to save my 23 year marriage to a man with Asbergers and to better understand our triplets w/As as well. The boys always had the dx but my husband was hesitant to accept the diagnosis. Although I knew what AS was and felt I was very knowledgable I wasn't. This book really takes you from the begining of a diagnosis, TO HOW TO AFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE AND UNDERSTAND YOURSELF AND YOUR AS FAMILY MEMBER. This book is wonderful not just for marriages will work for any relationship w/ an AS. My AS son is in a relationship with an AS girl, and asked me if he could borrow the book,:)Our marriage of 23 years a month ago was ready to blow up in smoke. Is now on the road to a comfortable place of understanding and communication."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"I have a son with autism and have thought about his future, especially when it comes to close relationships with others. This book is the most clear-cut and informational adult AS book out there. It has a fun tone to it and is easy to read. It makes the diagnostic criteria understandable. This book will be beneficial for spouses to read, as well as other close relationships--parents, business partners, siblings, friends. I highly recommend this book, not only to adults, but also parents who are anticipating the future with their AS and ASD children."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"I am a therapist, but found that most of the literature about Asperger Syndrome was geared toward children. There are thousands of adults who have been wondering all their lives why they are so different. This book will help those with Asperger and those who love them understand what this is all about much better."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"This was the most helpful book in actually explaining to the reader what the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for adult AS actually translates to, in layman's terms, and what those criteria may look like to a non-Asperger partner. For non-AS/AS partners who want their relationships to get better, who know they love one another and who desire to stay together, Ashley Stanford has given us a wonderful resource. She's ever hopeful, loving, and respectful of her relationship with her AS husband, while remaining honest in her sharing of how difficult it can be sometimes. Stanford shares the insights she's gained from living in an AS/non-AS marriage. She sheds light on how the many forms and nuances of Asperger syndrome may present itself, which can lead to difficulties for long-term relationships, as well as how to understand what those actions really mean. This understanding helps non-AS partners to avoid hurt feelings and promote better understanding between partners for their differences. This was the most upbeat, supportive, encouraging book I've read to date, and I've read many. I'd recommend this book highly to those who are determined to have a healthier relationship with a partner who has AS."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"Until I purchased this book I never quite knew what was wrong with my marriage. When I met my husband I knew he was different but couldn't put his quirks or his indifferences into words. I knew he loved me but somehow I knew something wasn't quite right. I even had a hard time bonding with his family and never knew why. They all are Aspies!After our children were born, my husband's Asperger's syndrome kicked into high gear. I thought he was a narcissist. When our youngest son was diagnosed with High Functioning Asperger Syndrome the physician explained Asperger Syndrome is usually passed down from the fathers DNA (genes). Wow, a light bulb went on! I purchased this book and highlighted the heck out of it. It describes him to a tee. Although he would NEVER admit to having Asperger Syndrome, I leave the book around anyway. Hopefully he'll be curious enough to pick it up and check out the highlighted areas. Perhaps a light bulb will go on for him as well.This book has helped me change the way I interact with him. As the book says you have to let go of what you think \\"normal\\" is in a Aspie relationship. Living with a spouse with Asperger's is a lonely life. Read this book, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!"},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"I got this book a few days ago and I'm half-way through it. I've already gained a MUCH better understanding of him and the problems in our relationship. What's more, this book frequently gives real-life solutions that have worked for other couples dealing with problems. I'd recommend this book to anyone whose partner has a diagnosis of AS."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"For privacy purposes I will not say much, but I think this book has really saved my marriage. The nuances of certain things that I go through with my partner are explained in full detail in this book and have taken a HUGE weight off of my shoulders. If you even suspect your partner has Asperger's, I suggest you read this book. The emotional deadweight has been lifted, and I've really been able to work on solutions instead of blame. So very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"This books reviews were misleading. This is not a &#34;self help&#34; book. It is more of a technical book. I returned this book which was a total waste of money."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"For years, my daughters and I have fondly dismissed some of my husband's behavior as \\"on the spectrum (Autism). In fact, people familiar with autism are often known to comment that many typical male behaviors do not fall far from this tree. The jury is out on this one. My favorite quote from this book is that an \\"aspie does not look into people's eyes because they are not expecting to see any information in person's eyes.\\" I also appreciated the comment that someone with Asperger's may give an intense courtship and then resort to default behavior.This book does a nice job of discussing Asperger's in specific terms and giving examples of what the behavior and thinking may look like. In addition, the suggestions are helpful. I love that the tone is generally upbeat. The quotes are useful. I find the entire book a welcome emphasis on ways to maximize the potential in a relationship, something every relationship may use. In the end, this book is specifically for this specific diagnosis, but gives some excellent advise for anyone who does not feel that their emotional connection is satisfying.If you have questions, this is an accessable book that I would recommend."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"This is a great book that has helped me not only in dealing with my issues but also just in helping me have a good relationship with my wife."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"Wish I would have read this book before I met my husband. The book didn't save our mariage but I think it is a very informative read. Highlynrecommend."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"I finally have some insight into things I did not understand. This book contains essays from many people describing their experiences, which helps make sense of behaviors I experienced with my aspergers partner. Some people acknowledge their behavior and the pain it causes and they are willing to try to make things better. Needless to say, others simply do not. If you're on the brink of making a decision on staying with your partner, this book may help you."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"This is a great book for understanding the Asperger's marriage and compromises that go with it. I find it more depressing than anything. I have been married to a man with AS for 14 years. It is important to read BEFORE you marry someone with AS if at all possible. I actually don't recommend marrying. Being married to someone with AS is simple, YOU do ALL the compromising and learning to deal with it. Unless you are financially independent it's very risky. My husband has prevented me from working all these years. Very few adults with AS are capable of change or compromise, even though it is not their intention. I have not found support and have lost all my friends. Much of my family also has AS so they 'side' with him. Non AS people are just game pieces for them to use. They do not understand that we are independent people since they don't think that way. My husband recently had a stress induced breakdown that is ending our marriage. The don't think he will recover because he refuses to accept that he needs help, all he does is blame everyone else and everything else and get angry."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"With this book had a few pages I really liked but other then that as the author says at the end she wrote this mostly for herself (That's not so great) and it defiantly showed. The little she wrote I liked like the one page on sex and the disorder isn't found anywhere else but almost all the rest of the info is and is delivered elsewhere better. She states she was pretty ignorant before her limited research and I could tell prior to her statement of it and frankly now she may be more informed but she still has along way to go and some of her assumptions which she states as facts are also wrong. But, she is right that a book like hers is well needed and the fact she acted on that is great. The fact that she deals with someone like her husband as well as she does and her commitment to her kids with it and without are also admirable. But, couldn't someone tell her stuff like that 70-75% of the people with this also have ADD/ADDHd? Which IS a fact.Ask the leading guy on the topic who she admires so much Tony Attword. She needs to know the area better herself and needs to do better research on it especially with her job being what it is in life and as a mother with 3 kids and a husband with it."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"This book is outstanding. Anyone living with someone with Aspergers needs to read this book. I am sure this book will help to save many marriages."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"Well written book by one strong woman. What about a woman like that for me too? I have Aspergers. Ashley Stanford really lays out good arguments about why people with Aspergers can marry and not believe garbage that Aspies should be forced celibates. She said being told you shouldn't marry is like telling Rosa Parks to sit only in the back of the bus. Fact is Aspies just function differently than the normal person and the rules of marriage are altered. People with Aspergers just communicate differently. The best communication is on a phone, text messaging, or talking to your partner in the dark where body language is useless. Body language is the key to understanding the opposite sex, we Aspies just are worse than the average guy at understanding it. Should be required reading for psychiatrists and pyschologists who think Aspies should live lives of forced celibacy. Perhaps I bought the book because I had a female friend in high school named Ashley, and she was gorgeous, too."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"The realities of Asperger's can be painful; it was encouraging to see these difficulties recognized and then deftly defused by Ashley Stanford. To be clear: it isn't like smearing a layer of chocolate frosting over a dirt cake - her aim is not to cover the issues with a cloak of happy denial. Rather, Ms. Stanford very clearly acknowledges the pain that can exist for both the AS partner and the NT partner, and then just as clearly demonstrates that life goes on in spite of that pain.Concise suggestions for how to deal with certain situations (such as the special interest or social events) provided great insight into the methods of constructing an AS/NT relationship that is a learning experience for both partners.As the NT partner in an AS/NT relationship, I can at times feel overwhelmed by the prospect of a life with an AS partner. This book helped me to recognize the potentially advantageous outcomes of this relationship.-Nicole ServaisAuthor of \\"The Lies of Sam Phillips\\""},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"This has been the best book on Asperger's I have yet read (6 and counting).

Great examples that make symptoms easy to identify and relate to. Very positive."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"I thought the book gave some good insight and perspective to partners of people with Asbergers. It is difficult to find material on adult issues that come up with this syndrome and many relationships may be saved if a loved knew what the symptoms may look like in an adult's marriage.I would recommend this book to significant others as must reading."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"This book helped me to understand a certain someone close to me who has Asperger's. They will not come out and admit it but have made references to it before (which is another sign of someone who has it I learned). After reading I feel at least more peace in my heart about this situation because for years I have been so frustrated with the fact that no matter what I did this person and I just do not seem to 'click'. Nothing comes 'naturally' and this person repeats stories over and over again and phrases and is almost mechanical in social situations. Well now I know...he has Aspergers."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"I wanted to read material that would allow me to understand my spouse's behavior in such a way that I could better understand him, without an knee jerk reaction of anger or resentment. Although he has never been diagnosed, he seems to have some moderate symptoms in common with Aspies, and because of that, I can begin to gain a new perspective, with the help of this book, about him and what makes him tick the way he does. I have determined, for my purposes, that there are many gradations of any diagnosis, and that recognition of a pattern of his traits, even if mild in degree, helps me put aside my usual tendency to take things personally, but rather to see that he is just operating in accordance to a very different perspective of the world, one that is highly sensitive to sensory input, oblivious of public scrutiny, and without a doubt, keenly intelligent and creative in its own way. Reading this book has been a very helpful exercise."},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"This book provides a good insight from someone in an Aspergers relationship with useful tips and ideas for all parties"},{"Title":"Asperger Syndrome Long Term Re","review":"I have just discovered a wealth of materials that examine adults with AS - most of my initial searching turned up children.

From his biographies of such stars as Bob Hope and Groucho Marx to his contributions to the 1970s sitcom, 'Alice', Arthur's writings have never failed to entertain. 'Set To Kill' is his first fiction title, and a fine one at that. Marx's dark humor mixed in with a suspenseful storyline captivates readers from page one and makes 'Set To Kill' a real page-turner. Though it was released over a decade ago, this witty and thought-provoking prose can stand on its own against any of today's top-selling mystery novels."},{"Title":"Palace Under the Sea","review":"I read Palace Under the Sea when I was 12 years old.

I'm so glad. It was such a joy to re-read. It was like being a kid again and dreaming about places I thought I'd never go. The book is still great, intelligent and a wonderful adventure. And I got to see some of those places while sea kayaking along the coast. Nice symmetry in life, I had the adventure too."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Every once in a while a book comes along that takes your breath away. \\"The Secret Magdalene\\" was everything I could want in a book. The author (Ki Longfellow) weaves a tapestry of great characters, beauty, mysteries, and uncommon adventures in this intriguing novel of Mary Magdalene and Jesus. To put it simply, this book made me a Longfellow fan, and I look forward to her future works."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"This is a novel. The same could be said for the Christian Bible. But whereas many men (and, just perhaps, one or two now suppressed women?) wrote the Bible over a long period of time, this was written by one person recently. I am deeply impressed. I am more than impressed. By the writing itself, which is first rate. By the research which is also first rate...and then taken to intriguing places many scholars fear to go. By the sheer audacity of the ideas scattered throughout like rubies (rubies are what the Bible calls good hardworking women who never give a thought to themselves, but only to their men). But these rubies are gems of great ideas presented in the life of a great woman who meets a great man. Most high recommendation from a stickler for the best."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"It's embarrassing to say this, but I was told to read this book by a friend who gushed about it.

I found myself getting a highlighter out just so I would be able to go back and read passages of it that touched my very soul, and there were so very many of these marks:) I have not read a book in a very long time that has lead me to *ponder* on what is being said. I could feel the characters, see the landscape, and smell the smells....thanks again."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Never read anything quite like this. Thought Nikos Kazanzakis in his \\"Last Temptation of Christ\\" was fairly daring when he wrote the usual story of Christ--but made Mary Magdalene and Jesus, if not quite lovers, then tempted. Thought various scholars who put forth the idea that Mary Magdalene was the Beloved Disciple were on to something. Thought those who actually posited she was the disciple John \\"himself\\" were also on to something. But this book, with its astonishing scholarship combined with truly masterful storytelling has, as they used to say, blown my mind. It's all from Mary's point of view. And this Mary is a real woman. She's an extraordinary person worthy of the extraordinary man called Jesus. A brilliant woman. A thinker. A questioner. She even has a sense of humor. And so does Jesus! Add to this the exceedingly clever weaving of historical facts, some obscure, some very obscure, some known by everyone--or at least we think we know them, until they're presented in this new and startling way, making the mind leap through ahas! and oh dears! and my gods! You think as you read: parts of this could be true. Great heavens, all of it could be true, it could really have happened this way. It's so plausible, so well thought out. And the stories based on the gospels! Each and every one of them are turned inside out so that we see them from a completely new vantage point and in a truly different and exciting way.The \\"secret\\" of this Magdalene is not something so, by now, utterly expected, as Mary being the bride of Christ (ancient symbolism, all this) or bearing his children, or even being the Beloved Disciple (which she was and is)...no, the secret is the original teachings. The secret is the Gnosis that the Church has long hidden from us knowing no Church that wished to hold great power could get very far with the individual being allowed direct access to the God within. (What? No priests? No Popes? No ministers? No rules and laws? Never!) Longfellow's Magdalene is the most wonderfully realized companion-teacher-philosopher-beloved disciple-\\"woman\\" I've ever encountered. She is unforgettable. Just like the Goddess who will not be silenced.What a feast for the mind. What a treasury of ideas. But the best of all is that this whole book is not only a character study of a stunning human being, it's the study of the birth of Gnosticism. Gnosticism is what was taught first, before Christianity as we know it today. It seems to be what Jesus Christ actually taught and what the later Church tried to hide from us. Time and again I've attempted to \\"get\\" what it is the very early Gnostics believed...and why. This book lays it out so clearly even I can grasp it.But maybe best of all is the story. It's a page turner. It's compulsive reading. Did I like it? I absolutely loved it!"},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"This book is not trying to be a historical perspective but it does shine through the very compelling fictional account.

I believe it's going to become a classic not only in the field of religious studies, but as a work of literature in itself. I believe it's an exquisite piece of writing.

I'm recommending it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"I found this book by reading a new effort by Anne Rice about the childhood of Jesus and then going on to read her reviews. In them, someone recommended this book. And I am so glad they did. Mrs. Rice is working within the traditions of the Catholic Church. But this book is working with true and abiding spirit. This book gives us a Jesus whose divinity is truly believeable and a Magdalene speaking with a voice of passion, intelligence, and a deep understanding. It's more than brilliant. I think it's inspired...by God, if you think that way. But certainly by all the creative Muses. I laughed and cried and smiled all the way through, and closed it sadly. One hates something so wonderful to end."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Just finished this book. Thought I would come rave about it. But first read all the reviews here before me. What can I say to add to all this? My favorite book about Mary Magdalene. My favorite book about Jesus. My favorite book about Judas. And to top it all off, it's a book about Gnosis, which everyone talks about, but no one seems to understand. This book is compulsively readable. It's smart. It's beautiful. It's unique. It's a shame I can only give it five stars."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"I became engrossed in this book from the first page and couldn't put it down.

Still, he is portrayed as a gentle soul who is trying to do the right thing for his people.

You will never think about the Biblical story of Jesus, his mother, Judas and Mary Magdalene the same way again.The writing is beautiful, rhythmic and Biblical in its own sense. I really enjoyed the slant Longfellow takes on traditional stories, like raising Lazarus from the dead, or the two sisters who host guests and one bitterly works in the kitchen while the other sits and eats.A lovely, thought-provoking novel."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"If you come to this book knowing only the four traditional gospels and the traditional Jesus narrative, you are probably going to be lost. This novel is written from the point of view of the majority of the \\"Gnostic\\" gospels, i.e., revealing Jesus to be a teacher in THAT tradition, NOT as one who went about teaching \\"salvation\\" as taught by present-day fundamentalists. We're talking \\"gnosis,\\" secret knowledge--the belief that each of us has God in us in a way far different from the usual \\"holy spirit\\" sort of Christianity.We also see here a presentation of the \\"Jesus passion\\" as a contrived and intentional reproduction of the ancient death-and-resurrection myths of Osiris and a dozen other earlier \\"gods\\" found from ancient Egypt to their Mediterranean descendants in the Mystery religions. AND it is heavy on \\"Mother\\" and the mother-goddess influence. Here think \\"Sophia,\\" especially.I'd suggest reading Freke and Gandy and their books on the Jesus mystery and the \\"lost goddess,\\" as these would be wonderfully helpful.Without some knowledge of such background, this book seems rather far-fetched. With such knowledge, this book becomes a beautiful retelling of what may have been the REAL Jesus story. It is what one character, Philo, calls \\"midrash\\"--conscious commentary and embroidery and interpretations and re-interpretations of an existing story. To quote him, \\"I think to perform Midrash. I think to devise for the Jews a new myth, one crafted from old myth, but a uniquely Jewish myth of a godman.\\"Read as such, this novel makes more sense of most of the New Testament narrative than the New Testament does.

It brings alive the true meaning of the Christ in ways no dry, historical text can and rings more true than any \\"non fiction\\" on the subject. The story will captivate you. The characters will live in you, and you certainly don't have to be a fan of Jesus to appreciate this fabulous novel .

Much more believable than the bible ever could have told. You love her, you fear for her and you wish she would just take off those bindings and be the woman she is."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"This novel purports to tell the story of Jesus (Yeshu) from a secular viewpoint expressed by the heroine Mary Magdalene. The story line involves the development of an attempt by Yeshu and his former militant Jewish followers to create a Messiah story based on suffering and resurrection as described in older Egyptian cult writings The whole idea is to fake the crucifixion death by drugging Yeshu through the wine soaked sponge and then resurrect him after his removal from the tomb. Unfortunately for the plot, the author inexplicably kills Yeshu through the medium of the Roman's sword, which pierces his side. This leaves a finely crafted plot entirely in the lurch. The author then quickly ends the book without ever mentioning the resurrection stories, which she had originally sought to explain through the medium of the faked death. This leaves the reader, whatever his/her religious persuasion might be, completely unsatisfied, having read a plot, whose logical conclusion is to have a live Yeshu walk again and then disappear into a monastery at Carmel, which she has expressly implied in the text to be used for that purpose. Even if the author had wanted the reader to ponder whether or not the resurrection ending was miraculous, she has done an injustice to the plot by failing to even once mention the stories of Jesus walking again after he had been crucified. I came to the conclusion that by the end of the story, the author had simply grown tired of writing it, cutting it off simply to get rid of it."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Ki Longfellow's The Secret Magdalene is an important book and I would suggest every new age seeker and for that matter, every sentient being, to read this extraordinary novel.

I found myself laughing out loud as well as weeping. I had many revelations while reading The Secret Magdalene, one being that it was time to take the photos of my teachers off of my altar because now all I need is a candle to remind me that I am the light.I usually read a book once and then pass it on but The Secret Magdalene will remain on my shelf because I know I shall read this again and again."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Ki Longfellow's \\"The Secret Magdalene\\" offers a mesmerizing account of Mariamne of Magdal Eder (known as Mary Magdalene) and her astonishing journey from ardent pupil to teacher and companion of the most famous man in history - Jesus of Nazareth. Much has been written about Mary Magdalene but Ms Longfellow's book is perhaps the most worthy addition to the fiction canon of her life, both in its breathtaking scope, meticulous research, and expert mixture of Gnostic philosophy with grand historical fiction. Framed as the narrative scrolls of Mariamne, she tells her story with wit, sensitivity and spirit, from her travels with her father's ward Salome into Alexandria, where they absorb mysterious religious philosophies, to their return to Jerusalem and their life-altering relationships with Jesus and John the Baptist and Mariamne's emergence as a prophet in her own right. Eschewing the legend of redeemed prostitute and delving far beyond the traditional Biblical tale, Longfellow immerses us in the daily life, travails, and spiritual awakening of an intelligent woman and leader, whose mystic appeal continues to enthrall us centuries after her death."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Because I am a writer myself, I should like to address this work as literature. There is much in The Secret Magdalene that is more poetry than prose, but don't let the idea of \\"poetry\\" put you off. (Pity that it should in this \\"infomerical-sound-byte-Hip Hop doggerel\\" day and age.) The prose poetry flows like fine vintage wine and takes you swiftly and lyrically from one page to the other as Ms Longfellow spins the most delicious tale of a young girl caught up in a terrifying world of rigid male values. Being Mariamne of the House of Benjamin, born to wealth and privilege and some education, but more especially, being born with wit and humor and an endlessly questing questioning mind, this Mariamne (who becomes in time Mariamne Magdal-eder, or to our ears: Mary Magdalene), tells her first person tale with candor and a tremendous natural intelligence. Her story is spell-binding, and told with the perfect \\"passive\\" voice, often sounding like the most gorgeous bits of the King James translation of the Bible. Once caught up in the rhythm of the work, there's no putting it away. Longfellow's is an important voice, and one I hope to hear from again, and again."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"THE SECRET MAGDALENE is an outrageously inventive work of fiction about the early Christian years, during the life and times of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. The 400-plus-page novel, which includes a bibliography with several pages of source material, is divided by scrolls rather than chapters. The first scroll begins with \\"The Voice\\" of Mariamne, the main character.Through the voice of Mariamne --- a visionary and prophet with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge --- THE SECRET MAGDALENE takes readers on a journey thick with details and wild in imagination.Mariamne is an adolescent Jewish girl who survived a childhood illness that left her hearing voices and experiencing visions. She lives in Jerusalem with her father Josephus and his ward, Salome, who also has the gift of prophecy. Mariamne and Salome are raised like sisters and are cared for by Tata, a household slave with worldly experience and a soft spot for her charges.One night, during dinner, Mariamne is moved to speak in one of her prophetic voices, whose proclamation is witnessed by Josephus's dinner guests. Josephus immediately sends Mariamne to her room and makes excuses for her behavior, but one of the houseguests is intrigued by what he has heard and wants to learn more. For Mariamne, that night changes everything. A week later, because of a misunderstanding involving the houseguest and Salome, Josephus banishes Salome, Tata and Mariamne from his home.With Mariamne's banishment, her quest begins. For both protection and ease of travel, Tata disguises Mariamne and Salome. Dressed as boys, they travel as child prophets who become known for their visions and wisdom. After parting ways with Tata, the young women travel with other companions to Alexandria in Egypt, where Mariamne and Salome become educated in philosophy and other areas of knowledge.During subsequent travels, they meet John the Baptizer (John of the River), himself a great prophet. John of the River, believed by some to be the Messiah, harkens the arrival of the real Messiah and, in doing so, becomes a threat to those in power. Through John, Mariamne meets his cousin, Yeshu, a simple man who is becoming a famous healer, teacher and prophet --- and a man believed to be the Messiah.With the encouragement of Yeshu, Mariamne shares the knowledge she learned during her studies in Egypt. She joins Yeshu as he teaches and heals, spreading his message of love and forgiveness to his followers, whose numbers continue to grow. In this fictional portrayal of historic events, places and people, Mariamne walks with Yeshu as he travels from Cana in Galilee, to Bethany in Judea, and into the garden of Gethsemane. She is present at the foot of his cross.In THE SECRET MAGDALENE, Mary Magdalene steps out of the shadows and onto center stage. Through the fictional voice of Mariamne, Mary Magdalene is elevated to a position of prominence as a disciple and the beloved companion of Jesus Christ. This is a wildly imaginative novel that undoubtedly will attract a lot of attention and foster discussion about one of the most controversial and fascinating women in early Church history.--- Reviewed by Donna Volkenannt"},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"The reader has to remember this book is a novel, albeit, a good novel. At first I thought this book would/should become as popular as Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, but knowledge of the historical Jesus may be needed to enjoy it to its fullest. Ms. Longfellow weaves the historical Jesus, the mythological Jesus and the theological Jesus into a very compelling novel. She uses all the tools available, the apocrypha, the canon, and scholarly writings. This reader marveled and wondered at how the author got from one supposedly known Jesus adventure to the next. Without divulging the ending I have to make the following comment - the reasoning comprising the ending sequence probably wasn't conspired by the person she indicates as most scholars feel if this conspiracy came into play, it was devised after Jesus' crucifixion. Also, I was always looking for Ms. Longfellow to incorporate the Secret Gospel of Mark into the novel. It would have been a natural with Mariamne already posing as a boy. This reader enjoyed the book immensely. This book is not for the fundamentalist."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"\\"A very long time ago a woman called Dorothea Brande wrote a book about writing and in it, she said: \\"The influence of any widely read book can hardly be overestimated. If it is sensational, or shoddy, or vulgar, our lives are the poorer for the cheap ideals which it sets in circulation; if, as so rarely happens, it is a thoroughly good book, honestly conceived and honestly executed, we are all indebted to it.\\" (Today, she would say that about our cheap and shoddy movies.) I think in time, we might very well become indebted to The Secret Magdalene. I think it has set in motion honestly conceived and honestly executed ideas about Gnosis, as well as the Goddess we all seek, and whose lack has long been lamented. Mary Magdalene is that Goddess, and this book opens us to both a true feeling for the Magdalene, but also for Gnosis, or \\"knowing.\\"And I'm not the only one who's beginning to see this. Not only has Timothy Freke, who co-wrote The Jesus Mysteries and Jesus and The Lost Goddess, listed The Secret Magdalene first in his wonderful new website's reference section under \\"Books to Read,\\" and given it a glowing review, and not only has it been endorsed by magdalene.org, the largest and oldest website devoted solely to the Magdalene, but Earl Doherty has written what he calls a triptych of a review of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, Robert M. Price's Da Vinci Fraud, and The Secret Magdalene on his own website: The Jesus Puzzle. In Doherty's review, he says: \\"One feels the stone streets of Jerusalem beneath one's feet, one breathes the dust of the scrubby Judean wilderness; the close air and beating sun by the stinking salt sea of inland Palestine clog the reader's pores. The great city of Egyptian Alexandria, lazing on the broad breast of the Nile delta, sparkles not only in the Mediterranean sunlight, it is lit by the intellectual vibrancy of its philosophical schools, by the vast knowledge and artistic creativity collected within the walls of the ancients' greatest library. Within this world of sand, sea and parchment moves Longfellow's heroine who has caught the imagination of so many who have come to know her. But however magical an achievement is the creation of Longfellow's atmosphere of the ancient world, it is almost eclipsed by the book's intellectual and emotional landscape. It is the richness of the characters and their minds and feelings that dominate this novel. But even this operates on two levels, a microcosm and macrocosm, if you like. While the characters think and feel as individuals, it is through such as them that a new philosophy, a new way of looking at the world and the nature of humanity is emerging, and the novel conveys that broader sense.\\" \\"All the characters, even the secondary ones, are drawn with depth and sensitivity. It may not be too much to say that Mariamne herself is one of the most perfectly crafted figures in modern fiction, which makes it no surprise that so many readers have taken to her so emotionally. She will no doubt eclipse all other representations of Mary Magdalene for some time.\\"I wholeheartedly agree. I'm sure Dorothea Brande would agree too."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"As a non-Christian this book came to me highly recommended by a friend. And I cannot recommend it highly enough myself. I have never felt so immersed in such a vivid depiction of the ancient world. Ki Longfellow brought Jerusalem, and its surrounding desert tribes, alive for me, as well as Egyptian Alexandria which held me in awe as the story carried me there across the Nile, and into the city and its famed library during its heyday. The story was a page turner, and the philosophy of gnosticism it depicts, during the time of its origins, fascinated me. The philosophy evolves naturally with the story, and humanizes Jesus as he struggles with his personal questions and doubts. As a non-Christian, THIS is a Jesus I could believe in. I had no idea of the complexities of Jewish culture during those times, and the story of Jesus moved me deeply. So much so that I cried both times I read the book, and books don't make me cry! If you're looking for a tale of magic, mystery and suspense, in which to lose yourself. This is the one!"},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Longfellow's seamless prose and rare understanding makes this a wonderful journey of the spirit. Susbstantial, important, depth layered on depth, yet it is an effortless read. A flawed and perfect Mary Magdalene, a complete Jesus, a heartbreaking Judas, makes this a Flaubert of a book, a mystic urging clothed in living history. It's bound to become a classic in not only the field of religious thought, but in the world of good and lasting literature."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"I love the part in a review of The Secret Magdalene which keeps appearing and disappearing that mentions a young girl keeping this book on her nightstand so she could read it over and over. That's how I feel. There's too much for just one read. As for understanding Gnosis, it seems to me that this author has not only understood it, but \\"experienced\\" it. How else could she write so well about what Jesus endures? Or how Mary Magdalene knows what she knows? I'm no scholar, but like a lot of other people, I'm turning away from traditional religion and towards Gnosticism. I want to know what it's all about. I'm not too sure about what became of Gnosticism over the years (too dark and too complex for me), but from what I can tell, in the very beginning it was simple. It was like Lao Tzu. It was about experiencing God for yourself, without priests and popes and whatever between you and the moment. It's not only reference books that bring understanding. In fact, reference books argue among themselves. This theory and that theory and which do you choose? No, I think story and myth are much stronger than \\"facts.\\" Or they can be. This story is stronger, and that's for sure. Before I read this book again, I'm reading Freke and Gandy's The Laughing Jesus. Again. Do Gandy and Freke write reference books? Not at all. They write philosophical arguments of great quality.

Books of this caliber shouldn't languish in the shadows; they should be right up there shining out with the best of the best. I bought an Eio Books edition.

My hopes for the book in early chapters were not fully satisfied but that is just my prejudice of where this book could have taken us.It held my attention throughout but I felt the final third of the book revealed either a fatigue of the author or such a strong desire to finish the manuscript that she lost some of the crispness of earlier chapters.The ending (which I will not give away) certainly is plausible although, as I said earlier, probably did not satisfy me because of my own bias. Other readers may very well find the ending completely satisfying.Again, Bravo, Ms. Longfellow."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Although the daughter of a privileged affluent Jewish aristocrat Mariamne is unable to overtly display her love of learning as females do not obtain a formal education. Thus she secretly studies whatever she, her personal slave Tata, or her father's ward Salome can borrow without anyone knowing. After becoming ill, she began hearing voices in her head that she assumed were prophecies even as she fully recovers from her ailment.When her father catches Salome alone with a young male guest and no escort, he becomes irate and tosses her out with nothing except the clothes that she is wearing. Though he has no evidence except a nebulous guilt by association, he also accuses his daughter of the same outrageous behavior and exiles her to his brother-in-law's house with an admonishment to never see Salome again. Instead Mariamne and Salome, dressed as males, run off to Alexandria, where they study in the library. Eventually Salome meets John the Baptizer while Mariamne finds herself attracted to Yeshu. The latter two share a love and the premonition of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection.Providing a female perspective to the birth, death, and rebirth of Jesus, readers see a unique viewpoint from that of THE SECRET MAGDALENE. Mariamne and Salome are terrific protagonists, who besides a retelling of the major events in Jesus' life enable the audience to obtain a look at the restricted lifestyle of even a wealthy female in the Holy Land. Though the action is limited, readers who want to a wider feminist glimpse of the last days will want to read Ki Longfellow's fascinating biblical tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"I came upon this marvellous story by a rather circuitous route. I recently re-established contact via the internet with an old friend in the UK and he pointed me in the direction of a radio programme about Viv Stanshall, the highly original British artist who was one of his heroes and to whom Ki Longfellow was married. This lead, as these things do in this Google age, to my discovery of Ki and this much admired book.At much the same time a real world acquaintance, who is a born again Christian, had lent me some of his books about the 'truth' of the bible stories, most of which I am sorry to say I found pretty hard going. This book on the other hand could not be more different. It sweeps along, positively movie-like in the rich detail and history of the time. And gnosis, as described by Mary Magadalene and Jesus in this book, reminded me with clarity and simplicity what real spiritual truth is all about.Mary Magdalene's own attempt as John the Less to describe gnosis on pages 122/123 echoed my own after my first experience in 1998. At that time I read an unattributed ancient Indian saying which has stayed with me \\"All that thinking when all we have to do is remember\\". As Ki has Mary say in the book \\"Even now, they stand in the Garden of Eden, and the only leaving they have done is a forgetting\\"This book is extraordinary. As many people have noted in their reviews here it stays with you. I hope I shall not forget again."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"I could hardly put this book down! It was not fast reading for me, usually a fast reader and since I'm not especially familiar with the Bible I wasn't sure where generallyaccepted myth departs and Longfellow's story began. However, it really didn't make any difference. I was completely caught up in this version of the story of Jesus and the Magdalene's relationship, as well as the purpose and meaning of Jesus' life...Quite a departure from the traditional spin and it makes total sense to me. Longfellow breathes life and humanity into all the characters ... and are there ever lots of characters!!The writing is superb, descriptions are so delicious in detail and scope and the obvious researach is mind boggling.

(Maybe people at all times think the world is cracking up?) In my search I've stumbled onto gnosis, and found Home. This book, of all the books I've read, makes it all so easy to see \\"why\\" gnosis is Home. Instead of a scholarly work, or another book trying to fit the Magdalene into an established belief system (ie: religion), this beautiful book creates a truly real woman, someone we can listen to as she learns about gnosis, and therefore so do we.

I've no intention of giving anything away...but I cried for an hour, right through the last fifty pages.

What the author did for Mary's story did not bother me the least, and it did intrigue me, as well as what was done for Mariamne and 'Simon'.What bothered me was the writing. In some parts the writing was awkward and repetitive. I remember one thing that grated me, it was like, 'a table of some sort with a machine of some sort' and that really bothered me, and there is also repetition in some sentences that was really unneccessary.

The new version with the foal brought to mind this book, \\"The Secret Magdalene\\" by Ki Longfellow. Though this is the story of Mary Magdalene, it is also very much the story of her relationship with one very special Donkey named Eio. Eio being the ancient egyptian word for Donkey. The book follows the life of this foal, her friendship with Jesus and Mary Magdalene and her important role she played throughout their lives. A remarkable account! The most poignant quote from the book is one those who love Donkeys can relate to: \\" Leading Eio, I am content to be doing anything\\". This book will make you \\"re-think\\" the Donkey you see in the Flight to Egypt, the Entry into Jerusalem and the Crucifixion images.

Small minded reviewers who gave it poor marks for the writing style miss the fact that it was narrated by Mary as a young girl for most of the book. That adds to its charm and does not detract from its flow; partly because there are so many gaps in historical knowledge here, so a child's perspective works well in this case.

As I am a Christian, this conflicts with my personal beliefs. I enjoyed the book and appreciate it for what it is. This is truly a work of fiction. Many Christians would be offended by the explanations Biblical stories presented here. I am not. People have the right to believe whatever they choose. Personally, I believe Jesus [Yeshua] is The Son of God. (And I think He loved Mary Magdalene very much.)Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\""},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Though the cover states \\"What the DaVinci Code only hinted at, this brings to life\\" is only partially true. Yes, it shows Mary Magdalene as Jesus's companion and intellectual peer, but no, it doesn't reveal any more of their relationship. In fact, it shrouds in diffucult prose what their relationship was, how they spent their time together (other than walking everywhere silently), and how they collectively orchestrated Jesus's resurrection to fulfill prophesy and give the people the Messiah they so desperately needed and sought. Through Mary's voice, it turns the miracles, the parables, and the events described in the Bible as basically misunderstood by the disciples, and therefore calls into question their historical and spiritual validity. This viewpoint, though creative and well-composed, made it all too convenient for me. I'm no Biblical scholar, but I do know some of the pivotal points in the Gospels, and what's more miraculous to me is how Mary Magdalene, whether clothed as herself or as John the Less, is at every one of them and has an explanation as to how they each came to be that's at odds with what's recorded in the gospels. I would agree with an earlier reviewer who found the ending a disappointment. I won't go into it, in case there's a reader out there who doesn't want me to give it away, but be prepared - it will let you down. DaVinci code went further than this, without going into all the details of Mary's (Miriamne's) life. Read it for the interesting perspective, but don't read it for salacious and informed details regarding Mary's and Jesus's relationship."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Although well written, this book takes all the writings of the New Testament regarding Jesus the Christ and his followers as not only ordinary, but, provides a story line that discredits any miraculous happenings, including the resurrection of Jesus. The book provides information on the times and geographical areas mentioned in the New Testament and develops the personalities of various followers of Jesus in ways that are most interesting. However, I would caution anyone planning on reading this book to know that all miraculous events will be given a non-miraculous context."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"The subject fascinates me. The writing style is superb. The author does a wonderful job of taking known Gospel stories and weaving them into this work of fiction with delightful twists. Time is easily lost and the pages seem to turn themselves. So why only 3 stars and no recommendation? The ending. We all know the \\"end\\" of the story of the Gospel of Jesus and I was very much intrigued as to how the author would retell it with a Gnostic twist. But intrigue turned dissapointment. I left the book with a feeling of: Is that it? Is that the climatic end of the story of Yeshu? Eloi! Eloi! This fine story deserved a much better ending."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Looking for spiritual and intellectual nourishment? This comic-book-depth treatment ain't it. A paste-up of lame ideas and actions in annoying and childish prose."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Not one of the worst books I've ever read but pretty close. Sorry I bought it and am not passing it on to friends. Perhaps it was the subject matter that first intrigued and in the end alienated me but I had to force myself to finish because I couldn't believe the plot. I kept hoping for some relevant message. Mary Magdalene, the original feminist and Mary the Mother of God, the worn out, bitter, stay at home Mom? I won't even try to describe her take on Jesus. Not my cup of nectar. I'll certainly make every effort to keep this book a \\"secret\\"."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"If you think this just another \\"religious\\" book, or something merely for questioning Christians, think again. If you think it is just another \\"Grail\\" attempt, wrong again. There is no Grail here. no bloodline, no claiming to be descended from anyone. This is a beautifully written work of spiritual depth and a search for real understanding. It uses the truth/myth of Mary Magdalene to explore questions we've been asking ourselves as humans for as long we could phrase a question at all. No creed is pushed here, nothing is required of us in this book but an open heart and an open mind. It's also a great read, a gripping adventure of mind, body, and spirit. I recommend it most highly."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"As many who know me well are aware, I rarely have a good word for organized religion, and yet will often curl up with a book which concerns man's search for meaning.Recently read \`The Secret Magdalene', and now weeks later I can still feel the vibrancy of that ancient time and her incredible life. Not perhaps the Magdalene most are familiar with, but one whose life, words, ideas and world will transform all who encounter her in this phenomenal adventure.Have been partial to historical novels since first encountering Mika Waltari's \`The Egyptian' as an adolescent. \\"I, Sinhue, the son of Senmut and his wife Kipa, write this...\\" and I had entered another time and a fascinating world. Now more than half a century later I have discovered the exciting and very real world of Yeshu and Magdalene, and all those whose lives they encountered along the way and how each in turn was changed. I felt that I was present as the ideas and concepts of Gnosticism were born and developed. Indeed, I was changing as the protagonists changed.A thought provoking work of infinite beauty. Not just the exquisite telling of a incredible story, but an experience. And one which I will return to again and again."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"I read all the books about Mary I can find. Some are good. Some aren't...although it seems to me that all are sincerely trying to bring Mary Magdalene back from the tomb she's been sealed up in for so long. A few really impress me with how much the writer has read themselves, and how much thought they've given to Mary and to her true place in history, as well as her rightful place in spiritual thought. But none of them are quite like this one. The book took my breath away. It's a novel, which means the author took liberties with the story. But since every New Testament Gospel is also different, I'd say there was a precedent for taking liberties with the life of Jesus. There's so much here. Bible stories, history, adventures, philosophy, interesting connections between historical figures I've heard of, and some I have never heard of. It's so rich and so exciting and so profound, I'm almost at a loss for words. One of the ideas that jumped out at me while I read along, gripped by the story, was this: you cannot \\"learn\\" what Jesus meant just by listening. You don \\"get it\\" by being taught. It's not an intellectual process. No one can \\"teach\\" another person to know God. It has to be deeply felt. So deeply, it can change you on a cellular level. This was what the ancients did with their mystery religions and their Passions. The Egyptians with Osiris, the Greeks with Dionysus. And the earliest Christians with Jesus Christ. The story of Jesus is meant to shake you to the core of your being. It's meant to rack you with feeling: joy, awe, reverence, then pity, then horror, then sorrow. That's what this book does. You follow Magdalene from her childhood to the Cross. And beyond. And on the way, you don't just learn something, you experience the Passion. This is a great book."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Ki Longfellow has achieved, in my opinion, the best Mary Magdalene novel ever written. She has left no trace of the weepy penitent, the sultry courtesan, or the harlot with a heart of gold. Gone are the demons, the groveling, and the superficial saintliness. The Magdalene that has replaced these tired old caricatures is complicated, robust, strong, tender, pensive, awkward, imaginative, and loving. In a word, Mary Magdalene is finally human.The Secret Magdalene brings the world of first century Palestine to life; a rich cultural milieu in which Greek philosophy mingles with Mosaic Law against a highly charged Hellenized backdrop. We follow the story of Mariamne (Mary Magdalene) from a pivotal event in her childhood through her education as a boy, eventually finding herself at a zealot outpost among those seeking a Messiah. While everyone points toward John the Baptist as the One, Mariamne finds herself drawn to his cousin, a red-haired Galilean named Yehoshua. In disguise as a young man named John the Less, Mariamne becomes Yehoshua's best friend and confidant. At about halfway through the book, this relationship is the beginning of a profound and insightful retelling of the Gospel story.Perhaps the greatest joy I found in this book aside from the powerful depiction of a realistic Mary Magdalene was Longfellow's deft ability to convey so much information about the ideas that form the foundation of gnosis, the driving concept behind classical Gnosticism. But so talented is the author that her efforts to educate us are transparent; we learn along with the characters, and because the plot flows so smoothly, the pages seem to just turn themselves. Unlike other books about Mary Magdalene that attempt to convey some larger message, this does NOT read like a dry, preachy tome. It's a literary and philosophical treasure that will be savored by the spiritual seeker and casual reader alike."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"As a feminist and a scholar and a lapsed Catholic, this is the book I knew was out there, or it would be someday. And now, here it is. The Secret Magdalene goes far beyond the usual fare served up in the name of Mary Magdalene. There's no apology for her being a \\"sinner\\" since the only sin this Mary commits is the sin of wanting to be free of a man's world, or if that can't be, at least to be a player in it. Mariamne and her childhood friend Salome long to be magicians and philosophers. They want to read everything they can get their hands on. They want to travel, see the world, have adventures. But the only way they can do that is to become \\"men.\\" In the parlance of the time, to call a woman \\"a man\\" was a great compliment. It meant she held few qualities deemed to be womanly and exhibited other qualities deemed to be manly. You can guess what the womanly qualities were: sly and devious, craven and lustful, foolish and weak. I could go on, but we've all heard the litany. There have been lots of women in the past who've lived as men in order to \\"be\\" something, or to be listened to. I grew up in the Catholic Church and I hated every minute of it beginning around the age of nine when I began to understand what those men standing up at their altar in their matching tablecloths and silly hats were telling me. They were telling me I could not speak out. They said if I as a woman held a mass I would pollute the very air of the Church with my blasphemy. They said God did not see me as he saw a male. After all, God himself was male. And I seethed inside. I hurt. It was hard not to believe these people (out back with their cigarettes before every mass, how well I remember that), since they'd been telling everyone who would listen this same thing for centuries. But if Mary Magdalene was as The Secret Magdalene (and I bet she was), then with her \\"second coming,\\" how she would lament the church founded in her companion's name. Read this book. Treasure this book. Understand this book. There's TRUTH in it. Much more than I ever found in the church of my childhood."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"An absolutely fascinating version of what might well have been. So many questions answered here that have never been even half answered to my knowledge by the usual theologian. Assuming Jesus actually lived and wasn't a new myth constructed from very old myth (and accepted slowly as \\"fact\\" by the literalists who flocked to the new and divisive Christianity, all guided with guile by those determined to have a male priesthood controlling the people), or assuming he wasn't a composite of many men...why did Jesus do what he did? What did he teach? Who did he think he was? What did he think he would be giving to his people by acting the scapegoat? More precisely, what was he saying by acting out the ancient role of godman for the Jews? Even if he were God on earth as so many claim (though not until three or so hundred years after his death, and then it was put to a vote and almost didn't make it; just think...today we could be shouting PRAAAAYS MITHRAS!), there must have been strong meaning behind his actions, and the symbols he chose to surround himself with must tell us something important--if only we understood them. Even if he were God on earth, those around him were men and woman. What did they think they were doing? Who did they think they were following? And what were the times really like? The Bible gives few clues, seems almost to obscure the feel of place and time as if Jesus existed in a peaceful world of skipping lambs and miracles only he could perform and a lot of mustard seeds. The truth is he lived in a world little different than the one that exists in the Middle East right now. It was full of miracle workers and healers and those who called themselves \\"messiah.\\" It was overrun with fanatical zealots. If the zealots had had Chinese gunpowder back then, they would have been the kind of terrorists we see today: strapping bombs round their waists, blowing away \\"unbelievers.\\" But since they only had knives, they hid these knives under their clothes...and were every bit as terrifying. Each carried a big Persian dagger called a sica. They were called the \\"Sicarii,\\" or knifemen. Rushing into crowds, they would stab a chosen priest or politician or \\"Scorner of the Law\\" and slip quickly away. (Doesn't Sicarii sound very like Iscariot?...a word connected to the name of Judas which no one has ever really explained. Judas the Iscariot. Judas the Sicarii. Judas the Zealot. Judas was, if not the brother of Jesus, one of his closest companions. So who was Jesus?) \\"The Secret Magdalene's\\" answers to these questions made my heart race with the sheer pleasure of discovery. Longfellow's treatment of the two brothers, Yeshu and Jude (twins with red hair, very clever if you know the symbology: actors, tricksters), made them the most resolute of men, the most gallant of friends, the most self-sacrificing of heroes. I followed their lives as I would follow a Shakespearean drama. I came to love them as if they were my own two brothers. I got my heart broken by them. As for the ending, the ending of this book haunts me.As for the Magdalene herself, here called Mariamne Magdel-eder (tower of the flock)...this Magdalene, who speaks so honestly and so beautifully, was heart and brain and soul and she left me in tears. I could listen to her voice forever."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"Told solely in the voice of Mary Magdalene (throughout the book calledMariamne, eventually to be called Magdal-eder, or She of the TempleTower), this book begins when Mariamne is still a child in the home ofher prosperous Jewish father, a glass merchant. Her mother dead, heronly friend a ward of her father's called Salome (an Egyptian raised inJerusalem), and her only confidante a fierce body slave named Tata,Mariamne is highly intelligent, always curious, and desperate forknowledge. Along with Salome, a child of wit, insight, and cruelty,Mariamne finds herself banned from her privileged home and dependent onthe care and concern of a mysterious man called Seth. Eventually allthree find themselves living for seven years in the Great Library ofAlexandria.This is an immensely inventive book, a book that turns the known and notso known gospels on their heads, revealing meaning in them virtuallyunique in my experience. To have a familiar story turned inside out isto view it so differently that the meaning we think we know, becomesinstead revelatory.Through Salome we meet a John the Baptist who is both sly and childlike,wise and brash, a loveable frightening man, willing to lose his life tosave his chosen people. Through Mariamne we meet Jesus. This Jesus,known to her as Yeshu, is deeply complex, driven, a man of his times,and yet a man for all times. Raised as zealous for the Law, yet he is aman tortured by \\"visions,\\" called on by a god who speaks so completelyat odds from the jealous angry violent god he has been taught to follow,that his torment almost breaks him. Only by meeting Mariamne throughtheir mutual friend Seth, does he slowly and painfully come to termswith the harsh demands of a simple man called on to be more than anyman. He is the hero, reluctant, in constant hope of escaping hisdestiny, yet ultimately bowing to the inevitable, at which point hefulfills his \\"destiny\\" with a triumph of will almost unbearable in theimplications of its choice...for he has a choice and by choosing it,rather than turning away, he uplifts our souls.And all the while we follow Mariamne as witness, as student, as teacher,as philosopher, as companion, as a woman perhaps unique in literature.She is not merely a disciple or a witness. She too is gifted with visionand she too struggles with \\"knowing\\" god. But in the mouth of MariamneMagdal-eder we learn it is not \\"a god,\\" a being, something outside theself, it is perfect love and inherent divinity that seeks us and whom weseek.As for Judas...this Judas is almost more a hero than any other in thisextraordinary tale of tales. A double of his brother Jesus, a booncompanion, Judas does what is needed when it is needed, sealing his fatefor all time as betrayer, yet without him Jesus could not become the\\"Christ.\\"Mariamne's voice is a voice to be heard. It speaks to us with a clearring of human honesty and doubt but also with a voice beyond our normalvoice, that of a visionary making thrilling sense of reality inunforgettable sentences replete with the meaning we all seek."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"While speaking of \\"The Gospel of John,\\" Origen (who was a brilliant Egyptian philosopher and one of the greatest of the early Christian theologians) once wrote: \\"John does not always tell the truth literally. But John always tells the truth spiritually.\\" Since Origen is long gone in body, I guess it's up to me to paraphrase him now, and say: \\"The Secret Magdalene does not always tell the truth literally. But The Secret Magdalene always tells the truth spiritually.\\"This is a book of profound understanding. Yes, there is the impressive scholarship. Yes, there is everything here...from the politics of the times (Romans, Greeks, Jews, Samaritans, Egyptians, Persians, Arab tribesmen--and just like now, they're all up to something, and very little of it any good), to the variations in dress (blond hair was in fashion, plucked from the heads of northern slaves), to the brisk trade in opium (rosh, opion: the best came through Crete and was used all over the Holy Land without a useless, not to say stupid, War On Drugs...which meant there were no Drug Lords and no drug runners and no vicious killings for the price of a fix...but I think I'm digressing here.) As I was saying, it's all here: myriad gods and goddesses which filled this long gone world with vivid color--as well as the usual all-too-human strife. (As in: My God can beat up your God.) And yes, the writing is wonderful for all the reasons writing can be wonderful. Like Nabokov, there is the delicacy of feeling. Like Austin, there is an acute eye for human character. Like Thomas Wolfe, there is lyricism. And like Dumas, there is just plain tearaway story telling. But Longfellow's understanding of her subject--which is \\"gnosis,\\" beginning with a deep spiritual longing, an acute heart-filled desire to \\"know\\" God, and ending, if one so blesses oneself, with a direct face-off with God as Ultimate Consciousness--is unlike anything I've ever come across in my own search for truth, or meaning, or enlightenment, or just plain common sense. (I can't contain myself, must digress again. If I may, I'd like to bring us all the way back from Origen of one thousand eight hundred years ago to George Harrison and yesterday--\\"I really want to know you, I really want to go with you, and it takes so long I know, oh my Lord, my sweet Lord.\\" Here's hoping George is playing a few licks with \\"ALL THERE IS\\" right this eternal minute. I'd give my left goolie to hear that concert.) In other words, The Secret Magdalene, through the totally absorbing story of the Magdalene herself (Mariamne Magdal-eder, a woman I would give my back teeth to know, then or now) is about the true nature of reality and our place in it. Now brothers and sisters, that's what lifts this book high above all others like it (are there any like it?) and makes it soar with MEANING.Read this one. If you're like me and like so many others, all searching for something our religions no longer give us (if they ever did) and you can't be bothered with New Age hokum, plus! you'd love to get your nose into a good book and a brilliant read, here it is...waiting for you."},{"Title":"The Secret Magdalene: A Novel","review":"I'm a Christian.

All of this matters little to me. What matters is the story of Jesus Christ. The story of Jesus Christ is the story of us all as we stumble through this world, trying our best to do our best. The way this book told the story of Jesus made my heart soar with love for all men and all women. It made me bleed with sorrow.

Gibson is definitely cutting edge in his writing with regards to incorporating technology and creating new terms. Everything that I've read by him has been based far enough in the future to be new, but close enough that the world is still real and not made up of flying cars and alien races. In other words, cyberpunk but try not to get the negative feelings about that word that a lot of people get. Instead this is an intense thriller incorporating virtual reality, designer drugs, new age weaponry, new religions and many other things which quickly pull you into this world rather than your own. It centers around two people: one an ex-cop and ex-rent-a-cop and the bicycle messenger. They quickly find their lives colliding over the theft of a pair of sunglasses.

It captivated it's audience with a dizzying mixture of dark, complex and fantastic elements in a distant future. His newer works are set in a realer, nearer future.The characters are readily identifiable, so that you feel like you've read about them before. They are tough and vulnerable in all the right places. The story swims through a realistic universe, diving and turning at it's own will. The writing style revives my favourite elements of his past works, including the shifting from one character's point of view to another.If the movie of &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; hadn't been such a poor representation of the short story, I would recommend that this book enjoy similar Hollywood attention. I've read this book twelve times, twice of which were still in the book store. (I still don't own a copy!) I doubt any newcomer to Gibson's universe could be displeased by what they find lurking in the pages of Virtual Light, and I know that no fan of his previous works could. Read it. Re-read it. Even purchase a copy if need be"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"here is gibson getting out of his neuromancer series'rut (everything was a slow downhill after neuromancer).wholly different, its more like fiction written in thefuture than like fiction written about the future. hedoesn't stop to explain every little new piece of technologynor does he condescend to make every new thing somepolitical statement about the present. his most engrossingbook yet."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"William Gibson is an author that creates characters and situations that capture your imagination. When you put one of his books down your thoughts stay with the story. Gibson is a major player in the Sci-Fi genre. His visions of technology and the world to come have influenced many other visions from the TV shows like Dark Angel to films like the Matrix.Fans of Gibson's work love and hate Virtual Light. In one hand his writing style is still there but the high technology of Neuromancer has been replaced by a less advanced technological culture. Those readers expecting another high adrenaline rush through the matrix almost gave up on virtual light. One of the appeals of Gibson's work is the vision of technology. The world of Virtual light predates the world of Neuromancer by leaps. The Eye phones and goggles take the place of the nerve-splicing and micro bionics seen in his earlier work. The lesser technology almost seems childish in comparison but it does provide an intermediate step for those of us who hope and wish for a glimpse of the matrix as a reality. \\"Virtual Light\\" leans more to the characters and plot than earlier work and gives a rich smooth story some times humorous some times sad. The characters take on more than just three dimensions. You can feel them grow and develop as the story continues. Now, if your new to Gibson start with \`Virtual Light' then read the sequels \`Idoru' and \`All Tomorrow's Parties' to get a feel of Gibson's style and technology. Then brace yourself and take the leap to \`Neuromancer', \`Count Zero', \`Mona Lisa Overdrive' and finish up with the collection of short stories that is \`Burning Chrome'. On the other hand if you've already read \`Neuromancer' or its sequels then try to put aside the lack of technology and just enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This is the first book in the trilogy (Virtual Light, Idoru, All Tomorrows parties), and a good place to start if you are new to Gibson.In my and most peoples opinion, it is only second to Neuromancer, not because of style or content, but because it's not as revolutionary and original.William Gibson is excellent in describing characters, technology and environment. This book represents a 'new' style for him (as opposed to Neuromancer, Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive). He focuses more on the characters and their travel to the new semi-dystopian world of technology.At the end you'll want to get your hands on a copy of the sequels (Idoru, All Tomorrows Parties). What the heck! Just buy them too right now!"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Virtual Light is a good read. Although very different than Neuromancer, William Gibson's cyberpunk classic, it is still very well written. The book is not only suspenseful, fast-paced, and imaginative, but it has just a hint of humor throughout. All of these things make you want to keep turning the pages, just to see what Chevette and Rydell will do next.Chevette is a bicycle messenger with an attitude. After some tough luck, she finally has her life pretty much on track and doesn't want to screw it up. Rydell went through some rough times too, but finally has a job that looks promising. He gets hired to help with the hunt for Chevette after she steals a pair of glasses, and something goes wrong.The plot of the book jumps around at first. It's a bit confusing, but after a few chapters you get the hang of it, and kind of figure out what is going on. The use of technology in the book was surprisingly sparse, compared to many other cyberpunk novels. What I especially liked was Gibson's use of humor. It was thrown in, in all the right places, which really made the book more interesting.Gibson describes all the characters in the book very vividly. It is very easy to sense what they are thinking and feeling. He also creates a vivid setting. Rydell moves from Tennessee to what used to be California, but is now NoCal and SoCal, two different states. All aspects of the setting are believable and conceivable. This is only the second Gibson novel I've read, but I liked it better than Neuromancer. Everything was much easier to believe and understand, and the entire novel was action packed. The suspense of the book wouldn't let me put it down."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Virtual Light is very much a departure from the world of Neuromancer, showing instead an insidiously closer-to-home look at a possible near future. The grittiness and vivid bleakness are still there, but they make up a different picture: our own society, just a little bit worse. The result is a bit more believable, but neither better nor worse; it's just a slightly different perspective.Similar in style to Neuromancer's sequels (yet with a bit more substance), the story is actually composed of several stories that meet up throughout the course of the book; each is important. Gibson manages to get a strong feeling of tension going as the characters become more deeply mired in their plight. The story's villain, Loveless, is creepier and more dangerous than expected, adding a sense that the stakes are higher than they seem and that nothing is predictable.Idoru, set in the same universe as Virtual Light, I'd say is slightly better, but Virtual Light shouldn't be missed. No Gibson fan should pass this up; anyone new to his work should start with Neuromancer and read Virtual Light next."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Chevette, the heroine in Virtual Light, is one of Gibson's finest creations, a bicycle messenger who lives on the Golden Gate bridge with a lot of other homeless people. She's a spunky, streetwise kid, sexy and vulnerable, who hasn't yet lost her innocence. Gibson is obviously a little bit in love with her, as any male would be who reads the novel.Rydell, the hero, is a security cop assigned to San Francisco to help recover a pair of what appear to be sunglasses stolen by Chevette from an obnoxious masher who had been entrusted with them. Like all Gibson's heros, Rydell is both tough and sensitive, a kind of street samurai of the future.Despite the charm of the leading characters, the central gimmick-dark glasses that show the wearer where new developments will be built in San Francisco-seems rather mundane in comparison with the cornucopia of technological wonders he created in earlier novels. Plus, the plot is the old one where villains, trying to learn where the city will build next, will kill anyone or do anything to get inside information because it means a lot of money.The novel is a bit of a disappointment, though not a total loss. Gibson seems to have trouble with conclusions. The one to this novel involves an air strike by characters difficult to tell who they are, what they are doing, or why they are doing it. Yet, it's no worse than other popular thrillers, and it contains a fine cast of fascinating characters."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Virtual Light was my first cyber-punk book and my first William Gibson book. I had to read it three times to make any sense of it. Once I wrapped my mind around the odd wordage of the story, I love it!! I really enjoyed the weird characters and the odd off-the-wall twists in the plot. The story possesses a bent sense of humor which I found to be really different. This book introduced me to the cyber-punk genre and I am hooked."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Gibson is possibly the most consistently original of any sf author of his generation. In this world of our near future (2005, according to the flap copy, but I don't think he's that explicit in the text), almost everything has been privatized, the U.S. has devolved into independent region-nations, and wealth and power enforce the divisions in society. Berry Rydell, a young ex-cop from Knoxville, is working for a private \\"armed response\\" outfit in Los Angeles until he screws up and is sent off to San Francisco as a driver for a skiptracer. Mr. Yamazaki, a Japanese student of social psychology and anthropology, is fascinated by the squatter community that took over the Oakland Bay Bridge, which was abandoned after the big quake. One of the bridge's residents is Chevette Washington, a bike messenger in the city, who looks after one of the aging pioneers of the bridge community -- but she also screws up, lifting what she thinks is just an expensive pair of shades from an annoying guy at a party. The glasses embody a secret that would destroy a lot of careers and Rydell's employer wants them back. Chevette is a marvelous character, as is Yamazaki, who enables the reader to see things from a truly foreign perspective. Gibson, a master of metaphor, never wastes a word. A terrific read."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This is one of Gibson's best works, as good as Neuromancer. It does have a few flaws, but they don't detract too much.What's good about it? The prose style, to start with: rich, dense, polished: all the usual Gibson attributes. The plot (most of the time) tugs you along; the characters; the background; the humor (the quiet sort, that has you gently chuckling about once every two pages and is usually based on parody/satire of current trends). The richness of the weave.Gibson is obviously an adherent of Checkhov's &quot;gun hanging on the wall&quot; philosophy: there isn't an unused incident in the entire complicated work, nothing that happens is just-for-local-color, everything ties up with something else. Usually with two or three something-else's, with an unspoken invitation to start thinking about the implications of this in society. A few times I found myself thinking &quot;why is he including this?&quot;, but there was always a reason further along the line.The book lends itself to this strand-in-the-weave approach, being written at least some of the time in very short chapters, so that we move from one scene/set of characters to another in an approach that comes to resemble the textual equivalent of sound-bites or video clips. After a series of several 1 1/2 page chapters, I found myself recalling Eliot's &quot;The Waste Land&quot;:These fragments have I shor'd against my ruinDon't know if Gibson intended that particular allusion, though of course it fits in so well with the general background of the book. But the video-clip approach to writing is surely saying something about the age the book is set in.What are the bad points? To start with, it was written in 1993, and the blurb says it's set in 2005. Reading it today, in 2003, it would be much more believable if it were set in around 2020. In general, it seems to me a bad idea to write a sci-fi novel set only 12 years in the future, if only because you're limiting the period of time during which it stays believable and therefore you can sell it. Moreover, if Gibson intended the date to be 2005, he has problems here and there with his characters: most of them are in their 20s, they can't really not remember everything from the 1990s; the one who says he wasn't born in 1980 must have been born by around 1981, which is cutting it pretty fine. And he has problems with the time-scale in general: given the post-catastrophe setting, there hasn't been time, in 12 years, for the series of catastrophes that resulted in the present world situation, the development of the political situation as a result, the rebuilding, and the settling down into a new equilibrium, which must have existed for several years, since several of the characters don't remember what it was like before. But I think Gibson is much too experienced and intelligent a writer to make this sort of mistake, and in fact I couldn't find any reference to an exact year in the text itself. Just disregard what the blurb says.Secondly, the ending: surprisingly weak and also rushed-over, considering how good the plot has been up to now. But by the time you get to the ending, believe me, you've had your money's worth.Gibson makes you work hard, fitting the pieces together. In general this is a Good Thing, but occasionally degenerated to the level of irritating.I had a slight problem with the narrator: after the first few chapters ask yourself, who is the narrator? Most chapters are told in the style used by that chapter's protagonist, which makes you feel, even though the narration is 3rd-person, that you're seeing the world through that character's eyes. But why the sparse, timeless, almost dreamlike style of the two chapters that describe the courier's action? Very far removed from his personality, if you consider his actions and believe the comments on him by the other characters. Must be a reason but I couldn't figure it out.So why 5 stars? Because, even though nobody's perfect, not even Gibson, I've yet to see anybody else do it better."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Excellent book. The concept of The Bay Bridge in San Francisco being taken over by the homeless is worth reading this book alone. There are other reasons too like great new characters (Rydell and Chevette) and new Gibson visions (the future of AIDS and security guards). This book is the first in a new series. This book not only has no Molly (too bad) but less of a focus on the internet and more focus on our future society. In my opinion he leaves too many loose ends at the end of his books and he tried very hard not to do this with Virtual Light."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Virtual Light left me kind of cold, but it wasn't until after reading it that I realized why: it is *too* Gibsonian. The usual Gibson textures are there, with a few delicious nuggets like bridges becoming squatting grounds and police state satellites, but in other areas his technology vision seems constrained to everyday objects like laptops and airplane video games. The real fault here is the incredibly light plot. Things seem to happen for no reason, and I found myself skipping ahead, looking for the next techno-description. Plot has never been WG's strong suit (quick, anybody remember the plot of Count Zero or Mona Lisa?) but the rewards for enduring it here are comparatively thin. If you're looking for post-Neuromancer-era Gibson, pick up Idoru instead."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"The first cyberpunk novel I have ever read. I was not disappointed one bit and was even pleasantly surprised with how much i enjoyed it. The ideas in this text were amazing and really got my mind thinking. The social structure built on the bridge, a collage of scrap that, together made up peoples lives. The religion based around television, The computor based dictatorship - all totally believable and even probable as the human desire and dependence for and upon technology increases daily. The charcters are difficult to penatrate but dont be fooled into thinking that they are superficial or underdeveloped, they are as deep and real as you and I and are worth the effort spent in the uncovering of their layers."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This book has a little less tech than I expected from Gibson. Indeed, the virtual light glasses, although a driving part of the story line, played a very small role in the story as far as actually being used for anything. Far more interesting to me is Gibson's portrayal of the social structure built on the remains of the Bay Bridge, how bits of junk and scraps of lives formed a microcosm of the larger NoCal/SoCal world but with its own rules and mores or lack thereof. I found the characters well fleshed out and sympathetic. The book moved a a good pace with several interesting storylines. The depiction of SF bike couriers was cool too. A solid start to this trilogy."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"As a former San Franciscan myself, I liked his vision of the Bay Area's future. And I always love the detailed landscapes he creates. I always feel like I'm getting a real glimpse into the near future when I read his work. However with this novel things begin to feel a little formulaic for me. His novels all seem to start with loosely related story lines that gradually grow closer together. Still, a very fun read."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"no descriptions of what it is eg: polygons etc, but how people interact with and deal with tech, the Gibson three b rule applies here Bridges, Bums, and Billionares A reasonable read"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"After reading Virtual Light's description on the back of the book, I was extremely interested in the fact that virtual reality was going to be a major factor in the story. However, the glasses hardly had anything to do with the story itself. I kept waiting for the importance of the glasses to become relevant, only to be disappointed by the dismal truth (which I won't reveal), and could hardly understand how stealing them could &quot;get you killed!&quot; Give me a break! However, Gibson's story telling is captivating as always, and his descriptions of San Francisco are splendid. I was compelled to buy another of his books as a result of reading it, and hope to enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Well, I read all the reviews, and was quity surprised by all the different opinnions, and i won't argue with people that didn't liked it, it is their point of view, and it is good that way. For me this book was great, the plot was just an extention of what i read in &quot;specialized&quot; newspapers, the characters where attaching, the technology was so damn close of what whe have here and now, maybe not his best work, but a great work indeed, i liked it and i just wanted to tell i liked it, as i liked all of his work."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I had been a fan of Gibson for some time before I had read Virtual Light, but when I touched this book I was blown away. This is quite simply Gibson's best work, creating a society based entirely on the absence of planning, and then cementing that society with some of the wildest characters ever to hit paper since The Stand. If you read no other Gibson book, read this book."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely, and I have tried to read Gibson's books &quot;in order&quot; (Neuromancer, Count Zero, Mona Lisa, and then this one). Although some people may be quite right in claiming that this book contains not quite the technological visions in the great quantities that were in his previous writings, the plot moved along at a quick pace.Yes, his writing style would be considered sparse, and in this one even more so than usual, but the characters were interesting, and I guess I found the habitation of the Bridge to be fascinating. I think if you are wanting hard core tech, look elsewhere. However if you enjoy a writing style which to me personally was more a mix of pulp and some sci-fi, than you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Gibson is most definitely one of science fiction's best writers. The characters in this book are very vivid and the technology he describes is fascinating. The bridge was a great concept, as was the Shapely sub-story, I also was intrigued by the television watching Christian sect.This book, and others like it, are what make reading a great form of escape and entertainment for me and thousands of other people. Check this one out!"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I have not been able to get the story, setting or characters from this book out of my head. I still dream about it. I was profoundly astonished to find this gem. I think it is his very finest by far."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"zzzzzzzzzzzz. A dreadful waste of time. No plot, no story, lots of endless running around to no purpose"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"You William Gibson fans have got to be kidding. I slogged through 60 pages of \`\`Virtual Light,'' then rang up the white flag. It wasn't as bad as Anne Rice's \`\`Violin'' (I got only 50 pages on that one), but it was close. There's a reason why much science fiction is dismissed as little more than weak plots and lousy writing, and \`\`Virtual Light'' is a case in point. The characters are cartoonish, the writing mediocre and unsubtle (Aaron Pursley -- gee, uh, is that Elvis? Duh.), and the plot about as interesting as a George Bush speech. In closing, let me say that I'm not an anti-sci-fi snob. I loved \`\`Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' and \`\`Voyager,'' though not nearly as good, is still pretty entertaining. But there's something to be said for craftsmanship and intelligence, be it in science fiction or any other creative endeavor. Ernie Torres."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This book has almost nothing to do with virtual reality, and left me feeling somewhat ripped off. All dystopia, no VR. And he named it Virtual Light!If you're interested in a good VR read, check out Tad Williams's Otherland series instead. Much, much more entertaining. Gibson is sadly overrated."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"While reading this book, I got the distince impression that Gibson got the inspiration for this novel right after he finished reading Neal Stephenson's &quot;Snow Crash&quot;.They both have a bad-ass protagonist who is down on his luck (this one is a former cop working a crappy security guard job, Snow Crash has a sword figher/hacker working as a pizza driver). They both have a young female main character (this one has some punk kid, Snow Crash has a courier skater chick). They both have some rich guy trying to take over the world, and only underworld types to stop them (this one has the 'villiage people' from the bay bridge and some mysterios hacker group, Snow Crash has the protagonist's hacker buddies and the mafia).The plot and characters are basically borrowed from Snow Crash. This book as a *few* memorable parts, but is pretty boring. Snow Crash, however, is an interesting, exciting rollercoaster ride of a book.Skip this, and go read Snow Crash. If you are jones'in for some Gibson, go read (or reread) the Neuromancer series; it seems that Bill blew his creative load on those ones, because everything he wrote since Mona Lisa Overdrive is garbage."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Virtual Light is not in the same hardcore cyberpunk categoryof Neuromancer. It is much more a suspense/action thrillerset in a fragmented California of the 21st century. Gibsoncreates 21st century jargon and pulls you into the futurein just a few pages. I found the book as fascinating as Ifound it entertaining."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I make a point of reading this book every summer. The plot is straightforward enough--like almost all cyberpunk, it involves people getting their hands on forbidden data and being hunted by its rightful owners--but what I really enjoy is the human landscape that Gibson relates. The book is full of images that, for whatever reason, connected with me on a visceral level: the lonely back roads of future California, Skinner's bridgetop apartment, L.A.'s endless convenience stores and strip malls...Gibson keeps his characters moving, and successfully (at least in my case) replicates the strange, gut-level nervousness and odd euphoria of driving around an unfamiliar part of the country at nighttime. It's essentially a cyber-noir road trip story, and the journey is infinitely more significant (and fun) than the destination.Gibson is cursed to forever take pot-shots from overhormoned teenagers for not rewriting NEUROMANCER again and again. And on rereading NEUROMANCER on the heels of reading VIRTUAL LIGHT, I noticed something for the first time: Gibson's original trilogy (NEUROMANCER/COUNT ZERO/VIRTUAL LIGHT) is missing a human heart at its center. Those books are totally concerned with looking sleek and sexy, full of meaningless sex and casual violence. Characters exist to do kewl things with gadgets and die unpleasantly. VIRTUAL LIGHT and its followups (IDORU and ALL TOMORROW'S PARTIES) are different. When violent things happen in these books, it's genuinely affecting because A) it's rare and B) we actually care about the people these things are happening to. Rydell, hero of VIRTUAL LIGHT, is a goofy and charming twentysomething guy from Memphis, Tennessee whose biggest ambition in life is to hold down a paying job. His problems are real, and if Gibson's readers were plunged into the world he writes about, I have a feeling we'd have a lot more in common with Rydell than with a sexy hacker superman like Case."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Please please please do not let this be your first or only Gibson book. It is incredibly shallow, trite and painfully contrived. Get Neuromancer instead, because it is a much more deeply woven story."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"&quot;Virtual Light&quot; reveals yet another dimension to William Gibson's splendid writing. Largely absent are lyrical passages describing cyberspace technology that are among the hallmarks of his &quot;Cyberspace&quot; trilogy and &quot;Sprawl&quot; series of short stories. Instead, he emphasizes personalities at the expense of technology. He seems fascinated with how that technology interacts with the seeemingly mundane lives of his downtrodden characters. Both Rydell and Chevette are among his most intriguing creations since Case and Molly; how their parallel tales weave and ultimately intersect is an outcome that I found most rewarding. Once more, Gibson offers some sly, thoughtful commentary on our media-dominated culture; a persistent theme throughout his &quot;Virtual Light&quot; trilogy, including &quot;Idoru&quot; and &quot;All Tomorrow's Parties&quot;. Those who've enjoyed Gibson's crisp, lyrical prose, but have searched in vain for well rounded, three-dimensional characters will not be disappointed with &quot;Virtual Light&quot;. Although less intense than &quot;Neuromancer&quot; as a literary joyride, it stands alongside Gibson's award-winning debut as among his finest works of fiction."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This book was OK. It was enjoyable and I read it fairly quickly. I didn't enjoy it as much as Snow Crash (Neal Stephenson). The main point of the book Virtual Light (?? don't get me wrong but I assumed this was the main topic) was totaly under developed and wasted. Some of the imagery was nice but I do feel that there was a lot of things that were left out. As said before-charachter development. I never realy felt like I was in anyons head. This seemed like a poor excuse for a novel from someone what would only get publish as he was before."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This was my first foray into cyberguru Gibson's realm, and the blend of cyberpunk and noir worked pretty well for me. Clearly Gibson is more interested in showing off his skills at imagining the gadgets and lifestyles of the near future, rather than providing any intricate plot. Indeed, the tale of a bike courier who unwittingly steals what turns out to be technology to die for, combined with a down and out former cop hired to help retrieve the missing item, rehashes some fairly familiar noir territory. But the evocation of a neighborhood built on the now unused Bay Bridge is good stuff. I especially enjoyed the clueless Japanese grad student who's trying to write an anthropology thesis about the neighborhood. If you like this, try Jonathan Lethem's &quot;Gun With Occasional Music.&quot;"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I really liked some of the ideas in this novel, but it doesn't seem like Gibson really runs with very many of them. The title, the cover, and the back intro of the novel, suggests that it will be about this cool virtual reality glasses, but they really play a small part of the novel, the reader barely gets to see them in action. I liked the main characters, even though it takes about 200 pages for them to really meet, which seems abit odd. I don't think this is one of Gibson's better books, but don't let this one stop you from reading some of this other novels, especially Neuromancer."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"If you enjoyed Count Zero, Neuromancer, and others, then you'll like this. It's part of a trilogy involving Ridell, a rent-a-cop in gibson's cyberpunk world of future earth, and all of the wonderful and rich characters in his six degrees."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I bought this book in paperback and I plan to purchase it in hard back for my collection and read it again (and again).

I recommend reading all the books in the series. I really enjoyed them."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This was an awesome book!

When you are done, be sure to check out the &quot;sort of&quot; sequal 'All Tomorrows Parties'!!"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Unlike many of his works, Virtual Light is a simple notch ahead on the timeline. Russian cops in Frisco. A simple act by a bike courier triggers the wrath of international business and their hirelings. Next year's quake turns the bay bridge into a squatter's paradise, with dripping rain and power spikes. It could happen soon and the pace never stops in this thriller where technology is not the star, just stuff all around us as we try to survive. I read it and lost sleep one night. Curious thing, though, often I see parts of Virtual Light in clips on the web, and the news. It douses the 19th century Doctrine of Progress and takes Futurists down to a gritty reality. A must read for anyone who cares what's over the top of tomorrow"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I read this book based on the reviews here and also based on a Wikipedia article about the bridge trilogy.None of the characters is memorable in fact, I could not care less about any of them. The stolen glasses simply did not add anything to this book, it wasn't even a coherent story! Character meandering about San Francisco, describing the city really did not help the story.This was simply a collection of words thrown together without any semblance of a story.i will not be reading anything else by this author, I should have borrowed this book from the library!"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"If you are looking for an adrenaline filled roller-coaster ride then you should look elsewhere. While far from boring this book is like a fine whiskey in that it is meant to be consumed slowly and enjoyed thoroughly. The characters are memorable not for heroic traits or super-human abilities. They are instead memorable as basically normal people who are thrust into extraordinary circumstances. It becomes a true delight when we are given glimpses into their thoughts. This trilogy is at least as good as his Neuromancer trilogy and there is an odd, intriguing asymmetry between the underlying themes of the two trilogies."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Reading a Gibson novel is an act of faith. He weaves seemingly tenuous threads into a vivid plot. Don't expect to fully comprehend where you're going until you're well into his story. Looking at the last pages doesn't help, either. Let him carry you through the story. It's worth the effort. Gibson's characterizations are peerless, even though so many of his people seem outlandish in our perception. His eye for the future is unmatched. Harlan Ellison's dictum that \\"SF\\" means \\"speculative fiction\\" and not \\"science fiction\\" finds its greatest expression in Gibson's works. This book, which became the introduction to a trilogy, is a fine example of all these elements.Berry Rydell was a Tennessee copper. Caught up in bizarre circumstances while \\"protecting the public,\\" he becomes a Cop In Trouble. If policemen today think \\"political correctness\\" has impaired their effectiveness, wait until they see the future Gibson has in store for them. Lawsuits resulting from law enforcement activities are rampant. But the police have support. It comes from media producers who see enhanced viewer capture in publicizing these cases. Who but Gibson could view the corporate mentality with such perception? By the time of this story, corporate America has built up such a web of interfaces between themselves and the world it becomes impossible to extricate them. Rydell views video screens with the question \\"Woman or machine?\\" arising with distressing frequency. Driven from the police force, Rydell takes up with a security firm and relocated to Los Angeles. It's a drastically different world compared to Knoxville, but he hasn't seen anything yet. Before long he's in San Francisco, then off to Texas. Beyond mere survival, which is increasingly problematic, he's seeking a piece of advanced technology - the virtual light glasses. Gibson doesn't dwell on the technology behind this device. He's more concerned with the forces surrounding its possessor. Why do the questors go to such extremities to recover these glasses? Rydell represents us all. He remains honest while working among those clearly outside the law. But it isn't the individuals who bring such tension into Rydell's life. His stress is ultimately due to the hidden agencies with which he must deal. They are faceless and obscure. They impart information of vague worth with a deviousness a Delphic oracle would envy. He isn't even clear whether he's dealing with individuals or cabals. Lofty and condescending, they give him but little satisfaction and what's given is clearly on their terms alone.It's these faceless entities that Gibson warns us of as he [and we] contemplate the future. Corporate operations are disappearing from view as their powers grow from local to global influence. They can tap growing information resources and their decisions, which impact our lives daily, are taken far removed from our scrutiny. Gibson uses Rydell to exhibit how helpless we're becoming in their grasp. Gibson shows they are subject to no accountability to law or popular review as they make \\"globalization\\" a new reality. We can only watch in awe as they form a new ruling class in world society. That Gibson can do this within the realm of captivating fiction garners our admiration. That this book begins a new trilogy commands us to follow where he leads. His view is far reaching and we are grateful he shares that vision with us.

It sounded like it would be in the vein and vision of James Cameron's \\"Dark Angel\\", one of my favourite T.V. shows of all time. Also the No-Cal and So-Cal concept sounded neat. However, the back cover summary turned out to be the best thing about this mess; this novel is terrible.The main thing I have to complain about with Virtual Light is the author's writing style. It is immensely confusing and short-phrased. After the first few chapters, I felt completely lost, and thought to myself: Who is this? What is that? Obviously Gibson did not feel the need to develop characters. I completely agree with an earlier reviewer who pointed out that Gibson writes as though him and the reader are sharing some kind of inside joke. I have 3 words for Gibson; Background, Character, Development!! One can not get thrown into the middle of a story without any development whatsoever and be expected to figure out things by himself but this is exactly what Gibson does to the reader. I'll admit that Gibson has a very active imagination, however the way he writes frustrates me to no end.So for those of you looking for a good cyberpunk read, I would recommend looking elsewhere. I'm going to try Neal Stephenson's \\"snow crash\\" next, hopefully I won't be as dissapointed."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"&quot;Why can't you give zero stars?&quot; I'm sorry that the person who said this feels that way, because to me everything that Gibson has written provides an enjoyable experiance. &quot;Technology that isn't fully explained...don't know what it does or how it does it...&quot; Gibsons ambiguity is what makes the books interesting. He gives skeletal details, and your imagination fills in the details. Techno-babble and an alternate future make for an interesting story despite, or maybe because of, the lackluster plot and un-inspired characters, but an interesting story it is, which means that it's a good book."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Gibson has obvious literary talents and raw skill at writing, but reading much of his opus it seems that he's applying them in the wrong way. Certainly that's my feeling after reading Virtual Light. Ultimately it's a story with a flimsy plot (I always find with Gibson's stuff that a month later I can never remember the plot), unlikable characters and a dirty setting where people do seedy things. As a dystopian novel it fails to adequately commit to its setting, to explore root causes, or to showcase essential dysfunction. In technology is feels unimagnative, a projection of today's conventional tech wisdom and cliches magnified by ten. The failings in the setting makes the weak characterization a deal breaker in enjoying this novel, when I'm not able to care at all about the cast's danger, failure and triumph I'm faced with an ultimately unappealing and unentertaining novel. I'm aware that at at a certain level I'm criticizing Gibson for not writing the book I would have liked him to, but his dirty already-obsolete cyberpunk scenario doesn't offer enough to leave me satisfied.If you want to read something from one of the contemporary top scifi authors try Greg Egan, Vernor Vinge, Iain M. Banks or Alastair Reynolds. Gibson leaves me empty, less from his bleakness than from his methodology in presenting that bleakness."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I love William Gibson. I think he is a phenomenal writer who is wonderfully intelligent and imaginative. In every one of his books, he spins fanciful, thought-provoking yarns that are utterly absorbing and linger long after the last page has been turned.So if this is true about Virtual Light (and it is), why three stars? Well, unfortunately VL felt to me like Gibson spent a lot more time worrying about some of the really neat ideas in the book (the homeless community on the Golden Gate Bridge, which was wonderfully described, the Costa Rican data havens, the TV Christian cult, etc.) than about the story.Several of the characters felt quite underdeveloped, a few even unnecessary. This is not uncommon in Sci-Fi, even in Gibson (though his characters are usually very good, and several here are, too), but here it felt like it detracted from the story significantly rather than being a minor nuisance. Additionally, the plot, though interesting, didn't actually go far until the end of the story. Things you might expect to happen in the first 100 pages weren't happening until 250, and the horribly deus ex machina ending occurred so quickly that I could hardly believe the book was over. Not that what Gibson did in the end was bad, necessarily (minus the &quot;divine&quot; intervention that allowed it to happen). It's just that he took 100 pages worth of plot and condensed them into about 10.Having said all that, though, the book wasn't that bad. I was very absorbed in it while I was reading, and almost all of the ideas in the story were very interesting. However, I'm glad this wasn't the first or even the third Gibson novel I read. I'd recommend you start with Neuromancer or his new one, Pattern Recognition, if you are new to Gibson's writing. If you aren't, this is still a worthwhile read, as long as you can forgive its flaws."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This isn't Neuromancer, and in some respects I worry if the success of that book has spoiled Gibson for all the others, because he has put in what made the first book successful (dystopia, out-of-control technology, bizarre but plausible human subcultures), but somehow it just doesn't come together as well as his other works. The plot is all right for the first half, but it delves into the deus ex machina and contrived for the end and an entire plot thread involving a fascinating character is harped upon for many, many chapters and wasted. Not to say that this is a bad book; I enjoyed it a lot, but it's not a classic of the genre. If you love Gibson, then you'll love this. If cyberpunk-style SF is a sometimes thing for you, give this one a miss."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Well, at least it's easy to read.Everyone and their sister has been telling me this is a must-read, and I'm left wondering why. The writing is weak, the character development nonexistant, the &quot;suspense&quot; not at all suspenseful, the dialogue hokey with *italics* all *over* the *place*, and the plot not terribly engaging. This novel could have been condensed into a 50-page short story, and nothing would have been lost."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Anyone who has read any other of William Gibsons' books will find 'Virtual Light' totally unsatisfying.

Neuromancer was written in '82 and was released in '84, to me that says &quot;pass&quot; on the test of time scale. This book, Virtual Light, is not up to caliber of the 'sprawl' series nor Gibson's short stories for that matter, but it's definatly worth a read.&gt;enjoy-sb"},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I enjoyed Mona Lisa Overdrive but Virtual Light grew tiresome. The plot lacks substance and Virtual Light, lacks any virtual reality. I thought with the theft of the high tech specs, the book was going to be an interesting read.Maybe I'm just tired of the quirky, &quot;tongue and cheek&quot; dialogue that Gibson and Science Fiction has unfortunately restricted it self to over the last couple of decades. The author thinks that he and the reader are sharing some inside joke throughout 350 pages and it gets old. Give me some of that &quot;old fashioned&quot; science fiction with plot development, characters and suspense, fear and challenges.

Cutting edge suspense? I don't know what these other readers are seeing in this book. All I got was senseless dialogue, idiot characters, technology that isn't fully explained, long rambling passages of senseless thoughts that have no meaning or relation to anything. Notice I didn't mention any plot in that list, because there isn't one. Somebody loses some expensive electronic toy, somebody else finds it, the first person tries to get it back. This would have been better if someone had explained what the thing is, where it comes from, what it does, or why it's so important. We never find out. Instead people get chased for a while, and then.. nothing. The book just stops. No resolution or explanation at all. When I buy a book I expect an actual story, with intelligent (or at least intelligible) dialogue, and characters that seem like more than cardboard cutouts. This book sadly fails on all these counts."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Maybe it's just because I was raised in Arkansas and I live in a trailer park that I love this one so much. Dunno, but I love how Gibson captures that strange, backward, what we down here call that 'redneck' or 'white trash' feel.

What we have here is imaginary world without imagination, characters are not likeable and you'll forget about them on the first day upon completing the final chapter. Cheap moralty and chases from B-rated movies makes this book a lousy trash SF, no matter what anybody else could say 'bout it. Chapters are written in different manner, varying in lenght and breaking the pace of the story more than is necessary. Storyline is rather uninventive without the satisfactory end, or to say with end that is no end at all. Various appearances of countless different and not so interesting characters keeps you occupied with tracking which is irelevant instead keepin' you on your seat wondering what'll happen next.

Virtual light paints a future for the US I believe to be a strong possibility. Very eye opening. Buy it. Buy the series. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"First off, this beautiful start to the Bridge trilogy of Gibson's work reveals why he is so damned legendary and so good. The entire trilogy, like its Sprawl trilogy before that, is a thing to behold. Yes, I'm a fanboy.But here is a question: Why can we get the second two books--Idoru and All Tomorrow's Parties--on Kindle but not Virtual light, the first in that \\"world\\".Come on publishers...get on it! I'm deployed to the Middle East and find it way easier to bring my library on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I'm quite a fan of Neuromancer; the post-apocalyptic, trans-human, electronically vivified world he presents in that novel and some others of his work is just plumb fascinating. Even when his dystopian environments and noiresque antiheroes are off-putting, I can stay totally enthralled by the glamour and cerebralness of the pure cyberpunk atmosphere.Virtual Light is not one of those books, not in the least, but it might even be something better. It is a VERY near-future kind of story, one where everything has a ring of truth, of everyday, yet at the same time is pulled back enough to make the reader notice just how weird this modern age is. Along with this is a subtle layer of fiction, of cyberpunkness, so to speak - just a hair, a note in the wind of something alien. Megacorporations are hinted at, technical spywork in law enforcement, some highly crazy speculative fictional elements, but everything feels like it is just budding, undeveloped, ominous. And, so well blended with postmodernism - stuff you see on the city streets, everyday - that I found it at once intriguing and unsettling, deeply so. After finishing Virtual Light, I seem to see our world going a scary direction much more effortlessly, and Neuromancer doesn't seem so strange after all.I grew up in Southern California, where much of the story is set, and am familiar with San Francisco too. The book digs right into the cultural atmosphere there, but in a very dirty, sleazy, unsettling part of it, and magnifies that, letting us see a potential fractured culture leftover from massive earthquakes that devastated the region, that frankly makes my skin crawl, it's so believable. I've lived far enough away from that culture (in Oregon, incidentally, where the girl Chevette hails from in the book) for long enough that its normalcy is wearing off, and the deeply skewed and dangerous attitude that is marginally present there is much more obvious. Into the middle of that, Gibson thrusts characters which are very believable, and easier to relate to, even admire, than his characters usually are. I ended up genuinely liking the main characters, feel like I've seen them grow into decent people out of the chaos that formed their early lives. In the end, it was these characters, not the setting, that kept me going, since I found much of the setting so disturbing. But the contrast of people and place might have been all the more powerful for that reason.Virtual Light, like most of Gibson's work, is not for the fainthearted. There is a lot of profanity, twistedness and weird religious fanaticism going on in here, and if that kind of thing disturbs you, maybe pass this one on. But if you're willing to stomach all that, and the nomenclature I've described sounds appealing to you, by all means go for it, this is one of Gibson's best."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This will be brief. First, a confession: William Gibson is my favorite writer. Period. Virtual Light is yet one more masterpiece of writing where every sentence is so finely crafted that I want to read each of his books again and again.Virtual Light is the first of the bridge trilogy. It is the future. Due to quakes, the Golden Gate Bridge has become unusable. Certain people manage to break through the barriers and set up their make-shift homes on the bridge; a crazy-quilt of ramshackle structures governed by it's own unwritten rules. In this mix we have Chevette, a bicycle messenger, who launches all of the actions when she steals a pair of glasses from some drunk as an act of contemptuous revenge for his obnoxious behavior toward her while she is trying to carry out her duties as a messenger. Barry Rydell, a wannabe cop with a big heart, is also introduced and thrown into the whole chaotic mess.Gibson develops and draws some of the most interesting and exacting characters of any writer I have known. He is a true artist who draws with his pen ( or his word processor or his typewriter or whatever he uses to write with). By the time you finish reading a Gibson novel, you feel as if you really know each and every character. Few books I have ever read leave me with such distinct impressions of the characters as those I find in Gibson's novels. In addition, there is often plenty of action and violence to be found. Gibson knows how to combine action, a fascinating unique plot along with great character development. The fact that Gibson also delves into potential future trends based on current technological development simply seals the deal for me.Virtual Light is a ride worth taking for anyone interested in just plain wonderful writing, whether you're into sci-fi or dystopian futures or not. Gibson's works show you what great writing is all about and Virtual Light is great writing by anyone's measure."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"This was my first William Gibson read...I really enjoyed Stephenson's Snow Crash and I saw all the positive reviews of Virtual Light and it looked like a good book for a long plane flight, so I gave it a shot. It's a virtual book, alright: several flat textbook main characters, a whole bunch of superficial people drifting in and out, and a simple \\"something got stolen and lots of folks want it.\\" Suspense? Action? Yawn. I did finish it, but only due to the long layover caused by weather problems. The contrived ending reminded me of watching a soap opera attempting to wrap up all the problems in two days."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"I fear, may be more accurate than one would like to admit.

This novel is Gibson's first tenative steps toward contemporary fiction.

I could write a pious review of the book or praise the author to the heavens, both would be justified. However it's very simple, you need to read this book and see how many people have lifted off Gibson or just been influenced by his work.Groundbreaking and still relevant 14 years after its initial publication. Truly an original work."},{"Title":"Virtual Light","review":"Science fiction is always really about the present. Futurists speculate about the future. Science fiction writers speculate about the present mostly, by embellishing or exaggerating certain things already present, in a mythical future.With Virtual Light, Gibson explores the possibilities of science fiction as now, and begins to do a few things. First, he begins to explore the possibilities of being a novelist in a larger, more classical sense, because he does in fact take himself pretty seriously as a writer. And secondly, he starts writing books that are only vaguely science fiction, and could pretty easily be mistaken for contemporary fiction.But what you have to read between the lines also is that Gibson is a classic hipster and fashion maven. He wrote a sci-fi novel about the then very \\"hot\\" bicycle messenger scene taking place in San Francisco, New York, and elsewhere, because this is where the action was at in the city for the \\"radical\\" young rockers back then. I was there. Gibson was trying to capture some of the fanatical enthusiasm and freedom experienced by folks living \\"on the edge\\" in what way was available to them, and does convey some of that.And moreover, he conveys some of the real stuff beneath. The dialogue where one of the messengers describes the vanishing middle class and the precarious role of the messenger in the posh office world, this was all real stuff to those of us actually living on that scene back then. The novel is clearly about what's really going on even now in the U.S. and elsewhere; urban blight, gentrification, and the not-so-discreet secession of the very wealthy into a new plutocracy. This is a recurrent theme for Gibson. And from the perspective of a bicycle messenger this was all very plain to see without the benefit of any science fiction, believe me.And where he confuses a lot of readers is probably that he takes a more artistic direction than would be expected. One of the really interesting things about Gibson is that he's one of those rare kids who grew up with a copy of Delaney's \\"Dhalgren\\" in his possession, and who must have gone to art school too. He was strongly influenced by 1960's and 70's \\"modern art\\" and modern literature. So this book begins as something resembling science fiction, and like most of his books, ends like a sculpture by Joseph Cornell, if it could be turned to words.Gibson meditates on a handful of profound ideas in his novels, but is not a very inventive writer, and recycles things to the point of irritating me, since I've read most of his books. If you have read others of his, I'm certain you will recognize certain key phrases and images that he's apparently latched onto. Just like the habit of cleverly incorporating phrases or titles from his favorite songwriters (esp. Steely Dan and Lou Reed) into his text; gets a bit old. But these faults aside, the book was still quite enjoyable.Virtual Light, to me, was a fantastic collage of now and near future, kind of a less dark vision than \\"Bladerunner\\" but more mundane, and thus more realistic. I do not like the sequel to it, \\"All Tomorrow's Parties,\\" as much. I've found that most of the sequels Gibson has written are weaker than the first; kind of the opportunistic money-making sequel problem.But as Gibson is, apparently like myself, one of the more slow, meditative types, his creative process reveals things in sharp relief, even if he doesn't pack as many ideas into a novel as the clever cyberpunk writer he's reputed to be. He thoroughly chews and digests ideas like time, memory and history, the contrast between the sacred and profane, and much more than you would expect from a cyberpunk writer, whose stereotype is supposed to be a really clever young guy all jazzed up on caffeine, writing about technotoys. For better or worse, Gibson turned away from that, and has tried to bring more depth to his writing, and this novel is approximately where he started doing that."},{"Title":"Taos Artists and Their Patrons, 1898-1950","review":"Dean Porter and his gifted associates have skillfully authored not only the best book ever written about the &quot;Taos School of Art&quot;, but the most interesting and educational. Why is their book different? They departed from the standard biographical information generally available everywhere and continually repeated by other authors in every new book and took the time to bring into focus the collectors and art buyers who made it possible for the artists to make a living at their chosen profession. The many stories, glimpes, and setches of both the artists and collectors make this book most interesting and readable. There are also many new paintings never before shown in other books about this group of artist. There is also a art exhibit that compliments the book. This is a must read and must see for those who love and collect the &quot;Taos School of Art&quot;. Like a fine red wine, you wish in your heart you could drink on forever."},{"Title":"Taos Artists and Their Patrons, 1898-1950","review":"The occasional case of the mad artist -- gaunt, ragged and living solely in his own creative mind -- has dominated our view of how art is created. In fact, patronage was and is the medium in which most art is created. This beautifully printed book casts a clean scholarly light into this remarkable relationship of artist and patron. While doing so the authors also examine how the demands and desires of daily living and the strains and strengths of personal relationships -- spouses, lovers, friends -- play upon the same chords that the patron touches, for good or ill. All are amply documented by the authors and as with all biography the telling anecdote best reveals the character of the subject. The fact that for decades a fertile art community existed a thousand miles or more from patrons and markets raises the question of whether indeed something special for the art world was going on in Taos. Easily dismissed by many as regional artists in the past, the Taos artists are put in a context by the authors' examination of the skein of relationships stretching to Taos. I would think that the world of art scholarship on that basis alone needs to respond to this well-focused work by examining other colonies, schools and concentrations of artists in the history of our country, for the purpose of finding how those stories of patronage compare. On its face alone the art reproduced in this fascinating book makes the case for the importance of the Taos artists as American artists. But the patronage story raises this question: Why did big city people, living and creating the big story of its time -- industrial, urbanizing America -- choose to support the painters in the desert? It seems to be a paradox. Or is it? We await the next study in depth of artists and their patrons. &quot;Taos Artists and Their Patrons&quot; has set the height of the bar. I hope the authors of this book stay in the game for the next book."},{"Title":"Taos Artists and Their Patrons, 1898-1950","review":"While the literature on American art history has grown enormously during the last several decades, that devoted to patronage remains very scarce, usually directed toward single supporters such as Luman Reed and Mrs. Jack Gardner. Taos Artists and Their Patrons is probably the finest study to appear devoted to a single school of painting, that which arose in Taos in New Mexico at the end of the nineteenth century. The authors have thoroughly investigated all aspects of patronage--exhibitions, individual advocates, institutional support, and many other forms. At the same time, they have presented what must be the finest study of the work of the artists active in Taos, embellished by a wealth of marvellous images, beautifully reporduced. The book enjoys three major accomplishments: it is a definitive study of the nature of American art patronage; it is a thorough review of one of the most important regional schools of art in this country; and it's a fabulous read!"},{"Title":"Taos Artists and Their Patrons, 1898-1950","review":"I am fine art trained, so my love of fine painting contemporary or otherwise is understandable. Unfortunately, I would rather do-it than read about it. Art history of the usual sort bores me to tears. &quot;Taos Artists and Their Patrons...&quot; grabbed me from the start. I'm even reading the foot-notes...an unheard occurance! This is a stunning, insightful work with plenty of juice...not the usual dried, dusty husks they tried to force on me in art school. If you are at all interested in enduring art, in truly fine painting, in the southwest, in those who risked established careers to seek new subjects and gave new meaning to hardship...and the joy of discovery, then this book is for you...and a bargain at the price. It reads like a grand adventure!"},{"Title":"Taos Artists and Their Patrons, 1898-1950","review":"For full disclosure, I have an essay in this book, but did not have access to the entire manuscript before the book was published. Consequently, I come to the book fresh and am simply overwhelmed by the book's sheer beauty. Even if one never read a word of the text, the reproductions are exquisite and remind us that these artists were producing some of the most visually stunning paintings in American art in the first half of this century. However, the text--contributed by several scholars on Taos art--provides context for how these artists supported themselves and their families (or didn't) through various public and private patrons. This anthology is certainly the most comprehensive publication on the Taos Art Colony phenomenon in the last ten years and is essential to collectors, dealers, and scholars, especially scholars of non-Western American art who tend to forget that &quot;the painting's the thing&quot; and Taos artists hold their own with any of their contemporaries, east or west of the Mississippi. Go buy this book, you will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Taos Artists and Their Patrons, 1898-1950","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that I know one of the authors of this book, and that I'm both an admirer and a frequent visitor to the Snite museum, where two of the authors hold down their day jobs. That said, however, I believe that this book is a marvel. The 400 plus illustrations, capture much of the best of the work to come out of the Taos art community, and the story that is told of the evolution of a community of artists, with all of the trials, triumphs, envy, friendships, love stories, and personal tragedies that filled the lives of the artists of Taos, is captivating. These artists needed patrons desperately. They were off on the edge of the world, creating art out of the mainstream. Most of them had only tenuous connections to the art establishment in the East, and they could not have survived without the help and support of others. The quality of this book is outstanding, and in my opinion, at the price offered by Amazon, it's a steal. If you enjoy American Art or just love a good story, you'll be very happy that you found Taos Artists and Their Patrons.

It is against this background that McTighe and Wiggins, respected American education researchers and theorists, attempt to say important things about understanding to teachers hoping to improve their lessons and their lesson planning.Their book sets out to do this largely by attempting to clarify some pragmatic trivia in a well ploughed field. Unfortunately, the reader is soon furnished with ample evidence that McTighe and Wiggins are patently out of their depth in this field. Their definition of understanding is an extremely poor one - \\"that a student has something more than just textbook knowledge and skill - that a student really \`gets it.' \\" - although, to be fair, their definitions of assessment and curriculum are much sharper and better considered, and remain useful even outside the context of this book.What the two researchers can achieve is the definition of a series of facets that they themselves create - the Six Facets of Understanding. One is immediately reminded of Bloom's taxonomy here, but McTighe and Wiggins claim that their research supports the notion that this rubric is valuable for teachers seeking to deepen the understanding of students in their classes.Typically, for this type of book it is the anecdotal evidence they cite which remains in the mind. There is a tradition of made up anecdotal evidence being perfectly acceptable in American education research - as long as it describes patterns of behaviour that are empirically evident in schools. I have strong reservations about the validity of making up classroom scenarios, but it is possible that this fictional anecdotal approach can occasionally be useful in clarifying areas of learning that are hazy. My problem with this book is that if McTighe and Wiggins are relying upon empirical data to persuade the reader to accept their facets of understanding rubric, then they themselves are recognizing only one of many possible definitions of what understanding is.In my view, the six facets allow the teacher or assessor to assert that the participator in a lesson influenced by Understanding by Design has been advanced further along an arbitrary linear spectrum called \\"Understanding\\" than might otherwise have been the case. No more and no less.The book is, therefore, mainly an explanatory footnote to the six facets rubric. It's a useful rubric for accomplishing some pragmatic classroom tasks, but it has nothing new to say about understanding.If you plan lessons that may broadly be described as* open ended* based on standards* containing clear criteria for student success* include different ways to ensure student enthusiasm* flexible enough to accommodate the \\"teachable moment\\"* accessing the higher echelons of Bloom's taxonomy* integrating skillsthen the likelihood is you won't learn anything new from reading Understanding by Design.

This is by far the most well written and enlightening book I've ever read on the subject of teaching. The Six Facets of Understanding, in my opinion, are a better approach than Bloom's Taxonomy.

Buy this book and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Understanding by Design, Expanded 2nd Edition","review":"I read the first chapters and feel I have wasted a lot of time. The basic ideas on UbD is quite straightforward that one can grasp them by spending 30 minutes looking into Wikipedia or other introductions on the web.

I agree with some reviewers that it can be more concise and spend more efforts to give out practical procedures to design a good UbD lesson plan."},{"Title":"Understanding by Design, Expanded 2nd Edition","review":"Others have already stated my opinion. The useful points in this book would be better stated in a booklet. The authors ramble on needlessly when, in reality, they should have backward-mapped their own main points, stated them, and then stopped typing. The extra babbling detracts from the main points: backwards mapping and six facets. This stuff would stick in the reader's mind more if the authors got out of the way, but then I suppose they wouldn't make dough by selling textbooks would they?"},{"Title":"Understanding by Design, Expanded 2nd Edition","review":"I used this book as part of a graduate level class. The book is quite informative and gives great ideas on how to teach for results instead of just covering necessary material.

It gets repetitive, but it is useful overall."},{"Title":"Understanding by Design, Expanded 2nd Edition","review":"The book is excellent in its comprehensive scope of unit design.

Even simple ideas, such as focusing on the goals of teaching first rather than the lesson plan, are worth the price of the book. However, the book is a bit long-winded. The authors make their point, again and again and again. I think the authors might have been better served by collecting their advice in a small booklet. Some of the book's advice, such as the lesson plan forms, involve way too many steps, to the point where it might discourage some professors from actively using the lesson plan forms. Still, worth reading for new teachers."},{"Title":"Understanding by Design, Expanded 2nd Edition","review":"As a Career and Technical Education instructor (Vocational Ed in some states), I haven't had to go through the traditional education school path.

The key for me is how it addresses understanding (it breaks it down into six facets). Let's look at seven aspects of/considerations within Facet 1 entitled Explanation:1) use dialogue to assess2) use performances to assess understanding3) use tasks the evoke misunderstanding (so we can correct)4) use a novice-master continuum as a goal5) use tests that are based on essential questions6) assess control of the big picture7) assess student questionsThe book breaks down curricular decisions into manageable and meaningful chunks so that they can be applied and not merely curricular theory stored in the deep crevices of the mind later to slip out of anything close to working memory.I use ideas from this curricular design framework, but also recommend Teaching for Understanding as a read. I don't want to say one is better than the other - both are well informed and both are pedagogically sound designs/frameworks.

But when the family moves to Maple Hill, Marly's great-grandmother's old place, for the summer, things brighten up a bit. Being close to nature and wonderful neighbors, Marly wants to stay here forever - especially if her dad feels better here. And the miracles are always here too."},{"Title":"Miracles on Maple Hill","review":"In my ongoing attempt to read all the newberry medal books I found Miracles on Maple Hill to be a very good book. This book won the newberry in 1957, and tells the story of a family that moves to the Pennsylvania country to live a more simplistic life away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. The story is very straightforward and easy to read. I really liked all the characters in the book, especially the children. Marley the young daughter in the book was my favorite, and I felt like the author wrote the story for a child Marley's age to read (about 5th grade).One of the things that I found interesting about reading the older newberry books is that you can see how the author dealt with serious issues within the timeline of that moment in history. For example, in this book it never completly comes out and says that the father in this book was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome from WWII, but the signs are left everywhere for the reader to pick up on. I wish that that the author had developed more of the stories relationships with the adults in the book, but I have to remind myself that this book is written with children not adults in mind.I gave the book a fourth star because I loved the air of nostalgia that the book left me with. The way she describes the winters on Maple Hill and especially the springs with the syrup left me wanting to linger at the syrup camps of that time and smell the sweet aroma of the sap cooking over a fire. This is a great book from a different time, that lets a little insight into the struggles of the post-WWII family and how they dealt with them."},{"Title":"Miracles on Maple Hill","review":"This is the kind of book I was afraid I was in for when I decided to read the Newbery books. Well, it was and it wasn't. A white family, looking at the world, saying, \\"Oh gosh,\\" and \\"Oh golly,\\" facing issues like the son staying out too late and wondering where he is, facing how to get the big maple sugar crop in before it ruins, and lots and lots of \\"You can't do that; you're a girl.\\"But it was also more. Dad was thought killed after time in a war camp, but he returns home, safe but scarred. Marly, the ten-year-old daughter, doesn't listen to all the warnings about girls being unable to do things.Moving to the country heals. The family develops a deep friendship with an elderly couple nearby. The couple is warm and loving, but does not come across as overly false.The details about maple sugaring are fun and new. The family heals, and reading about that process feels good. Yes, there are (sorry) sappy parts, but they, too, feel part of the time in which the story was written.

Seeing the joy of tasting maple sugar for the first time, watching a vixen and her kits, or enjoying the rare beauty of wild flowers through a child's eyes is a treasure that seems to be too deeply buried --or worse--ignored. Sorenson enables the reader to experience Marley's excitement as each new miracle unfolds, and leaves the reader with a renewed awe of the treasures of nature and brotherly love. The book never &quot;preaches&quot;, yet it imparts values to children.

Also, the book addresses adult subjects such as psychological damage from WW II in a very matter-of-fact and appropriate way. However, the book doesn't really deliver anything extraordinary.

Her dad has come home from having been a prisoner during the war, but he's not the same. He's moody and tired and seems as cold and dead as the winter outside. So the family decides to spend the spring and summer at Maple Hill Farm, the old place where Marley's great-grandmother had lived and where Marley's mother used to visit as a child, up in the corner of Pennsylvania's countryside. There they meet Mr. and Mrs. Chris, Grandma's neighbors whom Marley's mother remembers from her childhood visits. At first, Marley and Joe are afraid that they will miss their life in the city. Joe had wanted to join the bad at his city school, but the little school at Maple Hill doesn't have a band. But they begin to have many adventures sugaring with the Chrises, fixing up the old house, and experiencing other \\"miracles.\\" Will Daddy get any better? Will Marley's family return to Pittsburgh or will they decide to stay at Maple Hill? And when Mr. Chris gets very sick and has to go to the hospital, what will happen to him?This 1957 Newbery Medal winner is a delightful story that is deserving of the award. There are a couple of common euphemisms--gee and golly, one reference to chewing tobacco, and a mention of glaciers \\"millions of years ago.\\" I especially enjoyed the way the truant officer ended up handling the time when Marley and Joe were kept home from school to help the Chrises with their maple sugaring. A couple of reviewers said that the role model for girls is horrific because the girl is weak, cries, moans, etc., and that the sexist stereotypes made it difficult to stay with the story because Marly and her mother do \`woman things' at the house together.I can see how a femi-nazi or someone raised on femi-nazi propaganda would reach this kind of conclusion, but honestly it gets old hearing those who may disagree with traditional roles for boys and girls yell \\"sexism\\" every time they don't like the way girls are portrayed. Not every family is raising their daughters to be \\"I am woman, hear me roar.\\" And recent studies have suggested an actual biological basis for some of the emotional differences between males and females. Most of the reader reviewers liked the book, except the one mentioned previously and a couple of \\"kid reviews\\" which said that the book was too boring and not exciting enough. Of course, every book, even a good one, may not appeal to all people. However, my experience is that a lot of kids whose minds have been numbed by the helter-skelter, hooey-phooey, hocus-pocus, harum-scarum, hokey-fenokee type of stories like Harry Potter and Goosebumps often don't have enough attention span left to enjoy a real story. I would recommend Miracles on Maple Hill as a book which chronicles the joys of simple living."},{"Title":"Miracles on Maple Hill","review":"When Marly and her family move to her grandma's old house on Maple Hill up the road form a sugar camp, she and her brother have many adventures including pancakes, mice, flowers, cows, schools, maple syrup, and a hermit.

Through Spring, Summer, and Fall their friendship develops and Mr. Criss teaches her many things. At the end, Mr. Criss has an accident, and Marly and her family have to make the maple sugar just like Mr.Criss does in order to keep his business running.

The protagonist, Marly, can't explore the city like her slightly older brother Joe because her parents won't let her. She buys into that decision because \\"If Joe got off the bus at the wrong stop, he would just act like that's what he intended to do,\\" while her reaction would be to ask a policeman for help and be delivered home for a lecture from her parents. She has to wait for Joe to invite her to go with him to explore around their new home in the country: she offers to make lunch for them, and Joe is so pleased to see that she is up before him with two bag lunches prepared - one for her and another, twice as big, for Joe. When Joe and her father are off fishing with the delightful older character Mr. Chris, Marly and her mother do \\"woman things\\" at the house together.

It is almost completely timeless. Ignoring the copyright date, there is almost nothing in it that sets it in a particular timeframe. Because the setting is nature and a back-to-the-land ideal, the story could be set after almost any war - and because we're in a war right now, it could easily be set in the present. Sorensen mentions \\"the war\\" without ever mentioning Hitler, Germany or WWII. The only \\"give away\\" is when Joe refers to 4 dollars as a lot of money - but even that, since Joe's a kid, doesn't do any harm to the timelessness of Miracles.Marly's father is back from the war. A former POW, Dale is suffering from mood swings and depression and seems to be tired all the time. Lee, Marly's mother, worries a lot. She also talks a lot about Maple Hill, where she spent her summers as a child. They still own a house there and, as the story begins, the family is on the way there. Lee has been in touch with the neighbors, the Chris family, who have opened the house and done what they could to make it welcoming. The plan is for Dale to remain behind while Lee shuttles the kids, Marly and her brother Joe, back and forth, visiting Maple Hill on weekends. They will spend the whole summer there, as well. Hopefully this will help Dale, who isn't very social, to recover from the horrors of the war.The house is run down and overrun with mice when they arrive and the family sets about restoring order. Mr. Chris and his wife, Chrissie, are good neighbors and good friends - as much to the kids as to the parents. They've arrived during sugaring season and right away get to see how maple sap becomes syrup, with Mr. Chris teaching them. Mr. Chris teaches Joe and Marly much about the beauty of the country around them. Marly has, from the start, hoped for miracles here, mostly of the sort that will heal her family, and Mr. Chris reinforces that hope by promising her a miracle a week. He shows her the beauty of each season, in the little things. The kids also meet Harry, something of a recluse, who smells like the goats he keeps, and they learn a lot from him as well.Eventually, the family decides to stay at Maple Hill together, with the book ending a year later, during sugaring season. This time, however, rather than being the somewhat lost newcomers, relying on others to teach them about everything new to them here, they find themselves in a position to repay some of what they've been given by their new friends. Harry is injured and alone, with no place to stay and, worst of all, Mr. Chris is in the hospital with heart problems just as the greatest sugaring year in the history of Pennsylvania begins. His entire crop is at risk just when he and his family are faced with medical bills. Marly, Joe, Lee and Dale have to help him! It's a lot of work - has the family healed enough to work together and get the job done? Can they really do this, for the neighbors who have been so kind to them?A wonderful story of healing, caring and helping each other and so much beautifully described detail about the plants and animals they encounter! Dale's speech near the end, about men in the POW camp who were either willing to help each other or who were only worried about themselves, neatly tied together his experience in the war with their year on Maple Hill and showed how far he had come. I recommend this book for just about everyone - adults can appreciate it as much as, it not more than, kids.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Miracles on Maple Hill","review":"Found this book on a flew - market in New york and lapped it up on my flight back to Germany.

In the novel, Miracles on Maple Hill, the author, Virginia Sorsen, takes the reader on an adventure to see where miracles happen on Maple Hill. She also introduces you to Marly, Joe and the rest of their friends and family. In addition to the well written plot, the main character and author make the, Miracle on Maple Hill, a four star book because the characters are very believable.

Miracles on Maple Hill is a great book that you can read anytime and anywhere!"},{"Title":"Miracles on Maple Hill","review":"I didn't really like the book because Joe and Mr Criss were sometimes cruel to animals and that put me off. For example, when they were cleaning out the house, Marley found some baby mice and immediately fell in love with them. She really wanted to keep them as pets. But, the dad and Joe were mean and dropped the mother and babies down into the furnace. Marley was crying and crying. Also, Mr. Criss tried to shoot foxes and I think that's cruel. But, if you don't mind animals being shot and burnt to dust, then you might like this book.If I had to pick seasons to describe each character, Marley would be spring. She's young, full of energy, and caring, like a breath of fresh air. The mom would be summer, because she has reached her state of full growth (like summer reaches full heat) but she's sweet and kind like my mom. Joe is fall at the beginning of the book, because he's following his dad's example of being moody and depressed, but he turns into spring at the end. The dad is winter because he was mentally damaged from the war and suffers from depression, but turns into summer at the end through healing at the farm.Reading books about people that are depressed makes me feel depressed. For example, I read a book about Abraham Lincoln where he was depressed and gloomy, and many people were maimed and killed during the civil war, and it was very depressing to me. I don't enjoy reading these kinds of books.I also didn't care for the genre, realistic fiction, and felt that it was kind of boring. I prefer fantasy, science fiction, and comics.Overall, I thought the book was ok, but not a book I would choose to read on my own."},{"Title":"Miracles on Maple Hill","review":"I read this book to my 8-year-old daughter at bedtime each night.

Hisjudgments are vividly conveyed in this book, standing in marked contrast to his morereserved approach in Innocents Abroad. A delightful overview of mid-19th Century Europe,Tramp is also interlaced with entertaining asides. Twain was deeply interested in people, andvarious &quot;types&quot; are drawn from his piercing gaze, rendered with acerbic wit. Some of theseare contemporary, while others are dredged from his memories of the California mines andother journeys. He also relished Nature's marvels, recounting his observations. A favouriteessay is &quot;What Stumped the Blue-jays.&quot; A nearly universal bird in North America, Twain'sdescription of the jay's curiosity and expressive ability stands unmatched. He observes suchhumble creatures as ants, Alpine chamois, and the American tourist. Few escape hisperception or his scathing wit. This book remains valuable for its timeless rendering ofcharacters and the universality of its view. It can be read repeatedly for education orentertainment."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"\\"A Tramp Abroad\\" is a humorous account of Mark Twain's travels in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. It is part travel guide, part commentary on European culture, and part tall tale. Like many of Twain's less-known works, \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" is rather uneven -- the chapters in the book range from rather boring to laugh-out-loud funny. Yet on balance, the humorous moments make up for the dull moments, and the majority of the less humorous chapters are still interesting. Apart from a few slow chapters, it provides a good read from beginning to end.Some of the highlights of \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" are Twain's exaggerated account of his ascent of the Riffelberg (a mountain in the Swiss Alps), his comments on the peculiarities of the German language, and a hilarious episode in which Twain spends half an hour pretending to know a woman who remembers him though he doesn't remember her.I have read most of Twain's works, and in my opinion \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" is not his best work, but it is definitely one of his most underrated books. It is not as good as his most popular works of fiction (i.e., Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn), nor is it as good as \\"Life on the Mississippi.\\" But I found it to be the most entertaining of his purely travel-oriented books (the other books in that category being \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" and \\"Following the Equator\\"). The bottom line is that if you are a fan of Mark Twain's style, then you should find this book to be well worth reading.Finally, if you are going to read \\"A Tramp Abroad,\\" I highly recommend obtaining a version that contains all 328 of the original illustrations. While I normally would make this recommendation for any of Twain's works, it is especially important for this book since the text makes several references to the illustrations, and since some of the jokes in the text would not make sense without the illustrations. The only current edition I know of that definitely contains *all* of the original illustrations is the Oxford Mark Twain edition (ISBN 0195101375). Also, the Modern Library Classics edition (ISBN 0812970039) apparently has retained some of the original illustrations, since it contains a note stating that \\"... some illustrations have been omitted\\" (thus implying that some have not been omitted). I would assume that this edition has retained those illustrations which are essential to the humor, but I can't say for sure since I don't actually have it."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"I have not read Twain since High School twenty five plus years ago but a friend on a newspapers book forums got me to read him again and A Tramp Abroad is the first book I picked. For the current generation this book may drag but for those of us who grew up reading books instead of playing computer games this is Twain at his best. One has to actually read into his writing to appreciate a lot of the irony but when this book is really on like the mountain climbing near the Matterhorn ,Twain makes Seinfeld seem like he's talking about something. A brilliant travel essay and by the way the Penguin Classics edition of this book in paperback is 411 pages long, not 670 pages ."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"In this book, the master satirist and illustrious travel writer Mark Twain embarks on a walking tour through Europe. This is done Twain style, of course, so anyone familiar with the author's travel writings will not be surprised that most of his \`walking tour' is actually accomplished by coach, train, or vicariously through an agent. As is usual for his travel writings, Twain's descriptions are vivid and detailed, and his accounts of certain sites are simply marvelous. In fact, in my opinion, the only thing not up to Twain's standards in this book is the humor.Don't get me wrong, this book is funny. His account of his mountaineering expedition, together with a staff of almost 150 people, is hilarious, as are many of his anecdotes (which, incidentally, are randomly inserted). Still, this book is not nearly as amusing as \\"The Innocents Abroad\\" or &quot;Roughing It&quot;--but that should not come as a surprise. Most of Twain's best work came early in his career, before his pessimism took over and before he was deprived of his entire family through death. This work fits somewhere in the middle of Twain's career, before he completely burned out but after he had already lost a bit of his incredible zest for life and capacity for humor.All in all, this is an excellent book by one of the greatest writers the North American continent has ever produced."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"First of all, this is a great book that has made me laugh countless times. I live in Germany and Mark Twain's observations are so insightful and witty that this book is truly timeless.I give one star to the 2008 version published by \\"Quill Pen Classics.\\" The typesetting in this book is atrocious. It's like someone printed it on their home computer. It is an uneven eyesore and very unpleasant to read. Actually the cover of mine looks like the one available for the Kindle version, but it is a 2008 version from \\"Quill Pen Classics.\\" Apparently this company takes books in the public domain and sells overpriced, poor quality versions of them. $16.95 is a crime both to the consumer and to Mark Twain.I will not buy another book from \\"Quill Pen Classics\\" without looking inside first. I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"I purchased the paperback version of the book. The binding is of exceedingly poor quality. The first pages fall out one by one as they are read. I expect the book itself to be very good. Don't buy the paperback."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"It's fascinating to compare my own experiences, having lived now 3 years in Germany, to those of an American from 125 years earlier. I've been learning to speak German, and his Appendix on the \\"awful\\" German language was hilarious. In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing. The scene \\"riding\\" the glacier down the Alps was so funny I had tears running down my face. It's amazing to think that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly, eerily similar to either my or \\"typical\\" American's attitudes today.I'd recommend it to anyone, but particularly to anyone visiting or living in Europe. It's way funnier than his \\"Innocents Abroad\\", which is also a good read on travel in Europe."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"A Tramp Abroad, Mark Twain's tongue-in-cheek, semi-fictionalized account of his second European trek, is, despite it's 600+ pages, a lightning quick read. Twain's singular wit is on full display engaging the reader to such an extent that pages swiftly fly by. Though not his best piece of travel writing (see Innocents Abroad), I devoured this book in large chunks eager to see where Twain wandered next. When he arrives in the Alps, A Tramp Abroad vaults from an amusing piece of travel writing to a supremely satisfying form of entertainment.If there was any disappointment it occured with Twain's unexpected exit from the stage. A Tramp Abroad covers Twain's travels in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, but concludes quite suddenly with mere mention that the Netherlands are next on the docket. Yet, wishing a book to continue confers no blackmark on an author. It is further confirmation that A Tramp Abroad easily merits 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"Follows Twain's odyssey during and extensive European vacation in the late 1800s. One must pay attention at times to separate the pure fantasy-humor from actual experiences and observations. The book jumps around quite a bit and has no consistent theme, but Twain's writing skills, imagination and imagery are wonderfully on display. If you were only going to read one Twain book, this should not be your choice. But as \\"another side\\" of Twain, it was interesting and entertaining."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"Excellent writers also have bad days. The travel accounts are often repetitive.I have not seen a paper copy of this book so I wonder,where are the pictures mentioned throughout the book? Add poor proof reading, and you get stuff like this that another reviewer wrote for a different book: \\"I too would like to mention the FACT that emphasized WORDS are all CAPITALIZED in this version as AMAZINGLY annoying.\\" I confess I skimmed over a LOT of this book."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"Mark Twain's account of his year and a half spent traveling through a couple countries in Europe, despite a great deal of fictional embellishment, makes a remarkably lucid and informative travel journal. Twain describes his adventures in Germany, Switzerland, the French Alps, and finally northern Italy. His account of Germany takes up half the book so the coverage is somewhat lopsided, but I think this was simply a result of realism setting in: It's an awful lot of work to write a daily journal in detail and I'm sure that Twain began to grow weary of having to take time out of every day to record events. Time spent writing could be better spent living and enjoying one's vacation. I know the feeling since I do keep a daily journal; I let it slip for days or weeks and then have to catch up, and that takes a lot of time.Ok, the main thing to note is that the account is absolutely HILARIOUS. A delightful way to pass an hour reading during lunchtime or on the beach during a vacation. I read this quite a few months ago so I've forgotten much of the content. The stories that I still remember pretty vividly:- The bloody fencing matches at the university in Heidelberg- The raft ride down the Neckar- A couple tragic accounts of past failed attempts at climbing certain mountains- The over-the-top story of Twain's expedition to climb the Riffelberg- The hilarious appendix on the German languageI sell most of my books after reading them but I have such fond memories of the stories in \\"A Tramp Abroad\\" that I'm hanging on to it."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"A Tramp Abroad provides an insight into Europe, in all its guises. In many ways, this sparkling guide is as relevant today as it has always been. Many elements of Twain's &quot;character&quot; are portrayed in the book, including, at times, his innate childishness. His tendency to ramble, both in text and in journey, far from being irritating, quickly becomes indeering. The only thing that a reader has to fear from this book is either being late for work, or losing ribs. The most notable point about this book is the wonderful commentary Twain passes on his own artistic skills, and the way that the wholly imagined nature of the above serves perhaps as a metaphor for the whole of what he sees on his journey. Warning: not one to read when in a hurry."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"It's no accident that Twain has the great stature in American letters that he does. But if, like me until recently, you aren't familiar with him beyond reading Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn when you were in school, you may well not realize how hysterically funny he very often is. In &#34;A Tramp Abroad&#34; he alternates between lyrical, poetic descriptions of things like awesome vistas in the Alps on the one hand and truly laugh out loud passages satirizing his own drawing &#34;talents&#34;, mountain climbing prowess, or an endless parade of other absurdities, real or invented. He also displays here little of the misogyny and cultural chauvinism that makes the otherwise wonderful &#34;The Innocents Abroad&#34; sometimes hard to take. This trip was about 10 years after the expedition chronicled in &#34;Innocents&#34;; apparently more travel mellowed and broadened his attitudes, as it is wont to do."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"I want to visit Heidelburg now.

He turns even the most mundane task into an impossible adventure"},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"My wife and I read this book while trekking in eastern Turkey. Both of us laughed out loud while reading. Aside from the humourous style of writing, the stories themselves were eerily similar to our own more mundane adventures. What makes the exagerations hilarious is that they contain some eliment of truth.His remarks on speaking foriegn languages while traveling were especially familiar. Time and again I found my mediocre Spanish popping up in my elementary Turkish. On one occasion I and another gentleman were negotiating for bus tickets, each mixing our pigeon Turkish with the clerk's pigeon English. At one point the gentleman said something that had a vaguely familiar accent. I asked (in Turkish) where he was from. Sonoma. California! I exclaimed in English that I was from near San Diego. Through the entire experience neither recognized a fellow expatriot.Or Twain's comment's on foreign food. After two months in rural Turkey, we had the same cravings for something American.His descriptions of fellow boorish tourists, his appendix on the German language, his diatribe on the hairy trunk painting: Any of these would justify reading this book, all by themselves. But there is a chuckle on every page.

As a German native speaker I especially enjoyed the part about the &quot;awful German language&quot;."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"A Tramp Abroad is the third and least successful of the travel books written by the pen of Mark Twain.In this book we follow Twain as he tours Germany, Italy, France and Switzerland. I found the early chapters chronicling his visit to Heidelburg University; hilarious visits to opera houses and tale tales such as the Blue Jay yarn to be well done.The longest section of the book deals with Twain's alpine climbing adventures in Switzerland. This material is interesting but goes on a bit too long for the modern reader.This is a fine book and deserves to be read and enjoyed by a wider readership that better known but lesser Twain novels andtravel writing,I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys listening to a great author recount his peregrinations through Europe in a leisurely and informative manner."},{"Title":"A Tramp Abroad","review":"I listened to the audio version of both books, and will admit up front that the narrator for this one is not one of my favorites, but I got past that after a while.Twain seemed to be \\"padding\\" the narrative with an awful lot of folktales and legend, rather than his own experience. There's a lengthy (and highly annoying) \\"fantasy\\" sequence - I suppose he was trying for parody - as well. I found myself fast-forwarding through almost a full cassette of a gory description of two deuls (near the beginning); he delights in recounting grisly mountaineering stories later on during the novel. The storyline ended abruptly at the end of cassette 11 of 13; the last two were the appendix, which I skipped.I really liked \\"Innocents\\" and am planning on purchasing \\"Following the Equator\\" (I looked through it at a bookstore and it seemed pretty interesting), but I wish I'd skipped this one.

Little understanding of the deeper processes or issues involved. I would have much appreciated some critical first-person reviews of the various potions - if the authors have the nerve to recommend a substance, they should have had the nerve to try it out themselves first - and the honesty to report their real experiences or lack thereof. For example, bromocryptine has a lengthly chapter but the authors obviously never tried it themselves or they would have painted a much more complex and useful picture of its effects. Nor do they understand what its psychosexual effects are - much different from what standard medical usage would suggest.

I think that most readers would find them to be considerably more credible if they had such a degree, especially in view of the fact that Morgenthaler and Joy frequently foray onto (and beyond) the fringes of scientific knowledge. Such speculation would perhaps be tolerable if it were being espoused by someone who had a solid base of scientific training who had very sound reasons for conjecturing in this manner; it is difficult if not impossible for a reader who has no scientific background to judge whether or not the speculations of authors who have no scientific training are credible. The cover art and one of the fonts used in the text of this book can be best described as comical; they further detract from the credibility of the book.

I can't wait for her next book!"},{"Title":"Her Galahad (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"I read reviews so that I can get a good idea what a book is about that way I know whether or not it is a book that I would want to read. So, how do you write a review about a book that many people either loved or hated?Her Galahad has so much--love, betrayal, prejudice, a tortured hero, Australian history (an aboriginal storyline), and many secondary characters. This book had a very unique storyline, it was so fresh and so new that, for me, it was a breath of fresh air. I personally enjoyed this book. I loved all of the action that was going on the many sub-plots and secondary characters, but admittedly it is not for everyone-especially for readers that like the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; plots and characters. That is not an insult to any book, author, or reader. I for one have many cookie cutter books on my shelves, but sometimes I like those books that are just so unique that you know you will never find another book like it (plot wise). Does that make sense? At the same time it is a bit disturbing to realize that this story is based on the true history of Australia.Here is what it says on the back of the book:Seven years ago, a pregnant Tessa Earldon had been passionately in love with her newlywed husband. But she was told he was dead and was quickly pushed into an ill-fated marriage-and lost her child shortly thereafter. Now divorced and on the run from her ex, when she hears the footsteps one dark night, she assumes they belong to her husband. And she's right. But she's wrong about which husband is pursuing her...Six years ago, David Oliveri-aka-Jirrah McLaren-was about to claim his bride when her brother intercepted him, threw him in jail...and convinced Tessa that he was dead and to marry another. Now Jirrah is a free man, and he's back to get what's his-his wife. His child. And revenge. And not necessarily in that order.My opinion:I loved it! I was hooked from the first page to the last. At first, I didn't know whether I should be angry at Tessa for being so gullible or to feel sorry for her for all the lies her family told. Tessa married David the love of her life, but shortly thereafter, her father and brother told her that David was dead. A heartbroken Tessa believing the lies gave into her families pleas and married a man she didn't love. Tessa was also pregnant at the time with David's baby. Tessa gave birth, but the baby was quickly taken away and Tessa was told that her daughter had died. Tessa now believes she not only lost the man that she loves, but the daughter that she so desperately wanted.Years later, divorced, and on the run from her ex-husband the last person that she expects to see is her dead husband David (who now goes by the name Jirrah). Jirrah is angry and bitter over the crimes that Tessa's family has committed against him. He wants revenge, but he also wants his daughter, the daughter that Tessa believes is dead. Now it is just a matter of staying alive long enough to find their daughter and the evidence clearing Jirrah's name.It seems like I am giving away a lot of information, but in truth, I have hardly given you the tip of the iceberg. The story is very suspenseful and will have you quickly flipping pages to see what is going to happen next. If you are looking for a fresh unique storyline with a fast pace than this is the book. If you like a book that doesn't exactly fit the mold of your typical romance than, in my opinion, you should definitely read Her Galahad.**I would love to see if Mrs. James could redeem Duncan in a story of his own....hmm, maybe someday we will get his story! :)"},{"Title":"Her Galahad (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","review":"I fell in love with the hero immediately.

The Australian government has, in the past policy called \\"assimilation\\", handed fake death certificates to members of \\"The Stolen Generation\\" (Aboriginal children taken from their families by force). They were led to believe their parents were dead, so they wouldn't go back to find their family or their heritage. Those same girls were also given death certificates for their babies, and said babies were then adopted out to white families. This happened right up until the 1980s.This is documented history.

In Part 1 (\\"Agamemnon\\")Agamemnon was killed by his wife Clytemnestra so she could be with her lover Aegisthus. In Part 2 (\\"The Libation Bearers\\") Agamemnon's son Orestes flipped the tables and killed Aegisthus and Clytemnestra. but Orestesis tormented by the furies. This brings us to the 3rd and concluding chapter.The furies basically take the role of the chorus in the 3rd chapter. Basically, the furies do Zeus' dirty work for him. (Kind of along the line odf a Devil's Advocate.)Well, Zeus's son Apollo is confident the outcome will turnout in Orestes's favor. (Why not? Apollo is Zeus's son, and he commanded Orestes to avenge Agamemnon. And his 1/2 sister Athena is going to be the judge.)Orestes places in faith in Apollo. For one final time Clytemnestra (now a ghost) appears and demands vengeance for her murder. (It would appear that Aeschylus knows that murder and revenge transcend life and death.)When Apollo tells the furies to get out, he almost sounds like a priest performing an exorcism: \\"Out, out! Be off, and clear of this holy place /of your foul pestilence...\\" Interestingly, when Apollo confronts the furies with the full story, they have a mafia like theory. It was alright for Clytemnestra to kill Agamemnon, because he wasn't family by blood. It was wrong for Orestes to kill Clytemnestra because she was his mother.but we can trust that Athena (goddess of wisdom) will bring reason to this dispute. Interestingly, Apollo continues to sound like a priest combating evil: \\"I would not have your powers, even as a gift.\\"Orestes continues to place his trust in Athena and Apollo. Throughout the trial, the furies emphasize their distance from the gods. During the trial, Apollo emphasizes that he told Orestes to kill Clytemnestra. The trial seems to stay on Orestes's side, and the arguments of the furies start to lose even any hint of reason. We need not be surprised when Athena finds for Orestes.The cycle of revenge ends when Athena paves the way for reconciliation with the furies. All in all, this was a wonderful trilogy that shows the dangers of revenge, and that a return to reason is the only way it can end."},{"Title":"Adios a Mama: De LA Habana a Nueva York (Coleccion Caniqui)","review":"Los mejores cuentos de Reinaldo Arenas.

Although I did enjoy this book and the decade by decade review of the history of the American workforce and its laws, I found Mr. Rifkin's views quite radical even in the post 9/11 economy. It is very difficult to believe that the world will become a workerless society as the author would like us to believe. There will always be the need for people to fix the machines that Mr Rifkin believes will replace humans. He also does not address one of the largest employers of people that will never be in the technology age, the healthcare industry.Our society and economy will always have its ups and downs, but it has always recovered. Since 9/11 most of the jobs that were eliminated were technology positions. This is in direct contrast with the main idea of the book. It would be naive to believe that technolgy has not replaced humans because of the advances in machinery and computers, but to the extent The End of Work would like us to believe is foolish.Hopefully there will be a sequel to this book in 20 years to see how correct Mr. Rifkins views are, but I would tend to believe we will still all have jobs and not be out of work."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"I read this book on the suggestion of a friend. In general, I'm not a fan. Here are some highlights.On the positive side of the book, Rifkin has obviously done a very thorough job researching employment throughout the century, various periods, etc. He also makes some interesting points with respect to the manner in which technology rids people of jobs. He does articulate that the net result is that production increases past the point of which the economy can absorb the excess.However, where I really disagree with him is on the following points. First, he has not really normalized his data to incorporate those that were not included in the count (minorities, countries with non-purchasing populations, etc) during the different periods in question. He also fails to see some of the other fairly pertinent changes that have occurred throughout history as well that also impact unemployment rates, i.e. changing population demographics due to war, the opening of communist economies, the end of dictatorship/regimes.Further, he does not quite articulate the need to reinvest. He hints at it a bit, but he does not see that with each economic downturn and rise in unemployment, society has created a better secondary net. The loss of jobs generally occurs at the lowest level, and I get that it effects those that are the poorest. However, cheap goods leads them to have a slightly better time of fulfilling basic needs. In other words, though the poor continue to be poor, we should consider at each period what the poor they are better off. Alternatively, you could comparatively do the analysis across countries with varying levels of technological access (though of course, that would be a mess to neutralize second order affects). There are other far more interesting arguments that look at income gap between decile-d wage earners. While I'm not completely in agreement with such research, at least it is more fleshed out.He somewhat completely misses that the end game is for people to become smarter as a whole. Or that the increase in goods does make life - from a basic needs standpoint - easier; allowing for more inclusion in politics, society, etc.I do agree with him that people need to think past the rat race and try to figure out how to evolve and think of creation of things outside of material goods to be exchanged in the name of greed. I get that. And perhaps an alternative solution is to fulfill basic needs but foster enlightened understandings/education of what \\"choice\\" of livelihood really means. I recognize that only the greatest of optimists would think that people would not just choose to be a lazy stump and watch reality tv all day, but hey, maybe. Still, I'd like to see the conclusion be to improve education; not to hate technology or see it as an enemy which isolates blue collar, less resource rich citizens."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Do you have thought the future of civilization? The author pointed on the future of the work in civilization. Some people may think the author's opinion is too pessimistic to agree with his opinions. I think, however, the author's ideas are very great because he analyzed the roots of work and he continued an objective view in this book.According to the author's view, the work is related with not only the labor itself, but information technology, social changes and organization systems and so on. He did not said about the mass production work, nor lean production work. He make an effort to say about the directions of work changes, the counterproposal of idal work. For this objectives, he analysed various fields of knowledge: Information Technology, Sociology, Philosoghy, Economics, Business Administration and so on.If you have thirsty curiosity to the various Social Science or if you want to contact to the future of civilization, I tend to recommend this book without hesitation."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"So now it is feared that computers will destroy everyone's job.

Why they do that ? Because capitalism has put down his mask and shown what it really is. Unfortunately, nobody has shown us a better form to live economically, so each one of us must do our best to survive without depending upon the god damned companies !!!"},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"I often enjoy reading books written trying to read the future that are several years old. If only to see why the writer was right or wrong and where he went wrong.Well this book was published in 1996 and is basically written around the US although other countries are mentioned in passing. The basic premises is that the new industries will employ a few people but not enough to make up the fall in the established industries. So the unemployment will go up. Furthermore we better get used to it. His partial solution is reduction in hours of employment and a greater stress on the third sector.Looking at the US economy which most of the book is written about in the past 50 years the workforce in the US has almost tripled. Yet in the same period there is no long term trend to greater unemployment. Just look at a graph. Currently now its where it was in 1950. So obviously unemployment is not going up. So the writer got it wrong.Looking at a graph of US unemployments percenatges, its clear that the situation was a bit high at the time of writing. The writer made a typical mistake of many futurologist of extrapolating into the far future based on the past few years.Furthermore the writer paid too much attention to the publicity departments of R&D; companies. He keeps bring us all these new technologies that are going to change the world dramatically eg getting rid of farmers with chemical vats and vanilla production from genetic research. Well, its been 10 years and most of these technologies are still coming. He obviously has forgotten Daniel Bell warning in what is an absolute gem of a book \\"Coming of Post-Industrial Society\\" that many futurologist look too hard at industries worth millions of dollars and generalize into industrials worth billions.He seems to also forget that labour hours are dropping all the time. I am not sure what the situation is in the US but as the pay master in an Australian company, I can see that the labour hours are steadily dropping every year. For example old timers tell me that the standard office hours 40 years ago was 44 hours a week, by the time I started working it was 40 and now at 38 hours plus now two 10 minutes breaks are included in the working hours so its more like 36 hours week. Furthermore in the past few years the number of sick days a year has gone from 5 days to 8 days a year. Two extra days a year has been introduced for compassionate leave. Long service leave (a holiday of 15 weeks) is now given at 10 years not 15 years. Furthermore the average worker now starts his employment later as he tends to study much more, so early 20s is now quite standard to start working and he retires at 55. All this works out to a rather dramatic drop in hours worked in a generation.Finally we come to the third sector. The sector the writer hopes is going to take some of the unemployment. This is a sector that I have had considerable contact with over the years eg I went to a private school, been active in political and religious organizations, been computer programmer in a private cancer research organization and have been too many private hospitals. I don't see the employment opportunities. The volunteers or people on the committees that he is referring too tend to be at most a few hours a week. Hardly an equivalent of a job. Nor is it generally like they are working. Often its more socialible. The people that work for these organizations tend to be regular workers eg the janitor in the church, the nurse in a charity run hospital or teacher in a religious school does a similar job to the same people in a similar government or private institution. They tend to get paid roughly the same. Often they go from government to private to the third sector depending on who gives them a better deal. I just don't know where the writer is coming from with his arguments here. I suspect that he has little contact with these organizations.Overall I would say that this book is best forgotten."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Rifkin's book could have been referring to many instances throughout history whenever any new invention caused workers to be displaced in one job and retrained for another. This book is based on economic conditions during the early 1990s and may have been accurate for those times, but with the present day booming economy and the meteoric rise of the internet and the resulting companies and jobs created, Rifkin's work is very dated. It is apparent that Rifkin is terrified of technology."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"The premise of the book is that technological innovation drives Capitalism to produce more than it can consume (hence the Great Depression, etc). It should be obvious to anyone with children that \\"overproduction\\" is absolute nonsense. The whole point of economics is to deal with the fact that wants are infinite and resources are not. If there's more of a particular product - cars, for example - on the market than people want, it doesn't mean all of a sudden capitalism is in crisis and we should ditch the idea of people having jobs. It means production has been invested in the wrong particular things (the reasons for which Rifkin largely ignores). We will never get to the point where machines provide every need for us, because there will always be more wants/needs, and there will always be limited resources. Rifkin asks the wrong question, so predictably arrives at the wrong conclusion.Rifkin calls himself an economist, but seems to have no idea how the market works. Businesses don't have the market power Rifkin ascribes to them, to replace workers with machines and pay everyone else beans. It just doesn't work that way. Technological displacement is not the \\"achilles heel\\" of capitalism; it's a temporary problem made worse by \\"spreading the work around\\" or other methods of preventing adjustment.In short, if you're looking for real economic insight, you won't find it here."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Nothing much here, just a economic writer throwing data after data to comprobe his theories about the doom of mankind ..."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Probably one of the worst distortions in statistics is that of extratroplation of complex issues.

I notice too that there is essentially no consideration/balance regarding Schumpeter's \\"creative destruction\\" theories.The title itself \\"The End of Work\\" is not something we should take seriously or utilize as a basis for further discussion."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"\\"We are entering a new age of global markets and automated production. The road to a near-workerless economy is within sight.

I'd seen him on C-span and promptly ordered his book through Amazon. This was when it first came out in hardcover and my oldest son, assured of a future work using skills from his newly obtained Masters in Computer Science, was concerned I was reading such a book. \\"Isn't he one of those Luddites?\\" I think of myself as a wanna be Luddite, but I saw no signs of this in the book. Instead, Rifkin seems to be concerned with the coming affects of the Informational Revolution.The book begins with a history of the Industrial Revolution. He gives us a nice tour of the birth of materialism as a concept created and promoted by economists and businessmen. \\"The term \`consumption,\\" he tells us, \\"has both English and French roots. In its original form, to consume meant to destroy, to pillage, to subdue, to exhaust. It is a word steeped in violence and until the present century had only negative connotations.\\"The chapter, \\"Technology and the Afro-American Experience,&quot; addresses the effects of slavery, the supposed freedom of sharecropping, the loss of jobs as a consequence of the invention of the mechanical cotton picker, the rush to the cities and the subsequent loss of jobs as technology slowly progressed. There is a correlation to the success of whichever modern day technology we are experiencing, and the situation in the inner-cities. \\"Today, millions of African-Americans find themselves hopelesly trapped in a permanent underclass. Unskilled and unneeded, the commodity value of their labor has been rendered virtually useless by the automated technologies that have come to displace them in the new high-tech global economy.&quot;One chapter is entitled \\"No More Farmers\\" and discusses the advances of robotizing replacing tasks such as harvesting and livestock management, as well as the end of outdoor agriculture. Other chapters deal with the future for retail, service, blue collar jobs, the declining middle class and the growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots.In the chapter titled, \\"A More Dangerous World,\\" he cites the Merva and Fowles study, saying that it \\"showed a striking correlation between growing wage inequality and increased criminal activity.\\" \\"Rising unemployment and loss of hope for a better future are among the reasons that tens of thousands of young teenagers are turning to a life of crime and violence.\\"He does point out that the explosion of the Third Revolution is going to make the social wounds we've tried to heal seem like paper cuts, but does not claim that we should unhook our computers and resist the revolutionary explosion. His suggestion is that we work on \`empowering' the Third Sector' - the independent sector - and turn back to community, to helping each other before it is too late. \\" A new generation might transcend the narrow limits of nationalism and begin to think and act as common memebers of the human race, with shared commitments to each other, the community, and the larger biosphere.\\" He does offer that since hi-tech advances may mean fewer jobs in the market economy, the only way to make sure those whose jobs are lost will be compensated is to have the government supply compensation. Naturally, this gives a flash-back to the welfare system, which I think has freaked out a few reviewers, paralyzing them into a sort of retro response. But Rifkin isn't just talking about the recipients of old - those stereotypical lower-income, under-educated inner city folks, he's talking about many more people. In my family, my middle son is a hands on kind of worker who in the past might have been a farmer. No matter how much education he gets, he isn't one of those who will sit well in the new techno age, and already he's feeling the pressures. The high paying jobs for him are life-threatening, so the kind of work he's hired for is low paying, not enough to support himself, let alone the family he has decided he can't afford to start. Rifkin isn't doing retro work - he suggests tying the subsidized income to service in the community, which he suggests migh help the &quot;growth and development of the social economy and facilitate the long-term transition into a community-centered, service-oriented culture.\\"His answers are not clearly spelled out - he offers suggestions and insight into where we might be going as a race (the human race). The truth is, we all need to ask some questions and help find the answers. For those whose minds are set firmly in any direction, you'll get from this book very little - for those with open minds, regardless of your political view of the world, you may find this to be a door to the future."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Jeremy Rifkin has distilled much of what is brewing below the surface in our economy and weaved it into a compelling thesis that deserves serious attention from academia and the public at large. A gifted social scientist and economist, Rifkin transcends the &quot;Megatrends&quot; genre, and provides us with a compelling analysis and dissection of a post-market economy that sits clearly on the horizon. Many who have read and critiqued this book have siezed upon it's liberal view for the future, however, no one has disputed the issues he has raised which clearly depict an economy where labor is in declining demand, and sophisticated computer automation will replace large sectors of our current economy. Perhaps the one flaw in Rifkin's book is that he presents a vision for the future that is polemical in its political orientation. I was deeply disturbed by Mr. Rifkin's findings, because I fear that I could easily become among the ranks of the technologically displaced. But I read this book twice, because I realized that if I am to keep ahead of the game, I need to know which way the wind is blowing, and ensure that I don't fall victim to what millions of workers are destined for in the years to come.

Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs lost, millions of service sector jobs, near collapse of domestic auto industry, housing and mortgage meltdown, credit card crunch, trillion dollar government bailouts. Most of these jobs will NEVER return. What are all these displaced workers going to do for sustenance? Mr. Rifkin nailed it in this book: The Rise of a Massive Welfare State. That day has arrived. Technology didn't do it, I don't think. Rampant greed and colossal corruption on all levels, including the financial industry and lack of government regulation sent this country over the cliff in a short order of time."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"With \\"The End of Work,\\" Jeremy Rifkin has combined detailed research with insightful analysis to spread a warning message that any amateur futurist, economist, or social commentator needs to consider seriously before rejecting. Rifkin's thesis is simple: human labor has been, to a large extent, replaced by machinery in the production process, and this trend will continue to subsume jobs that require great amounts of skill, as computers and machines become increasingly capable of performing such tasks. The result is going to be a permanently unemployed and underemployed workforce, as labor becomes more extraneous, and the symptoms will be manifest in growing wealth disparity, and an increasingly dangerous world, as the unemployed become politically radicalized, and turn to violence, whether random, economic, and political.First, I feel compelled to acknowledge the elephant in the room, which is that Rifkin's thesis is decidedly Marxist. The idea of post-scarcity and the replacement of labor with automation, as well as the consequences that Rifkin forewarns of, were all predicted by Karl Marx throughout his career as a political agitator. That Rifkin's prescriptions are more moderate than Marx's does not make the diagnosis less Marxist. As a longtime libertarian and believer in capitalism, I would like to be able to dismiss Rifkin's thesis out of hand, as many reviewers of a conservative bent do and have. However, the care with which Rifkin has researched this book and the consistency of his analysis, as well as his stature as a scholar, compel me to consider his argument more carefully.One positive trait of the book is that it was written fifteen years ago. As such, it is somewhat dated. Some of the predictions that Rifkin cites and makes have born out, while others have proven untrue. That is the nature of prediction. The intervening time since the book has been published give us experience and a frame to judge Rifkin's predictions. Also, thought the current economic climate of \\"recession\\" (not sure that word is appropriate) and combined unemployment and underemployment upwards of 15% make a thesis like Rifkin's all the more compelling now, it lends credence that this book was published in more mild economic times, and is thus not merely reactive, but foresightful.As for the evidence, hopefully it is not in dispute that income and wealth disparity are increasing in this country. In recent years, the news has been replete with reports of the absorbent increases in executive compensation, in the financial sector but also in the general economy, all while the real wages of the worker have been stagnant. Rifkin cites that in the 1950's, average CEO compensation was 28 times the salary of the average worker. At the time of this book's publishing, this figure had increased to 93 times. I read an article recently that in 2009, in had ballooned to about 220 times. So this prediction has borne out. More importantly, the more comprehensive GINI index of economic disparity has been increasing for decades. This measure is not cited by Rifkin, however.Rifkin gives a detailed history and recount of the evolution of labor as an institution in the United States, and also in other countries. As should be familiar to most Americans (though perhaps not in this much detail), he recounts how the bulk of labor was once invested in agriculture. As agriculture became increasingly mechanized and more efficient, labor increasingly moved to manufacturing. In the post-war era, as manufacturing has become increasingly automated, the lost jobs have been absorbed by the service sector. In turn, service jobs are in the process of being automated. It is unclear what will come in their stead. The history that Rifkin recounts is detailed, and made for dry reading at the time, but in the end the information was valuable.In contrast, the analysis of trends and their implications is not dry reading, but holds interest the whole way through. Rifkin discusses the gradual increase in unemployment since the 1950's, and also how this increase does not tell the entire story, because real wages and benefits have been declining over the same period. Increased competition from the Japanese, Japanese innovations in the production process, and the widespread adoption of some of these have also made production more labor intensive. Of course, when this book was written the Japanese were more in the forefront of consciousness, and one wonders if the points made still hold, and if the processes introduced are still relevant.Rifkin also discusses Say's law, which states that supply creates its own demand and that displaced labor will always eventually be redeployed. Say's law is often advanced by conservatives and free-market economists as a counter-argument to those concerned about unemployment. To this, Rifkin points out that Say's law says nothing of the quality of employment. While high-skill manufacturing jobs have often been replaced by service jobs, these replacements generally pay less, require fewer hours, and have lower benefits. This only exacerbates income disparity. In this case, Say's law holds, but the outcome is far from desirable. Even when most things of value are produced by machines and the value of production accrues to the top echelon, displaced workers will still need to do something, and the result is that they will find jobs for $10 per hour or whatever, doing work that isn't that important. The ultimate result is a \\"busy-work\\" economy (my term, not Rifkin's), full of people performing work that provides little value. The recent rise of the financial sector, which in a healthy economy should be a small segment facilitating capital allocation, corroborates this reality.With the disease diagnosed and the evidence for the diagnosis presented, Rifkin then turns toward the question of prescription and antidote. It should be noted that though Rifkin is often considered a man of the left, his proposals in this area are actually quite moderate. These proposals include reducing the number of hours in the work week in order to \\"share the work,\\" and a tax credit program that would reward volunteered time in a similar manner that monetary charitable donations are credited for tax purposes, essentially having the government pay individuals for charity work. The idea of the second idea is to revive the idea of community, while combating the problem of technological unemployment. While the goal is admirable, the potency of this proposal is suspect. Similarly, the idea of \\"sharing the work,\\" may be largely antiquated in the post-industrial era, where labor is less of a fungible commodity and the work week is less well defined. Certainly it could apply to certain low-income sectors, but it has little relevance and is unenforceable in the professional, white-collar corporate world, or in sales. It should also be pointed out that the obvious solution to the problem of technological unemployment, as foreseen by Marx and others, is socialism, which Rifkin does not propose.All in all, I found this book informative. Rifkin argues his position well, and provides a wealth of information, data, and analysis regarding the problem of technological unemployment. I recommend this book to anybody interested in the underlying causes of our labor economy."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Some reviewers see this book as a \\"gloom'n'doom\\" \\"Malthusian\\" feeding of technophobia, but I disagree. Look at the news - reports of job losses despite increased productivity and corporate profits are not going to go away. Technological advances make this an inevitability. What Rifkin ultimately questions is how we deal with that - we could either head towards great social upheavals because of mass unemployment leading to people being unable to provide for their own basic needs, or we could enjoy a cultural and social rebirth where people are free from wage slavery and are free to pursue meaningful and fulfilling endeavors.Rifkin's surveys of the development of the third sector (NGOs, arts, sports, social services, religious organizations, etc.), proposals for the guaranteed annual income for everyone, usage of time dollars, and increase in volunteerism does not indicate that he's some kind of paranoid nut who's screaming that the sky is falling - in fact, he comes across as being more cautiously optimistic. These are the similar ideas about a work-free (meaningless work, that is) future that R. Buckminster Fuller Robert Anton Wilson and Bertram Russell have written about.If some might think that this book is \\"leftist anti-corporate propaganda\\", it is not - it's quite non-partisan; he may espouse the idea of a guaranteed annual income which most might distastefully find \\"socialistic\\", but from the capitalist point-of-view, how can consumers buy products to support a corporation's profits if they don't have any money in the first place?"},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"I must admit that when I read this book, I was a bit dissappointed at the lack of new information. As a student of labor history, I had read previously many of the ideas and concepts that Rifkin expands upon in several other books. I only wished I had picked up this one book, prior to reading all the others. It would have saved me much time and money.In short, Rifkin decribes the transition of the worker from pre-industrial revolution, through the era of machines and mass-production, and the advent of the information age in which he predicts there will be fewer and fewer workers. His analysis describes how this effects the worker, organizational make-up, employment relationships, and even how government has been forced to change to accomodate the modern economy.I believe that anyone interested in the dynamics of technology and globalism on the workforce will find Rifkin's work very interesting, well-written, and easy to read."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"As with many futurists, their analysis of trends are insightful and can provide a glimpse of the future; however, often their glimpses are of the extreme nature. Having studied trends regarding the advancement of technology, I came to the same conclusion Rifkin did, that sooner or later work and income must be disassociated with one another. A guaranteed income is one answer to this. Just as wage labor made no since in pre-industrial eras, so will wage labor make little since in futuristic economies. Societies that insist stubbornly to this notion are doomed for collapse. My concern with American society is that we won't make this jump until economic catastrophe hits us. Just as it took a Great Depression to convince policy makers that the Federal Govt. did have a role in preventing poverty to occur through social insurance mechanism, so to will it take an economic upheaval to convince the populace that wage labor as a primary means of allocating income in this society is antiquated and cannot continue."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"If you are on the dole, this book is for you.

But, as the book teaches us, the whole world is at risk. Happy new century to us all"},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"This book is a must for anyone interested in an easy to follow, in depth, unbiased study of current and past labor trends as well as the silent revolution that is currently forever altering those trends. The central conclusion of the analysis is that with the increasing role of &quot;smart&quot; machines and other labor saving innovations, globalization, societal overemphasis on consumerism, trends toward conglomerates, and other factors, massive groups of workers are slowly (and as quietly as possible) being obsoleted. Lines of work drying up is nothing new, but historically, workers who were obsoleted could find new jobs in a different sector. Here, Rifkin convincingly argues that that for the first time there are no longer sectors available to swallow up the obsoleted workers. The only possiblity, the highly touted &quot;information&quot; sector, is shown to lack the ability to accept the influx of workers contrary to the pronouncements of numerous giddy prognosticators. Though the book was written in the early 90's, more recent events (the recent flurry of dot-com layoffs, increasing consolidation in numerous sectors, etc.) certainly support Rivkin's bleak view. Pessimistic though it may seem, Rivkin's analysis seems hard to refute, and he does offer some sensible ways in which the situation might be improved."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"The version of this book that I read has a copyright of 1995, so some of the statistics are dated, but, for the most part, the rest of what the author has to say is very up-to-date. The focus of the book is on automation, and how it has affected jobs and employment. I recently read \\"Aftershock,\\" by Robert Reich, too. The books complement each other nicely, but I actually think \\"The End of Work\\" is more complete and effectively written. A similarity between the two books, I think, is that neither offer credible solutions to the disturbing trends. But that is O.K., as the strength of both books is to define the problem and put it in an historical context.Rifkin starts out telling us that global unemployment is at the highest level since the 1930s. He also says that the Information Age is here, and it is not going away. Corporate downsizing and the \\"re-engineering\\" of organizations to reduce the needs for people also appears to be here to stay. Again, the book being written in 1995, Rifkin says that U.S. corporations are shedding workers at a rate of about two million per year. And, of course, the bulk of the newly created jobs pay far less than the ones lost.The author acknowledges that more than 75 percent of American workers work at jobs that involve relatively simple, repetitive tasks. Anxious to replace workers with machines, companies make capital investments in machines, not people. History tells the story: In the 1950s, about 33 percent of American workers worked in manufacturing; by 1995, that had dropped to about 17 percent. All this, while productivity soared. And the definition of \\"full employment\\" has shifted accordingly. In the \`50s, it was about three percent; by the 80s, it was up to five percent. Today, we know that it is probably above seven percent.The first wave of modern automation was introduced in the \`50s. The theory of \\"trickle-down technology\\" stresses that producing more for less is of benefit to the U.S. consumer. The related problem of unemployment is supposed to work itself out for the better. Important here is that Americans had to educated to become dedicated consumers. Advertisements encouraged folks to stop making things, themselves. Instead, they were encouraged to buy products at stores, from food to clothing to all kinds of labor-saving devices.World War II and the post-war boom in government jobs created an atmosphere that encouraged Americans to buy new homes, new cars, new appliances, and to borrow to the hilt. Many held out for a reality of increasing consumer delights in tandem with a world of full employment. But the employment numbers in this \\"Third Industrial Revolution\\" lagged. In 1961, the Steel Workers Union reported a loss of 95,000 jobs, as productivity soared. Quite simply, more steel was being produced by fewer people. In other industries, similar numbers were reported. And Black Americans were hit especially hard. By the late \`60s, riots had broken out in urban areas across the country.Similar to what Reich points out in his book, what evolves is an economy that can produce tons of good and services. The problem is that there is a diminishing number of Americans who can afford things. Labor unions have had little success preventing any of this. Frequently, unions settle for re-education and retraining funding, rather than the retention of jobs. And not just blue-collar jobs have been on the line. Middle management types have lost jobs in droves. And none of these jobs seem to be coming back. Rifkin suggests that what is approaching is \\"a near-workerless world.\\" And this is a global trend.In 1995, Rifkin says that about half of the world's population was still working in agriculture. But in the U.S. that percentage is below three percent. More and more, populations move to the cities for work, but, says Rifkin, \\"Much of the human workforce is being left behind and will likely never cross over into the new high-tech global economy.\\" \\"Continuous-process\\" production turns out \\"a massive volume of goods more or less automatically.\\" As early as the 1880s, for example, a machine could turn out 120,000 cigarettes per day. Modern steel plants look more like laboratories than factories, and modern oil refineries, essentially, run themselves.Today, nine out of ten jobs in New York City are in the service sector. Along with the consumption boom after WWII, employment in the service sector boomed. But by the \`80s, improvements with computerized systems and automated processes slowed that growth. Jobs for cashiers and secretaries declined. Even the cooking industry is being automated rapidly. Says, Rifkin, \\"Being a chef today often means emptying a pouch of already prepared frozen food into hot water or placing it under a microwave for three to seven minutes.\\"And it can only get worse: \\"Whole categories of workers will dwindle in number and in some instances disappear altogether. Information technologies are going to get smarter and cheaper....\\" Benefits from the productivity gains in the Third Industrial Revolution are not trickling down to workers. Wages have been flat, after inflation, for decades. Both the private and public employers are turning to temporary workers without benefits. And even advanced degrees in education may not pay off any more. And, in sync with the Reich book, Rifkin says that the rich are simply getting richer \\"largely at the expense of the rest of the American workforce.\\"Rifkin says that one in ten Americans rely on food stamps. I think in 2011, that is now one in seven. He talks about food banks, and the inability of the average worker to buy a home. Reich is quoted in the book as asking, \\"What do we owe one another as members of the same society who no longer inhabit the same economy?Rifkin does not suggest that we want to return to a world where workers put in 80 hours per week to make a living wage. Nor does he suggest that we should ever expect masses of workers to be hired again for work that can also be done by machines. Nor does he suggest than most folks will somehow be happy substituting work for leisure, even if they get paid for it. He does make a pitch for non-profit organizations and volunteer opportunities, suggesting that folks get paid by tax credits, if there are no wages involved. But, in the end, Rifkin has little to offer in alternatives to the demise that automated factories can pump out much more than the general population, many without jobs, can afford. He ends the book with this:\\"The end of work could spell a death sentence for civilization as we have come to know it. The end of work could also signal the beginning of a great social transformation, a rebirth of the human spirit. The future lies in our hands.\\""},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"This may have been one of the top 1-2 books I've read this year - which needs to be contextually framed by the fact that I typically have time to read no more than 4-5 books each year anyway. Maybe I'm just &#34;extra good&#34; at the selectivity of the books that I choose, but this one was really quite good. It explores the multiple dimensions of increased productivity, work, an increasing population - and the continued and rapid encroachment of technology in the displacement of workers. Most of those workers up to now have been more production-oriented, but will the rise of computers and technology in the future signal the beginning of the loss of jobs for knowledge workers? Given that this book was written close to 15 years ago - it was prescient in some of its predictions, and especially telling in light of the recent (and persistent) recession - and where 1 in 5 low wage jobs were lost in the recession, but in the recovery, low wage jobs have represented close to 3 in 5 jobs created.

His arguments are compelling and terrifying.Most interesting are Rifkin's solutions to the problems of this technological invasion. One solution is that everyone work less hours for more pay. This would free everyone to pursue more noble causes without pay. (Yea, Right!)As societies becomes more hedonistic, it is also unreasonable to believe, as Rifkin asserts, that volunteerism will increase to become the great social contract that will give meaning to the dislocted and disfranchised and ultimately save us all.

The positive side of this is that the author tends to support his hypothesis well, and even those who do not agree with his conclusions will appreciate the parts of the book that overview the labour and economic history of the West - it's all quite fascinating. On the other hand, those familiar with this thematic and wanting to get to the \\"jist of it\\" should just skip to the book's final part.I think Rifkin presents his views and conclusions very well, except that he is in my opinion a bit too enthusiastic about hydrogen use in the future and overly enthusiastic about the development of AI. But those are, overall, minor things. I disagree with the assertion that he is too gloomy or a neo-Malthusian - he simply observes trends and uses common sense and the scientific method to extrapolate into the future. Many of his proposals make capitalist sense - such as the shorter workweek.

Wallulis, Chas. Handy, D. Rousseau). However, Riftkin's view is unneccessarily pessimistic. He sees this trend away from &quot;jobs&quot; as something that may lead to anarchy or, at the very least, a de-globalization of the working world reorganized into a community-based, third sector. This premise is interesting but flawed. Rifkin fails to see the positive consequences of this important trend.

In Spain this is half/half of that idea. In the North, yes, not so much in the South, but I suppose that's a question of philosophy of living and by nothing easy to change. This book contains also, at less for the foreigner, some surprising facts about the USA society, as the conditions of Afro American people until 1965 and his ignorance of money- paper in the cotton camps.In general, I think a person must have earnings enough to live reasonably, nor forceful a traditional, hard task to do, because you can be a writer, poet, musician, and another tasks not usually considered as work, as in a car factory.If not, the conclusions of this book are terrible but I think without a very real motive at bottom."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"The End of WorkBy Jeremy RifkinBook ReviewBy Richard E. NobleThe End of Work by Jeremy Rifkin is an extraordinary work. It opens to the reader a whole new world of thought and ideas.I read the first 100 pages with my jaw hung open in horror. Mr. Rifkin's revelations were not above and beyond my own thinking on the subject but I had never before come to realize the full scope of the matter. I had joked in my book Hobo-ing AmericaHobo-Ing America: A Workingman's Tour Of The U.S.A.that all my working career, as fast as I learned a new skill I was replaced by a new method or machine. I joked that I couldn't be retrained fast enough to keep up with those who were out to replace me.I am also familiar with the workers' plight here in America. I have a book of my own dealing with the history of the American Labor Movement America on StrikeAmerica on Strike: A survey of labor strikes in America. So I am not naive when it comes to discussions of this sort. But all my research and background did not prepare me for what Mr. Rifkin had to reveal. I was shocked.According to Mr. Rifkin my joke with regards to being constantly replaced and retrained was not a joke but a fact of life in the evolving new global world economy.The point of Mr. Rifkin's work is that the day when workers will become obsolete is appearing on the capitalist horizon - and it is not creeping along but racing towards each of us no matter what our job status.Mr. Rifkin is not presenting a theory that may or may not happen ... someday. He lists in descriptive detail all the jobs that are disappearing from the market place, never to return.The scope of this problem is bigger than I had ever dreamed.I have heard people suggest over and over that jobs were leaving the shores of America and would never return. But like Donald Trump, I said in my innocence, Why can't they return. Let's just change a few laws and incentives and make America once again an appealing spot for the steel mills, shoe and sneaker factories, textiles etc.It never occurred to me nor was it ever explained that these jobs would not and could not return to America because they no longer existed.Mr. Rifkin details the millions and millions of jobs that are totally disappearing due to technology, automation, advanced software, and labor saving management programs.He points out that this is happening in all business sectors. The service sector is now on the road to job loses as great as those that have been plaguing manufacturing, construction and all other work avenues, public and private.Jobs in management, middle management and in other once secure areas are being eliminated. No longer are jobs being picked up by the service sector or even the public sector. Everybody is cutting everywhere. They have been and will continue to do so, blindly and at their own peril and future destruction. It all seems so insane.He carries these practical observations off into the theoretical and speculates on an inevitable semi-jobless world and how such a world could be run.The last few chapters of this book outline his theoretical solutions to a jobless world and/or society.I find Mr. Rifkin's analysis of the problem and his predictions of dread for the workers of the world credible and inevitable if no action is taken to offset this realistic scenario.His solutions to this problem I find self-contradictory and impossible. But that solutions must be offered and new roads taken is undeniable.Every workingman in America should read this book and become aware of the true battle that is looming up before us as I write this very review.This book was published in 1995 but it is far from outdated. It is a work that is decades ahead. Now is the time to read it and get the picture of the future in perspective. For me a large piece of a very big and confusing puzzle has just been put in place.Buy this book and read it. You will not regret it.Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher:\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\" Novel - Lawrence, Ma."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Rifkin's work, with a foreword from perhaps one of the most socialist mainstream economists of our day, Robert Heilbroner, of the New School for Social Research, addresses squarely the problems caused by technology replacing labor in today's rapidly changing globalized economy. Since only educated Americans read these days, fully 75%-85% of the U.S. population will never be exposed to the author's insights. Therefore, the solutions presented by Rifkin will fall on deaf ears; and perhaps, they should.Technology as the driving force for social change, as in every other epoch of modern human history, is carving out a niche for the technologically informed individuals. For the sociologists out there, is a new &quot;class&quot; (heaven forbid) being constituted? I think so. What will be the political, economic, and sociological result? Most likely not much different than the impacts of the past epochs: capital/wealth concentration to those individual and institutions who own and control the &quot;means of production&quot; (my apologies to those made nauseous by Marxist arguments) or, in this case, those who control the creation and production of information- or knowledge-based technologies (read Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Time Warner, Disney, GE, Westinghouse).Capitalism has survived in various forms (despite Mr. Marx's assertions) for thousands of years whether in the form of feudalism, mercantilsm, imperialism, corporatism, or today's state-sponsored global corporatism.Therefore, a suggestion to all of those of the laboring classes: Why not give in? Accept benevolent corporate benefactors in the best case, or non-wage-based, total private corporate slavery in exchange for room and board, minimal disease care, and survival. Why struggle and compete against your neighbors, friends, and family members, when wage slaves can never &quot;win&quot; the battle against technological advancements and corporate-statist, social organization?Technologically-disenfranchised wage slaves of the world unite! Instead of the public welfare state of the last half of the twentieth century, financed primarily by regressive payroll taxes levied against the working class, accept defeat; demand benevolent, corporate socialist slavery!"},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Rifkin provided a good historical examination of how technological innovations of automation, corporate reengineering, lean production, and computers have replaced the need for workers at an alarming rate culminating in what he termed &quot;The Third Industrial Revolution&quot;. Every sector and industry has experienced significant trends in unemployment and underemployment. Although virtually every worker has been affected, African-Americans were particularly devastated as they got caught between the machanization of southern agriculture and automation in northern cities resulting in the creation of the underclass. In all, technology has undermined the worker and reconceptualized our notion of the workplace.Solutions to global worker displacement include shorter work week to share the remaining work to all workers. Rifkin also argues for investment in the third sector of volunteerism and social services to combat the rise in crime and violence that is inevitable in a society of large scale employment.Although his historical examination is admirable, his future prophecy of a massive unemployment did not convince me that we are headed to a society run by machines. Alternatively I believe there will always be demand for human labor as machines present their own limitations. Several years ago many proclaimed that dot.com's will put bricks and mortar stores out of business. Despite these claims bricks and mortar stores did not disappear partly because many customers enjoyed the personalibility of social interaction with salespeople and other customers. Doing Christmas shopping over the internet is not a comparable replacement to going to a shopping mall for everyone. In addition, Rifkin never addressed the all important realm of unpaid work that will never diminish as long as there are humans on earth.Overall, this book is a good read although I had trouble with his future predictions."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Middle management is vulnerable to job loss in the event of restructuring. Typically a reconfigured company sheds forty percent of its jobs. The computer revolution is most pronounced in the manufacturing sector. A world with fewer and fewer workers is a disturbing trend.In the early years of the Great Depression the link between labor-saving and overproduction was discerned. By 1932 shorter hours of work was supported by the rationale of economic justice. In 1963 a triple revolution was identified by J. Robert Oppenheimer and others, cybernetics, weapons manufactures, and human rights concerns. The issue presented was the possibility that previously disfavored groups could become outcasts in the new cyber economy. Norbert Weiner warned of technological unemployment. Labor leaders decided not to fight automation, the use of labor-saving devices, but rather to push for retraining. Unfortunately too few jobs were created and the union began losing membership and clout.Modern management began with the railroads in 1850. Now organizational hierarchies are being deconstructed. There is a connection between biotechnology and automation resulting in rapid changes in farming practices.Service work has been absorbing losses of manufacturing work in the past, but service work is being automated and can no longer be depended upon to create jobs. Productivity gains and increased profits are being made with fewer workers. Electronic inroads highlight the advent of the paperless office in the insurance and banking industries. Paper in a service business has been compared to cholesterol in the bloodstream.A lot of retailing has gone electronic and wholesale functions are being eliminated. In the meantime cashier productivity has increased greatly through the use of bar code technology.The author terms the current state of affairs the third industrial revolution. The work force, though, is in retreat in nearly every sector. Trickle-down is a chimera.The newest victims of re-engineering are apt to live in affluent suburbs. A fading middle class is described. There is gross disparity between high wage earners and low wage earners. The pace of work due to automation has increased resulting in worker stress. There are more temporary jobs and fewer full-time jobs available in the re-engineered business environment. Technology displacement produces an increase in crime statistics. Hardship and stress lead to spontaneous upheavals. One cure for unemployment is a shorter work week.In the future the market sector and the public sector will be less important than the third sector embodying volunteerism.

If one is looking for a very clearly articulated portrayal of these dislocations in the modern time, then one will like this book. I disagree with all of the doom and gloom, however. This sort of doom and gloom reminded me of the Malthus's writings about overpopulation and fears of machinery in the late 19th century, both of which I view as very discredited observations.There will always be dislocations as result of technological progress; and as tragic as it is, one cannot progress without rendering something obsolete.

Very thoroughly chronicles the progression of the 3 Industrial Revolutions---the 3rd of which we are entering now---and their impact on global economics and politics.The message is clear: Millions of people are becoming economically obsolete; because of technology we no longer need them to help produce things like automobiles, steel, and many consumer goods. At the same time, they can no longer afford to purchase these things due to job displacement. They have been shoved out of the world economy, and if we don't do something about it, we will have a global French Revolution situation on our hands as their ranks continue to grow exponentially due to outsourcing and tech upgrades and the chasm between haves and have-nots continues to widen daily.There are two futures that the author sees as possible. The first---and more probable according to him---is a bleak one with rising crime and massive backlash of the poor on each other and the wealthy. The other is a refocusing on the volunteer/social sector and employing the displaced masses in worthy contribution to communities. Rifkin does not realize it, but he is basically suggesting a casting away of European values originating from Platonic dichotomies of good/bad, us/other, valuable/expendable, etc...then evolving into the \\"us\\" VS. \\"other\\" mentality of medieval Europe...before finally maturing into full-scale imperialism, colonialism, manifest destiny, etc.....the ULTIMATE \\"Entitlement\\" mentality...resulting in the unapologetic exploitation of land, people, and resources until imploding on itself out of its own greed and ravenousness. When he talks of the 3rd/social sector--the \\"'post-market\\" area, he is actually suggesting the adoption of more cooperative and community-conscious African principles once the European worldview has collapsed on itself."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Amazon does not allow to scale a book differently for the message and for the way the message is brought. For the message I would give a 5 , for the way a 4, for the solutions a 3.The theme brought is one of the principal societal trends of today and debit to the current economic crisis. The decline of the working middle class and work as the core of wealth, is becoming inescapable for anyone reading the economic pages in the newspapers or making a living by working in a corporation (I am an ERP consultant). A book written before 1995 has become even more actual in 2003, the temporary relief during the 4 bubble years 98-01 notwithstanding, the economy is a Medusa raft. Why Gore was not allowed or not finding funding to make it a campaing theme is a perfectly understandable drama.The way it is brought: most of the evidence and working out of the theme is anecdotal and circumstantial, that makes for interesting and fast reading but leaves you without the solidity of scientific proof. There are no statistics, no graphs, no formulas, nothing of the kind. I did not need convincing of the truth of what is happening and those who are not will not by statistics or facts alone, but I like scientifically verifiable facts and figures.The solutions: undoubtably the non-market sector, guaranteed annual income and income transfers will have to play a role and Rifkin sites a wealth of names and studies supporting this. What I want to see are figures showing how it all adds up: how much redistribution, what are the required tax levels, what are the income levels needed to sustain a 'volunteer' middleclass, what are the permissable income gaps to make it work ?"},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"How many hours do you work a week? 44 hours? 40 hours? 30 hours? Or no work? Many people believe that the less we work, the more we are happy. However, is the labor time so important in future? Do you think it's very simple with the future of work? What's the most important thing with this subject?Do you have thought the future of civilization? The author pointed on the future of the work in civilization. Some people may think the author's opinion is too pessimistic to agree with his opinions. I think, however, the author's ideas are very great because he analyzed the roots of work and he continued an objective view in this book.According to the author's view, the work is related with not only the labor itself, but information technology, social changes and organization systems, Future Economics and so on. He did not said about the mass production work, nor lean production work. He make an effort to say about the directions of work changes, the counterproposal of idal work. For this objectives, he analysed various fields of knowledge: Information Technology, Sociology, Philosoghy, Economics, Business Administration and so on.If you have thirsty curiosity to the various Social Science or if you want to contact to the future of civilization, I tend to recommend this book without hesitation."},{"Title":"The End of Work","review":"Another reviewer criticized Rifkin for being a 'neo-Malthusian' - Malthus has not been proven wrong insofar as there are an excess number of potential labourers to work in a 'service'economy, hence that labour becomes less valuable. Rifkin is not a revolutionary theorist but makes some rather timid suggestions, along the lines of shortening the work week (that is not happening and even in France they will repeal the 35-hour week) to 'share'the available work, and valuing volunteerism (and what used to be nearly entirely the province of women). Politicians like Reagan like to give homilies about those who give of their own free will - people who help with disaster relief, work in free clinics or with homeless people or the indigent, tutor low-income children, etc., but as long as people give, their work will not be valued. It is those who control the wealth flow who will also wield political power, and not the meek. I think that some new work projects can be created but those are short-term solutions. In the long run, Rifkin doesn't really propose changing the capital market system that runs the world. In that sense, nothing he proposes is much different from the WPA programs of the 1930s-40s in the US. He seems to forget sometimes that he addressed this problem as a global problem. His proposal for volunteerim (the third sector) would not work in China, for example. The things that need to change and are changing are the bases of the economy, the things of value (oil and coal vs. renewables, housing materials that are energy-saving vs. US style cheap and wasteful, use of cars vs. public transport, trains vs. trucking)."},{"Title":"Mendel Rosenbusch: Tales for Jewish Children","review":"Mendel Rosenbusch: Tales For Jewish Children is a splendidly entertaining and highly recommended collection of eleven instructive tales, each set in a rural Czech village. These stories feature Mendel Rosenbusch, a wise, wonderful, poor man of God who lives in a small house behind the synagogue. One night, Mendel is visited by the angel Rafael, who places a ancient Jewish coin called a Shekel on his blanket. Rafael reveals that &quot;When you carry this coin with you, Mendel, then you will become invisible, and the coin will continue its magic power as long as your secret remains undiscovered.&quot; What follows are stories of how Mendel uses his magical invisibility to intervene in the lives of the townspeople. Each of the stories teaches young readers how to behave properly and to learn that virtue entails doing the right thing. A prolific playwright, poet, and children's author, Ilse Weber's wonderfully told folktales are ably translated into English by Ruth and Hans Fisher."},{"Title":"Mendel Rosenbusch: Tales for Jewish Children","review":"This beautifully written book by Ilse Weber, who perished in the Concentration Camp at Theresenstadt,tells enchanting stories for children. The hero is an old man who loves children and is beloved by them. Through the gift of becoming invisible at will he is able to observe and intervene in the lives of the people in his town. His interventions are always gentle and in the service of doing good, especially for the children. like most fairy tales, each story points out the moral good. But unlike the grim tales of the brothers'Grimm and most other fairy tales, there is no violence in these stories. They are good humored and upbeat. Rosenbush is a loving and lovable character. Of course, all of his good deeds are anonymous. The stories are aimed at elementary school aged chilren, but are so charming and sufficiently complex that they are very engaging for adults. All the adults we have shared them with are similarly smitten and are delighted to read them with their children and grandchildren. The translaters, Dr. Hans and Ruth Fisher, discovered an ancient copy of the book, originally written in German. As a child this had been Hans Fisher's favorite book. He immediately translated it for his own children and grandchildren with his wife's assistance. This led to its ultimate publication in English. Ilse Weber was a popular Czech writer of stories, poems and music during the 1920-s and 30's. As a Jew, she was tranported and murdered in the concentration camp."},{"Title":"Off the Mangrove Coast (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Louis L'Amour was one of the great writers of modern times, and he is sorely missed by everyone that loves a good story. This book is one of the best collections of his short stories, some of them never before published. His books and stories are often filled with a deep sense of justice, and the ultimate triumph of all that is right. The stories in &quot;Off The Mangrove Coast&quot;, follow that pattern. There is the story of a boxer, seeking justice for the cruel death of his father. In another story a man goes out into the jungles of Borneo, trying to rescue some tourists from murderers and headhunters. There is a story about a true friendship that forms during a perilous journey on the sea, in search of treasure. There are nine stories included in this book. These are stories about the heart of adventure and courage, and the surprising good that can sometimes be found in very unexpected places. Louis L'Amour wanted to be remembered as a good storyteller, and in this and so many of his other books that wish has always been fulfilled."},{"Title":"Off the Mangrove Coast (Louis L'Amour)","review":"The nince uncollected stories here range from L'Amour's earliest days as a writer to his latest, but are linked by protagonists seeking justice. While L'Amour is most famous for his Westerns, most of these stories draw upon his own life experiences for their setting and subjects. L'Amour was a boxer, winning over 50 bouts, and in \\"Fighters Should Be Hungry\\" he presents the classic tale of a hungry kid seeking to avenge his father's death. Boxing surfaces again in the equally formulaic \\"The Rounds Don't Matter.\\" I don't know that he was ever a detective, but he's not much of a detective writer, based on the two weak pulp stories here, \\"The Unexpected Corprse\\" and \\"Time of Teror.\\" For the Western fans, there's a quite nice little tale of outlaws and gold, called \\"The Secret of Silver Springs.\\" And for the checkers fans there's a brief little throwaway tale about a champion seaman checker player called \\"It's Your Move.\\" I have to confess that \\"The Cross and the Candle\\" made such a small impression that I have no idea what it was about! The two best stories derive their quality from L'Amour's travels. \\"Off the Mangrove Coast\\" is about a villanous quarter of sailors seeking gold lost at sea. It's a tense, gripping story with a great fight scene. The longest and best story is \\"The Diamond of Jeru\\", about an expatriate American on Borneo who dreams of making a big diamond score so he go back home. When an American couple hire him to take them upriver, it turns into Deliverance meets The Headhunters. It's a great old-fashioned adventure tale that was recently made into a cable movie. All in all, a mixed bag with two gems and a few lumps of coal."},{"Title":"Off the Mangrove Coast (Louis L'Amour)","review":"Last September I found myself in a desperate situation, i.e. in a holding pattern with nothing to read. Then, I found a cast-off copy ofSackett (The Sacketts, No 6)by Louis L'Amour, which, though being the pulpiest of formulaic western fiction, at least served the immediate purpose of mental diversion. Why, it was even engaging enough to finish. The question then arose: Should I obtain and read more of, if not all of, his other westerns? Uh ... no, that's just not an option because I suspect they're all cut from the same piece of rawhide. And there are just too many. And there's just too little daily reading time in my life to recklessly fritter it away. However, I did note that he's written other short stories not of the western genre (Say it ain't so, Joe!) and I thought, before I cut the author loose, that I would give them a go. Simply out of curiosity, mind you. Thus, OFF THE MANGROVE COAST.This is a compendium of nine short stories ranging in length from nine to sixty-eight pages. One unfolds in the Old West. The other eight take place more or less contemporarily in Borneo (2) and the United States (6). The heroes are two boxers, a private eye, an expatriate American in Paris, two treasure-hunting adventurers, a cowboy drifter, an insurance salesman, and a checkers player. (Perhaps a series could be built around the checkers player, you think?)All the stories read as if tamed-down versions of those written for the male-oriented \\"men's adventure\\" genre of pulp magazines in the 50s and 60s. I say \\"tamed-down\\" because only once is a scantily-clad female part of the plot - and that but briefly. Otherwise, all the male heroes are reacting to danger and opposition with the expected all-American virtues: competence, perseverance, bravery, gallantry, loyalty, and a sense of justice deserved. It's Good vs. Evil in black and white. While this is perfectly fine - indeed, thriller fiction traditionally follows this general formula - there are none of the messy, gray areas that one sees in the real world, which are an essential part of the plots from my personal favorite author, Gerald Seymour, and which are the incubators of Pyrrhic victories contested by protagonists that aren't overtly heroic and antagonists that aren't totally iniquitous.Louis L'Amour was apparently writing for a different audience in a simpler time, i.e. readers living during the Cold War when it was the Godless Red Menace against God-Fearing America and its allies. Only in the beginning of the last short, \\"Time of Terror\\", did I get a hint of something more edgy - something akin to the weird reality found in a Dean Koontz thriller, but the story ended abruptly without evolving further in that style.Ok, ok. Perhaps I'm over-dramatizing and over-simplifying. The point is, L'Amour's characters and plots are to me more unadorned and less ambiguous than those I've come to appreciate in the twenty-first century; for whatever reasons the author's tales seem very mid-20th century. However, that said, I'm awarding OFF THE MANGROVE COAST, like I did SACKETT, four stars because the stories are representative of their time and, while not riveting or likely to cause the reader to do a mental double-take, are nonetheless enjoyable to a better than average degree."},{"Title":"Off the Mangrove Coast (Louis L'Amour)","review":"I came upon this book having no prior experience with the work of Louis L'Amour. Now I am a convert, and will eagerly search out other novels and short stories by this great American storyteller. Written in stirring yet simple prose, this collection of nine short stories is a perfect antidote for too many \\"serious\\" books. Each tale presents a new cast of memorable characters, and usually offers a riveting moment when true courage is summoned against odds. If the tropes seem familiar, dont blame L'Amour!

It doesn't matter whether you are six or sixty-six; this book brings out the inner child in all of us. The clever plot twists and fantasy worlds keep your mind on edge. Instead of Three Wishes is composed of seven mystical short stories that will amaze you. The second story is entitled &quot;Leroy Roachbane.&quot; This story involves a child named Leroy. Every morning Leroy woke up and went into his pantry to kill off any cockroaches before his mother entered. One day after his daily duty, Leroy went to the store to buy boric acid and roach motels. On his way home, Leroy's bike skid on an ice patch, and he was knocked unconscious. Leroy's mind began to wander, and took him to a place in many ways similar to his own life. When Leroy regained consciousness, he discovered something out of the ordinary. This story was incredibly entertaining and mind boggling, as is the next story. The third story is called the &quot;Factory.&quot; In short, this story concerns a new employee that will work the high crane at a local factory. For some reason, this job has been vacant often. One day while the employee was reading on his lunch break, he saw another figure that seemed to also be reading. In actuality, the figure was the ghost of a little girl who once lived on the factory lot. This story takes what we think we know and twists it into the unknown. &quot;Factory&quot; makes you wonder if there is an afterlife, in a fun and lighthearted way. The fifth story is the title story. This story is in some ways similar to the first story in the book. It involves a student who helped an unrecognizable elf prince cross a busy intersection. In return the prince offers the student three wishes. THe student declines the offer and moves on. Over the next weeks, the student and her dis abled mother recieved a handful of gifts, which they decline. In the end, the perfect gift is evident, the offer was so thoughtful, and the student could not refuse. This story was very interesting to read because of the personal connections.

The final story is entitled &quot; The Baker King.&quot; i personally found this story to be the most humorous and entertaining. The story involves an island country without a king. The elderly king sent his only son off to boarding school, but no one thought enough to ask where. After a short while, the king passed away, and the island was without a leader. The king's court decided it would simply wait for a letter from the prince. After nine years, a letter was finally recieved. But it was not from the prince. It was from a wanted bandit. The letter prolaimed that the bandit would king himself once he and his gang arrived in the country. With little time to spare, the minister of cultural events, Orvis, went out one night and accidentally ran into a baker. Orvis was convinced that the baker could very easily pass as the king. In the end, the baker became king for a day, but then chose to return to the bakery. This story has many interesting, funny, and clever parts. &quot;The Baker King&quot;, also has a nice overall theme. The story shows, that being rich and famous is not perfect for everyone.

Mom works for him. And Dad writes a series of entertaining, immensely popular, pun-filled books on the English language. (No, I'm not making this up.)Therefore, the book is filled with a harrowing life story, a report on what it feels like to be the final table of a big poker tourney, and poker tips. The poker tips are scattered about the text in little boxes, but they are the real goods from a professional player.Unlike other poker memoirs I've read, this book has a whiz-bang happy ending, and it reads as fast as folding to an allin bet from Ms. Duke.Or, for another point of view on Annie's family, read Poker Face by Katy Lederer, her younger sister. (I told you they're all geniuses.) It's a touching memoir of growing up Lederer, but you won't learn any poker from it.P.S. I wanted a bigger book with more poker strategy. When you learn how well Annie's done at the tables, you know she knows a lot more than she reveals about the game."},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"I have been playing poker for several years, and when they started broadcasting the World Series of Poker on ESPN I was hooked from the start. And as happens to most people I immediately took a liking for some players and started hating others. Annie Duke was among my favorites from the start, together with Daniel Negreanu, Chris Ferguson and Gus Hansen. So 2004 was a great year for \\"my players\\", since Negreanu was player of the year, battling it out with Ferguson, Hansen dominated the WPT, and Annie won the Tournament of Champions.That is why when this book came out I undoubtedly wanted to check it out; and the result was as good as expected. Not only did I get to relive in Annie's own narration some of the tournaments she had played, but I also got to know more about what led her to that place in life. On top of that, she uses a very interesting style in her writing, intertwining the chapters about poker with those dealing with her marriage, studies and kids. While I was reading this book I got the same sense I get from when I see her playing on TV: that she is a very entertaining person, and one that would be fun to have in my poker table (of course, unless my goal is to win some money).Annie also includes text boxes throughout the book that contain poker advice, mostly for newbies, but I found a couple of pointers that helped me become a better player. At the end there is a more thorough explanation about the different types of poker (focused on Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha Hi-Lo) and a brief description of the most prominent poker players that dominate the spotlight nowadays.The book is great, but I cannot help but point out a couple of things that surprised me as being wrong. The first one has to do with the fact that Annie makes reference to another poker pro that carried out a vicious internet campaign against her, but she never mentions him by name. I don't really understand the reason behind this mystery. The second has to do with a mistake she makes when describing an Omaha hand. She mentions having a nut straight, which is accurate, but then she goes on to say that the straight was A-K-Q-J-10 when for this she is using three of her hole cards (A,Q,J), which you cannot do in Omaha. She did have the nut straight, because there was a 9 on the board, and the straight was K-Q-J-10-9. Anyway, this is not a huge deal, but it really surprised me that such an accomplished poker player would make that mistake. Bottom line: she still gets five stars in my book!"},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"The two best reasons for reading ANNIE DUKE are for its point of view on big-time tournament poker and its honest self-examination of the life a controversial poker pro.Duke and co-author David Diamond succeed in revealing a view from the table at high-pressure poker tournaments. The book goes through Duke's win at the World Series of Poker in 2004, then at the Tournament of Champions later that year. The vivid details and notes on the hands (the book isn't overly technical and contains explanations of the terms and rules of play, but part of the book's draw is that it takes you \\"inside,\\" and that includes playing some poker hands) help understand the swirl of emotions and details that can fill a player's head when they get into this unusual environment.The second reason for recommending the book is Duke's willingness to reveal how she became a professional poker player and celebrity through the circuitous route of a competitive family, academia, marriage, and motherhood. Plenty has been written about Annie Duke's story (including her sister Katy Lederer's POKER FACE, which also tells the story of their unusual and remarkable family). Her own version has some new details, but its best feature is its honesty. Duke thinks highly of her poker abilities and says so, but she also shares stories of her losses, insecurities, and bad decisions. She does a great job explaining the decisions that brought her into poker as well as those that led to her backing away from the biggest cash games.Duke and Diamond also structured the book in a very readable fashion, shifting chapter-to-chapter between the action in her two big poker wins and her life story.As a matter of disclosure, I wrote a book about professional poker players this year, but never spoke with Duke in connection with it. One of my sources on that book was Annie Duke's brother, Howard Lederer. But many other sources were players who did not like Duke and whose attacks on her are mentioned (though she doesn't give out their names) in her book."},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"Have you ever tried to tell a story to a friend or acquaintance, some personal epic filled with twists and turns, comedy and drama, thrills and chills and all sorts of gut clenching climaxes only to be met with a blank expression and a vaguely rhetorical \\"I guess you just had to have been there?\\" That was my reaction to this book.It's an interesting insight to gambling culture and one woman's take on it, but after a while the two threads of the book (chapters alternate between her autobiography and her experiences at the World Series of Poker) begin to feel schizophrenic. Her history begins to read more and more like a recitation of rote facts while her descriptions of the hands she played in Vegas become more bombastic, which makes for an awkward reading experience. One chapter is a description of how she met this guy and they hung out and he moved back west and then she married him and followed him and so on while the next is a breathless explanation of how exciting it was when the three of clubs came up!Given that this book is essentially focussed on her experiences in poker, this dichotomy is perfectly understandable, but towards the end of the book I was worn out by the constant yo-yoing of the narrative that I was simply relieved to be done with it."},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"The name of this book is Annie Duke and it's all about Annie Duke and how she won the Omaha 8 or Better tournament at the World Series of Poker, how she won the Tournament of Champions against a field of very good players, how she had four kids, how she grew up, how she got married and divorced, her anxiety attacks, her almost academic career, her critics, her passion for poker, etc.The part I liked best was when she went into the Crystal Lounge in beautiful downtown Billings, Montana for the first time to play poker against an all-male line up of crusty old ranchers and cowboys and assorted male chauvinists. In one of the first hands she was dealt ace-queen and got a lot action and ended up making a full house on the river. How sweet that must have been!It is also about how Annie kicks off her shoes and tucks her legs under her butt and settles in to play cards; how she punks when she feels panicky, but how once the cards are in the air, she is in no danger of throwing up. The cards and the machinations of the game distract her. This is also about how she wanted so much to be thin and liked and pretty, and how she loved to party.Frankly I don't know what to make of Annie (n&eacute;e Lederer) Duke. Personally I never played cards with her. I don't know whether she wins because she's good at reading people, or because she has an instinct for sharp aggressive play, or because of her experience and understanding of the game. Reading this book I would say all three. Her brother Howard Lederer is a world class player himself, and he taught her a lot. And she paid her dues playing small stakes games.I found it interesting that while playing $50 and $100 hold'em in Vegas she made between $50 and $100 an hour (p. 160). And when she played at home on the Internet she made about $40 an hour. She also writes about losing $300,000 in one week at high stakes cash games (p. 182), and intimates that she bombed out of the $1,000/$2,000 hold'em game at (I presume) the Bellagio. She writes she \\"wasn't happy\\" playing at that level (p. 189). One thing I have to tell you--and Annie Duke mentions not a word about this subject, not a single word, is that high stakes poker players have an intimate relationship with the IRS and they are always trying to find ways to lay off their winnings to reduce their taxes. So I would take her winning and losing figures with the proverbial grain of salt.It is also interesting to note that Annie Duke may be more of an instinctive player than a scientific/mathematical player. The great swings that her bankroll apparently went through suggest that she (and her brother as well) are very, very good when they are on, but fairly ordinary when they are off their game. Scientific/mathematical players keep a more even keel. Of course the greatest players in the world are both instinctive and scientific.She writes that you can have a hand in which you are a 2 to 1 favorite and can \\"lose it ten times in a row,\\" adding \\"that's not statistically surprising\\" (box on page 183). Well, the odds against losing ten times in a row when you are a 2 to 1 fav are almost sixty thousand to one. If it happens, it would be a lot more than \\"statistically surprising.\\"She also writes that for safety's sake you ought to have about 300 times the big blind in your game as a bankroll. Actually, how big a bankroll you need depends on what kind of player you are and how great an edge you have over the competition. If you have a big edge, you only need a small bankroll. If your edge is small you need a larger bankroll. But even if you are a winning player but play a lot of hands, your variance will be larger and you will need a larger bankroll. Annie does a good job of explaining this in Chapter 24. However, she reports that her brother went through a four-month period when he was \\"losing literally every day.\\" (p. 182)Somehow I doubt that. The odds of a winning player losing that consistently are astronomical. What can happen, however, is that even very good players can drift away from their best game and can go on TILT. They can lose their confidence and actually become losing players.As was pointed out by another reviewer that was a king-high straight that she made on page 49, not an ace-high, but that isn't her mistake. That's the equivalent of a typo. Another bit of carelessness is in the glossary where \\"river\\" is defined as the \\"final community card in Texas Hold'em or Omaha.\\" Actually the term originally referred to the final card in seven card stud, a game appropriately dubbed \\"Down the River\\" long before hold'em ever came into existence.By the way, if you don't know how to play Omaha 8 or better (also called Omaha hi-lo) a lot of poker hands she recalls will be difficult to appreciate. Also the structure of the book in which alternating chapters refer to her playing and then to her life experiences may be a bit artificial for some readers.Bottom line: a little too, too much Annie Duke here for some readers and not much in the way of instruction, but an interesting read anyway.One final point: she did it. Annie beat the best and she made millions, and nobody can take that away from her. I just hope she invests her winnings well and concentrates on raising her four kids."},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"Annie Duke's book is long on title, short on substance. The chapters alternate from her past to her present (at the time...her first big win in an Omaha Hi Lo tourney). The present-day stuff is presented well and you get a feel for what happens at a poker tournament...tension, boredom, table talk, and \\"rail birds\\" are all covered well. That's the good part and poker fans like myself will enjoy it for that.The bad part is that the personal stuff is not fleshed out enough. The breakdown of her marraige for example, is never really explored and I'm certain there was a good story behind it. The relationships between herself, mother, and father are described in depth at first, but the parents seem to drop off the face of the earth about midway with little or no description of her relationship with them now. Since she included this personal side in the book, she should have followed it through and given the reader a full picture of where she is now.Prior to reading this book I admired Annie Duke. She is competing in what is truly a man's world and for that she should be congratulated. Unfortunately, after reading this, I ended up not liking her at all. The \\"poor me\\" attitude she adopts runs thin after just a few chapters. Poor her, indeed. Having to \\"scrape by\\" on her husband's TRUST FUND. Those of us who work every day aren't likely to feel sorry for such a self-centered mess. I feel certain that if she had included more detail in the past/personal life chapters, one would understand and sympathize with her more."},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"Not knowing much about Annie Duke, but being a big fan of biographies and Poker I couldn't resist picking this book up in a bargain bin. It was the hardcover and selling cheap, had to have it.I got my money's worth. It was a nice distraction from the other book I am reading now. I like how she lays out her life story while describing her win in the Omaha 8-or better tourney she was in. The reading was smooth, the story interesting and I liked her poker insights, although fairly basic in nature, which is the way I believe she intended them since this is a biographical account of her rather then a poker study manual, they are timely reminders for the game.I give the book barely 4 stars, simply because I was not bored reading it. Most books have areas that are snoozers or after 50 pages you ask yourself \\"What was that I just read?\\" Get this book if you want to read about the genesis of a great poker player that started out in life going where she was expected to go only find out that she was on the wrong road and then rather then doing a U-turn she drove off the road, cut through the forest or land and got on the right highway. This book was good and worth the discount price I paid. The EV was there for me. I'd recommend it from that percpective."},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"This is not one of the typical how-to hold'em books that have flooded the market. While there is a sizable amount of material focused on poker, it is not all hold'em either, it is really two great stories woven into one book.The recounting of Annie's win of her WSOP bracelet in Omaha 8 is well told and interesting. There isn't too big a focus on hand-by-hand play. The tips she gives on this form of poker are great, too. This part of the book fueled my interest in expanding my poker prowess into this game.The other story is Annie's bio. I was really intrigued to read about the roots she came from to the bracelet winning pro poker player she is today. And she includes the hard times in her life, too, which I found particularly poignant.It is one of my favorite poker books, partly because it's not all poker, and one I'd recommend to anyone with a love of the game."},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"Annie Duke really does have a story to tell.

She does provide an interesting and unique story that serves as a inspiration for those who wish to have a life in the poker world. The book strikes a balance between poker mechanics and her personal life as a mother of four children - each helping to explain the woman who is Annie Duke.

And You Can Too (Plume, 2005)If you put aside the odd grammar of the book's title and dig into it, the first word that will no doubt come to mind is readable; I am not (to understate the case a great deal) a fan of memoirs, and I still devoured this in one day (while working on two other books as well). Duke, or co-writer David Diamond, or both, is a born storyteller. And while I grant you that people who don't play (or watch) poker are probably not going to be as on the edge of their collective seat during the relating of a particular hand in a particular tournament, there's more than enough meat in Duke's private life to keep the non-card-sharks interested as well. ***"},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"Fun and entertaining read.

Annie Duke is one of the most visible figures in the game and this autobiography provides a great insight into her life told in her own words. She exposes almost every facet of her personality, from her continuing battle with anxiety to her unyielding drive to win. The only slight negative to this book is that she repeatedly builds herself up. She carries a tremendous chip on her shoulder. Annie also appears arrogant at times, which is one of the principal criticisms other poker players have of her. All told, however, this is yet another great poker book that belongs in the collection of a serious player."},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"This is a great story, and deserves telling. It's split about 50/50 between Annie's personal life and her poker experiences. Both of these are compelling.

If you're interested in the poker lifestyle, though, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Annie Duke: How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker","review":"This is a fascinating, entertaining book. Annie Duke is an incredible person -- in part because of her caring personality and her character strengths, and in part because of the turmoil that she's gone though in life while still emerging as a stong successful person. All these interesting aspects of her life come out as you read the book, together with some insight into how to play poker (both Omaha Hi-Lo and Texas Hold-Em).Duke's life provides a new twist on a Horatio Alger story -- she started with nothing, playing poker to earn her $125/month mortgage payment, and ended up winning $2 million at the ESPN Tournament of Champions. She endured ups and downs to get there, in poker and in life, and it's clear that she's come out a stronger, more emotionally balanced person as a result.

Many of the details of the poker celeb's life overlaps between the two books. The first person narrative feels as if it was written by a ghost writer.

She's wasting her life, and this book is proof.And the book is flawed. She describes a hand where she has a king-high strait, but claims to have an ace-high straight. Even amateur poker players like me immediately noticed that error. It's simply unacceptable in a book like this. The equivalent would be Michael Jordan mentioning the NBA's 35-second shot clock in his biography, when in reality it's a 24-second clock. It's laughable. When a professional poker player can't get the rules straight, I have to seriously doubt her credibility.

Olin Foundation Changed America","review":"This simply stunned me. It's as much an eye-opening experience I've had in a 3-4 years. An amazing journey - some new ground and some old, but all seen in a totally new light.Those who have followed the development of public policy intellectual thought over the past 2 decades are will recognize the supporting cast here: Allan Bloom, Tod Lindberg, John Chubb, Irving Kristol - and organizations - American Enterprise Institute, National Association of Scholars, Collegiate Network, American Council of Trustees and Alumni,....One originally sees these and appreciates the struggles of the founders of these groups, the efforts, the results; one knows that the participants from like-minded organizations move in intersecting circles and meet each other in philosophical agreement.Yet it had never even occurred to me that all could be tied together so in a common bond of support through a single funder, via a dedicated team that methodically sought out and empowered each and all.And then the amazing story of Law and Economics, a discipline which I'd never heard named before (nor, probably, had my MBA professors). And yet, there it built up and spread across the country, providing a cutting edge of learned thought. Many of us think often of the Law's impact on our economics in the US - especially via a National minimum wage (which skews everyone's views of fair, localized, work-appropriate compensation). But the story of systematically introducing economics into our wayward law schools was a tale worthy of Tom Clancy!This truly was astounding work the Olin Board and Staff were engaged in.This spring brings much commentary from Francis Fukuyama on the war. Miller reveals that it was the John M. Olin Foundation which sponsored the orignial debates and publications to give Fukuyama fame.I must say, I finished the book jealous of the Olin staff. What great fun to work with such intellectual diversity and excellence.

This is a must read for anyone wishing to expand into the feminine mysteries."},{"Title":"Beyond Heaven","review":"This powerful and compelling novel of ancestral spiritual responsibility will expand your awareness of the unseen mysteries of the universe. Summer Moon Bradley, a young black woman growing up in Virginia, learns the sacred history and spiritual traditions of her ancestors, the Tribe of Dan, from her elderly grandmother, Granmoon, who raised her. This tribe, one of the so called lost tribes of Israel in the Bible, was a society in ancient times made up of powerful women who had the secrets of the world. They were followers of the Goddess, the feminine spirit and creator of everything in the universe, who was considered the Creator long before the name of the Creator was later changed to God, a masculine spirit. During Summer's formative years, Granmoon teaches her the ancient secrets of the followers of the Goddess, because she knows that Summer has the mark and has been chosen to carry on those secrets. Before her death when Summer is 17, Granmoon tells her, \\"Believe in the Goddess and have faith.\\" This use of the word Goddess instead of God confuses Summer so Granmoon explains:\\"Everything of value on the earth and through God came by way of the female - land, money, power, the ability to create life, the blessing to heal, and the gift of prophecy. ... She nourished everything. She is Nature and the earth. Nothing exists without Her. She is the breath within you, the wind and water and the air we breathe. She feeds us and protects us. Don\`t ever forget that. You hear me? ... Before the fathers came, everybody believed in and worshipped the Goddess. The father powers brought the man God when they came. When that happened, the people turned away from Her because they was scared. But our family line defied them. We is descended from a long line of priestesses. We was loyal and dedicated. As a family we is proud to serve in ministry to the One who nurtured us. We in special favor to Her who we call the Goddess.\\"The story continues after Granmoon's passing as Summer comes to an awareness of her inherited gifts through her deeply disturbing and prophetic nightmares. In her dreams her own spirit travels throughout the universe, what is called astral travel. She eventually must do battle against a force of evil for which she will use all of the Goddess powers that Granmoon taught her.This is a spiritual thriller that will hold you in suspended animation as you are drawn into the mystical world of feminine spiritual power and the battles between the good and evil unseen forces in the world. Highly recommended for anyone but especially for those seeking to learn more about the Divine Feminine."},{"Title":"Slavery in the Islamic Middle East","review":"This book collects five essays by scholars on different aspects of slavery in the Muslim Middle East. Contrary to the title, it is not a comprehensive review of the phenomenon -- vast in time, space, and social, political, and economic features -- but snapshots of slavery in a few limited contexts. Perhaps the essay that will appeal most to non-specialists is John Hunwick's discussion of the role race played in enslavement in northern and western Africa; he teases out the various conflicting strands of legal-religious theory and practice on the ground to bring to life a relationship between slavery and race with tantalizing differences from and similarities to the system Americans are most familiar with. Also good are the editor's (Shaun Marmon) discussion of domestic slavery among the Mamluks and Yvonne Seng's on slavery in Istanbul. Michel Le Gall contributes a translation of an account by a French doctor of the slave trade in late eighteenth-century Cairo; it contains some useful data and has been judiciously annotated, but anyone who wants to use it seriously will no doubt consult the original French. The volume ends with a posthumous essay ranging broadly over time and space by the great scholar David Ayalon. While there is probably nothing much new here, it is fun to watch a great mind playing with history on the broad scale. It is a pity that the editor did not feel the need to supply the references that a scholar like Ayalon would surely have included in a final revision had he lived to complete it."},{"Title":"Slavery in the Islamic Middle East","review":"Compiled and edited by Shaun E. Marmon, Slavery In The Islamic Middle East is an impressive and informative selection of scholarly essays examining the institution of slavery as recognized and regulated by Islamic law, and as incorporated into Muslim societies well into the modern day. Looking at military slavery in Islam in the pre-modern period, the connection between skin color and slavery, a memoir portraying a raw and real look at victims of the African slave trade, and more, Slavery In The Islamic Middle East is a welcome and invaluable addition to Middle Eastern History and Islamic Studies reference shelves and reading lists."},{"Title":"Slavery in the Islamic Middle East","review":"The five essays in this book were not intended to offer a comprehensive look at slavery in the Islamic world, but to serve \\"as contributions to the ongoing study of slavery in Islamic societies,\\" according to editor Shaun Elizabeth Marmon.In her article, the first, the editor focuses on the representations of slavery and all its aspects in narrative Mamluk Egyptian sources. But she focuses mostly on the domestic slaves, who were \\"omnipresent in Mamluk urban society.\\" As she notes in the article, \\"The enslaved individual suffered a kind of legal and social metamorphosis. He left the realm of human beings and entered the real of commodities (al-sila) thus losing his legal capacity (ahliyya) to act of and for himself.\\" Thus, the slave had no rights whatever-- to marry of his own accord, to own property, to act as a witness, to inherit or bequeath, to be in authority of any kind, or to execute any contracts, to control one's sexual life or even to control her own offspring. Moreover, religious admonishments to beat a slave \\"point to a harsh reality.\\" And make no mistake, the society was built upon the labors of slaves.Next, Yvonne Seng discusses slavery in 16th century Istanbul. This study, too, is based on contemporary documents, studied at the Muftuluk Archives in Istanbul. These archives reveal that the slaves were treated as objects in various inventories of household goods. Unlike \\"mute property,\\" they were considered \\"property with voice\\" (mal-i-natik), albeit sharing a demeaned position equal to that of livestock.To a large extent, slaves ended up as part of the freed, subject population, or reaya, but they ended in this undesirable position as a result of the barbaric devshirme, the annual tax on subject peoples taken in human children. But \\"Slaves [also] began their passage into local communities through capture during either military campaigns or commercial slave raids.\\" The primary collection points were via Ottoman campaigns into the Balkans and Crimean raids into Russia and Poland. Slaves also included Hungarian, Wallachian, Bulgarian, African, Circassian, Albanian and Greek victims. Slaves were inculcated in Islamic practice and forced to convert, thus sometimes moving from infidel slave to Muslim Ottoman subject.John Hunwick then takes on \\"Islamic Law and Polemics over Race and Slavery in North and West Africa\\" in the 16th through 19th centuries. As he notes at the start, race was always a secondary factor after belief. \\"In the Muslim world, attitudes towards various human groups have been most obviously an artifact of the single greatest prejudice of Muslim peoples-the prejudice against 'unbelievers,' for these were the archetypal 'other'.\\" Slavery was seen as both \\"a result of unbelief and, in most cases, a cure for it.\\" Nevertheless, Black Africans were a group, clearly identifiable by race, who had been transported to the Mediterranean Muslim region as slaves (and as former infidels). Even after manumition, there was \\"a clear tension between the idealism of the shari'a and certain attitudes--no doubt of long standing--about black Africans.\\"Michel Le Gall has translated an 1802 memoir of Dr. Louis Frank, who describes in great detail the deplorable conditions of Sudanese slaves held in Muslim Egypt, and specifically Cairo. This includes the prejudices of slave-owners and the many diseases encountered by the slaves. As a result of Islamic wars of conquest, the subjects of the vanquished rulers became the sultan's \\"captives and they are either kept in his service or are sold or exchanges for commodities such as linen, towels, clothing, cows, camels, horses, etc.\\" Secondly, slaves were kidnapped, a practice which brought \\"a smaller number of these unhappy wretches into a state of slavery.\\" Thirdly, Islamic warlords trailed \\"wandering hordes\\" with no religion or government to protect them. The besieged men, overcome by hunger and thirst, were then bound with cords and chains, and sold or exchanged for other commodities.Finally, we read the work of the late scholar, David Ayalon on the importance of the Mamluks to Islam's military might. \\"They were taken from their homelands at or near the age of puberty,\\" he writes. Upon reaching the Muslim lands, under force, \\"they were converted to Islam.\\" Unfortunately, the scholar wrongly concludes that the boys could quite often better their lot via this route. The fact is, only \\"the best\\" were chosen as Mamluks, and in any case, they were slaves, forced to comply with their masters' wishes. To conclude that this lot was somehow better than life with their families in Europe defies logic.Nevertheless, this is an important collection.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Slavery in the Islamic Middle East","review":"I just reread this book for the second time in ten years. I first read it in 2002. While I admit the book was somewhat interesting, it did not provide me with enough interest to give it a Four-Star rating. I felt the differing authors provided no consistency in thesis which only made me question where the essay was going.The book contains five essays that are rather disjointed in time and descriptions. The last review by the late Professor David Ayalon had very little to do with slavery. Indeed, it seemed to be more about Islam's descent from major power to nominal participant in the world scene by late 20th/early 21st century. Which would be fine in a geopolitical book, but this was a book that was supposed to deal with Slavery In The Middle East.There was little that I learned from this book. However, the two best essays were written by John Hunwick and Michel Le Gall (Le Gall's Being A Translation Of Louis Frank's 19th Century Essay). The rest are not worth mentioning, although I admit I was interested in Ayalon's essay from the standpoint of his explanations of why Islamic societies fell short of Western Societies in technology. \\"The Cause of Western Superiority--A Tentative Explanation\\" discussed in detail the reasons why Islamic societies have fallen short of Christian societies. Indeed, his viewpoints were expanded in full by Bernard Lewis in his text What Went Wrong. I plan to read that book at some point.In short, this book is best read as an ancillary document to other, better researched titles. I have read and reviewed on Amazon the book Slavery In The Arab World, written by Murray Gordon. That was an excellent book and one I highly recommend for both professional scholars and serious amateurs. I also read some years ago Race & Slavery In The Middle East written by the great Bernard Lewis. This book too I recommend, although I have yet to review it for Amazon. Indeed, John Hunwick even cites Bernard Lewis in his essay \\"Islamic Law & Polemics Over Race & Slavery In North & West Africa (16th-19th Century),\\" on pages 43 & 63. This only shows how Bernard Lewis affected so many other historians (Even Murray Gordon), and how he will always be the scholar of note for Islamic/African studies.A.

His argument rests on several themes / assumptions, some of the most important of which are:- The sonic boom is an intractable physics problem for any SST and thus operation on any overland route is not feasible.- Due to the amortization of what would have to be massive development costs(and thus passed on as purchase costs to the airliners) coupled with massive increases in fuel costs to operate SST's, their ticket price would only be affordable for 1st class passengers and possibly some upper-end business class passengers, some ~3-4% of current traveler volume.- The combination of increased aircraft productivity (an SST could potentially make two passenger carrying flights for every one a subsonic airliner could in the same amount of time), with the small share of traveler volume that could afford tickets on the small number of routes that can be serviced (over water only flights, i.e. New York to London, vice. Los Angeles to London) means that the total market for 200-300 passenger SSTs at the time of his writing the book was about a couple dozen total.The author delves into some basic market analysis techniques (the primary one is literally just dividing total first class annual passenger volume on potential routes by the number of seat-trips an SST design could make per year to determine potential fleet size) that are pretty illuminating for someone with an interest in aircraft design who has never started from the very begining in a commercial design and done some market analysis themselves. Overall his arguments, when made and when his assumptions are granted, are pretty convincing.Most of the book is more history than market analysis techniques and application, and he shows quite well that SST proponents in the past have pursued a Chimera of their own illusion when trying to justify efforts such as Boeing's ill-fated 2707 answer to the Concorde (not to mention the Concorde itself) and NASA's HSCT of the '90's. He also spends a chapter on the idea of a hypersonic transport (which is not a very good one, worse economics and far more challenging engineering) and ends with a brief argument for why only larger jets is the practical way to go forward in commercial aviation. (The book was written in the late '90's.)The idiosyncratic part of the book is that it is very evidently self published and suffers from some distracting flaws an editor could have fixed. It kind of rambles here and there, and his arguments could have been delivered in a more logical and organized manner. There are numerous typos, to the point of being annoying, and in multiple paragraphs he refers you to literally \\"see page __ of chapter __\\" (with the blanks unfilled in!) or the wrong page of the wrong chapter. (At one point he refers you to a page number that's higher than the last page of the book.) This doesn't make his arguments wrong, but it does give the book a rushed and unprofessional feel. It's also needlessly angry. However some of his invective is warranted. He does document how taxpayer money has been spent on aerospace projects with practically no chance of success and which have been championed by people who either should have known better or lied to drink from the public trough, on both sides of the Atlantic. As the author is a former member of the UK aerospace industry, which catastrophically collapsed from mismanagement -including, but not solely as the result of, fallout from the Concorde program- he has personal experience from which he speaks.All in all this is a good book, and a quick and easy one, for aerospace engineers to read, especially those involved with commercial aircraft projects. It does suffer from some noticeably poor editing though.End of ReviewA follow-on. As someone who can't help but think that things like the Concorde or the concept designs from the High Speed Civil Transport Study are objects of pure beauty and who not so secretly wishes for the chance to ride on a supersonic jet someday, does this book hammer the final nail in the SST coffin? Not necessarily . . . (but I'm obviously biased.)- The fact is, is that SST's will always cost more than a subsonic aircraft (and thus have smaller market potential) and that there are extreme engineering challenges facing their development. Previous attempts to build them have been drastically ahead of their time at best, and as such admittedly pretty dismal failures. The author claims that this will always be the case.- However, airline traffic volume is increasing as the world becomes increasingly wealthy, and markets for all types of air travel are increasing in size year after year. I bring this up because at one point the author relates how on an SST project he worked on the project engineers told him there was an identified market for 200 SST's. Not believing the numbers, mentioning particularly the data point that there were 3,000 seats a day from LA to Honolulu in the market data the project engineers were using, the author discovered that the project engineers accidentally took the weekly data he gave them as the market analyst and entered it into their models as if it was daily data, thus increasing the actual market seven-fold by accident. However this was around 1980. Doing a quick search on travelocity for LA to Honolulu flights recently this reviewer tried to look up how many jets of what type and from which airlines were flying that route daily, and using seat data from seat guru for each aircraft type and airline, was able to calculate 3,016 seats daily.- One of the author's assumptions is that SSTs will never be able to fly over land because of the sonic boom. However recent research, including a flight demonstration by a modified F-5 fighter, have shown that the overpressure N-wave that a supersonic aircraft produces and is heard as the characteristic sonic boom can actually be \\"shaped\\" and thus turned into a much quieter sonic \\"woosh\\" which may be acceptable to overland flight. If true, and if the shape modifications to aircraft necessary to shape the sonic boom don't destroy their lift over drag ratios or empty weights, this could increase the number of routes an SST could fly on.- Inspired by the author's \\"bottom-up\\" market analysis methods this reviewer used travelocity.com and seatguru.com to count the number of daily seats (including specifically first and business class seats) on 44 major city pairs felt to have the highest daily traffic, i.e. routes like New York to London, London to Hong Kong, etc. (I have a professional interest in this subject which is why I had the time and motivation to do this, but I am also not an airline market analyst so I probably f'ed it all away.) These routes ranged from 2,500 miles to 7,500 miles and more than half had significant overland portions. I assumed a 100 passenger size SST, that it could capture roughly 2/3rds of the business/first class seats (i.e. if there were 500 daily first class/business seats on a route I guessed that would be capacity enough for 3 100 pax SSTs. This was a larger portion than the author seems to think could be feasibly captured, and would depend on engineering and technological advances making a modern or future SST significantly more cost efficient than Concorde to operate) and that on each route less than 5,000 miles an SST could fly a round trip per day vice a one way trip per day (roughly Mach=1.7 was assumed for engineering reasons). Based on this data I calculated a market of about 130, 100 pax SSTs. Certainly not a huge market to chase after, but using the author's assumption of only over water routes the result came out about three dozen, in line with but slightly higher than the author's claims in this book. So given perhaps a couple decades or more of growth in traffic there could be a potential of maybe 200 - 300 100 pax SSTs that are \\"overland supersonic quiet\\" as a very rough guess.- Thus, provided a small, 100 pax, long-range, overland queit SST could be developed and that it was affordable for first class and upper end business class passengers to buy tickets on it could be marketed to carriers as a way for airlines to siphon off their first and business class passengers to one type of aircraft, and increase their fleet's overall seat capacity by allowing them to refurbish their legacy 747s, 777s, A380s, A350s, etc. to single class economy seating. This would also reduce the number of subsonic jets they would need to purchase to expand (and which may be why a new entrant to the aircraft manufacturing market would have to produce an SST.) Certain large jets (i.e. 777) can literally increase in more than 100 seats going from a 2 or 3 class configuration to a 1 class configuration. The A380 can literally carry 200 more passengers going to a single class configuration.- From an engineering perspective the only way to get to the above type of SST would be through the successful introduction of a supersonic business jet first, and concurrent development of military projects such as QSP (Queit Supersonic Platform) for applications such as quiet supersonic cruise bombers in order to refine sonic boom minimizing technologies and develop engines with sufficient specific fuel consumption.- Anyway, just a hypothetical of how some SSTs could eventually fly again. Overall though, I feel the author is correct that the market for an SST will always be much smaller than that for subsonic aircraft. However based on some of his assumptions being invalidated in recent times, I don't share his belief that they will never fly. It may literally be two decades or more for a sufficient market and technology to emerge though, if ever, admittedly."},{"Title":"Never Sniff a Gift Fish","review":"NEVER SNIFF A GIFT FISHBy: Patrick F.

His stories of life growing up in rural America are extremely entertaining: I've seen an entire room of men rolling on the floor... literally! Boys and grown-up boys of all ages enjoy his dry humor, his creative descriptions of the trouble he gets into, and the way he communicates effectively the joys and pains of growing up.We have close to 10 of Pat's books now, and all of them provide evenings of rollicking fun and excitement. This one is no exception. Call up the guys, find somebody who's a good reader, and enjoy the hilarity! Sometimes it's just as fun to watch the people listening as they fall off of furniture and gasp for breath between guffaws... but soon you'll be doing the same, so keep listening!Note: your wife, girlfriend or other women in your life will look at you as if you've gone crazy when you read this book. For reasons I don't quite comprehend, most women don't seem to appreciate the humor, but that's OK. It's a man's book, written for men, and if they don't find it hilarious it's just proof that we're different, right? Let them read their mushy love stories; us men will stick to tales of the American wilderness, written by our all-American outdoor hero.

The usual pattern was some misfortune caused a young lad to have to leave home and join the forces where, after giving an educational spectator view of great men and great events and surviving many escapades he returned made good.This book follows that basic outline, but, unlike Henty would not make a Sunday School prize. Jack Absolute is a teenage scholar at Westminster School whose extra mural activities are drinking, gambling and wenching. He falls foul of the noble patron of his mistress and has to join the army in North America, where the war with French and their native allies is at a low ebb, to escape the consequences.There he is present at the Siege of Quebec with General Wolfe. Later he is captured by Red Indians and survives the famous St Francis raid by the American Rangers only to have to spend a harsh winter in a cave with only a Mohawk warrior, a dead bear and a copy of Hamlet for company.The story is told with great verve and humour and the narrative powers along. Despite the somewhat grim subject matter it is a fun read. A great breadth of subjects is covered, but nothing is skimped - the author is to be commended for his research. That I am eager to start on the sequel \\"Jack Abolute\\" must say something.In summation daring escapades, interesting historical and geographical background, wicked villains and just enough humour. BUT not for the innocent..."},{"Title":"Blooding of Jack Absolute","review":"As has been said before, this is the \\"prequel\\" to the Captain Jack Absolute series by Canadian author C. C. Humphreys. The story takes place between 1752 and 1760. At the beginning of the novel we discover that young Jack grows up illiterate, unhappy, and abused by his uncle Duncan \\"Druncan\\" Absolute and his bullying cousin Craster in Cornwall, England. Through spunk and chance, young Jack escapes his tormentors, is reunited with his real parents (Sir James \\"Mad Jamie\\" and Lady Absolute) who send him to be educated as a gentleman at Westminster School. In London, he learns more than just the declension of Latin nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Jack becomes a first rate cricketer, billiards player, punch drinker, and womanizer. The latter causes him to run for his life from a jealous Lord Melbury and into the arms of the British Army. I won't spoil the action and fun that follows, but will say that readers of this excellent series find out how Jack meets his Mohawk friend Ate, becomes a spy, and survives many harrowing experiences in the New World, including the Battle between the French under the Marquis de Montcalm and the British commanded by General Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham (Quebec, Canada 1759). This is a terrific book full of adventure and derring-do. A real page turner.I would have given this book 5 stars except for a few irritating historical inaccuracies, e.g., the British soldiers facing the French in battle were not referred to as \\"the thin red line\\" (p. 283) until almost one hundred years later during the Crimean War at the Battle of Balaclava in 1854. Nitpicking, I know, but attention to small details such as the above makes for a better book, I think."},{"Title":"Blooding of Jack Absolute","review":"Excellent book! Even Better than the sequel \\"Jack Absolute\\", which is great too. Very powerful characters and exciting story line which begins with Jack as a school boy and leads on to his role in the British siege of Quebec. It has a good balance of historical fact and thrilling fiction with war, rivalry and romance you will find it hard to put down."},{"Title":"Blooding of Jack Absolute","review":"With his parents away most of the time, as his mother the actress accompanies his father the soldier on his campaigns, his Uncle Duncan raises Jack Absolute. In an odd way Uncle Duncan cares for the boy especially when he is sober, but he spends much of his waking hours drunk. So Duncan's son abusive Craster plans to watch over the lad with an iron fist.When Duncan suddenly dies, Jack joins his parents in London. However, Jack gets into deep trouble when Lord Melbury catches him sleeping with the aristocrat's mistress. Taking this as a worse insult than if the youngster slept with his wife, Melbury demands satisfaction with Jack's father. Melbury dies in the duel, but Jack knows he must leave town to avoid vengeance or recrimination. Thus he enlists joining General Burgoyne's Light Dragoons deploying to the New World in the war with the French. After the Battle of Quebec, Jack's escapades turn nastier as Indians allied to the French abduct him and leave him to die in the wintry wilderness. Jack struggles to survive with his goal to return to England.Jack is at his swaggering best in this terrific prequel (see JACK ABSOLUTE). His escapades on both sides of the Anglo pond are entertaining as he blusters his way in and out of trouble like a youthful Errol Flynn. Historical thriller readers will appreciate his blooding entry into the world if action and adventure.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Blooding of Jack Absolute","review":"I started this one but never had the chance to finish. And now, I have as with the rest of my books."},{"Title":"Blooding of Jack Absolute","review":"The Blooding of Jack Absolute is the middle book of the trilogy and an exciting prequel to book one, that introduces the reader to Jack Absolute's origins, and to how he became Britain's top-most spy during the American Revolutionary War. The first installment simply titled Jack Absolute, introduced the two main characters of this fabulous series, Jack himself, and his partner in crime Ate, a Canadian Mohawk Indian. That introductory story was an exciting adventure tale as they both served under General John Burgoyne spying in the wilderness outside Albany New York, rooting out espionage involving the Illuminati and the Freemasons.This prequel of book two, takes us back to Jack's early days as a young teenager in England. Jack is forever the ladies man who continually finds himself upon a fogged shrouded heath at dawn, with a sword in his hand dueling to defend his honor after a night of female dalliance. Always in trouble in school, with the ladies, or with his tyrannical father, Jack eventually is forced to flee London by the skin of his teeth, his father rescuing his endangered backside from death by enrolling him in the army under General Burgoyne.Landing in Quebec after a long sea voyage, Jack grows up quick and is tutored on board by seasoned army mates and the mentorship of the general. Once landed, military skirmishes ensue and Jack finds himself fighting for his life as well as for King and Country. Mastering languages, ciphering and cryptography, fencing and engaging in the art of espionage, Jack soon becomes England's prime spy. After one long and blood-bathed battle, Jack is left alone in the Canadian wilderness, thought dead by his fellow soldiers. He is soon found by a local Indian tribe and learns he is to live there as a slave. Together with another lone captive Indian of the Mohawk tribe, the two unlikely men bind a friendship forever. Jack and Ate escape and the rest of the story is their grueling survival during a harsh Canadian winter, scraping and scratching, hunting and bleeding to survive in the wilderness alone. During their long incarceration hiding in a cave with barely enough food to survive, Jack teaches Ate how to read, and humorous scenes abound as Ate acts out Shakespearean plays and falls in love with books and the written word. This aspect follows along in the first book where we find Ate reading James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans to Jack as cannon fire explodes around them in the New England countryside.Their eventual emergence from their hellish winter experience finally leads them towards enemies, friends, action scenes, endearing human emotions, ladies in waiting, family feuds, military battles, duels of honor and both men's lives within a very short time turn from coming-of-age to hardened soldiers always ready for the next adventure. A well rounded series filled with all the ingredients a reader would enjoy."},{"Title":"Blooding of Jack Absolute","review":"A highly entertaining historical adventure, with elements of Henry Fielding (Tom Jones) and Kenneth Roberts (Northwest Passage, etc.) I liked it even better than Jack Absolute, the author's previously written sequel laid during the American Revolution. The first half of Blooding, involving Jack's bawdy antics in Georgian London, is especially enjoyable, and the second half, laid in Canada during the French and Indian War is dramatic and instructive. The book points out that James Wolfe's famous victory at Quebec did not, contrary to the popular perception, mark the end of the war, in fact the book's climax comes with the second battle of the Plains of Abraham the following year. Enough loose ends remain at the end of the book to lure the reader into buying the next installment, which I intend to do."},{"Title":"Blooding of Jack Absolute","review":"The telling of the wild life of young Jack Absolute is action-packed from beginning, where the 9 year old is tied up in his drunken uncle's cellar in Cornwall, about to be thrashed by his bully of a cousin against the background of the riots caused by the change to the Gregorian calendar in 1752. An escape, a death, a charge of murder, going into hiding, more beatings and the sudden appearance of Jack's long-absent parents quickly ensues.Then a scene change to London-town and Jack's school days at Westminster, which includes an important cricket match, carousing at taverns, visiting prostitutes, a wager for a hundred pounds on a game of billiards, a powerful lord ---and enemy-- mistreating their mistress and threatening death, a rape, young love, composing poetry, disruptive theater crowds, secret meetings at Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens wearing masks and duels to the death. And that's just the first part of the book.Then there's the Battle of Quebec and capture by Indians. It's boys' adventure to the max (although lots of fun for the modern girl, of course!). I'd read JACK ABSOLUTE a while ago, and enjoyed it, but this was even more fun. No super-spy plots needed. This young Jack was fascinating all on his own, with his quickness and temerity, his basic good intentions but wild and reckless youth, set in an exciting and tumultuous time and place. Even as an abused, unlettered child, there was a resiliency and energy that grounds all the adventures and makes it believable that Jack will naturally have an exciting life. The historical detail also adds dimension, as does the right touch of introspection and emotion.I am absolutely hooked on this series!"},{"Title":"Blooding of Jack Absolute","review":"A prequel to Humphrey's Jack Absolute, this is a bildungsroman set during the Seven Years War.

The book could be useful as a way of looking up something you want to say (if you can find it) and pointing to the chinese writing, but that's about all.Cantonese pronunciation is very complicated, and this book isn't very helpful in explaining it. The section that tries to give a broad introduction to the language is terrible. For example, early on it gives a list of 8 &quot;useful verbs&quot; which is missing staples like &quot;to want&quot; and &quot;to have&quot;, and in fact only has about 3 that are even remotely useful. One of the listed verbs is &quot;to trick&quot; -- a word that every traveller struggling with a language wishes they could remember.The majority of this book is organized by topic. Within each topic, it goes into too much depth to be able to find anything quickly, but being a small book it is not comprehensive at all. The dictionary section in the back is tiny and not very useful either.My copy ended up in a trash can in Hong Kong a few days after I bought it."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Cantonese Phrasebook (Lonely Planet Language Survival Kit)","review":"This phrase book has authentic cantonese characters. Cantonese is an oral language and they use a few special characters aside from the &quot;chinese&quot; characters. I have seen another phrase book which uses all &quot;chinese&quot; characters. If you literally read it in cantonese, the pronunciations are all wrong, but the meaning is the same. It is frustrating if you know a little cantonese, and want to know the cantonese characters. This book is good because of the cantonese characters and the correct pronunciations that go along with them. If you have no background in a language and want to learn never choose a phrase book. Go buy a textbook."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Cantonese Phrasebook (Lonely Planet Language Survival Kit)","review":"First of all, I have to give credit to anyone who writes a book explaining the pronunciation of cantonese.

This isn't good for learning as such, but it is a useful tool if you know some cantonese already to reinforce what you know for general converstaion and also if you are stuck in Hong Kong with the characters being alongside the romanization for easy pointing to the locals if you are having trouble with the tones."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Cantonese Phrasebook (Lonely Planet Language Survival Kit)","review":"Mostly all the translated words are on the mark and in nice neat cantonese.

Much better than the yale style because the cantonese part is broken into syllables and you don't have scratch your head too much about where the stress/intonation points go. Hamburger is \\"hon bo baau\\", museum \\"bok mat gwoon\\" It does take a small degree of guess work and a decent speaking knowledge of cantonese get it 100% right, but that's life. Also provides sample sentences for everyday actvities. Would be useful for learning colloquail terms and traveling. Of course if you're in Hong Kong you could just speak english...

It's is just because I know some Cantonese vocabulary that I can use it. For the words that I don't know I have a hard time of figuring out how it is supposed to be pronounced. I'll have to ask a relative or friend who is fluent in the language for the correct pronunciations. Cantonese is a very difficult language and a phrase book without any audio input is impossible.

I haven't had a chance to read the entire thing, only having skimmed so far as I am very busy but it is a very concise look into the psychology and economics of the times, and the author also explains to the businessmen why they should be wary of doing business with Hitler as he was a true national socialist, in that he wouldn't actually pay them or allow them to take their goods out of the country. I guess Hitler was buying a lot of stuff on credit as the entire world was in a depression and people were desparate to trade. He was not paying his bills and likely invaded some creditors.It's really interesting to read intellectual arguments from the past. I found this book in my bookshelf as my great-grandfather had purchased it. The writing is phenomenal and very clear. It is always interesting to see what our intellectual foundation is as everything else builds on it and just becomes more complicated.

I learned of hiking trails I didn't know existed and the Gorge seems to have plenty of them. Each hike is listed with a general description, the distance of the trail, how much traffic of people to expect there, the best season to go, the elevation gain and maximum elevation. A map is shown and directions to the hike are given along with detailed description of the hike. Many black and white photographs show views from the various hikes. My one disappointment with this book is that the Deschutes River trail that is branched off directly from the Columbia River Gorge is not mentioned in this book, because it is east of The Dalles; this book only mentions the trails from Portland to The Dalles."},{"Title":"Hiking the Columbia River Gorge","review":"There are few places on earth as majestic as the Columbia River Gorge, and fewer still with its wide variety of climate zones. At the west end one finds temperate mid-latitude forests of ancient fir, while at the east end high desert with scrub oak predominate. There are few places in the world where the weather varies as dramatically over such a short distance.It's not just beautiful; it's also one of the great places in the Northwest for hiking and recreation. Kayaking, wind surfing, and fishing are among the recreational activities afforded by the gorge. And hiking; lots and lots of hiking.Schneider's book describes all the well-traveled trails in the gorge, and many of the less-traveled ones as well. He describes the trails on the Oregon side of the river first, where most of the waterfalls are found. In his descriptions he moves from sites near the west end of the gorge to those nearer the east end. Then he takes us across the gorge to the Washington side, following the reverse direction from east to west.Schneider describes the trails by name, and gives numerical descriptions as well as directions to the trail heads and points of interest along the way. He also provides a rough estimate of the difficulty, along with altitude and distance. I've hiked about half the trails he describes, and generally find his descriptions to be accurate, though there are a few instances in which he over estimates the trail's difficulty.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to become more intimate with this rugged and majestic landscape. It's useful for both the beginner and more advanced hiker. There are lots of similar books on the market, but I think Russ's is one of the best."},{"Title":"Hiking the Columbia River Gorge","review":"My, then girlfriend now wife, and I spent 2 days in the Columbia Gorge this was one of two books that we had on the area and this was the one that we used the most.

It was revised in 1952, in an edition from the Oxford publisher, Blackwell and reprinted by the University of Notre Dame Press (Indiana) in 1964, with a new Preface and some bibliographic updating; which is the date given by Amazon. The title is a little misleading, as I shall explain below.Through the late 1990s, at least, it was being cited at *the* standard work in English; departures from its positions had to be justified, agreements did not. But, with new editions of texts, and new ways of reading them, it is getting old.I first read it in the 1970s, and was glad to find a paperback copy (of the 1978 third Notre Dame printing) some years later. I have been waiting for an equally comprehensive successor to appear, in English. In the meantime, I have found that it remains amazingly useful, amidst an abundance of much more advanced, much more technical, and much more specialized, studies. An example would be Ann W. Astell's \\"The Song of Songs in the Middle Ages,\\" a fine work of criticism which I would have found baffling on the most superficial level without having read Smalley's book, and recognized the contexts of commentators she analyzes.The late Norman Cantor expressed high approval of Beryl Smalley's book in \\"Inventing the Middle Ages,\\" and lamented the neglect of its author by British academic circles, which he attributed to sexism. (He was probably right; but I have no independent source on her life.) He also suggested that the organization of \\"The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages\\" leaves much to be desired. I understand what he means, but I am not sure that I could suggest a better one.The fact is, Beryl Smalley (1905-1984) chose to cover a huge amount of territory, which could be mapped in many ways; and she seems to have tried out more than one. \\"The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages\\" was, by her original intent, restricted to Latin Christian writers interpreting what they called the \\"Old Testament\\" -- \\"New Testament\\" studies were considered \\"Theology,\\" and those who had any sense of self-preservation stayed away from unapproved speculation. Explaining the words of Ezekiel in ever-finer detail, or debating the exact length of the reign of a king of Judah was one thing. Touching on specifically Catholic doctrines, seen as arising from a Gospel or Epistle, was another.Smalley in fact wrote on medieval Gospel interpretations, as well as medieval political thought; areas in which she found herself describing views that came to be deemed heretical. Some of these writings do not seem to have been collected until the 1980s.But she found that this limitation to the Latin Old Testament was, perhaps unexpectedly, too restrictive, and gave a false sense of a closed system of ideas. It may have seemed a safe assumption that St. Jerome was the last important direct contact with Jewish Biblical scholarship until the Renaissance. (Aquinas reading Maimonides on how to reconcile Aristotle and Scripture was a somewhat different matter.) In the course of her work, she came to agree that there was, in fact, a distinct and significant influence from medieval Jewish commentators on Christian writers at certain periods. She had to extend her coverage; but, of course, medieval Hebrew had not been part of her education, so skipping the whole problem must have been a temptation.Instead, she got considerable help from a Hebraist who had been looking into the relation of European Jewish commentators, from Rashi to Kimhi, to their Christian environment. But she still had to spend a disproportionate amount of space explaining basic facts about them to other medievalists, whereas \\"the Benedictine Reform\\" could pretty much take care of itself. (And if you don't recognize the commentators, but at least know the name of the Benedictines, you are in the same position as many of her original readers.) Since her associate was also a congregational Rabbi, she lost his direct assistance by the time of the revised edition; he assumed a new position out of the country. (And the whole picture of Jewish commentators has since been altered by later scholarship; although I don't think that this would make much difference at the level of detail she provided.)But it was a valiant effort. And it was typical of her industry and enthusiasm. And also of the resulting sprawling, and seemingly disproportioned, nature of her account. In the end, the book seemed to me much too short; much of it already needed to be replaced, but I could think of nothing that should have been cut.The issues she raises concern not only religion, but the entire nature of literacy and interpretation of the written world in medieval society. I would strongly urge anyone seriously interested in medieval European intellectual culture to try it; and not only those with a special interest in religion or biblical studies.Although it was not Beryl Smalley's only book, it is the only one in print; and for the moment apparently only in the U.S. Amazon UK offers it among a wider selection of Smalley titles, all unavailable except used. That list includes \\"The Bible in the Mediaeval World: Essays in Memory of Beryl Smalley (Studies in Church History)\\" (1985).[Addendum, 2012; This review was written in 2005; Amazon (US) now provides an extensive list of Smalley's publications, many of which are in print, or are/were otherwise available.]"},{"Title":"Cradle & Crucible: History and Faith in the Middle East","review":"This was a good book for anyone interested in the history of the Middle East. The book is basically split into two parts: the first part is history of the middle east and the second part focuses on the major religions of the area.The earlier chapters move a little fast for my taste, shoving thousands of years worth of history into one or two chapters, but the book slows down to a more reasonable pace as the times in discussion become more recent. As a whole the book was an excellent read, and touched on everything from the beginnings of agriculture to the Roman empire, to the Ottomans, to the World Wars, to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. It is good as a touch-and-go overview of the history, where the reader can discover what eras he/she is interested in and then find other materials that pertain to those eras. I found it extremely insightful in terms of explaining why there is so much unrest in the area...for example, how the nations were formed and what events lead to more recent events (I guess you could say a chain of events) that lead to the way things are now. I highly recommend it. It really puts everything in perspective.The area focused on the religions of the area was not as good as the history part in my opinion, but was still very informative. However the authors weren't very consistent in the foci of their essays. The Christian and Muslim sections were focused more on the history of their religions, how they came to be and more-or-less where they are now. The Jewish section was more focused on the Jewish people and what it means to be \\"Jewish.\\" Not having much experience with the history of Islam, I found that section very informative and well written.If you are interested in the history of the middle east as a whole, get this book! I don't think you can find a more broad, compact, and easy to read presentation of it's history and people."},{"Title":"Cradle & Crucible: History and Faith in the Middle East","review":"Excellent book! It is an insightful look at the history and culture of Near East.If you are not familiar with the history of Near East and interested in understanding it, this book is a perfect place to start. Even if you are familiar, you can still find valuable knowledge, distilled insight here.The first human outposts, the birth of religions, the story of Arabs, the rise and fall of Ottoman Empire... All these and more are covered inside. It is a concise, easy read covering all the important stories of Near East.Each chapter is written by a separate writer, yet it reads fluently. The photographs alone are worth the price of its admission; they are specially chosen marvelous pieces from the archives of museums, collections and National Geographic magazine. Printing the book on a high-quality paper was a good choice.This book succeeds in giving an understanding of why this volatile region \\"has shown a capacity like no other to affect the destiny of World\\"."},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"I would read this book before my test along with my other required material, helped me get a different view of disorders and systems. The questions were quite helpful also."},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"wow! this book is really a miracle book because it helped me pass medsurg class in nursing school, and I just passed my EC medsurg exam as well.

I am definitely a big fan of reviews and rationales!"},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"I would recommend this book to NU102 students for the review of the \\"essential\\". I found it very helpful when I was studying endocrinoly.I felt more confident before my exams after reviewing the chapters and the questions relating to the exam.

It's only 25.00 (plus change) and it is worth it.. Trust me!"},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"I am convinced that this book was one of the two most influential texts that carried me through my last two semesters of nursing school. I only wish I'd discovered the convenience and proper preparation that NCLEX review books offer even earlier in my nursing school years.This book is particularly helpful in teaching you concepts that may not have been grasped in lectures and formal textbooks - the rationales are sensibly concise and thorough at the same time. The numerous multiple choice questions are excellent and the answers are provided at the end of each section. This book is not only beneficial for the classroom and exam settings, but fabulous for NCLEX preparation, too. The CD is also well worth it. I recommend the HESI review book for a quick, last minute review, but this book is number one!"},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"This book is so helpful and makes it easier to understand what to look for and how to assess a patients for certain S/S."},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT!!

Any book of this series is highly recommended to the nursing student."},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"I bought this book because my teacher assigned too much reading (100s of pages) from the textbooks and I just couldnt read that much. This book is concise yet gets the information you need for your nursing school tests and the NCLEX across. The questions are great though I wish there were more and I like that the questions have explanations with them. I used this for my last test and after having gotten bad grades on the two previous tests this raised my percentage on the next test by almost 15%. By combining this book with my notes and the outline the teacher gave us it really helped me. I will definitely buy more of their books in the future if the need arises."},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"I used this book a good bit along with my textbook.

This book gives you the important information without all the extra wording. This book carried me through my course, especially reviewing for exams. Prior to reading any other chapters, I would recommend that chapter 17 should be reviewed first (common problems encountered in emergency and critical care nursing) as there is a lot of info in this chapter that will help you in preparing for cardiac and respiratory systems, info that is not mentioned in these two chapters. This book is a must have, you will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"I got this book as an adjunct to my Saunders NCLEX and the workbooks and clinical guides for my texts during my last semester of nursing school. The rationales for the answers are vague and hard to follow, particularly with more difficult content. It doesn't include multiple patient scenarios, and the questions include a fairly clear \\"correct\\" answer. If you want to be a good clinician AND pass your NCLEX/school exams, this won't help. Get a good prioritization and delegation book instead, along with the Saunders and a Kaplan book."},{"Title":"Medical-Surgical Nursing: Reviews and Rationales (Prentice Hall Nursing Reviews & Rationales Series)","review":"I bought this book to help me and my study group prepare for our 1st semester of med-surg (NPII).
