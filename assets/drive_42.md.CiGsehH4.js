I'm not that mad though it did have a lot of good part for example when jo-jo, and Tiara and her girls whip home girl ***. Or when she met her mom and didn't even know it was her, or when her aunt Charlie whip her mom ***.But most of all it still dosen't compare to &quot;I'm Telling&quot; Ms. Miller please make another book of that caliber. PLEASE!"},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"With her third book firmly under her belt, readers will learn that Karen Quinones Miller is absolutely here to stay! In \\"Using What You Got,\\" Ms. Miller uses a much gritter style of writing than previously seen in her first two books. But the language and situations ring crystal clear and utterly true for who and where her characters are: where they live, how they live, and where they come from.In this book, we meet the overindulged, self-absorbed Tiara. Girlfriend is smooth as silk and fine as wine. A legion in her own mind. Just when you think this chick doesn't have one redeeming quality, we find that she is nothing short of a brainiac and sporatic bouts of random acts of kindness that has nothing to do with how it is going to benefit her. Like everything else in her life, learning comes as easilty to Tiara as the latest pair of designer jeans or whatever she can conjole out of her father. Men have also been easy for Tiara to acquire, whether she wanted them or not. That is, until she meets the one that doesn't seem to be that impressed with what she has to offer. Should she be satisfied with the man with the money, the car, the clothes and the style to give her the lifestyle she wants or will she throw it all away to get the one that got away? Also, while it seems that Tiara and her younger sister, Jo-Jo, who loves sports almost as much as irritating Tiara, have nothing in common, we learn that when push comes to shove, Tiara is more than ready to throw down to defend and protect her baby sister.Next, we also meet the handsome and very responsible Reggie, Jo-Jo and Tiara's father who has raised them almost entirely by himself when their mother runs off shortly after Jo-Jo's birth. Reggie is the kind of man any woman would love to get her hands on. He's an ex-boxer who is still fine and sexy as all get out. He is assisted by his seemingly forever cranky sister, Charlene, whom everyone calls Charlie. Charlie has her own substory and probably could carry her own book. There is a lot of unspoken, undealt with pain over an accident from when she was a teenager that forever changes how Charlie sees herself, and has clouded how she lives her life. However, through her own changes and disappointments in life, Charlie is right there to help Reggie with raising his beloved daughters.Using What You Got is about what it means to be a sibling, a family, a friend and a lover. Its about learning to love your family, even when you don't always necessarily like them, finding out who your true friends are as well as learning to be a friend, and everything that glitters is not gold. Quinones Miller covers all the bases with this one, and she covers them well!"},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"This book deserves all the stars. It grabs you and doesn't let you go. Each character is so unique. In reading this book I thought I was going to smack Tiara right off the pages, but the books tells a story that you can both relate to and learn from. Tiara was definitely using what you had to get what she wanted, but is she wanted worth it???? To answer that question, pick up the book. You won't be disappoint!! And old saying is everything that glitters ain't gold. And everything that looks good to you ain't good for you. Just ask Tiara Bynum!! Karen Miller keep doing your thing. I look forward to more from you."},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"Tiara is a self-centered brat who thinks that the world revolves around her. A New York inner city housing project serves as the background for this less than pleasing story that focuses on Tiara, the ultimate BAP. Tiara's sister, Jo-Jo, father, Reggie and Aunt Charley also play intergral roles in Tiara's life as she muddles her way through, making the absolute wrong choices, which ultimately come back to bite her in the behind. This offering is certainly better than the last Quinones-Miller book that I read, I'm Telling; however, there's nothing here that is worthy of recommending to others. 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"I read this book and I was disappointed. It focused on a girl who is very superficial and only seems to care about herself. I think in the end she really did not deserve to be happy. She still had the same attitude toward everything and the only reason she did not accept the money is because she did not want Rashad and her father to figure out she hasn't changed.I thought the novel &quot;I'm Telling&quot; by Ms Karen Quinones Miller was much better."},{"Title":"using what you got","review":"I really enjoyed this fastpaced read. This is my second book by this author. She has a way of weaving a tale that makes you think you are watching a movie. Tiara was a trip with her &quot;yeah I got it like that&quot;. The only thing that was wrong with Tiara was that she was spoiled. I read another review where the reviewer states that if Tiara was all that why was she in the projects still. Hello duhh her father was working very hard I might add to get them out of their situation and also living in the projects does not mean that you have to have low self esteem. Because before I grew up and bought my own house I realized it wasn't where I lived but how I choose to carry myself. I still have friends that are single moms living in the pj's that are doing the Dayuum thing. Anyway........I am anticipating Ida B.

The Vancouver downtown map showed me the nearest hotel to her address and the prices quoted for hotels were a good guide. She has been in Canada for eight months, but did not know of a restaurant (Roosters Quarters) recommended in Denman Street which is 10 minutes walk away.

Lots of history, which is always great, besides the usual road info. Take it, 'cause without it, you'll soon be on that unique BC mountain highway feature, the Runaway Lane!"},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"As an avid fan of the Hideaway Series, I often had questions as to why Samuel Cole was a little left of center with the love of his family. My questions were definitively answered in BEST KEPT SECRET, the prequel to the series.The lives of Samuel Cole and Marguerite Josefina(MJ) Diaz, the patriarch and matriarch of the Cole-Diaz dynasty, unfold in dramatic fashion. Samuel is driven by the desire to prove his father wrong, and that grit and determination is what drives the story. Failure was not an option because his father's legacy was always on the periphery like an electric prodder. Samuel's destiny started after he returned from the war with black market items, which he used to finance his dream. He journeys to Cuba to set the wheels for his dream in motion. That dream is manifested when he meets his wife, Marguerite and an astute business partner, Everett Kirkland. Samuel's partnership with both parties become his spring board and almost his demise. MJ has dreams of her own and Samuel is her ticket to achieve those dreams. Her plan start out on firm ground but, Samuel's actions compel her to face some cruel truths that could sabotage her journey. Samuel helps Everett restart his life but, later the relationship of the two men take an unprecedented turn. All parties returned to Florida and their lives took wings. Samuel's dynasty was on a firm foundation until he, being the selfish, driven man that he was, committed a grave faux pas, he had a liaison with his secretary. The results of that involvement creates a secret that changes the course of five lives and left readers drained.I loved this story! Ms. Alers did a wonderful job with the plot and back-story, it was amorous, heartbreaking, pulsating, and redeeming. She added great substance and also supplied enough infidelity, unorthodox cover-ups, and double standards to fill four-hundred plus pages. I can honestly say this is the first Romance I've read where at the story's end, I could not embrace the hero and I was undecided about the heroine. I especially recommend this book, for Hideaway fans. For me it is the most dramatic story in the Series, Ms Alers, this one took me there!Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ(tm) Reviewers"},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"\\"Best Kept Secrets\\" by Rochelle Alers is the story of the begining of the Cole-Diaz empire. A love story between a self made millioniare and a women born of cuban royalty. Reading \\"Best Kept Secrets\\" will help you understand the relationship of Samuel and M.J. The loyalty and love a women has for a man. The love and devotion a man has for a women his wife. You will be cheering M.J. on has she claims her womanhood and her husband. You will have a hate love relationship for Samuel as he builds the empire for his family. This is a wonderful history lesson and a page turner."},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"This prequel explains a lot more of the characters of Samuel, MJ and Teresa and even why Joshua Kirkland was so bitter. It is well written and the historical detail are very informative. However as some have noticed the timeline used here (1924-1947) makes the timeline of Hideaway, Hidden Agenda and Vows about 30 years before their time with the technological details mentioned in those books. (Based on this book Hideaway to Renegade is set from 1956-2008 thereabouts). Perhaps this is because these were written first and the author did not know she would go back in time to tell the 'first' story. Apart from that its a briliiant story and shows that Teresa was not as innocent as she appears to be but was very manipulative I felt sorry for Everett and MJ."},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"I hardly ever complete reviews but I'm a huge fan of Ms. Alers and truly enjoyed this prequal to the Hideaway series. I've actually now started re-reading the books in order. It has taken me this long to finally obtain the whole series. My only question regarding Best Kept Secrets is the time frame. Why is there such a large gap (almost 50yrs) between this book and the first Hideaway book characters. I just did not understand how children were born in the 1940's and then the first book of the series picks up in 1998. I did email the author this question but as of yet received an response."},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"I'd read the other Alers books and had questioned the story behind the great Cole-Diaz Empire. Reading this explained everything. Great writing and plot. Love the work."},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"Rochelle Alers' writing style makes it easy to allow in-depth characterization to define how it suppose to mesh with great storylines...and in the case with her latest novel, Best Kept Secrets nothing changes. The novel moves moderately along with each character giving homage to the drama that fuels the story. With every Alers book, readers have become accustomed to great pacing and retrospective translation. The aforementioned is indicative of going back to give readers something they may have missed relative to what is being written now.This, the prequel to The HIDEAWAY Series, is warranted and does a good job of introducing the clan to first time readers. The story of how Samuel Cole and Marguerite Josefina Diaz, the patriarch and matriarch of the Cole-Diaz dynasty materialized couldn't be overstated. The story unfolds without delay giving insight to the Cuban ambiance of the 20's for setting and historic content. Nothing is lost with the gist of it centering amid the genesis of the Cole family's business empire, and the drama that unfolds because of it. The grit and determination of Samuel Cole is unmistakable and tends to give an edge to the story as relative implication always seem to give him center stage. Taciturn and determined to succeed, Samuel has the specter of his father's legacy always on the periphery to remind him why failure is out of the question. The power and ego that finds him sets the stage for a unique partnership with Everette Kirkland. Dynamic duo? Perhaps, but not amid the inner turmoil that allows intrigue to be a willing partner to mayhem.I simply loved this book! I recommend it as a MUST read if one is to understand how it all began for the Coles. I'm delighted that the author did a great job of showing the different countenances of these gentlemen to make the story most interesting. But the plot and back-story thickens as femme fatales are introduced in amorous ways to give the story substance. Enter MJ Diaz, infidelity, an untimely pregnancy, denials, backstabbing debauchery, and double standards for ulterior motive...well, you KNOW you have more than just a rudimentary story; you have a Rochelle Alers original! I recommend reading this book, and other Hideaway serial books. It's worth the price of admission to see if the sons are as roguish, arrogant, and philandering as their father. And, did MJ tame Samuel once she entered? I rate it a 5 out of 5 stars, further cementing my opinion that Ms Alers is among the best."},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"Not only were Marguerite Josefina Diaz-Cole and Samuel Cole keeping a secret from their families but their fans as well. I have always wanted to know the true story behind the romance of the Cole family's matriarch and patriarch. With Best Kept Secrets by Rochelle Alers, that story is revealed.Beginning in 1924 Havana, Cuba and spanning to 1947 in Florida, the romance, drama, demons, insecurities and faith of the characters are revealed. M. J. Diaz is not your typical Cuban girl; much to her father's consternation she would rather attend college, be photographed and live a carefree life than settle down with a hand-selected member of a another prominent Cuban. Enter Samuel Cole, a black man fresh from the war in Europe, trying his hand at entrepreneurship. Samuel travels to several Latin countries, because of the racial divide in America, to launch high-end business ventures. It is then he meets M. J., a beautiful, headstrong Cuban with motives and desires that she believes Samuel can deliver. She is definitely his match in determination. Not the only one with motives, Samuel sees opportunity in courting and marrying M. J., and thus the romance begins. What occurs are covert deals, marriage, children and deadly secrets, which once revealed may cause indisputable harm to all family members and friends.I found this story to be a treat for several reasons - the imagery was vibrant and at times tranquil; the Cuban culture of wealth were revealing and the characters developed to the point where they all danced to their own beat. The women showcased were not your typical subservient Latin women, which was refreshing and at times caused shock. Finally, with the release of this novel, the characters throughout the Hideaway series share a history, which was once a mystery. This is a satisfying beginning to an end of a series.Reviewed by Dawn R. ReevesAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"Rochelle Alers is awesome! I began this series four months ago. I have read every book relating to the Cole family but, Just Before Dawn. I can't put them down. It amazes me that Rochelle Alers takes special care when researching the information for the books.Best Kept Secrets puts everything together so well. We now understand Samuel's and MJ's background. We also understand who Teresa Maldanado was. I am totally fascinated by this Dynasty! Rochelle Alers description of the challenges faced by the African American business community and social elite was accurate.I also felt so many emotions when I completed this book. Martin is my hero in this book. He understands the true meaning of family. Joshua Kirkland is also a favorite of mine. I am so glad that he was able to bond with his family in later years. This is a must read!Rochelle Alers has done such a fabulous job making the characters in the Cole family come to life.

Not only was this story properly researched. The historical facts were on point, along with some interesting characters which made this book a page turner.In the process of trying to destroy M.J's marriage, Teresa Maldonado fell victim to her own scheme. I think M.J. did what most women would do in a similar situation. I love M.J. She was a very good wife and mother. Inspite of her upbringing, and comming from an upper clas family I think she was humble.I know some people might hate me for saying this. But Teresa got what she deserved. Although M.J. and Samuel came out on top, This woman had a negative affect on so many people including her own. Before Teresa came along, Everett and Samuel had a good business relationship. Everett was a lonely man. Working with Samuel was all he had to look forward to. His involvement with with Teresa brought all that to an end, which I think made him the ultimate victim in this maldonado scheme."},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"I read this book within two days and was completely mesmerized by the story and its characters.

Read Best Kept Secret to see how the Cole family came to and how it was necessary for Samuel to do what he had to do to keep his family together.Mrs. Alers pulled out all of her stops when she wrote Best Kept Secrets showing how love will make a man do anything to accommodate his love ones but how a little fall can become a major fall."},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"Rochelle this book was worth the wait.

She takes you through a wide range of emotions with each character. The vivid descriptions of the sights, sounds, and tobacco smell of 1920's Cuba put you right there. This story answers all of the many questions left unanswered in the other HideAway Series books.I commend Ms Alers on her in-depth insight into each characters personality and the way the events of the story help to develop and bring them to life. I really disliked Samuel Cole in the Hideaway books. In \\"Best Kept Secrets\\" all of the secrets are revealed and lay bare everyone's faults, and they all have them. I came to understand Sammy, but I don't think I have every disliked a character in a book more. Hats off to you Ms Alers for your ability to have your words conjure up such strong emotions towards a character.Yes, all of the characters are victims including Sammy. However, his decisions spiral everyone's misery, including his own. I felt disappointed in the way his relationship with Everett Kirkland turned out. I say relationship because I don't think that Samuel ever thought of anyone as, nor did he consider himself to be, a friend. In his desperation to find a solution to Teresa he went to Everett. As always Everett was there for him, and again Samuel's decisions spiraled more misery. By the end of the book I wanted Samuel to suffer some more.In \\"Best Kept Secrets\\" Ms. Alers takes you through a mass of emotions; determination, loyalty, love, lust, obsession, betrayal, disappointment, joy, anger, happiness and sadness, just to name a few.

Now, I've just started to re-read (HIDEAWAY) again and there is just no way that (Martin) was born in the 20's.Or, Joshua in the 40's I believe it was. I would just like to understand Ms. Alers thinking behind that. But other than that (BEST KEPT SECERTS) was the perfect beginning to a (STELLAR) series."},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"This book had me captivated and mezmerized from the first page to the last. The details and the progression of events were perfectly synchronated. This book answered every question that you wondered about from the original series, specifically the Joshua, Teresa, Samuel, Everett connection and what Samuel had to do to keep MJ from leaving him.I am simply amazed and in awe of Ms. Alers talent and can bearly comprehend that she wrote all of the other books first -- and then -- this one.I actually did not like the book that started the series (Martin and Parris - I did not like Parris from the beginning even before she was adducted), but Hidden Agenda (my favorite) and Vows (#2) pulled me into the Saga and from there, I read all of the books in the series. Then along came \\"Best Kept Secrets\\". The best of the best in my opinion.I am now compelled to read the entire series all over again - even \\"HideAway\\" -- and -- Ms. Alers is now in a tie with \\"Brenda Jackson\\" as my favorite author. I truly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Best Kept Secrets (Sepia)","review":"I usually don't write reviews, but I couldn't stay quiet about this book. Best Kept Secrets was great!!!

And I have to say I totally agree!! I have been dying to read this book, but was determined to go in order. This story was great!! I t shed light on a bunch of unanswered questions like, how Samuel and MJ came to be. How the relationship between Joshua and Samuel became the explosive mess that it was. Even though I liked Samuel at first, as the story went on he turned into a low down D-O-G!!!!! He cheated on a wife that was nothing but giving to him. She loved him, gave him, children, satisfied him sexually, and he still strayed. Not once or twice, but several times. And then to get that involved with Theresa Kirkland...a woman he spent a weekend with. So involved that he said he shared a part of himself with her that he never shared with anyone, including his wife. DOG!!!! And after reading the books leading up to this I felt so bad for Theresa. I was like he did her so wrong!! HUMPH!! Ms Teresa is far from innocent. she planned every step of her seduction, including getting pregnant. But, I did feel for her when it came to, Everett. He was a cruel and vicious man. If you can call him a man. She didn't deserve that kind of abuse. I can feel MJ's pain, I would not have went about it the way Samuel did, but he loved MJ more than he loved Teresa, and yes, he did love her(Teresa the trollip).......Again if you read Hideway....Martin and Parris' story, then you will understand why Samuel did not like Parris, I read it, and I am like oooooohhhhh, now I see!!!!!!!!! Samuel was guilty of loving two women, and there is a such thing as loving two people, he just loved one more than the other. Still, he was so wrong to bring that pain upon someone who had done nothing but be there for him. This was great. If you read this series, then this book is a must read.

The main character, Jonathan Ferrier, is anything but admirable and I quickly grew tired of his arrogant, rude personality. No wonder people were so quick to believe he was guilty of murder. Jonathan's attempted rape of 20-year-old Jenny in chapter 19 was the end of this book for me. When he returned home and confessed the attack to his mother, she \\"more than suspected that, and was delighted at the thought.\\" And later, \\"Once let a woman suspect she has charms that could drive a man to assault her, and she will love him then - if she had never before - for desiring her. Things were progressing very nicely, thought Marjorie (Jonathan's mother).\\" Really? Delighted that her son had just tried to rape a young woman? I can't believe a female author would write anything so stupid and anti-women. I refuse to read any farther. I suppose Jenny forgives him for the attack and they fall madly in love and live happily ever after - that's more than I can stomach.

My enthusiasm for the book began to wane about half-way through, when I came to understand that I was really reading a soap opera story. What I thought was the main stage of medical advance and courageous advocacy slipped into the background, obscured by a \\"the lost and frustrated loves of Jonathan\\" storyline. Also, Taylor Caldwell's treatment of the conspiracy theory elements, tied to the character of Senator Campion, seems a kind of thrown in device that is never really resolved. There are not many characters here that are really admirable, and the ending seems like a very incoherent nod to the classic \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\" denouement.Having said all that, Taylor Caldwell is a vivid writer, and her descriptions of environments and people are enjoyable and powerful. She offers up great insights into the human condition and its vulnerabilities and hypocrisies."},{"Title":"Testimony of Two Men","review":"Saw this as a mini series on Tv probably in the mid 70's and have been waiting since then for it to be released as a DVD series.

I have been in love with him ever since. My sister read it months afterwards and it inspired her to become a doctor. I have given it as a gift to many friends over the years and nearly always receive the same response; why have we never heard of this author before? I agree. Taylor Caldwell has a gift for minute detail. She can reveal more in one paragraph than many modern writers can in an entire novel. Her characters, major and minor, are full and robust -- all with a sliding scale of strengths and flaws that never fully balances. This story of a misunderstood, flawed man's journey to love, and ultimately a better understanding of himself and those around him, was crafted by a master writer. I can only hope that there will be a resurgence of interest in the new effort to republish this work again in paperback and hardcover.

But they could never forgive the truths he told about them. From this compelling story of a doctor at war with the world he has been taught to heal, Taylor Caldwell has fashioned a novel of an unforgettable, angry idealist -- a novel in which the drama of new medical frontiers becomes part of a sweeping chronicle of love, death, desire, and redemption.I was introduced to the wonderful writing of Taylor Caldwell while still in high school. From this book, I went on to read many more of her books. The sign of a really well-written story is when you can recall it from memory many years' later. I can so do with many of Calwell's book, and none more than this one.The book is filled with wonderful characters. Jonathan Ferrier fighting to modernize medical practices in his town and fought, and even vilified, by the old guard. The story contains the conflict of brothers, betrayal, and love.This is a story in which one becomes completely immersed and is superbly told, start to end.

Ferrier's quest for perfection in medicine and in all areas of his life eventually lead him down the road of scandal and heartbreak.

I was enthralled. Soon after, I bought the paperback featuring the 3 principal actors on the cover and read it in record time. I have read it several times over the years, most recently last week. Even though it's been 35 years since I viewed the miniseries, as I was reading, I could easily picture in my mind each actor who portrayed each character, that's how much of an impression the miniseries made on me.

While many less worthy miniseries are available, I have not found this one, though I have searched for years. Can anyone help?As to the book itself, although it came out in 1968, it does not seem dated, since it is set in the summer of 1901. Jonathan Ferrier is fighting the medical establishment in his fictional hometown of Hambledon, PA, to bring advancements in the practice of medicine. Hard to believe that as late as 1901, there were still doctors who did not believe in germ theory and refused to wash their hands before examining patients. His methods are blunt and he does not suffer fools gladly. He cares only for his patients. Powerful men seek to drive him out of town, even after he is acquitted of the murder of his wife.

In her introduction, Taylor Caldwell dedicated the book to all the physicians who toiled and labored to bring all of us into the (then) twentieth century. Not only a was this book was her tribute to the hard working and anonymous physicians who created modern medicine, it's a personal story of a man who had to learn to forgive others so that he could heal and forgive himself so he could earn the right to the love of an incredible young woman.On a side note, read Taylor Caldwell's recreations of surgeries and examinations and wonder that she did not earn a medical degree herself.At its core it's a love story that is wonderfully poignant and heart-breaking, passionate without being tawdry."},{"Title":"Testimony of Two Men","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone in the medical field..We all stand on the shoulders of the past and need to thank the men and women who fought so hard to bring medicine to where it is today.The book may be fiction but there is no doubt in my mind that things, as related, did in fact occur."},{"Title":"Testimony of Two Men","review":"I first read this great novel in the early 70's and absolutely loved it.

Having never heard of Caldwell previously, I decided to give her \\"medical novel\\" a try in hopes that it would shed some light on my future profession. In this particular novel, Caldwell applies her understanding of the Christian Bible to depict the absurdity of a popular American conviction - that the testimony of two men is true (John 8:17). This obvious allusion serves as one of the novel's prominent themes, hence its title. The main character, Jonathon Ferrier, affirms the prevalence of truth in the most unlikely forms. Other themes include the traitorous nature of humanity when \\"the going gets tough\\" and its reluctance to accept change, even if for the better.Caldwell subtly employs symbolism in her acknowledgement of a nearby island known as \\"Heart's Ease.\\" While one character asserts that only a woman could have named the tract with such sentimentality, the reader can assume that the name merely stands for a place of respite, quite possibly heaven. A motif of \\"the future\\" develops as the characters begin to weigh the long-term consequences of their actions. This device plays into the novel's stream-of-consciousness effect and offers some coherency regarding Ferrier's occasional flashbacks. Caldwell's fascinating authorship exhibits impressive medical accuracy, and her in-depth character development capture the imagination. Just when it seems that matters could not worsen for Jon, she incorporates an unexpected plot twist and further heightens the reader's interest.As an aspiring physician, I found inspiration in Ferrier's quest to modernize the medical field. Some chapters tended toward redundancy, but this one negative aspect is overshadowed by Caldwell's extraordinary use of drama and conflict as she unveils an intriguingly darker side of society's advancement into the modern medical era. After reading Testimony of Two Men, anyone would be as adamant as I am about locating a copy of the 1977 film adaptation."},{"Title":"Testimony of Two Men","review":"This book, which I originally read in the seventies, at the age of 12,completely mesmerized me.

In her introduction, Taylor Caldwell said that she wrote the story in testimony to the brilliant physicians who brought us kicking and screaming into the twentieth century, physicians who were seen as prophets by some and madmen by others.

My wife gave me a hardbound edition several years ago and it remains my fictional favorite."},{"Title":"Turning Point: Moving Beyond Neoconservation","review":"In Turning Point, the authors trace the history of economic thought from John Maynard Keynes through to contemporary neo-classical economics and the school of Milton Friedman, and later theories such as the \\"rational expectations\\" theory of Robert Lucas, the \\"increasing returns\\" theory of Paul Romer, and the work of Robert Reich. They tie in these theorists with the history of economic policy making in Canada. This may seem boring at first blush, but the authors do their best to make these sections readable and interesting.The main argument of the book is that the government lacks a coherent economic policy for the future and needs to address this issue if Canada is to play any significant role in the new \\"knowledge economy\\". They claim that the neo-conservative solutions such as funding cuts in the mid-90s were necessary to deal with the spiraling debt and federal deficit, itself created by government policies enacted to address unemployment and later high inflation. However, in their eyes, the deficit has now been dealt with, and now the government has to move into reinvesting in several primary areas: health care, education, the information highway, and child-care. The authors believe that tax cuts do not boost spending, but rather consumer confidence. In fine Canadian fashion, they argue for a \\"middle road\\" between the neo-conservative agenda of tax cuts and old style liberal school of excessive government spending in order to sustain the robust economy.In general, I found this book readable and informative. I am not an economics major, but I found their analysis of economic theory and overview of policy implementation concise and interesting. What the authors argue seems to make much sense. However, I suspect that if you are a libertarian or very right wing economic conservative, this book will not be convincing. Conversely, if you fall on the left hand side of the economic spectrum, the analysis and solutions might not seem radical enough.The authors propose some solutions that seem fairly simple yet may be tough to implement. For example, with respect to education, they believe Ottawa should lower the cost of tuition on the assumption we need more, not less productive and innovative workers. This might be a tough sell politically. Perhaps not as tough would be increased investment in health care, something the government seems more amenable to.I did have some problems with a few of their arguments. For example, with respect to social programs, they argue that the government should view social programs as economic assets and not \\"largesse to be given to the masses by a benevolent wealthy elite.\\" (p. 195). However, one might argue that with globalization and increasing mobility of workers, firms don't care as much about hiring talent from local areas if they can parachute in highly educated workers from other countries. Thus, why should a multinational worry about locating in Canada or hiring Canadian workers and pay higher taxes if the alternative is to locate in the U.S. and have access to a highly skilled labour market and pay less taxes as the same time?Also troubling is their advocacy of a major child care scheme. In essence, they argue that because most parents are both working longer hours, child care has suffered in Canada. As a result, the government should reexamine creation of a national daycare system. However, I wonder if parents are really happy working longer hours and not being able to raise their children? While I don't presume to be an expert, the response seems a return to the \\"big government\\" style solutions that seem to be out of vogue. Perhaps more flexible work regimes are the answer, and not handing over care of one's children to strangers.The only other problem I had with this book was the writing style. They often use awkward phrases and descriptors; they refer to various \\"think tank\\" theorists as \\"media yackheads\\" and \\"cardboard thinkers,\\" yet declaim that \\"they serve an important purpose for politicians.\\" (pp. 146-147) I am unsure how to take this. There are many examples of this kind of &quot;popular&quot; writing style used in the book, and I found it annoying and more akin to ad hominem attacks.In summary, if you want to understand more about the economic policies and issues that have shaped the country since the Depression, this book is a good introduction. It is a welcome resource and will hopefully produce more debate on the issues."},{"Title":"Philosophical Counseling: Theory and Practice","review":"Philosophical Counseling is a paradoxical new field that purports to help people with life's problems by engaging them in philosophical discussions. This is paradoxical in a couple of ways. On the one hand, providing assistance with life's difficulties was one of the roots of philosophy, so how can this be a new field? On the other hand, many people, especially many professional philosophers, consider philosophic problems in the year 2001 to be very far removed from the problems of life. Smug within their ivory towers, philosophers have long ago immunized themselves to the charge that their studies are of no earthly use. It brings a smile to outsiders, and causes a commotion among the philosophers, when a philosopher hangs out a shingle offering a useful service for a fee.One of the central issues that Raabe examines in his book is: How can that fee be ethically justified? In the process of examining this, Raabe provides a broad survey of the field of Philosophical Counseling. Since the field is new, there is little general consensus even as to it's definition. Many of its practitioners use widely differing definitions of Philosophical Counseling in their own work. Raabe offers a critical survey of these various conceptions. Strikingly, Raabe is critical of the &quot;Beyond Method Method&quot; of the movement's founder, Gerd Achenbach.One man with whom I discussed &quot;Philosophical Counseling - Theory and Practice&quot; said in mock horror, &quot;This is about counseling, not philosophy!&quot; It is about counseling, explicitly and didactically so; the book could serve as an introductory text on counseling, I think. But the book is about philosophy too, for one of Philosophical Counseling's main ideas is that many of the stresses and upsets that people feel grow out of philosophical mistakes or misconceptions.Philosophical Counseling has a very broad overlap with psychological counseling. Many methods of psychological counseling, such as Cognitive Therapy and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, deal extensively with philosophic ideas in their practice. Part of Raabe's task is to find something that would in fact distinguish Philosophical Counseling from other already well established forms of counseling, and also to find a task that Philosophical Counseling can perform better than psychological counseling.Very broadly, the divide that Raabe finds is the one between therapy and education. Sometimes something is wrong with us; our leg is broken, we're attacked by germs, chemical structures in our brains are upset - these are all clearly medical problems. At other times, we just don't understand right, or we just don't know how to do something; we get wet feet because we don't know the tide is rising, we can't cross the water because we can't find the bridge. These are clearly educational problems. One might imagine a boundary between medicine and education; a place where the influence of the structure of the body blends with the influence of ideas to determine things like our various capabilities, aptitudes and attitudes, as well as our experience of happiness with our existence. One side of that boundary is the terrain of the psychologist, the other side of that boundary is the terrain of the philosopher.I'm not a philosopher or a counselor, but I found Raabe's book both an interesting read and a wealth of information. I'm not an insider to the growing Philosophical Counseling movement, but I understand that the challenges that Raabe has raised are controversial in many quarters. But as Raabe says, unless the movement can properly and ethically establish just what it's practice is, it will be threatened by charlatans."},{"Title":"Philosophical Counseling: Theory and Practice","review":"&quot;Empty is the argument of any philosopher who doesn't relieve any human suffering.&quot; Epicurus (341-271BC)Philosophy is different than psychology. Psychology looks at controlled scientific experiments to find out how the mind reacts to society. Philosophy is concerned with the conceptional questions like what reality?

I can forgive all that because it is entertaining, meaningfully explores some big issues, and the protagonist is very likable. Like other Cartwright novels, the prose is good."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"In a situation where Tom Clancy would waste five pages of techno-weenie jargon explaining exactly how a motion detector works, former SAS sergeant Andy McNab writes a few short sentences on how to beat one.McNab's main character, Nick Stone, describes himself as a 38 year old man with a lot on his mind and not much in it. Nothing ever goes quite as Nick plans and the results are thrilling, often quite funny and sometimes more than a little sad.If you are looking for a book to take along on a trip to read at the airport or on plane, this one would be tops. A fast read that makes killing time enjoyable."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I read the abridged version of Remote Control and decided to read the unabridged version to see what I had missed. I discovered that I had missed nothing more than a large amount of swearing and plenty of graphic violence. I recommend this book to anyone, but would promote the abridged version as the better option, as the story is not adversely affected by the 'chopping' of several parts."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Plenty of action/thriller writers can talk the talk, but only Andy McNab can walk the walk. That's why the Colombian drug cartels and the Provisional IRA still have contracts out on him. McNab doesn't have to imagine how these things work - he KNOWS, and he tells his tales in the sure knowledge that his plots and descriptions carry the authenticity that other writers lack.Remote Control follows agent Nick Stone through a storming story of IRA duplicity, murder and drug dealing. Curiously, at the time that I write this review, terrorist funding is hitting the world headlines following the despicable atrocities at the WTC and Pentagon. Andy McNab (with no foreknowledge of these events) points out that many citizens of USA have been funding the IRA for years. It's strangely ironic to be reminded of that now that USA needs the support of the rest of the democratic world. I guess one man's terrorist is another man's hero (?)I notice that other reviewers point to a seeming weakness in the story regarding Nick Stone's relationship with seven year old Kelly, whom he has saved from his parents' murderers. I think that this awkwardness between the two characters is quite intentional, highlighting the emotional difficulties of any special agent who is trained to kill without sentiment.Remote Control is a real page-turner of a book, delivering action that is just this side of out-of-control, and a plot that oozes authenticity. There's no doubt, almost from the outset, who the real villains are, but that doesn't lessen the suspense. How will Nick Stone get himself out of the mess and how will he save the little girl? Particularly since he's on a deniable mission and his British spymasters have disowned him. If you want to read a thriller that tells is as it really is, Remote Control is the book for you.... Five well-earned stars."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Remote Control is an unbelievably exciting story about ex-SAS agent Nick Stone. While in D.C. on what is typically described as spy work, he discovers the vicious murder of an old friend and his family. He grabs seven-year-old Kelly, the only survivor of the massacre, and finds himself being pursued by his friend's killer(s). Now tangled in the &quot;world of IRA deals, drug cartels, and messy TransAtlantic politics,&quot; Nick doesn't know where to turn or who to trust. The best part of McNab's novel, however, is the characters. They are so real that they easily drag you into the story. I found myself gripping the book so tightly whenever they were in immediate danger, that my knuckles were bright white... have fun trying not to fall in love with Nick and Kelly!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"If you liked any of the Rogue Warrior books, this book takes that same kind of wild ride, good time read to a new level. I have never read a book that I actually got an adrenaline rush from reading, but this one did that in spades. If you enjoy fast paced, non-stop edge of your seat reading, you will NOT go wrong here. To all the fans fron this book, I have also read his second book in the Nick Stone series that I picked up in England. It should be released in the US soon.......*GRIN*......so hang on, the fun doesn't stop here."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is a terrific read. McNabb's obvious knowledge of the subject matter makes this far more enjoyable than other books in the genre. If you're a fan of Tom Clancy (before he descended into political diatribes), you'll love this book. The political intrigue is well done, the intricate explanations of the spy game are incredibly believable, and the story moves along at a great clip. I picked this up at the airport and couldn't put it down until we landed.I can't wait for the next book from McNabb!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"As a highschool student i had to read a fictitious work by a British author. I am extremely glad that i let my friend talk me into reading Remote Control. It was one of the best books i have ever read, and i am thinking of keeping it rather than sell it to my teacher (she offered to buy it from me since the local library did not have a copy yet and i had to purchase it). It makes me feel sorry for the library that they do not have such an excellent book."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"A little over the top at times, never the less a very good read. Nick Stone does not let his immage slip as a tough character with all the witty remarks. Another good read from a top Author"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Real... I was an army medic and never one of those &#34;insane f**kers&#34;, but I have always admired their total commitment. To read the thoughts and get inside the head of an ex-SAS operative ... WOW!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Great book similar to most of the authors other titles but different enough to keep you interested throughout. Prefer a finished tail end then to be left wondering"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Read both of his first books B.T.Z and I.A. Remote Control is an outstsanding novel, the story is so plausible that I can not beleive it is fiction. Mr McNab you have outdone yourself yet again. Keep up the good work. Please give us a sequel to this facinating story. J.D"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Nick knew he screwed up by not checking that the serial numbers from the weapons were erased before he brought them to the Kurds in Northern Iraq. So when the Firm called him in, Nick expects the worst because any scenario he plays in involves the deniable operations of the British Secret Intelligence Service. Instead, the Firm offers him a fastball assignment that he immediately accepts. He trails two members of the Provisional Irish Republic Army from Shannon to Washington Dc to learn who they meet.Everything goes perfectly for Nick until he calls for assistance to tap the hotel room of his marks. Shockingly, he receives instruction to lift off immediately. Since Nick has time before his flight back to England, he visits an old war buddy. When he arrives at his friend's home, Nick finds Kevin, his spouse, and one of their children brutally murdered. Nick escapes with the other child, seven years old Kelly. He tries to make contact with the Firm, but fails. The American police think he is the killer, but he knows that professionals like himself murdered his friend. He knows he must first prove his innocence before the Firm reels him and Kelly back to safety.REMOTE CONTROL may be the espionage book of the year as the suspense never lets up until the final page. If any literary character in recent years seems like an operative, Nick is that individual. Kelly adds an extra measure of tension. The incredible story line shows that Andy McNab has insider's knowledge that he details within the exciting plot. The tale seems so authentic, readers will be checking every stranger in any public place they visit, courtesy of Mr. McNab's talent.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book ROCKS!! I just couldn't stop reading it over and over again"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I picked this up in Amsterdam. Not a bad work of fiction. McNab gets a couple of the guns wrong and I thought the name Nick Stone, to be a little lame in the start. But, overall, I never got bored and really enjoyed the book. Cameron Spence wrote another good book about the SAS in the Gulf and has written a work of fiction. Neither is available in the US, too bad."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I picked up this book in the Sydney airport while on a business trip (I'm shocked as to why this hasn't been released in the States?). I loved it, I couldn't put it down for two reasons. First is because I had nothing else to read on my 14 hour flight back to LAX and the other was because it was an excellent story. I found the first person narrative a refreshing change. I have read \\"Immediate Action\\" and \\"Bravo Two Zero\\" both excellent in my opinion. As I read this book a sat and wondered how much of this stuff really happen to Andy McNab.All I can say to Andy is... I WANT MORE!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"After reading Bravo Two Zero and Immiediate Action a Novel was the next obvious step and I was not disappointed. Mcnab's first 2 books gave attention to detail of life in the SAS and in his first Novel this theme is carried over. Once you begin reading you are transported into the story with graphic descriptions making you view exactly what is going on as if you are really there. This book is full of surprises and is a story of an Ex-SAS man who becomes involved in a murder whilst on an undercover security operation. After his former colleagues' family is wiped out in a murder he must protect the only survivor, an 8 year old girl. The story takes many twists and at times can be quite funny with an ' Ex-SAS hard man' having to 'unofficially adopt' the 8 year old girl, protect her from the baddies and learn to live with her 'alien' habits."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I picked this book up in Amsterdam durng the summer of '98. I had read both of McNab's books prior and saw it in a train station and figured WTF. It's not a bad book and McNab has come up with a good story line. I think there are a few lame points in the book (Nick Stone, come'on is this a porn flick ?) and some of the gun and fights are a tad off. But, for someone who wasn't taught to be a writter, it's a darn good read. For those into the SAS, check out Cameron Spence's Sabre Sqd. I don't see it listed on Amazon and I picked it up in greece, but it's also about the Gulf War and he does a good job too."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I am reading this book for the second time and it still retains it's surprises. I couldn't put it down the first time and i can't put it down this time. Highly reccomended"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Following in the footsteps of Chris Ryan, and becoming a full time author, MacNab has made an outstanding jump from autobigraphical work to fiction. I found the book to be 'un put a downable' and all the time I was reading it I couldn't help thinking I can't wait for the film. I don't want to spoil the story more than saying it's good guy against bad goverenment - US and UK. There is blood and gore and a fine attention to detail that makes it a must. I can't wait until the next book"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This had the making of a great book. A good story line, explosive action, human interest and well written. Why did the author have to use the &quot;f&quot; word so regularly, so out-of-place and so off putting that it became too difficult to continue reading?"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I read one of the early McNab books in which he relates details about his time with the SAS, but with a strong narrative style. Kept me turning the pages when so often non-fiction bio-based books can be stale, so I was intrigued how this entry into fiction might go.For the most part McNab pulled it off as we get sucked into a tale whereby our hero has to protect the life of a seven-year old girl, Kelly. One criticism is that we could have seen a bit more from the girl's POV, and the depth of detail was at points a bit too heavy and so slowed down the action. But overall this was a sterling effort and I'm sure more will be seen of McNab in the fiction arena."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is the first book in a long series of Andy McNabb's fictional character Nick Stone. It is a realistic and awesome book! I never want to put McNabb's books down! Fiction or Non-Fiction!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I read Remote Control when it was first published in paperback but am about to buy it again (for Kindle, if it's available).Ironically I first bought Remote Control in the Borders book store in Tyson's Corner which in the book was one of the suburban metropolitan DC strip malls that McNab describes in excruciating and accurate detail in his opening chapters.Borders is of course closed now but the strip mall where it used to exist (in 1999) is described quite vividly, right up to the dumpsters and rear store entrances. Back in 1999 or 2000, I actually went to the the various Tyson's strip malls described in the book and have no doubts whatsoever that \\"Andy McNab\\" - whoever he may be - might actually have walked those same areas.It's probably also relevant that Tyson's Corner area is quite packed with intelligence agency support companies.Then McNab moves on to hotels in Crystal City, Virginia (only a couple miles away from Tyson's), which are immediately south of the Pentagon and - perforce - packed with yet more military intelligence activities.So for me Remote Control may have had a slightly different effect than on other readers: it begins with a detailed local geography and phenomenon which \\"McNab\\" has portrayed quite accurately even though in fiction."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I have read several Andy McNab books on my Kindle since Christmas and I rate this as by far the best."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"From the start of the story, it's obvious McNab is not your typical thriller writer. There's an edge, a brusque matter-of-factness that reflects the the author's military service (much of it with British SAS). The attention to operational detail lends a sense of reality that is rare in other genre writing, yet somehow we don't get bogged down in the minutiae. And the action is brutal and visceral, no movie-style stylized fist-fights, instead there are vicious no-holds-barred fights (realistically, what happens when someone is fighting to stay alive) that frequently leave our hero worse for wear.Even more unusual for this genre, a child features prominently in the plot, and McNab accurately captures the sense of a non-parent adult trying to cope with a young child, except for one plot twist towards the end where the kid is unrealistically competent (you'll know it when you get there).If you have discovered McNab via his gripping true story inBravo Two-zero, his writing has the same quality in fiction. Well worth the read, and you'll probably end up with a bunch of later McNab books on your wishlist, like I did."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Alright, I knew \\"who dunnit\\" pretty early on, but it was still a fun read. Mr. McNab for obvious reasons brought a great deal of verismilitude to the story. I'll definitely be picking up more of his fiction."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"this Book is his best one so far i think, it was very hard for me to put it down and i think it's a very exciting read and andy has a great story once more and the more the book advances you are wondering how the book will end, very good job Andy!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Andy McNab's Nick-the-SAS-guy character makes an impact with Remote Control. It's obviously an earlier Nick, and written by an obviously less-experienced Andy McNab, but it's chock-full of tradecraft and suspense. I started reading this series with Crisis Four, the second most recent book, and decided that I enjoyed it enough to go back in time."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"After reading Bravo Two Zero and Immediate Action I decided to take a read of Remote Control, being the first fiction book Andy McNab has written I was unsure what to expect. After reading the first few pages I was hooked, it got my interest right away. Andy McNab maintains his successful down to earth writing style, he is descriptive but to the point, its rare you find yourself bored by a flood of inconsequential technical details.The character, Nick Stone, is like McNab an ex SAS soldier. He now lives his life doing deniable operations for the British intelligence agency. The rest you just got to read to find out.It's this book that opens the door to what I hope will be a very interesting and somewhat educating series of books. McNab's down to earth sense of things shows in the way he writes the book, Nick Stone is no super hero, he can't take out a whole regiment of soldiers with a few grenades and an Uzi. This is the kind of book I have been waiting for, a book written by a guy who knows what he is talking about, he knows his characters limits and he doesn't breach these, I only hope this is maintained through the series.I particulary like the obvious advertising placed in the book, it must be nice to be offered such a large sum of money to mention a product in your book, nice one Mr McNab!I give this book 5 Stars."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I heard of Andy McNab through the letters pages of the excellent espionage comic &quot;Queen and Country&quot; by Greg Rucka. McNab came highly recommended from Rucka, a writer I hold in high regard, so I thought I'd give him a chance. To say the least, I was floored. &quot;Remote Control&quot; is as good a spy thriller as you're bound to find these days. It mixes excellent &quot;working field knowledge&quot; with high suspense. Moreso, you get the feeling that, as highly trained as Nick Stone is, he is still as vulnerable as you or me - not some invincible Bond-type figure. It makes the violence in the book all the more riveting when you take this into consideration.About the only flaw I found in the book is some minor points of characterization with the young girl, Kelly. Without giving away the plot, I will say that her reactions to her entire situation were a little too calm and understanding, especially considering her age. I doubt a real child of 8 or 9 would be able to keep a cool emotional head as she does throughout the majority of this book.That said, the end of this book, and how Kelly is involved, is absolutely stunning. A wonderful read! I look forward to reading more of McNab's work."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is a verry exciting story. I've almost read the book in just one breath!!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Brilliant! Superb! I could not put it down, and read it in just under six hours. Non stop brilliance and action."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Not a bad book, although one would expect something more at the end. Only question is who is the real hero this time. When bullets fly, McNab is the hero, but when keyboards work overtime, someone else should get the appropriate credit. Come on, mr. McNab, you of all people should know that SigSauer pistols DO NOT HAVE SAFETY LEVERS! It takes just a little detail like this to give away the game... Anyway, not a bad book, not bad at all."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Andy, for Godsakes, write what you know. Just because it's a novel doesn't mean that you have to ensure that it really is.The book started off with a believeable surveil and pop of some the Boyos in Gibraltar. A true action, and characteristic of many of the ops that go on all the time. But then, Andy, you have the main character trying to E&amp;E from the baddies whilst carrying an 8-year old girl as baggage. At that point, your book became a coffee-table ornament suitable for the occasional disciplining of one's pets.The tradecraft was sparse, but credible. Dialog was in character. For those who are offended by obscenities and potty-mouth, please understand that the &quot;F&quot; and &quot;S&quot; words are conversational staples of the Regiment. For a squaddie to not potty-mouth is similar to tying one's hands and not being able to speak or communicate. As for me, I'd have slapped a strip of tape across Kelly's mouth. No words or comments are needed from you, my Miss. In reality, Kelly wasnt' a true form character anyway. Andy, you know Kelly would have been either ditched or become baggage that eats and does things at inopportune times.&quot;Remote Control&quot; was a good show for the first time attempt at a novel. Still, it went on remote and cruise control with a relatively predictable ending. Andy, you know that one's friends are often one's most dangerous enemies, that people are &quot;used up,&quot; that there's always a shiny Ned-the-New-Lad to replace you and any day that you can see the sunrise is a bonus. Write what you know - the truth will scare the public. There are plenty of great stories, with unbelievable twists and turns, triumphs and absolute betrayals whilst on a soggy lay-up in the &quot;Bandit Country&quot; of South Armagh or dealing with the Boyos of Tyrone acting up in Germany or Spain. Stay with what you know and the only thing left is to write the deposit slip."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"It is a long time since i read a book that slow and boring.But now i know a lot about the streets and hotel rooms in Washington D.C.I also know how to operate an old VHS tape-recorder.Everything is just so slow and detailed that u will probably go to sleep very fast.I did."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I read a book a day. FINALLY a real &quot;page turner&quot;. The beginning is a little slow and seemingly disjointed. Don't give up. It'll make sense later. The ending could have used one more paragraph. Enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Experienced SAS operator Andy McNab deserves credit for sparing us the predictable Hollywood-style action novel. He keeps things realistic: long on tradecraft details and short on gratuitous action.Beneath a thin international intrigue veneer, what we really have here is an unromanticized glimpse into the tedious, unexciting day-to-day drudgery of witness-protection work. Spywork, fights and shoot-outs do take place, but the writer shows great discipline and keeps the bang-bang restrained within the context of the mission at hand.If you're expecting spec ops action a' la Rainbow Six, sass like Richard Marcinko, or spy dramas in John Le Carre's style, you'll have to go elsewhere.I vote 5 stars for realism, 3 stars for overall reading enjoyment. In any event, Andy McNab looks to have a very promising future as a writer of special operations novels."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"For totally raw, in your face, absorbing, thriller action this book is a must.Most definatly the best book I have read. Although a little formula in plot it doesn't really matter. The only book I have read twice ... the ending is something else! enjoy"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Excellent Book, I simply couldn't put it down. The story is about an SAS Soldier working undercover following two PIRA Soldiers. They are followed to Washington, where it all goes terribly wrong."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"First of all this is not a review! So if you want one stop reading. First, for the second review listed: he wouldnt have gotten any of the guns wrong! What do you think he trained with for ten plus years?! I have read both of his non-fiction books (that are excelent and should be bought immediatly)and I wish he wouls write another one carrying on after Bravo Two Zero. I can only assume that this one is as good as his others. Tell me is it?"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Andy McNab's first thriller is a top-notch combination of violent action,pulse-pounding excitement and edge of your seat suspense.In \\"Remote Control\\" McNab introduces a new hero, Nick Stone, who makes mostother famous fictional heroes look like prancing twits (can you say \\"Dirk Pitt\\"?) Anex-SAS operator and current deniable ops specialist for Britain, Stone is somethingof a cross between Hammett's Continental Op and Alistair MacLean's PhillipCalvert: tough as jacketed hollow points, totally on-task, and cunning enough tobeat the bad guys at their own game. Nick Stone has more life in him (and moreblood and soul) than any action hero this side of Pendleton era Mack Bolan.The action in \\"Remote Control\\" never lets up for more than a few pages, and evenwhen Stone isn't facing guns and fists he's deep into the task at hand and planning2 or 3 moves ahead so that the pace just keeps up and the tension builds.Stone has to work against a plot without any help after he finds the family of afriend murdered. On the run and out in the cold with his friend's seven year olddaughter in tow, Stone uses his training, intelligence and toughness to bestadvantage. And just when he's past one challenge, an even greater one confrontshim. The story is told in first person and it really sounds like authentic dialogue.This is like the golden age of Len Deighton's spy writing but with a tougher andmore realistic hero. Hard-boiled stuff!The great relationship between childless Stone and seven year old Kelly is awonderful thing in this book. I think I worried as much for him when he had tofinally tell Kelly her family was dead as when he was in any of the many deadlyencounters in the story. McNab obviously knows something about children andKelly's character is so real it makes the reader very frightened for her safety.The cover quote from author Stephen Coonts claims McNab is \\"the best suspensethriller writer. . . since Alistair MacLean\\" and I can't argue with that. This book waseverything you'll want in a thriller. I can't wait to start the next one!This is a 5 star effort if ever there was one. Read it."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"REMOTE CONTROL is an exciting, bullet flying, rib cracking, guts spewing story about an ex-SAS man, Nick Stone, who gets caught up in the vicious murder of an old friend and his family. Rescuing the only surviving member of the massacre a seven-year-old shell shocked little girl called Kelly, Nick goes on the run, and finds out that even friends are potential enemies in a world of IRA deals, drug cartels and messy TransAtlantic politics. This is a knuckle bitingly good book and I spent the whole of an evening reading it from cover to cover. Andy McNab is as good a writer of fiction as he is of fact. I liked his hero because it showed the man to be human and not just a killing machine as SAS soldiers are often portrayed in many novels. I hope that McNab thinks of writing a sequel to REMOTE CONTROL as Nick Stone and Kelly make quite a formidable team. A big thumbs up for this cracker of a first novel."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"After reading McNab's &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; and &quot;Immediate Action,&quot; I thought I'd give his fiction a try. Overall this book is entertaining, with more action than recent vintage Clancy novels. The action is often quite intense and, in those moments, it is a real page turner. The technical and tradecraft details are what really make this book. McNab, or course, is all the more believable in these areas due to his personal experiences as relayed in his non-fiction work. He buys a credibility there that Clancy, et al. just can't match. Worth reading for that fact alone.While the story is good and the details better, the writing itself is sometimes clumsy. Maybe this is nitpicking, since the reality is that the writing somehow seems to &quot;fit&quot; the story (you wouldn't want Steinbeck or Hemingway telling the story, would you?). However, I suspect that the writing is simply due to first novel syndrome (I had no complaints about his writing in Bravo Two Zero), and would expect this to improve in future works.Although I only gave the book 3 stars, I'll definitely keep McNab on my &quot;read&quot; list."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"There are a few books that are so suspenseful and action-packed I have been unable to put them down. Remote Control is one of them. Ex-SAS 'K' Nick Stone is assigned to follow a group of Provisional IRA members on their way to Washington. His mission is cut short, but before leaving, he decides to visit a friend's family. At this point, McNab plunges the reader into a rollercoaster ride of emotions as Stone finds the family savagely murdered. From there on, the action does not stop - Stone finds himself and 7-year-old Kelly, the family's only survivor, pursued by mysterious forces intent on capturing them both. An array of supporting characters add to the drama - 'Slack' Pat the ex-SAS drug addict, Al De Niro the ex-mobster, Euan the best friend, and more. Stone himself is a brilliant creation, a hero with a sizeable share of ruthlessness - you can't help but wonder how much of McNab is in Stone. Remote Control creates a world which is brutal, thrilling and shockingly realistic - quite simply one of the best books you'll find."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I absolutely could not put this book down! McNab has a gift for writing action. The tradecraft sure sounds believable to a civillian like me. The characters are a bit cardboard-like, and I wonder how much time McNab has spent with children, but who cares? I was completely sucked in from the first page. The fight in the PIRA office in DC is a stunner, and it's not even the best part of the book. I'm looking forward to McNab's next effort."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is the first book I've read from McNab but I'm sure I'll read more. Similar to the Rogue Warrior series, I like McNab a bit better. McNab is not quite as arrogant, but nevertheless, special forces must grow an in-your-face attitude.I particularly enjoyed the detailed observations and the reasoning behind the tradecraft actions. What's Nick Stone, the hero, doing looking inside a fire extinguisher? What's he going to make with the kitchen supplies? One always gets a bit more involved when the writing not only entertains but also educates.The relationship with Kelly also moves the story. Surely a SAS operative would have problems with relating to a seven year old but by the end of the book, it's quite believable how they have grown attached.I had only a couple of minor irritants. McNab's British background is evident as expected. However, some actions would get different reactions in the US. I can't believe a British citizen wouldn't draw more attention with an American child in tow. Particularly with the scratches and cuts gathered along the way during the characters romp through the seedy side of America. Who from England would want to stay in a hotel in the warehouse district?Also, as some of the other reviewers pointed out, the story is somewhat predictable. Even I could tell early in the book who the ultimate villans had to be. Nevertheless, REMOTE CONTROL was an enjoyable way to spend the weekend."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"From the first page all the way to the final one, Andy McNab's &quot;Remote Control&quot; was a gripping and fantastic read.Readers will follow the main character of Nick Stone from Gilbraltar to London and then on to the United States. While on what is termed a &quot;deniable assignment&quot;, Nick contacts a former SAS colleague, only to find upon his arrival at their home that Kev and his family have been brutally murdered. All but one.... their seven year old daughter Kelly.This story never loses its pace. Nick and Kelly are on the run from people trying to kill them at every turn. But it's the growing relationship between Nick and Kelly that I find truly memorable.At first Nick tries his best to protect the young girl from the forces closing in on them, only to slowly find himself growing to rely on Kelly with every turn of the page.I totally agree that this is a &quot;can't put down&quot; novel. Your heart will race at the clever twists and turns McNab has crafted. The supporting cast of characters are highly developed. From the dangerous IRA hitmen, to Stone's British employers at The Firm, to fellow SAS members Pat and Euan, all the way to the federally relocated mobster Big Al DeNiro. Each is a living, breathing character adding to the tension and brilliant storyline!This is a novel that begs a sequel so readers can see what further developments take place between Nick and Kelly. They are two unforgettable characters!Very well done, Mr. McNab!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Andy McNab's &quot; Remote Control &quot; is the greatest compelling story of real-life action in the world of Espionage, Politics, Terrorism, and Corruption. So far, it is &quot;The Best of the Best&quot;."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"You know how some people, when they tell a story, have to give you every...single...detail and by the time they get to the point, you are past caring. That's how McNab is -- only to add to the misery,his main character is dragging a little girl around with him. And we have to hear about every street they go down, every hotel room they inhabit. And, on one hand, the author makes you think that capture could come at any minute. Yet, the character has time to buy clothes for the little girl, right in the heat of the chase. Spare me! The book just plods along with little excitement and little plot development. In fact, the plot seems to go nowhere. McNab is better writing non-fiction. I can't understand all the positive reviews here. It must be a British thing."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Recently, I acquired a copy of the Stephen Leather thriller,Hot Blood (A Dan Shepherd Mystery), which had on its front cover a sticker that screamed \\"Better than Andy McNab or your money back\\". Leather's ongoing fictional hero, Dan \\"Spider\\" Shepherd, is a former member of the SAS now working for an ultra-secret undercover unit of London's Metropolitan Police. Nick Stone, the protagonist making his initial appearance here in McNab's first novel, REMOTE CONTROL, is an ex-SAS trooper now working for MI6. What, do Leather and McNab have a mano-a-mano thing going? (I don't ever remember seeing a Dean Koontz release with the claim, \\"King writes dross; read my stuff.\\") When queried by me, Stephen said that his publisher suggested the ploy. But, since I did end up buying REMOTE CONTROL, perhaps the point is to sell more books from both.Here, Stone is tasked by his SIS controller to follow two hard IRA boyos to Washington, DC, to see what mischief they're up to. Once comfortable in his hotel room, Nick is almost immediately recalled home. But, before catching the next plane back across The Pond, Stone decides to visit old SAS pal Kev, now working for the DEA. Arriving at Kev's suburban home, Nick discovers his buddy bludgeoned to death and his wife and one of two daughters with their throats cut. Stone find's the second daughter, 7-year old Kelly, cowering in a hidey-hole. Realizing that Kelly saw the killers and her life is now in peril, and that he himself may become a suspect in the bloodbath, Stone grabs the girl and runs. Over the remainder of the book, our hero must discover the identity of the murderers, protect Kelly, and get both of them to safety in England where his boss, Simmonds, will certainly sort things out.For a first novel, REMOTE CONTROL is better than average. McNab's personal tour of duty with the SAS imparts a patina of realism to the actions of his Stone character. Indeed, Nick is a Tough Guy in somewhat the same vein as author Lee Child's ex-Army MP, Jack Reacher. At one point in a desperate, hand-to-hand struggle with a Bad Guy over control of a pistol, Stone must essentially chew the man's face apart. Somehow, I don't see Leather's hero doing anything so messy.One of the criticism's I've made of the Dan Shepherd series is the fact that Spider's young son Liam is trotted out as a prop in every installment to re-emphasize that widower Shepherd is otherwise a warm, decent, family man whose day job takes him to the world's hard and grotty edges. In REMOTE CONTROL, Kelly also starts out as a prop. But, by the conclusion, she plays an integral, nail-biting, and very satisfying part. I see from plot summaries that Kelly also appears in follow-up volumes of the Nick Stone series, so I've gone ahead and ordered the second out of curiosity to see where McNab takes the character.The drawbacks to REMOTE CONTROL are that we've seen the scenario before in books and films - adult and child flee a deadly conspiracy hand-in-hand - and, well before the end, the coming betrayal twist becomes all to obvious.By profession, Stephen Leather is a journalist who's lived all over the world. McNab - a pseudonym ostensibly to protect his identity from vengeful terrorists left over from his bad old SAS days - continues to work with intelligence organizations on both sides of the Atlantic. I suspect, therefore, that Andy's books will be more realistic in the finer points, while Stephen's will show a wider scope of imagination. In any case, both are excellent British authors creating some very entertaining reads.Hey, Stephen and Andy, why don't you both co-author a thriller in which both Dan and Nick appear? The potential for a friendly, or not so friendly, rivalry between the two heroes is almost too good to pass up."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Remote control, is about a special K soldier called Nick Stone. Nick is on a secret mission in the USA, when his best friend and his family are murdered. The only one left in the family is a seven year old girl called Kelly. Nick and kelly, are being chased around the USA, trying to find safety. But who is friend and who is foe?"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. The author clearly is an expert at spy stuff. There was one part where he disabled a motion detector with a clock and an egg carton, and there was another time when he blew up a house with ordinary kitchen materials. And the plot was really great. The way he depicted all of the espionage stuff was excellent. This is a really great book."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"this book had a twist that you would never expect, and all of mcnab's experience really adds on to the quality of the book. There was one incedint where he blows up a house with normal kitchen materials, and another when he nutrelizes a motion sensor with a clock and a milk carton. He also said in an interview that all of the experiences had actually happened to him."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Good book, but in contrary to his book Bravo Two Zero and Chris Ryans books, this one does contain a few unpleasant tones of over-violence. The tone is that in an E&amp;E-situation, be as violent as possible, the main character would not hesitate killing a cop, since &quot;ultimately that is what they are paid for&quot;, etc. Too bad for an otherwise excellent book."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"As an amateur reader, this was the first Andy McNab I had ever read. On finishing the first Chapter, I felt intrigued to read on. In some parts of the book I felt the author went into a lot of detail which made me able to follow along with the plot easily. I felt that the end of the book was very gripping. The next book I will be reading will be the ever famous Bravo Two Zero, of which I have seen the film. I hope that this next book will be as good as &quot;Remote Control&quot;."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book was both exciting and suspenseful. I am really impressed with the quality of writing. It was a good length for a quick read. It was so realistic and I became attached to both Nick Stone and Kelly. Not many books I read have such memorable characters."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"It's hard to imagine McNab hasn't written fiction before--he's a natural. He tells the story with an ease that's befitting an accomplished writer, and with a knowledge base that can only come from having &quot;been there.&quot; I wouldn't call this book exciting from start to finish, because there are lulls in the action--but it holds your interest. Like FALSE ACCUSATIONS from another first-time author, Alan Jacobson, REMOTE CONTROL deals with someone on the run, and nowhere to turn. Both FALSE ACCUSATIONS and REMOTE CONTROL keep you guessing as to how it's all going to come out in the end...and both books keep you turning till that last page. I'd highly recommend checking out both. And I'm definitely looking forward to McNab's next book."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book has an excellent plot and is thoroughly suspenseful. A great &quot;chase&quot; scene. Unfortunately, however, McNab stretches the bounds a little too much when he has the character of eight-year-old Kelly act as the littlest spy, concocting bombs and searching PIRA headquarters. Stretching suspension of disbelief a little much. Also, his writing of the child's dialogue was weak. But, if you can overlook these flaws, it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Remote Control is really worth reading. Its full of details that makes the reader realize that heres an author who tried the drills himself. A sequel please!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"On the book jacket Stephen Coonts writes that &quot;McNab is the best suspense thriller writer ...since Alistar MacLean&quot;. I did not realize that Mr. Coonts was old enough to know of MacLean, but I am. Andy McNab may not be the best since MacLean, but he is assuredly a fine writer. He has developed a close knit plot, cleverly inserting various possible clues and factions (PIRA, DEA, CIA, SIS, et al) into his storytelling. As a craftsman he has maintained continuity while providing the beginning, middle and end of the story, never leaving the reader in a lurch. &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; may have been better, but I read that about 40 years ago. I look forward to &quot;Crisis Four&quot;."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"this is the first of his i've read, and i was suitably impressed. Nick Stone strikes me somewhat as a more realist, more modern James Bond, an ex-SAS man, he now works for the &quot;deniable operations&quot; unit of the British secret service.The book is well written, and easy to read. the pace is fast, the plot is exciting and never lets up. the action is constant, and the ending is full of surprises.Stone is a likeable &quot;hero&quot;, and seems very human. His relationship with Kelly, the young girl he is trying to save, is touching and at times very sad. The book has a fierce realism, borne from the fact that McNab has been there, done that.I would reccomend it."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"After reading a fair number of thrillers, you can tell when someone is writing from knowledge and experience without even knowing anything about the author. Andy McNab has learned much from being in the SAS, and it shows-- Stone is one of the most cunning and believable characters in thriller fiction. I got the same feeling of excitement reading this book as I did when I first read Alistair McLean's early novels. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This guy seems like the real thing. The special thing about this series is the hero's relationship to the little girl in his care.While much of the action seems fantastic, it never crosses over to unbelievability.Obviously, the author has been there and done it.Escapist reading of the highest order. First of the series."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This exciting book about a man called Nick Stone. He is sent on a mission to follow two irish suspects. Everything was going swimmingly untill he went to his friends house...A great book with ups and downs a plenty. An exciting read with plenty of action yet not so much it ruins the book. A great book to read on journeys."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I liked this book. Very similar to Richard Marcinko's Navy SEAL books. While Richard Marcinko goes into the technicals of warfare, Andy writes a story that is about human side of being SAS...and along the way we get to watch some good fight sequences.The story was good, and it didn't seem like Andy was trying to stuff it full of sensational violence or shoot outs. All round very interesting and entertaining. I look forward to reading some of Andy's other work.I was especially impressed with the orator/story teller (tape version.) He did a great job of putting all the voices together."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Superb beginning - one of the few books I couldn't put down . Extremely realistic and exciting. However during the second part of the book I was put off by the heroes relationship with the little girl. I didn't find this convincing at all and so gave up interest having to skip the bonding nonsense. Stick to the action Andy, this is your strength and few can do it better - you know it makes sense!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book makes you feel that you are living Nick and Kelly's adventure. Andy holds no punchs and tells it as it is. Anyone who has read any of his books will enjoy this classic spy thriller!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"This book was great. I could not put it down. He had me in suspense the whole way through, making it seem like he was never going to get out of his situation. He works your emotions, from describing those terrible murders, to finding out his best friend had deceived him. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"It is said write about what you know, Andy McNab knows his trade-craft. The story is well plotted and moves quickly. However,the shadow group involving drug cartel,DEA and British Intelligence is poorly defined. The major flaw in a good novel is the ending, just left me hanging!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Remote Control was one of the best books I ever read. I couldn't put it down. It involves an SAS agent named Nick Stone who flies to the States to find his best friend and family murdered. The only one who survived is Kelly, his friend's daughter. They have to evade the police, which takes them all over the East Coast. As soon as they think everything is finally okay and they're in the clear,.....well, you'll just have to read it! Awesome book!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"With all due respect to Andy, I think he should stick with writing true crime/non-fiction books as he did before (&quot;Immediate Action&quot; and &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;; both great, especially the latter one).There is a good thing, though, that comes out of this book. I learned how to go into hiding, how to evade the enemy, how to conduct survaillance, how to lose people in the crowds, how to lie when checking into hotels, how to ditch cars and never use credit cards while on the run. Not to mention how to make home-made bombs using kitchen cleaners. It's a good guide on what to do while hiding from government agencies or 'other organizations'. &quot;A Fugitive's Manual&quot;.Otherwise, as a fiction novel, it's not all that good. But I still appreciate the tips!"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"You can read synopses of the story above - probably already did. I'd like to share my response to this book: I found it so gripping that my jaw was tight throughout the entire read - which, by the way, lasted all night since I couldn't put it down to go to bed. This is a suspenseful drama with characters who grow on you. (Did me, anyway.) An exciting story with what looks like real tradecraft sprinkled throughout the book.If you liked Clancy's Without Remorse, I think you'll love this book. If you like Clancy, look up McNab, and then Dean Ing. Ing used to write SF (which is so good that many non SF'ers enjoy them) but now writes (damfino what to call them. Let's try:) Techno-Thrillers.Can't say too much about Remote Control. If you like adventure, spy type novels, this is one of the best - most gripping and exciting."},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"I guess it doesn't surprise me that the intellectual level of what one assumes must be an average SAS operator is fairly low. Given the political dirtbags who run such agencies these days, McNab probably quite accurately represents the conformity of thought and uncritical mindset of killers for hire.Tradecraft? Well, I'd love to see a veteran OSS operative run circles around this bozo.It's an interesting read if only for a look into the British soul. It reminds me once again why I feel revulstion towards most Brits; so thank you, McNab.As a purely technical criticism, directed more to the editors than the author, it's always a good idea to have an ending in a book. This one just sort of stops.... Maybe the last couple chapters got lost somewhere?"},{"Title":"Remote Control","review":"Great setting for a crime - everyone snowbound or snowblind perhaps.

In terms of currently available map books of the roads and highways of Ontario, this is probably the least helpful and least user-friendly. Ontario map books by other publishers, such as the \\"Ontario Road Atlas\\" by MapArt Publishing (issued yearly) and the \\"Ontario Road & Recreational Atlas\\" by Whitecap Books are MUCH better in terms of accuracy, detail and features. The MapArt book is excellent for general Ontario travel (it includes backroad names) while the \\"Ontario Road & Recreational Atlas\\" has detailed information on parks, trails and conservation areas as well as detailed road maps. Both of these map books are available through Amazon.com as well and I would much reccommend those instead."},{"Title":"AutoCAD 2000 Tutor for Engineering Graphics","review":"This book is great for those whom are just beginning to use AutoCad.

I read it from cover to cover in just a few days."},{"Title":"The General","review":"The novel \\"The General\\" is a war story of one man's rise through the British military as they face the Germans in Europe during World War 1. As the novel begins, Herbert Curzon is a subaltern in a British calvary unit in South Africa. Herbert is noticed for promotion, when he leads his unit down a trench and attacks the German flank, catching them unaware and winning the battle. This victory beings a meteoric rise for Curzon. For each battle he participates in, his superiors are wounded or killed off, thus causing him to ascend up the military ladder. This rise is further assisted, by his marriage to a Duke's daughter. Eventually, Curzon is promoted to Lieutenant-General and fighting in the trenches of Europe. It is here where C.S. Forester's writing comes in describing the old school tactics of trying to overwhelm the enemy with superior infantry numbers and prolonged bombardment by planes and artillery. It is amazing to see the tactics used and the stubborness of the British military as they continuously throw men at the German lines, in order to be mowed down my machine guns or be caught in barbed wire. And with each failure, the British command along with Curzon's advice, believe that all they need to succeed is to march more men at the Germans.\\"The General\\" was an informative novel about the thought processes of decisions made by the British military during the trench warfare of World War 1. And it is a story of one man's determination to rise and succeed at warfare, by using previous successful military tactics, that currently were wildly out of date. Even though a bit slow in parts, I enjoyed reading the novel, and was interested to see where Curzon's stubborness and thinking would eventually lead him."},{"Title":"The General","review":"This is the best anti-war novel I have ever read. It shows the creation of motivations for war and military action that come out of the personal issues of Generals and politicians. It underlines very clearly the massive destruction of lives as a brutal meaningless war (WWI)in the trenches went on for no reason except the personal ambitions of generals and politiians."},{"Title":"The General","review":"This relatively slim volume is in fact a great story with universal lessons for all. \\"The General\\" ranks as high as a general in teaching lessons about how lessons ought to be taught to our leaders, political and military."},{"Title":"The General","review":"Not one of Forester's best. It is clear that Forester has an agenda, and this agenda gets in the way of the story-telling. But the strikingly odd thing is that what he tells you and what he shows you are different. Forester tells the reader that Curzon is old-fashioned, militarily; that he still believes in cavalry charges and that he disdains modern weapons such as machine guns. What he shows, on the other hand, is Curzon fighting dismounted, making effective use of those new-fangled weapons he so dislikes. He might not like modern methods of war, but he is smart enough to know that they can't be ignored. He is not the stupid, antiquated luddite he is described as.Despite that flaw, it is a good, entertaining story. In some ways it puts me in mind ofThe Life and Death of Colonel Blimp."},{"Title":"The General","review":"I know that this N&A edition is priced high but I payed the $25.95 here at Amazon and I was not disappointed. The General is one of the best war books I've ever read. It tells the tale of Herbert Curzon as he rises through the ranks to being a general in the British military. It's brilliant in revealing the world, social and political, of WWI Britain. One admires \\"old-school\\" Curzon and those like him and yet one is also shocked at the inadequacy of \\"old-school\\" tactics and their results. This book is gritty and polished, much like the British officers it illustrates. The war bits are very good though tragic. I had read The African Queen and disliked it. This is the second book of Forester's that I've read and I thought it was brilliant."},{"Title":"The General","review":"I live in England and read evey CSF book I could find 20 years ago. Whenever I visited the local public library I had several authors I knew would entertain me. Fleming, AJ Cronin, and my favourite, CS Forester. His Hornblower books are exciting, but his other books are just as as well written and enjoyable (probably better, read The African Queen). I did a search on Amazon and found this book....The memories came flooding back.This book will teach you what it was like to be an upper crust, English gent in 1914. The bumbling ways we the British conducted ourselves in the The Great War. However, it will also tell you about how brave man can be.If you think Tyson is tough, well the General is tougher.READ IT. You will not be disappointed..."},{"Title":"The General","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I bless the day many years ago--in college, I think--when I found it in a bookstore quite by accident (for I am not a naval buff and have read none of the Hornblower novels.) It was out of print for many years, and I welcome it back.This is an anti-war novel written by a military historian who grieves over the way his country fought the Great War. It has parts which are hilariously funny (Curzon's courtship and marriage, the family he marries into, the wedding night (nothing graphic here, of course--Forester is a gentleman); it offers a scathing view of England's class system at work; it is dead right (is there a pun here?) in dealing with trench warfare.Buy it, savor it, re-read it. If you happen to teach, assign it to your students along with All Quiet on the Western Front. This is a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"The General","review":"Forester is best known for his works of historical fiction with maritime themes. _The African Queen_ and the exceptionally wonderful Hornblower series are his best known works. _The General_ takes a completely different tack on multiple levels.- On a simple level, _The General_ is Forester's only foray into ground conflict. Herbert Curzon (the title character) is an &quot;old school&quot; cavalry man who is promoted (several times) during World War I and eventually has responsibility for large numbers of land forces: infantry, artillery, etc.- On a deeper level, I think that this is Forester's &quot;anti-war&quot; tome. His subtle, yet indelible, criticisms of the bloody trench-war tactics wielded by Generals who believed in honor through sacrifice. Millions of young lives were sacrificed in useless and ridiculous frontal assaults that benefited only the casket makers.Curzon is a mildly interesting character, consumed with his Generalship and taking only brief moments away from the war. During one such break, he meets his wife-to-be, the daughter of a Duke. His in-law peers are none too happy to have their daughter marrying &quot;beneath her&quot;.Without deeply analyzing Curzon's motives - which appear relatively pure - Forester makes it crystal clear that such social climbing had enormous benefits for one's military career. Curzon is portrayed as an honorable man. But he is not very bright, nor skilled tactically or strategically. He is exceptionally dutiful and is filled with a sense of honor at all cost. It is this belief among the British military leadership that leads to the needless deaths of so many.Curzon learns little during the course of his successful military career. The same tactics are employed over and over again with dismal results.I rate this book nine out of ten. If you haven't read Hornblower, you _must_ read the entire series first. It is not be missed. If you are already a Forester fan, read the _General_ for a completely different perspective on combat and the nature of conflict."},{"Title":"The General","review":"While most of the authors novels were set during the time of Napoleon, some were set at later times including the well known novel, \\"The African Queen,\\" and this lesser known novel, \\"The General,\\" both of which were set during World War I. It has often been said that generals plan tactics based on the last war. Napoleon had developed tactics based on an artillery barrage followed by an attack by infantry and cavalry. The British Army was still trying to use those tactics at the start of World War I, ignoring the change in armaments which included the introduction of machine guns.Herbert Curzon is an officer from the old school, entering World War I in command of a lancer regiment, expecting to charge the enemy on horseback. Command of machine guns had been relegated to a lieutenant \\"who did not sit a horse very well,\\" and most officers did not study the tactics of their use. They did not expect to fight on foot, and did not carry entrenching tools. The machine guns quickly became the most critical part of the battle, and men had to dig in the best they could in the muddy ground.The British were slow to learn new tactics, and still adhered to the tactics developed by Napoleon well into the war. Curzon is given promotions, partly because he survives and impresses the War Office with his reputation for holding his positions, and partly because he marries the daughter of a Duke who has a position in the government. He rapidly rises to Lieutenant General and Corps commander. The novel ends when he is badly wounded trying to rally his men against a German offensive which is breaking the British lines.The novel illustrates the muddle that occurred during the war. Officers had little experience trying to handle the orders necessary for the movement of half a million men, and there was an insufficient number of experienced officers. Reserves were in the wrong place, roads became clogged preventing movement, officers had a fixation on large assaults across torn up ground that their own artillery had rendered impassible. It rained, turning land into swamps where the artillery had destroyed the drainage systems. Changes to tactics were very slow. Observations were by balloons and airplanes instead of cavalry patrols. Tanks were introduced, but too few, and not readily accepted by the generals.Hundreds of thousands of men were lost for little purpose. It is truly amazing that the government did not totally collapse, but they did not have the news media of our present day; and they had almost hysterical patriotism, with young women publicly shaming men who would not volunteer to go to the front.The novel ends halfway through the war, when Curzon is badly wounded.The novel was published in 1936. The forward indicates that it was used as a military manual in some countries."},{"Title":"The General","review":"I read 'the General' shortly after I finished Forester's 'Hornblower' novels and was pleased to find that the same depth and adventure that Forester brought to the British Navy of the 19th century he also brought to the bloody battlefields of WWI Europe. 'The General' lets us into the mind of a British General in the opening months of the war. Forester's protaganist reflects the mindset of those who conducted the war and allowed it to become the bloody mess that history remembers. An Amazing novel."},{"Title":"The General","review":"This is one of C.S. Forester's first novels about war, published in 1936 and hence pre-dating Hornblower.Like almost all the novels which Forester wrote before he created the Hornblower books, this is brilliant, far less well known today than it deserves, and consequently quite rare. The author H.G. Wells described \\"The General\\" as \\"a magnificent piece of work.\\"Some of Forester's other books, particularly those describing battles against opponents of whom he strongly disapproved of such as Hitler's nazis or indeed Napoleon, can come over as patriotic to the point of jingoism or chauvinism. This story does not come into that category and it would not be far from the truth to call it one of the first great anti-war novels.If you collect books about war, and you are fortunate enough to find a copy of \\"The General\\" for sale at a remotely reasonable price, buy it at once.This novel describes the military career of a fictional first world war general. It begins and ends between the wars, with a sharp pen-picture of the retired general Curzon sitting in a bathchair on Bournemouth Promenade, having lost his leg during the great war and never managed to learn to walk properly with an artificial one.Then the story goes back to Curzon's first battle as a subaltern in 1899 during the Boer war, and follows him through to the climax of the book at the battle of St Quentin on March 21st 1918 when the last desperate German offensive nearly snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.Forester appears to have set out to do three things; to entertain, inform, and explain. He entertains with an engaging story; he informs by describing the ghastly conditions and waste of life which was the first world war in the trenches; and he tries to explain one possible answer to the question of how British commanders could possibly have given the orders which sent hundreds of thousands of young men to their deaths.One of the most memorable passages in the book describes the debate as generals and senior staff officers of an army corps prepared a report of why the attack they had just organised had failed and how to succeed next time. \\"In some ways it was like the debate of a group of savages as to how to extract a screw from a piece of wood. Accustomed only to nails, they had made one effort to pull out the screw by main force, and now that it had failed they were devising methods of applying more force still ... they could hardly be blamed for not guessing that by rotating the screw it would come out after the exertion of far less effort\\".But that does not mean that Forester is simply repeating the popular caricature of First World War generals as dangerous idiots. Although he is critical of the mistakes of the generals who wasted so many lives, his criticism is far more sophisticated than the old \\"Lions led by donkeys\\" cliche.Although Curzon, the central figure of this book, is old fashioned and conventional, he is intelligent enough to change his mind when confronted with clear evidence of the need to do so, and decisive enough to enforce that change of mind on others when many men would freeze in panic. Had he been as stupid as some reviewers make out, Curzon would not have survived the first few months of World War 1, let alone been rapidly promoted.He is intelligent enough to realise that his men need to eat and to make sure that they are fed properly, and to make use of officers who understand newfangled things like engineering, railways, or how many men it takes to carry a gas canister. He is ruthless enough to sack staff officers who are not up to the job even when one of them is his wife's cousin.Within minutes of arriving at the front and seeing what artillery and machine-guns can do, Curzon abandons his pre-war attitude of deliberately evading training on how to dig trenches, and instead orders his men to dig for their lives, demanding compliance from junior officers who are afraid that the men might get dirt on their uniforms. \\"God damn it, man!\\" he explodes, \\"Get your men digging, and don't ask damn fool questions.\\"In the first round of battles in the Great War, heroic efforts from Curzon in the face of greatly superior german numbers prevent the British from being flanked and probably defeated at the First Battle of Ypres. Having fought with distinction up to this point, he is promoted to much more senior positions. But then things start to go wrong.Forester makes a great many good points about the need to use the tactics which will win the current battle rather than the last war: indeed, that even the tactics which won earlier battles of the current war should be dropped if they are out of date. But that is not the only message he is trying to put over.The main theme of \\"The General\\" is a World War One version of the Peter Principle. The very qualities which make Curzon successful on the battlefield up to and including the command of a brigade have disastrous consequences for England when he is a Lieutenant-General commanding an army corps, and when both he and all the other senior officers of the army are still displaying the characteristics which colonels and brigadiers need to hold their regiments in the line.Forester states quite explicitly in the book that the very strengths of the World War One generals, not just their weaknesses, were part of the problem. I quote - \\"It might have been ... more advantageous to England if the British Army had not been quite so full of men of high rank who were so ready for responsibility, so unflinchingly devoted to their duty, so unmoved in the face of difficulties, of such unfaltering courage.\\"This book is an unforgettable classic."},{"Title":"The General","review":"Forester's main character, Gen Curzon, is from the old school, where one does not question orders, nor does one make waves. That being said, from a military leadership perspective, if one has a method, even if it doesnt work, it will continued to be used time and time again. Curzon's character is a representation of the level of British generalship in WWI. Unyielding, unimaginative, and willing to toe the line at all costs, with the blood and treasure of England.The story has a humor woven throughout the narrative. It looks at Curzon's social climbing, his promotions (through no fault of his own, and his old school belief system. If it werent for the tradgedy of the hundred of thousands of lives which were expended based on the unimaginative battle techniques, it would be a very humorous story. Unfortunately, the death toll of WWI is a sobering reminder, thanks to Forester, of the repercussions of Generalship as displayed by Curzon.HIghly recommended. An excellent insight into the class structure of the British Army of WWI."},{"Title":"The General","review":"I love C.S. Forester's writing, but this one isn't particularly well-done on his part. He is trying to convey the hubris of the old British Regular Army in WWI, and in a sense he achieves his goal. But the main character is pretty unlovable, and the points Forester sets out to make are done at the end of a sledgehammer. If you're interested in Forester's work, try 'The African Queen' or 'The Gun' and leave this one for Forester aficionados"},{"Title":"The General","review":"This was one of the best books that I've read in a couple of years.

Like I said before I got off track it is very, very, very, very, very, very cool!!"},{"Title":"Change (Animorphs (Quality))","review":"This is a story of a hawk-boy Tobias. The stories till now are simple. There were four kids enjoying their lives when an alien fighter appeared before them. From then their lives changed from normal kids, to destine to save the earth warriors. Previously on Animorphs, this cool, fashion loving mighty warrior princess Xena had a huge problems. Go crocodile, then super large fly, and African elephant which we should appreciate it for wrecking the house. Until, Ax told her that it was fine, only allergy, and solved the problems.This book, the thirteenth, is just one out of many series from 1 to 54, totally original, accompanied by high rates of addictions. This is my favorite book out of all the Animorphs, probably because it's the first one I read, but also, it \\"changes\\". The biggest change happened before is Ax joining their little Yeerk butt kicking and Mr. Ellimist interfering under the table. Now, all those things compared to this is nothing.In this book, Tobias is starting to miss his older life, when breakfast was no more than boxes of corn cereal, not hunting for mouse to eat. The story starts with Tobias hanging out with Rachel taking her to another Yeerk pool's entrance that he found. However, when he tries to go there, he mysteriously heads to a forest where they find a pair of Hork-Bajirs running away from the Yeerk pool and decides to track them down. After some yelling, thinking, ordering, and hurling butts, they find that not all Hork-Bajirs have been enslaved. The next day, they get screwed up by a entire squadron of Yeerk army, composed of Taxxon trackers with ever-lasting hunger, pretty nervous destined to take the earth human-controller, seven-foot walking razor death Hork-Bajir controllers, and finally, Andlite hosted Visser three. The Animorphs are trapped in a forest, inside a tight U shaped fire with Yeerks staying ready at the gaps. Here is where Mr. Ellimist interferes again by giving Tobias morphing powers, not making him human again. You see, just a few chapters before, Tobias asked to get paid by his services by the Ellimist who made Tobias to be in a place where he didn't wanted to be. Thus, dragged him into a stupid mess with these two Hork-Bajirs, both free and named Jara Hamee and Ket Halpak. After escaping very close death, Tobias and his fellow Animorphs prepare a play for the Yeerks to think that this \\"rebelled\\" Hork-Bajirs are dead, and the Yeerks fell for it. Their plan was simple. Throw Jara Hamee and Ket Halpak down the ravine and make them look like they are dead, Marco, hide and catch Rachel and Tobias in Hork-Bajir morph. Cassie and Jake, pretend to be wolves devouring the \\"dead\\" Hork-Bajirs. Next they went to a valley which Ellimist created and Jara Hamee with Ket Halpak, lived happily ever after till this book.Before \\"the\\" end, I said that the book's title and its story are the same. It is a CHANGE. In addition, there is one more change left. Tobias receiving his human DNA and having a happy ending. Overall, I think it is a great book, and everyone reading my comment should see it."},{"Title":"Change (Animorphs (Quality))","review":"My favorite charcter is Tobias, and that is why this is my favorite Animorphs book.

Tobias and Marco are my fav characters, Tobias because of all the stuff he's been though, and his family doesn't want him, and you automatically think ahhhh, and Marco just coz he's the humourous relief and all that! In this book (and I can't remember it too well since I haven't read it for agggges) Tobias regains his morphing powers. Just when your thinking, 'O.K, so he can morph, but he can never be truly human can he, the poor soul' he has a dream, and he sees him self. Somehow (and I, as I'm sure many others are, that the Ellimist had SOMETHING to do with it) he manages to aquire himself, so that he can morph his former body. At the end, the most touching part of the in my opinion, he goes to an award ceremony that Rachel tried not to let him know about, as she thought he couldn't go. He surprises her there, and I can't think of anyone who could read that part and not think..ahhhh. As a girl i realise that some people might not like this as much, as it doesn't have many battles, but it's so sweet and lovely that I find it wonderful. Also, as a girl I am fasinated by the relationship between Rachel and Tobias, and think the final gesture of this book is inspiring.

He was always a great character .In this book Tobias is given a wish by the Elemist. He thought the Elimist would make him human again. Instead the Elimist gave him his morphing power back, making him a full member of the team once more. By the end Tobias finally accepts that the Elimist did indeed give him what he wanted. Accepts what he has become and admits how much he loves it, that he doesn't want to be human again. He can morph his human body when he wants to be human for a little while, and he still gets to spend most of his time as a Hawk. He lives free of society and at one with nature.Also this book shows what the Hork Bajir really are. How without the Yeerks they are harmless and lovable. Also it furthers the Elimist as a Character.

The quality of Applegate's wrting seems to be getting better with each book. I have read each of the books in her series and I can say in all honesty that I believe the Animorphs will be one of the most popular series ever done. I am a twenty seven year old college student and I know I should feel funny about reading and writing about the Animorphs. But to tell the truth I don't, because Applegate's writing is so good that she does the one thing any writer should do,that is to take the reader out of their life and tempoarly let them into a fictional world where anything can happen.And in this case does happen. Keep up the good work Ms. Applegate. And 'til Visser Three wins the war, LONG LIVE THE ANIMORPHS."},{"Title":"Change (Animorphs (Quality))","review":"Oh, yes, this is definetly the best one.

What Tobias wants is to be human again, but keep his morphing power. Will the Elimist cheat Tobias? Read the book!"},{"Title":"Change (Animorphs (Quality))","review":"I've been reviewing all of the Animorphs as I reread them (and filled a few holes in my collection via Amazon) so if anyone is actually interested in other reviews, you'll find me there. Being this is a book in a series, you'll need to read Animorphs #1: The Invasion to get all the details of who these characters are, why they're doing what they are, and how they \\"morph.\\" However, like all the other books of the series, there's a general outline at the start of the book to condense events so the reader isn't utterly lost on what's going on. There's enough written in paraphrase to where you can start with any of the books, and reading the others isn't critical (but is helpful.) Since there isn't already a synapsis on this one, I'll begin there.The Change is narrated by Tobias, one of the five humans who have the power to become any animal they touch, and one alien who was a survivor from a crashed spaceship. They, alone, are the resistence force for earth to halt a race of slug like creatures called Yeerks from taking over the bodies of billions of humans, then destroying what's left of the planet. Tobias is a boy who is trapped in the body of a red tail hawk, so different from the others in that respect. Why is covered in the short form at the start of the book, or full form in The Invasion. He spends his days either hunting for rodents or when full, has a lot of time to follow known Controllers (people who have a Yeerk living in their brain which completely controls the host body.)When Tobias invites his fellow friend and Animorph, Rachel, out for a flight to look at some entrances to the Yeerk pool he's found (again, see earlier books in the series for the Yeerk pool), they find themselves flying in completely the wrong area, as if Tobias was lost. Although this bothers him, because he can't imagine how he lost his sense of direction, all thoughts turn to something else when they witness a pair of Hork-Bajir fleeing for their lives from other Controllers. To date, all the Hork-Bajir have been enslaved, so why they're being chased is a puzzle at first. The once gentle species was entirely enslaved because of their great physical strength and cutting blades covering their arms, legs, heads, and tails. As Marco put it \\"walking salad shooters.\\" The realization strikes the characters that somehow these two Hork-Bajir might actually be free of the Yeerks which were inside their minds, and they rush to the rescue.Unfortunately, saving and keeping two free Hork-Bajir from recapture is a grueling task. The Yeerks are willing to stop at nothing to get them back, throwing Taaxons (a giant centipede race with a nasty habit of devouring even their own kind, along with anything else), humans with Dracon beams, humans with ordinary guns, helicopters, vehicles, and Hork-Bajir controllers at them. Tobias brings in the rest of the group to help, and throughout the story, he finds himself places he didn't intend to be or has visions which help him along. Angry at being used, Tobias finally plants his talons and won't carry on until the person/creature who is using him reveals himself. The Ellimist proves to be behind it, and says he'll grant Tobias' greatest wish if he'll continue the mission. He would have done it, anyway, but now he hopes to be human again, giving him even more reason to carry on. Working with the Animorphs, he has to try and find a safe haven for the two peaceful, sweet, and somewhat dull witted aliens. I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't read the book, but as always, the story keeps itself together well. It has more action in it than the last book, being closer to Megamorphs #1: The Andalite's Gift in that regard. The ending is also well thought out.This area is what I call my \\"older than thou\\" part of the review because I'm way over the normal age group these are written for. So why exactly do I write these reviews? Because I think it's a good idea to have a synapsis up if there isn't one, yet, and also to give a very different insight if adults are looking into what their kids read, looking for a gift, etc. (Much like the last book, there aren't any strong, underlying themes to this story (as there have been in others.) Tobias is, in many ways, the inner strength of the group, not letting self pity take control over him in spite of the tremendous amount of loss he's had to deal with. To use an old phrase, \\"when the going gets tough, Tobias keeps going.\\" The character has to question himself in several places when the Ellimist keeps his \\"promise,\\" and in doing so, has to do even more growing up mentally and emotionally. He asks himself if this was what he really wanted, and had he been tricked? The reader is left to decide that on their own, but the very ending paragraphs will tend to leave the reader with a smile. Overall, this is one has a lot of action, near escapes, and \\"grip the edge of your seat\\" scenes in it. Some of the books in the series get more introspective, others focus mainly just on a good, flowing story, and still others have more action than normal. Although this is a well written novel with a very good flow beginning to end, its one of the more action oriented ones, in my opinion. This is a good one if you want to skip books like The Secret where the reader is left to ponder age old questions which don't have answers (yet they will always still be asked by the human race) in favor of some hard hitting scenes of fugitives on the run and trying to beat all the odds which are against them. This is also a very important one to read for some of the future books in the series."},{"Title":"Change (Animorphs (Quality))","review":"Tobias gets used to his life.

It gives a great insight into what the term RELIGION means with context to INDIA. From a novice to the scholar (of Hinduism or Comparative Religion) - all will read this book with rapt attention from cover to cover. This book is actually a compilation of the discourses on the GOSPEL OF SRI RAMAKRISHNA delivered by the author. However, it is enriched by the references to various religious texts and their relevance when viewed in the light of the teachings of a modern saint as SRI RAMAKRISHNA, a Hindu saint from India (1836 - 1886).The author was a monastic who lived a life based on the principles of Practical Vedanta and was a living example of a person who had attained the highest spiritual knowledge. His other writings on the Upanishads and the series of editorials he wrote for the Bulletin of The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture is a treasure-trove for the student of VEDANTA, HINDUISM or COMPARATIVE RELIGION."},{"Title":"I con if you condom: The ins & outs of contraception (Smart sex stuff for kids)","review":"21 x 28 cm (approx A4 size), 27 single-sided pages, text only (no pictures or illustrations).I was quite disappointed with this book, especially for its price. Its 27 pages contain just text that has come from someone's laser printer, complete with a few typos and formatting problems. Ok, the reproduction of those laser printouts is high; I have no complaint with the quality of the reproduction. But it contains no illustrations or pictures of any sort, although the front and back covers are colorful and cheery (although irrelevant to the subject matter).The actual text of the book is noticably straight-forward and open, more so than other straight-forward and open books. I like the way that it makes it clear upfront that there are two objectives of contraception, to prevent (1) pregnancy, and (2) disease. The remainder of the book generally discusses prevention of pregnancy only, though; discussing the various types of contraceptives.The content of the text is very well written, but the text doesn't deserve to be sold alone, unillustrated, at such a high price. The title of this book is a bit misleading too; it's not specifically about the condom, but rather about contraceptives generally. Discussion about condoms takes up two pages of the text."},{"Title":"Historic India (Great Ages of Man)","review":"Part of Time-Life's Great Ages of Man series, this book explores the history of India through pictures, essays and short but interesting historical notes. India is a vast country, one of the oldest continuous civilizations in human history, the birth place of no less than four world religions, and home to hundreds of languages. Obviously theres only so much that a small book like this can cover, but it does a wonderful job as an introduction to India's cultural achievements, particularly for a casual reader. And the pictures (including various Mughal minatures, works of architecture, and depictions of Hindu and Buddhist deities) and side bars are particularly worth note.In terms of content, this book starts with the Harappan and Mohenjodaro civilizations of the Inuds, supposing that they were the product of the Dravidian peoples, who were gradually pushed south by Aryan invaders from Iran or Central Asia. From there, we get an introduction to the Vedic era and flowering of language and culture in that period, the roots of the Hindu faith, the birth of Buddhism, King Asoka and the Mauryan Empire, Alexander the Great's invasion of the Subcontinent, the Gupta and Chola dynasties, and so forth. An entire chapter explores Hinduism (including mention of the Mahabharata and Ramayana epics), while another explores the caste system, and theres a brief list of important Hindu deities in the appendix. The final chapter explores the Muslim Mughals, who ruled India until the invasion of the Portuguese and British, complete with infromation on their coutr culture, and some Mughal paintings from the story of Akbar the Great.All in all, its a very informative and beautifully illustrated book, particualrly if you have no real background on South Asian history. It is, however, rather dated so parts of the book may be slightly inaccurate or controversial (like the Ayran invasion hypothesis). Still, considering India's rich cultural heritage, it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Dog Health & Nutrition For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I bought this for my dad and he was very happy with it after I explained that I wasn't calling him a dummy!"},{"Title":"Dog Health & Nutrition For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I reserached a while into various bokos on dog nurtriotn and health. the options I found were limitintg: one can purchase books for alrge sums on money giving me all kinds on information about rare diseases and symptoms or the opposite, very light and uncritical. this book is in the middle.

In addition, the author is highly credible in her field -- she is an expert in canine sports medicine and is a full professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She teaches medical and veterinary students. She has her DVM and Ph.D. Honestly, you can't get much more credible than that!The book is not extremist in approach; rather it presents sensible questions about just what is in manufactured dog food, and how do we know it. It then rounds out the picture by presenting alternative diets (home-cooked food) but presents drawbacks there and how to correct them. It addresses supplements as well.While other topics are also presented beside nutrition (helping your dog age gracefully, training, etc.), I bought it mainly for its nutritional content, and I was not disappointed. The book cites research on nutrition from very credible institutions (Tufts University Veterinary School, as well as others). In addition, if you prefer to cook for your dog, it tells you how and where to send your food so you can find out if your are presenting a balanced meal. It offers other helpful hints as well.The book is very well written, mainly in active voice, and on a level the layman can understand.

Luckily the bulk of the book covers these issues (the nutrition section is very small), and that makes this book a worth while purchase. one of the most useful things is a list of things that is included is a list of what to have in a pet first aid kit.overall I'm only giving the book 3/5 stars because I feel that a book titled \\"health and nutrition\\" should thoroughly cover nutrition and this book just doesn't cut it.

The author does not &quot;dumb down&quot; any of her information or presentation and presents everything in a clear, informative manner.The content is very broad and covers just about anything you might need to know about health and nutrition including structure, drugs, parasites, first aid, holistic/alternative therapies, and many more. The author even presents issues such as the hotly debated food issue with a relatively fair and balanced approach. Although she does take a side, she presents the postives and negatives of each side and lets the reader know that there are various schools of thought out there should s/he choose to research further.The book is attractively laid out with pictures, diagrams, charts, and cute little markers in the margin denoting things such as a &quot;tip&quot;, &quot;warning&quot;, &quot;technical stuff&quot;, etc. It is an easy read that you are sure to pick up some new information from, regardless of your current knowledge about dogs.

That theory would contradict this whole book. It would contradict the basic principles of The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. Their aim is not to inform you on their controlling actions in our society but to use scientific methods that are well known to work in discreetly \\"brainwashing\\" the public.The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was created in 1921 at Oxford by The Royal Institute for International Affairs and later funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. It is the core for mass indoctrination and global manipulation. From Wars to the media, it has effected it all.This book has 35 short but detailed chapters. Some of which are:1. Founding The Worlds Premier Brainwashing Institute3. How \\"Times\\" Were made to Change4. Social Engineering and the Social Scientists5. Do we have what H.G. Wells called an \\"Invisible government?\\"7. The Making Of Public Opinion8. Degrading Women and the decline of Moral Standards11. The Paradigm shift in education12.

Exposing the upper level parallel secret government35. The Music industry, Mind Control, Propaganda and WarThe back cover reads:\\"The Tavistock Institute for Human Relations has had a profound effect on the moral, spiritual, cultural, political and economic policies of the United States and Great Britain. It has been in the front line of the attack on the U.S. Constitution and State constitutions. No group did more to propagandize the U.S to participate in the WWI at a time when the majority of the American people were opposed to it.\\"Much of the same tactics were used by the Social Science scientists at Tavistock to get the US into WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Serbia and both wars in Iraq. Tavistock began as a propaganda creating and disseminating organization at Wellington House in London in the run-up to WWI, what Toynbee called \\"that black hole of disinformation.\\" On another occasion Toynbee called Wellington House \\"a lie factory.\\" From a somewhat crude beginning, Wellington House evolved into the Tavistock Institute and went on to shape the destiny of Germany, Russia, Britain and the United States in a highly controversial manner. The people of these nations were unaware that they were being \\"brainwashed.\\" The origin of \\"mind control,\\" \\"inner directional conditioning\\" and mass \\"brainwashing\\" is explained in an easy to understand book written with great authority.\\"The fall of dynasties, the Bolshevik Revolution, WWI and WWII saw the destruction of old alliances and boundaries, the convulsions in religion, morals, family life, economic and political conduct, decadence in music and art can all be traced back to mass brainwashing practiced by the Tavistock Institute.....\\"Overall this book is easy to follow with history that one must certainly know.

The author makes a great job to put every historical event into place so we are never lost in the lecture.With names, dates, places and huge amount of details every single chapter is carefully explained giving one of the most impressive historical book ever written.Dr.Coleman made and exhaustive research of hidden and almost impossible to get documents and manifestos made by the Tavistock Institute or prior name \\"Wellington House\\" that contain all sorts of conspiracies and atrocious acts against the United States people and also the world in order to make their final goal come true: The complete domination of the world and the slavery of every living person on Earth.This book is divided into 36 different topics about how Tavistock has damaged progressively our moral, social, educational and ethical standars. This book is also so easy to read that anybody will understand everything because the Dr.Coleman wants that... to make everybody aware of what is going on in this actual world full of chaos. So don't worry if you are not an avid historical reader because after you finish reading this book the only thing left will be wondering why you didn't read it before.I also recommend to read to anyone really concerned and worry about the true facts of why our society is at the brink of collapse: The committee of 300 also from the the same author Dr.Coleman, Worldwide Misery-the legacy of the 13 satanic bloodlines by Robin de Ruiter and Salvador Borrego E. bibliography.Of course, this kind of books will turn on your brains only if you are up to make a change into yourself and spread the word so we can make the whole society a better place to live once again.

Dr. Colemans work has critically analyzed and identified the culprits of social metamorphisis, the so called gods of this world. And what they crave more than anything else in the known universe is absolute power and control of mans thoughts and feelings. This literary piece explains how they, the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, manages public opinion on a global scale daily, through manufacturing artificial emotions by means of mass manipulation in an effort to instill propoganda within the minds of the masses. If anything at all, the reader should at least raise his awareness, and desire to seek more information concerning the workings of the elite: their organizations, and the achievements made in the past by successful methods of mind control and public disinformation."},{"Title":"The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations: Shaping the Moral, Spiritual, Cultural, and Political","review":"Their must be something mysterious about this book.

It really did not tell me much that I already didn't know, but then I have been researching this subject since 1976. If you are newer to this subject then it will probably suprise you to learn some of the information detailed, and if that is the case, then I would recommend it. It seemed to repeat much of the same thing over and over with some new added tidbits woven in. I have a collection of these type of books so it will fit in well with my others. Now as for the customer service this seller deserve 5 stars! This book arrived about a month after I placed my order. I just assumed it was on back order. When it finally arrived there was a hand written appology inside that stated the delay was caused by their shipping mistake. They had sent it to the wrong address. To compensate for the delay the seller included 4 DVD's on mind control and public persuasion by the powers that be. I thought that was very generous so & I would absolutely order from this seller again.

They had flourished and progressed just as long as these civilizations remained under the control of the Anglo-Saxon Nordic Alpine, Germanic races. The unsurpassed beauty of their literature, art, their classics, spiritual and moral advancement of the female sex with a very large corresponding degree of protection, was what distinguished Western and Classic civilizations from others.\\"If this point of view is what motivates you to continue breathing then good luck to you.

A serial killer is on the loose. A female FBI agent, in training, that seems to be able to communicate with a sociopath who can help solve the case is called in to help. The killer kidnaps a new victim and the clock starts again. While Red Dragon first introduces Hannibal Lecter this book shows us who he is. The character development is excellent and the writing is good. I have no complaints."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"In Thomas Harris's Silence of the Lambs, he truly characterizes what a horror story is. His creation of horror: Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter is a former psychologist who has turned into a man eating mind manipulating criminal. After eating 9 people, he is finally caught and put in jail. Harris has put this villain and its counterpart Clarice Starling, a FBI hopeful, into a story with nonstop suspense and action. Not only does it involve the horrifying and deceptive Hannibal Lecter but also the murderous Buffalo Bill. Bill is a nationwide known killer who terrifies any woman of being killed and then skinned. Clarice and other FBI agents are responsible to find Buffalo Bill and the only way to get information about him is through Dr. Lecter. This book is for anyone that likes thrillers that never have a boring situation or scene. The book is a classic, a masterpiece I truly will cherish for the rest of my years."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The main reason I ordered this particular edition was because of the picture. Unfortunately, the picture does not match the picture of the product I got. Instead, I received a hardcover mass market with the same picture as the paperback mass market.

But be warned, if you order this book and expect it to match the picture, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book is one of my favorite books. Harris does a great job with it. Clarice Starling does not take no for an answer in this gritty suspenseful novel!!! Hannibal Lector is one of America's most popular villans thanks to this book. That could not have been possible without Harris's portrayl of the character. The killer in this book is also entertaining. I loved the scene with the dog in the hole!

What I've read so far is great, I just can't believe how cool Harris wrote this book, I can't wait to read &quot;Hannibal.&quot; So far, I've read that that the movie varied a little bit from the book, because in this book Clarice never tracked down a Ms. Moffet. But she was trying to find Benjamin Raspail. But when she found his head in a jar in some old garage full of Lecter's things, then she knew she couldn't find him. So then she goes back to Lecter and asks him who killed Raspail. To my surprise, Lecter had no clue. All he did was shrug and say, &quot;who can tell?&quot; So I guess the hunt was on again and Clarice was no closer to finding Jame &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Gumb. This book almost followed the movie exactly, except there were some things different. Like there were some parts in the book that were not in the movie, etc. Harris does have a way with words in this very scary nevel. Read it and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The only problem there is with this book is being able to put it down. Thomas Harris is truly a very gifted writer who is able, without any difficulty, to bring to life the ravaging effects a serial killer has upon his audience. The dialogue is crisp, believable and well written, the plot is of course fantastic, and the nice thing is if one has seen the movie, reading the book after spoils nothing. The Hannibal Lector, truly the real star of this book, lives up to the images we've already conjured in our minds, a truly terrifying and very unsettling character, believable in every act. The same holds true for every character in this novel from Jame Gumb to Clarice Starling. Needless to say there is a good reason this novel is rated so highly and there is no reason to believe otherwise."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Thomas Harris has solidified himself as one of the top storytellers out there. Wonderful character development, perfect pacing, brief yet comprehensive description.This is my first Thomas Harris novel and it wont be the last. The novel drew me in from the first page and held me up to completion. The main characters all had multi-layers and were developed so well that I felt I could anticipate their next moves and still find myself enthralled.The story revolves around a serial killer at large, Buffalo Bill, who murders then skins his young female victims. Clarice Starling, the fresh FBI trainee is picked by the head of behavioral science, Jack Crawford, to gather information from an incarcerated serial killer, Hannibal Lecter. The goal being that Hannibal can get inside Bill's head and help the FBI profile him better and ultimately catch him.Buffalo Bill abducts a senator's daughter which adds varying degrees of pressure to the investigation and takes us on a ride which Thomas Harris pilots brilliantly.As I mentioned, the pacing is perfect. There are no \\"wait a minute\\" moments where we try to figure out how we got where we are and who this person is.I'd already seen the movie when I came to read the book and now I wish I hadn't. The book then the movie would have been better in my mind. Nevertheless, if you have seen the movie, don't let that deter you from reading the book as the movie did the book justice but the book is far more engrossing.Very well written book with not one, that I could find, spelling or grammatical error. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"clarice starling is an easy character to connect with. you can feel the terror. the suspense. as she talks with hanibal lecter. you feel like you are staring into the abyss too"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book is terrific and I loved every moment of it.

I still read this book like it was fresh. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Great quality, and well read audio book. The Silence of the Lambs story is perhaps the best thriller/horror story out there."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Even though I still have not seen the film, I thought I'd explore Harris' world when I discovered a paperback very cheap at a local book swap. Though the book is marketed as all about Hannibal Lecter \\"the ultimate villain,\\" it's really about the minds of criminals and the people who wish to stop them.It's interesting that each side is set in pairs -- the criminal side and the justice side of the equation.At one end of the spectrum we have Clarice Starling, an FBI agent who is learning the ropes. I mean, she hasn't even finished school yet! She runs into prejudice all the time -- \\"how long have you been at the FBI Ms. Starling?\\" to which she quickly changes the subject. Her mentor and confidant Jack Crawford is in his own world. Struggling with his wife's terminal illness, he yet makes an effort to teach Starling the ropes -- and an ulterior motive to use her to get into Lecter's mind -- the only man who may have the clue to find Buffalo Bill -- the mad serial killer who is skinning women and leaving them floating in rivers.The other end of the spectrum is Dr. Lecter, an expert of the mind and behavior, but also rather insane -- he literally will bite the hands that feeds him! His sense of smell is startling. His ability to see deep into Starling's core is also a bit unsettling -- for Starling as well as the reader! Lecter's pair is Buffalo Bill himself whom we meet as he prepares to skin a senator's daughter!Will Clarice find the killer in time, despite the arrogance of bureaucrats and the curtains everyone of the characters seems to hide behind? And is she willing to give up a bit of herself to Lecter in return for some information?**Spoiler - Fascinating pace of story, especially at the climax when she actually meets the killer and has no idea who this guy is -- but then does and man, you can't turn the page fast enough! ** End SpoilerI am mighty impressed with Thomas Harris bit of crime fiction here. I may pick up his earlier work, Red Dragon [Red Dragon.Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I resisted reading the book because I was such a fan of the film. The book is fabulous, even lyrical at times. The psychology in it is masterful, and there's an ongoing dialectical dialogue on the meaning of evil. In this day-and-age, we're willing to look at what made an individual do what he did--bad childhoods or hate-crime-loving fathers, for instance. Harris doesn't come up with an answer, but the question is certainly interesting."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I'm not sure that I can add very much to the hundreds of glowing reviews already posted on Amazon, but I can certainly try. I first read SOTL in high school, and picked it up again recently, rereading it for the first time in 15 years. The book certainly has not lost its magic. SOTL is a scary, fast-paced read and if you are like me, you will find yourself closing the blinds and double-checking to make sure that your door is locked. If you liked the movie version of the book, you will surely love the book itself; characters are much more fleshed out, and there are some good exchanges that are missing from the novel. There are several references to Red Dragon, the most excellent book that came before SOTL, but one does not have to have read Red Dragon in order to fully understand the plot of SOTL.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed the movie, or anyone who enjoys a really, dark clever thriller."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"There are passages in this book that are more haunting and more beautiful than anything that I have ever read in a book of this genre. You simply cannot read this book one time to truly enjoy the nuances and power of Mr. Harris' words.As anyone who has seen the movie well knows, FBI investigator Clarince Starling moves closer to a heinous serious killer via a trail of veiled clues proffered by the brilliant, horrific and locked up Hannibal Lector, who becomes her mentor and tormentor all at one time.There is one particular passage - when Starling travels to the home of the first victim - that rates as the most compelling 10 pages of crime fiction I have ever read. The first victim has been dead nine months, and police have long since given up looking for further clues in her hometown. It is the ultimate cold crime scene. What Starling discovers just by spending 10 minutes in her bedroom is an amazing testatment to Mr. Harris' understanding of the female insight and explains very well why he chose a woman as the central character in the book.I have had several people tell me they would not read this book because they have already seen the movie. That would be a mistake. There has simply never been a better crime novel written."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I have read The Silence of the Lambs five times and it is one of my favorite books. This story allows you to journey inside the mind of a serial killer. I was very interested with the way that one serial killer is the key to the capture of another serial killer. The Silence of the Lambs is a horror classic and it will remain an erie thought in the minds of its readers."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Look, I'm kind of getting fed up with all the people who complain about the lack of detail about Buffalo Bill in this book. The focus of the novel is NOT on him or on trying to hunt a serial killer. The focus is on Clarice trying to correct horrors from her past."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Having seen &amp; loved the movie (especially Sir Anthony Hopkins), I was afraid to read the book &amp; didn't for years. Wow, I'm glad I did. First, it validates the movie in that it truly was a brilliant film because it was so faithful to the book &amp; so wonderfully well cast. But the book is better. I am a highly critical reader, &amp; I find not a flaw in this diamond. It's believable; Harris isn't afraid to make Lecter likeable; every single character is strong, even the dog; the research is obviously excellent; there isn't a bad patch in the book; and, on top of all this, it's written with such wonderful economy--I visualize the scenes powerfully, yet this is achieved in just a few sentences each time. It's 367 pages, &amp; that just doesn't seem enough space to make it work, but Harris pulls it off wonderfully. This is just an outstanding, tight, powerful, page-turning, insightful, brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I'm assuming that anyone interested in this book has already seen the movie and read Red Dragon. Comparisons between the novel and the movie are inevitable. I shall give in to my nature and make them ... The differences between the book and the movie stem from three sources: Continuity with Red Dragon, additional storylines, and modified scenes. The most visible modified scenes in the movie are the infamous Goodbye Horses sequence and the finale. Goodbye Horses was drawn from two things: Dolarhyde's home movie in Dragon, and Gumb's &quot;Cash For Your Trash&quot; sequence in this book. The change doesn't hurt the story, unless you really like Q. Lazarus. The change in the ending is the result of both rewriting and continuity of Lecter's character from the previous book. Don't worry ... the Funny Quip (TM) is gone, replaced with something else possessing incredible sexual charge. (Or maybe that was just me ;) There's other minor changes: Several species of moths instead of one, Precious is developed more (I'm not kidding), and the death of Mrs. Crawford, which appears to try to set a mood of malaise but fails.Instead of the tortured Francis Dolarhyde, we are given several people who are evil because they choose to be evil. That's certainly refreshing; while some serial killers were abused as children, some have simply gone flip-city. Moreover, there are several kinds of evil. Psychopathic, sociopathic, and some self-serving idiots who really need a come-uppance in the next book.There's not as much gruesomeness as Red Dragon. Always the possibility of something terrible happening, but it rarely does. On that note, I always wonder at people who complain about the film being too violent, or gruesome, for them to watch. People have been desensitized to the violence of the gun, or the bomb, but when violence is committed with teeth....The storyline is quite cohesive, and the characters consistent. A previous reviewer complained that Clarice wouldn't have entered the basement without calling for backup. The reasons were given in the book: She hadn't been issued a cell phone, she didn't know where Gumb's phone was, and the profile had indicated that Gumb would immediately kill Catherine if confronted by officers."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I enjoyed this book greatly. I feel that it was better then the predecessor to this book, 'The red dragon'. In this novel I had far more contempt for the 'serial killer' involved than in 'red dragon'. I felt that I could understand the forces that turned Francis Dolarhyde into 'The Red Dragon' but could not understand what made Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb so evil. Because I did not understand Jame Gumb it made him seem more frightening and more evil. In my oppinion that made 'Silence of the Lambs' a scarier and more enthralling book. As a character I liked Clarice Starling and found her more interesting than the main characters in the previous book. Haniibal Lecter is a very interesting character, the way in which he gradually led Clarice Starling to the identity of 'Buffalo Bill' was very clever, yet full of his very own brand of evil.I thought this was an excellent book, it was very easy to read and understand, and the storyline was very cleverly constructed. The characters were well thought out and the ending left me wondering what would now the 'Buffalo Bill' case was closed.I would recommend this book to any adult reader, especially to anyone who likes to read horror titles.I would recommend that you read this book after having read 'Red Dragon', and then afterwards read 'Hannibal'. These books are now a trilogy and I feel that reading all three would be a good reading experience.I will no doubt be reading the third 'Hannibal Lecter' book ,'Hannibal', within the next few months. I am sure I will enjoy that too."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This is the best book I've ever read and will probably ever read. It is the psychological thriller genre at its best. The book was fabulous and the ending was the best ever."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read this book a few years back way before the movie came out. My cousin convinced me to read it, and let me tell you it is one book that I will never regret reading. As a matter of fact, I've read it more than once.After I finished the book, my cousin and I thought that it would make a great movie, and we went over the characters and tried to figure out who would be best playing each part. We came up with Jodie Foster, but I can't remember who else we thought would play the parts of the other characters. When it actually was made into a movie, my cousin and I were first in line at the theater on opening night.The book was extremely descriptive, I felt like I was right there with Clarice and Hannibal. It is very rare that you find a movie that is almost identical to the book and both are excellent. This book falls into that category.

Really exciting..just buy this book NOW!!!!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"AWESOME!I'm 11 and it is one of the best books I've read!!!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Thomas Harris's \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" a bone-chilling thriller, was an immediate hit upon its 1988 publication. Now, nearly twenty years later, most of us inevitably approach, or reapproach, it knowing something about it; with the famous movie based on it firmly in mind. Yet, I, at least, had to fight off the temptation to stay up all night to finish it, although I surely knew where it was going.Harris, to be sure, writes a great, tense story of suspense. He'd already published \\"Black Sunday,\\" and \\"The Red Dragon--\\" where we were first introduced to Dr. Hannibal Lector. \\"Lamb's\\" plot concerns the efforts of the Federal Bureau of Investigations to catch a serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill. The agency sends trainee Clarice Starling to interview Dr. Hannibal Lector, former psychiatrist, imprisoned in a Baltimore insane asuylum, after having been found guilty of nine sadistic, cannibalistic murders. Lector has unusual tastes, and intense curiosity about the darker side of the mind. The formerly eminent medical man's understanding of himself, Starling, and the killer forms the core of the book.\\"Lambs\\" benefits from a complex, multi-layered plot. As it proceeds, we realize that Lector knew all along where it had to lead. The author's timing is impeccable: he hits his high notes, then gives us a moment to unwind. We hardly dare breathe during the Lector/Starling Tennessee scenes -- we're waiting with dread for what we know will come; when it does, it's overwhelming. The plot's also titillating, let's be honest about it, sex change operations and all. Furthermore, serial killers were new to us then; the genre is still remarkably popular, judging by the countless rip-offs of it since. Finally, a lot of the story deals with gruesome material, but the forensics are still fresh, and it's always leavened by the author's black humor.Harris created two of the most memorable characters in modern fiction in Lector and Starling. The author has an acute ear for dialogue: who doesn't believe the Lector/Starling duets? At another point, Harris has Barney, sole knowledgeable orderly in the mental hospital where Lector has been held, say to Starling,\\" Listen, when you get Buffalo Bill -- don't bring him to me just because I got a vacancy, all right?\\"The writer's eye and ear serve him well. He describes a character's car as \\"a black Buick with a De Paul University sticker on the back window. His weight gave the Buick a slight list to the left.\\" He describes Clarice's thoughts: \\"Sometimes Crawford's (her boss's) tone reminded Starling of the know-it-all caterpillar in Lewis Carroll.\\" Early in the book, he has Starling driving back to FBI headquarters at Quantico, \\"back to Behavioral Sciences, with its homey brown-checked curtains and its gray files full of hell. She sat there into the evening, after the last secretary had left, cranking through the Lector microfilm. The contrary old viewer glowed like a jack-o'-lantern in the darkened room....\\" Sorry, but ya just gotta read the book to get this stuff."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Clarice Starling is a young woman who is working her way through the FBI academy. She also is a trained and certified psychological counselor. When no one else can get the psychotic murderer Hannibal Lecter to submit to answering a questionnaire for research purposes, the FBI sends Clarice in. Lecter takes a liking to her, and is even willing to share information with her that he has not shared with anyone else. Clarice is soon caught up in chasing another serial killer who has recently kidnapped a senator's daughter. Will they catch him before he kills her? Does Hannibal \\"the cannibal\\" Lecter know who the killer is, and will he tell Clarice before it's too late?I liked the character of Hannibal. He was really smart and crafty, and totally creepy. Some of the violence was too graphic and gory for my taste, but I suppose that's to be expected in a book about serial killers."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I imagine some people read this book because they were looking for a weekend of thriller escapism and they spotted the mass market paperback on the \\"impulse buy\\" shelf at the supermarket.I imagine other people read this book because, as they sipped their Chai and scanned the shelves of their favorite bookstore, they spotted the trade paperback and thought it might provide a thoughtful story whose engrossing issues would promote earnest contemplation.The beauty of The Silence of the Lambs is that it rewards both kinds of readers. This book offers plenty of suspense through its well-constructed characters and engaging plot, at the same time providing an unexpected level of depth and subtlety in its exploration of human nature.This is the book that will either ruin or reinvent the thriller genre because it will entirely transform the expectations of readers."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The term &quot;horror&quot; is often misused today when applied to literature or film. It connotes an image of spilt blood, slashing knives, masked figures, and nubile teenager girl with underdeveloped bodies and personalities. If I asked someone to name a horror author, I'm sure Stephen King would come to mind, although King's books haven't scared me in a long time, full of the same sort of characteristics I've just described.But to me, horror is much more than flesh and blood. Like H.P. Lovecraft who argued that horror came from within, I believe that it is actually a sense, an emotion so deep within us that when exposed to genuine terror (as opposed to slick, Hollywood produced images) we feel our hearts quicken and our muscles tighten in anticipation of response. Fight or flight. The terror compounds when we are faced with human monsters, rather than the supernatural, the ones that lurk in our neighborhoods, in our homes, or in our hearts.Thomas Harris' The Silence of the Lambs is an excellent example of true horror. Originally published in 1988, adapted to film in 1991, and reissued in a lovely trade paperback edition for the tenth anniversary last fall, the novel is actually a sequel of sorts to an earlier Harris novel, Red Dragon, which was also adapted into film (&quot;Manhunter,&quot; 1986) yet not as successful as its sequel. Perhaps this was due in part to the relatively unknown cast, although still an excellent gathering of fine actors. Lambs had Glen Campbell, Jodi Foster, and Anthony Hopkins, the latter two also won international acclaim for their portrayals. The film generated an enormous response, and even influenced this reviewer to create a character modeled heavily on Foster's portrayal of FBI Academy trainee, Clarice Starling.In Lambs, Clarice Starling is a cadet enlisted by Jack Crawford (played by Campbell, heavily based on real-life profiled, John Douglas) to interview Lector in connection with an open case file on a serial killer nicknamed &quot;Buffalo Bill.&quot; Bill, it seems, has been kidnapping women, holding them for some time, then killing and skinning them for some unknown purpose. His methods and locale vary, but there is one similar characteristic among the victims: they are all large-framed and young. The FBI cannot determine a pattern in his behavior, however, so they hope a questionnaire applied to known and detained serial killers will help in developing a profile on Bill.And so, Clarice is sent to interview Hannibal Lector, a former psychiatrist who devoured parts of his victims, occasionally serving them in gourmet meals -- without telling, of course -- to party guests. An intelligent, perceptive, and attractive trainee with a severed past, meager finances, and a very strong desire to advance in the Bureau, Clarice is anxious to participate. Ambition is her flaw, her weakness, and it is a veil which covers her eyes sometimes.Clarice valiantly attempts to question Lector, but he quickly sees through the plan. He knows that Crawford is desperate to include him in the survey, but Lector feels he is well above -- and he is -- such amaturish questions. Lector dismisses her efforts; he is much more interested in worming his way into her mind, her heart, and yes, her soul. He becomes Clarice's own personal Mephistopheles, the demon who demands a high price to satisfy his own twisted sense of pleasure. &quot;Quid pro quo&quot; means information about Bill in exchange for information about Clarice -- her feelings, her past, herself. The relationship between Clarice and Lector is complex, taking on multiple levels and roles as the plot unfolds. Criminal-investigator. Mentor-student. Father-daughter. Experience lover-virgin. Their interactions are no less dynamic or stimulating. Although the stakes radically increase when Bill kidnaps a senator's only daughter, it is the seduction, the unholy bond between Clarice and Lector which drive this story.The horror of this text is two-fold. First, there is Bill, the slayer and tanner of human hides. Based partially on several real life serial killers, including William Gacy who skinned his victims, Bill is an emotionally-imbalanced and psychologically-twisted individual who appears relatively normal on the outside. No one really knows who he is -- background, childhood, or motivation. He could be the man down the street or your next door neighbor. Bill is the embodiment of serial killers, a chameleon who drifts in and out of stores, classrooms, hospitals, and churches without capturing attention and yet the horror of his actions causes us to grimace and fear the unknown.The second horror of Lambs is Lector himself. As a man whose intelligence cannot be measured by any means humanly possible, nor his actions understood, Lector is one to be genuinely feared. When I found even more terrifying than the man himself was how willing Clarice became, how quickly she fell under his &quot;spell,&quot; in order to advance in the Bureau and solve the case. Clarice is one of the finest female characters I've ever read -- strong, intelligent, and capable. Determined, too, yet I wondered at what point Clarice might stop herself in time before Lector's hypnotic stare and languishing voice overwhelmed even her internal strength.Harris' writing style can be frustrating at times, a mixture of past and present tense and conflicting perspectives, but these distractions are minor when the psychology of the text is considered. I can forgive Harris for these errors because he's supposed to be writing a sequel -- no word on when it will ever appear, although Hollywood is pressing forward with its version next year -- and because he genuinely scared me. I know there are monsters out there -- murderers, rapists, and child molesters -- and I know how easy it is for them to hide, so it was a relief when I finally finished the book and put it away. Something like Lambs can only be read every few years; when it's done, it's done, and everything is good again.But what really scares me is that I cannot close the cover on the monsters out there."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read Silence of the Lambs despite the fact that I've seen the movie (many times). I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it because the film version is so faithful to the novel. But there are still some variations between the film and the novel and there is a strange fascination for diehard fans in discovering them. In any adaptation there are elements of the novel that simply can't fit into the film. For example, in the novel Starling runs up against an FBI bureaucracy and internal politics that threaten to stall or even jeopardize her budding career and Jack Crawford copes with his wife's terminal illness. These plot lines add depth to the novel that isn't in the film.The most compelling reason I found to read this novel though is that despite my familiarity with the story, it was still suspenseful. Even though I knew what was going to happen I still found myself furiously flipping pages. It's just that good a novel.The heart of the novel, as with the movie, is the relationship that develops between Lector and Starling. While Lector first appeared in Red Dragon, it is in Silence of the Lambs that Harris really breathes life into the character. Lector, as fascinating as he is, never evolves. It is Starling who must take emotional risks, playing mind games with a sociopath, standing firm against a corporate culture that marginalizes women, and persevering in a political system that seems intent on holding her down.Silence of the Lambs is an excellent movie, but before that, it was a damn good novel. I highly recommend both. If there is anyone out there that hasn't seen the movie and is thinking about reading the novel - wow - are you in for a ride. If you have seen the movie and you are wondering if you can still enjoy the novel, I think you can. You may know how it's going to end, but the ride is still worth it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book will always be for me the ultimate thriller. Flawlessly executed on every level, the story grabbed me by the lapels and smashed my spine against the wall until I'd read the very last word. Unbelievably good in every way possible -- from procedural to character to dialogue, pacing and originality -- the book is the best in the genre. In a somewhat unprecedented move, Harris is being awarded a Lifetime Achievement award from the Horror Writers Association. I can understand why. He's a master storyteller who has penetrated our culture and consciousness like no other."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"There are only a handful of books that I've read from cover to cover in just one sitting. Thomas Harris' SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was one of them. And for good reasons: his story was completely absorbing and he wrote it well.You all know the story, especially because of the hit movie. But if you haven't read the book, I urge you to do so. While the film successfully conveyed the psychodrama between Starling and Hannibal, what I thought was missing was the sense of urgency, the suspense that a life was hanging in the balance. The book is a rush because its suspense is so compelling from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I feel bad for those people who have only seen this work on the big screen as well as for those who merely read Harris' tale on a flight from New York to Orlando accepting the popular misconception that it is nothing more than a work of horror and mystery, a surface tale of shock fiction. While the film is probably one of the best novel to film transitions I have seen and the tale is both horrific and mysterious, Harris' creation takes the reader to a far more involved place than that. To merely accept the words on the page and the gross horror that they create is to do yourself and Thomas Harris a great disservice. Yes, enjoy the thrills and chills that resonate through your body, but appreciate the character development and deeper themes that Harris has so carefully crafted.Anthony Hopkins made Dr. Lecter infamous and in doing so made him the chief character in the minds of many. The masses heaped interest in the mind of the calculating killer, yet in doing so forgot the interest the Doctor himself shows for the young Clarice Starling, an interest that Harris spent much time developing and the interest that drives a good portion of this work. Clarice is given the task of approaching the good Doctor for input concerning the mind of a serial killer, a task that is of relatively low importance, a task she endures because she is willing to show her diligence, and a task she may have been granted simply because of her sex. In the male dominated world of government service Clarice must claw her way to the top, much like Buffalo Bill's victims who try to claw to the top of their death cell. It is Clarice's drive to prove herself in a man's world that saves the lives of her female counterparts from Bill's grasp. Clarice faces the typical obstacles of a woman in her field, yet her feminine nature is also the key that helps unlock the case and the final confrontation with Buffalo Bill.Harris is a careful craftsman when it comes to character development, and his work far outshines his visual counterparts through Hopkins and Foster, while the screen version of Buffalo Bill is a Muppet compared to Harris' depiction. Through Harris' exposition and Lecter's insight we learn much about the young FBI trainee Clarice Starling, a technique that I really appreciated; instead of merely recounting, or even &quot;showing&quot; us Clarice, we are given another dynamic presentation that rounds out our appreciation and interpretation of this deceivingly powerful young woman. It's tough to think about Lecter without the Hopkins popping up in my mind, but Harris' work paints a wonderful portrait that is so much more than the screen version; a more calculating, sinister evil that haunts the novel and the reader. As terrifying as Lecter is, Buffalo Bill is somewhat more chillingly painted in the tale. Harris does a phenomenal job of creating a man who is pure evil, yet completely believable and touchable-making you wonder about those neighbors of yours who you never see out of doors.And of course there is the gripping, suspenseful mystery that made the work so popular. Harris tells a wonderful tale that keeps you guessing, and even if you've seen the movie and think you know the ending, you're still wondering exactly what is going to happen when Clarice risks it all and dashes into the basement.No matter if you have seen the movie or claim to have read the book before, give Thomas Harris his due for writing a beautiful, deep, suspenseful tale that should be praised for its detail and development as it is for its spine-chilling excitement and read this book...with the lights on."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I bought this book at the airport purely because it was 50% off. Before this, I was reading PD James kind of murder books. I'd seen bits of the movie and it never grabbed me. But the book was another matter - I read from the moment I sat down to when I had to get off the plane. It was only a 3 hour flight so I could't finish the whole book - for the first and only time, I wished the flight was longer so I could go on reading undisturbed! I couldn't even put it down at mealtime, and had to eat with one hand, lucky airline food is so mushy.This book really got me started and since then I've read many, many dozens of serial killer mysteries, trying for the same thrill. There are a very few books you wish you could erase from your memory, so you can read them for the first time again - this is one of them. The only other murder books as good, that I've found: Red Dragon, and Val McDermid's The Mermaids Singing."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Bar none, Hannibal Lecter is the most compelling and dangerous character I've come across. I read the novel just as the movie was released in the theater, so I already had Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster pictured as I was reading it, which worked very well for me. I later saw the movie and it really succeeded in bringing the novel to life. You've probably already seen the movie, but it does miss out on some brilliant dialogue between Clarice and Lecter. An absolute must read for psychological suspense fans!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"In Thomas Harris' classic thriller (skip this paragraph if you've seen the movie,) FBI agent-to-be Clarice Starling is put on a case because of lack of manpower. Her job is to interview a former serial killer in a hospital for the criminally insane to try to find clues on how to catch another serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. The character of Hannibal Lecter (the imprisoned killer) is the most passively vicious villain ever. He likes to play games with anyone who will talk to him, Clarice and others. He will not respond to anyone unless they will answer his questions which are often very personal. He makes Clarice tell him about her childhood and her darkest nightmares. In exchange, he gives her clues about the case. If someone comes to him asking for clues and they will not answer his questions, he will ignore them or, worse yet, lead them astray. Clarice and the FBI have to investigate his often subtle clues to try to end the dreadful killings.I like how Harris makes Clarice stand up strong, and often alone, in the male-dominated FBI. She is a very intense character. We learn much about how her mind works as she interviews Lecter and tracks down Buffalo Bill. The scariest feeling in the book is how Clarice begins to think like Lecter to try to understand his clues. This book gave me a small picture of what being a criminal psychologist would be like. All the characters were very vivid. If all authors wrote like this, books would never be boring.This thriller is for everyone, especially those who loved the movie. Lecter is just as sinisterly portrayed as in the movie, and the book will keep you just as wide awake and on the edge of your seat.&quot;Over this odd world, this half the world that's dark now, I have to hunt a thing that lives on tears.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Well, I wrote a review a while ago of this book before I had seen the movie, and promised to write another one after I had seen the film. Well, before I watched Jonathan Demme's \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" I read the novels \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Hannibal.\\" And the other day, I had a four film marathon which consisted of \\"Manhunter,\\" \\"Red Dragon,\\" \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Hannibal.\\" I must say I was just a wee bit dissipointed with the film version of this novel. I thought it was a very good movie, and have already watched it three times, but I have been hearing so much about how it was the absolute SCARIEST and absolute GORIEST and absolute BEST movie ever made, and I felt a bit dissipointed on all of those levels. While I was dissipointed, I felt it was still an excellent film. Compared to Brian Cox's subtler and closer-to-the-book version of Hannibal Lector in \\"Manhunter,\\" I thought Anthony Hopkins' interprtation of him in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" was a lot better, and much more memorable. Hopkins eats up the screen with panache and remains the most memorable thing in the movie. He is simply amazing. I think I enjoyed the movie a little more than the book because it was easier to understand what was going on visually. For example, every scene with Lector, Lector's escape, the showdown with Buffalo Bill and the autopsy scene were all much more effective here. In the novel, all we have are Hannibal's words and Clarice's words, but in the movie, we see Hannibal's expressions and Clarice's face and it was all much more interesting to me in the film. I don't really \\"picture\\" characters when I read a book, so I wasn't dissipointed with any of the actors in the film version. Ted Levine was really, REALLY scary as Jame Gumb and that trick he did with his richard near the end will haunt me forever. Jodie Foster was good as Clarice and Scott Glenn was suitable as Crawford (though I preferred Dennis Farina in \\"Manhunter\\"). Anyway, in comparision to the film, my opinion on the book hasn't changed much. I enjoyed the book the first time I read and now that I've seen the movie I still think it's good. Not good enough for five stars, but still quite good. Thomas Harris' writing style was unique and it seems like hwe put alot of research into the way the FBI functions because the whole book seemed quite realistic.Anyway, my recommendation is to read the book then see the movie. The movie, I thought, was better, but the book is still a good read. Incidentally, I liked the novel \\"Hannibal\\" MUCH better, however.John"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"As I have seen the film of the same name many times, I already understood the gruesome goal that piqued Jame Gumb's mind as he killed each of his victims and earned the name 'Buffalo Bill'. However, being aware of the murderer's intentions did not detract from the overall reading, rather it allowed me the freedom to analyze Harris' work from a craftsman's perspective and pay closer attention to the baited hints Hannibal Lector tosses to Clarice Starling akin to bits of bread flicked to greedy birds. These scenes between Lector and Starling are electrifying in their simplicity and nuanced with a psychological tension so taut it leaves the reader gritting his teeth and sucking in his breath. Harris' juxtaposition of Lector's insidious disregard for anything that barricades his way, with his refined tastes and superior brain powers creates a personality that evokes a fascinating blend of revulsion and admiration. Like Starling, we are titillated and repulsed--little flies in Lector's spiderweb.The film covers the novel's ground to near perfection, so anyone who has seen and enjoyed the film knows what to expect. Crawford's character in the book is fleshed out with a little more detail regarding his personal life. Such details plunge the reader deeper into the dark world of criminal investigation where sleepless nights and stark conditions supercede any of the press-generated glory from a real time quality-of-life standpoint."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Yet another great read from Harris! Superb! Though I didn't enjoy is as much as &quot;Red Dragon&quot; I still absolutely loved it! Harris has an amazing way of captivating his reader, forcing the reader to constantly think about what you think is going to happen. Unlike Harris's previous novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, you hear more and learn more about Hannibal Lecter as well as the murderer, Jame Gumb. Though I was slightly dissapointed that Gumb was not talked about as much as Dolarhyde was in &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, Gumb was also a highly absorbing character. I guarantee, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; will stay in your memory forever! Stunning!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I loved this book, really good, and I recommend that you read it. The movie is one of my all-time favorites, I could watch it over and over.

Great movie and book."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Thomas Harris is and will always be one of the best suspense writers that ever lived. That's because his novels grip you, scare you, excite, and entertain you at the same time. His descriptions may be a bit graphic but that's the formula he uses to keep us reading. I, myself, finished this book in three short days because it was amazing: the chemistry of the characters, the mystery that he wants us and the main character to solve, the drama that scares us and makes this book a page-turner. Overall, it's amazing. I actually read this book without reading Red Dragon, the book that took place earlier than this story. I admit there were some scenes in the book that I did not understand. But enough of that. The Silence of the Lambs is about a young trainee at the F.B.I. academy named Clarice Starling. She is suprised when she is summoned by Jack Crawford, Chief of the Department's Behavioral Science section, a buidlign that deals with murders and serial killers. Crawford tells the trainee that a serial killer named Buffalo Bill is on the loose and killing women and skinning them. Starling's assignment is to interview Hannibal the Cannibal Lecter, a captured serial killer held at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane ,known for his grisly ways. And as Hannibal starts handing out clues to Clarice, the case gets more personal. I won't tell you the ending but I'll tell you this: the ending does make room for a sequel. The characters are perfectly described, the suspense keeps your eyes glued to the page, and the climax is spectacular. No wonder that Stephen King, the master of supernatural horror wrote &quot;This book simply comes at you and comes at you, finally leaving you shaken and sober and afraid on a deeper level than simple 'thrills' alone furnish.&quot; This is a must buy for all fans of suspense annd horror. This is the book that would go on to become a classic masterpiece and gain four Academy Awards including Best Actor Anthony Hopkins for his portrayal as Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster would win Best Actress for her role as Clarice Starling."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Like some of you that are reading this , I've read \\"The Silence of Lambs\\".

I'll just tell you straight up, if you don't like books that go into grusome detail you won't like this book at all. I,personally, read this book because of that reason, because it has grusome detail. I thought it was interesting the way that, in the book, the FBI had to trust one psychopathic killer to catch another.

I bought Silence of the Lambs for a plane trip, not seeing the movie, just having a general knowledge of what the book was about. I have to say, Thomas Harris is a genius! His characters are so complex and realistic, I can see how easy it would be to make a movie from the book.Clarice Starling is a character that makes you glad there are books. She keeps you hooked and you can't help but root for her. My favorite character though was Dr. Lecter, the way he is so gentlemanly but at the same time a psycopath is writing at its best. Basically, Harris creates an entire book of deep characters.The entire book revolves around a murderer named Buffalo Bill. Who skins his victims, thus giving him his name. The search for him by Starling, with Dr. Lecter's &quot;help&quot;, creates a book full of twists and turns. The ending is climatic and overall not disappointing.If you are even slightly considering getting this book, DO! If you are into this genre, you won't be disappointed; Thomas Harris is the master!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"After seeing the movie of The Silence of The Lambs, I was a bit skeptical about reading the novel. A frightening movie only yields a more frightening novel. And I was completely correct. This book exceeded all of the expectations that I had for a perfect suspense/thriller novel. Though I am not a big suspense/thriller fan, I did appreciate this novels ability to retain my attention from the first page all the way to the very last sentence. Thomas Harris not only achieved pure suspense/thriller greatness, he also added many thematic aspects to this novel that many writers would not have the ability and/or talent to do this well. I commend this novel for being a literary masterpiece, in my humble opinion. In The Silence of The Lambs, Harris has created a spellbinding plot and has done an amazing job on the characterization. In this novel, Federal Clarice Starling is a FBI agent working her way to the top of the agency, struggling to make a place for herself in such a male dominated field. Her supervisor, Jack Crawford, has assigned her the difficult case of speaking to the infamous Dr. Hannibal (The Cannibal) Lecter. Lecter is a psychiatrist who is an inmate at a mental hospital for the criminally insane. Lecter has been placed in the hospital for killing/eating several people and has been locked away in a cell ever since. He is very intelligent and, because Crawford and his team will be out on the &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; case, Clarice is to have Dr. Lecter fill out a questionnaire. As she is sent on her way to do the evaluation of Lecter, Clarice encounters a very sexist/egotistical Dr. Chilton, who serves as a diabolical head of administration at the mental hostpital. With Lecter's help, Clarice is able to make a break through on the Buffalo Bill Case, in which a man is kidnapping women killing them and skinning them to create himself a &quot;woman suit&quot; with. Through the twisted turn of events and multiple frightening visits with Dr. Lecter, Clarice is able to persuade the FBI to allow her to follow the leads she has received from many various sources (Lecter included). The mastermind, Dr. Lecter, has figured out the plans that Buffalo Bill has in store for the woman he has kidnapped, a powerful Senator's daughter, and in return for this information Lecter is able to kill his way out of the hospital. Though the plot is dramatic and very intense, a reader must also be aware of the multiple under tones this novel has on society. One is the idea of women &quot;climbing their way to the top&quot; and the various obstacles that they must over come to do so. Another major theme in this novel is the ideas of one overcoming their past. It becomes more evident through a closer reading of this novel but when you think about even the title alone &quot;The Silence of The Lambs&quot; is all about the struggles to overcome your past. Harris has provided us with very memoriable and intriguing characters, even the pyscho-cannibalistic-murderer-mastermind is likable. I know I was impressed by Dr. Lecter and by the character, Clarice. She showed women that anything is possible to overcome in this world with just a little hard work and dedication. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who would like to enjoy a VERY scary book and yet come away with a few of life's little lessons under your belt. Fantastic NOVEL!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Of course we've all seen the movie. Jodie Foster as Special Agent Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins as the devilish, yet likable Hannibal Lecter. The sequel HANNIBAL is in theatres at the time of this writing.What about the book? I've read THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS for the second time in less than eight months. It is simply an irresistible novel, not only because of its dynamic characters but also because of the themes explored in it. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is so much more than a simple suspense/horror novel; it addresses feminine portrayal as well as stereotypical gender roles. Thomas Harris subtly disguises these issues beaneath the tension and suspense of the book, but as readers, we can still se them there below the surface. Harris is not a preachy writer. He can touch these issues without shoving them in our faces and still get his point across.Clarice Starling is attempting to become a Special Agent in the FBI. Her upward climb puts her on a path with a homicidal psychiatric genius, one Hannibal Lecter. It is through him that she discovers secrets about herself as well as the keys to her own success. Lecter assists her in her pursual of another serial killer, Jame Gumb. Lecter's assistance comes from the confines of a dungeon cell in an asylum, but his presence is incredibly captivating. It is here that Thomas Harris twists our own interests around: Not only do we side with Clarice, we also side with Hannibal Lecter. We know this man is a maniacal, monstrous genius, but this deadly combination only draws us deeper into him. We want Clarice to succeed in her endeavors, but we want Hannibal to do the same. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS allows us to side with the good guys as well as harbor a secret, guilty admiration for a down right evil man.Thomas Harris doesn't stop there. After we've fallen in love with several of his characters, he introduces us to deeper themes and motifs. The numerous male characters in the book often hit on Clarice. Her abilities are doubted because of her sex. Many of the &quot;high ranking officials&quot; in this novel attempt to toy and double-cross Dr. Lecter, much to our disdain. Harris uses these themes to explore the roles of women, their stereotypes, female objectivity and double standards.Impossible, you might say. All of this in a suspense novel? Yep. And Harris pulls it off as only he can: beautifully.THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS rewards in so many ways. The suspense level cannot be ignored. Harris writes in a cinematic fashion, using his words to guide the camera eye of the reader. We are easily pulled into the macabre world of Jame Gumb and the stressful, yet exciting life of Clarice Starling. Behind it all is the unforgetable smiling face of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Even if you have seen the movie, the book rewards in so many ways that the cinematic version cannot. The writing is exceptional and the resolution satisfies everyone who becomes enthralled by the book. Harris is a master storyteller and anyone opening the cover of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a mesmerizing book, a terrifying journey through the dark unopened doors of the human psyche. Harris has written a stunning book, of all of the novels I've read recently only THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY can compare to it for emotional impact. I was drained when I finished it, it is an astounding work of fiction."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book is fluidly written; the story seems to flow from one page to the next and one can't help but get caught up in the author's frolicking imagination. There are some of the most clever conversations ever penned in this book, such as Lecter's acute breakdown of Clarice's history, and I hope that more people will read it...I know I will again, but not until I finish &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;. :-)"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I picked up the book after hearing great reviews. I was looking forward to a 'good, fun read' in a hot summer. I was very wrong. From the start, I got wound up in the terrifying prospects of the immense criminal genius of Hannibal Lecter, the steadfast yet young Clarice Starling, and the horrific ideals of 'Buffalo Bill', or Jame Gumb. A killer is on the loose, kidnapping girls and leaving their bodies sans skin for the authorities to discover. FBI trainee Clarice Starling is sent to ask dangerous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter to fill in a questionnaire, and is reluctantly sent on a 'treasure hunt' for the serial killer by Hannibal Lecter, who knows of him. It rides like a rollercoaster, and highlights include the phenomenal escape of Hannibal Lecter from the authorities and the shootout in the dark at the end. Througholy twisted, terribly enjoyable, I loved it, despit my age."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Since I had only seen the film and not read the original text, I decided that in anticipation of Hannibal (June 1999) that I would go back and read the first two -- Red Dragon and Silence.I found the book to be truly spellbinding. Interestingly, this is one of the few books that the movie has been extremely faithful to depicting as written.I thoroughly enjoyed the two principal characters Hanibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. I look forward to Hannibal!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I am not an avid reader. But, when I picked up a copy of Silence I never put it down! I really loved all of the Psychology involved with this book."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Well, being 11- reading this book really don\`t help sleeping at night. I read this book over 2 months and it totally scared me. I read it at night before I went to bed and I used to dream about it. I saw the film in December and found it not like the book at all. The author must have a ummmmm &quot;Vived&quot; imagination! But this book is brilliant- go on and read it! I can\`t wait to read the new book- if my parents will let me!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Like many others, Silence of the Lambs proves the fact that the book is always better than the movie. It is a *must* read, even though there should have been more chapters written from Lecter's perspective. On the other hand, there's less confusion in the book than in the movie and it's easier to understand Jame Gumb since they explain him indepth, and we can always get our Lecter-fix from the new book Hannibal. :)"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"One of the most fast-paced, entertaining, and well written books I have ever read.

I want to let Mr. Harris know how much I enjoy his books.I very much looking forward to reading Hannibal."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Disturbing. Not so much because of the sheer evil in Dr. Lecter, or because of the malevolent Mr. Gumb, but because we are seconds away from becoming them. The playful strategems orchestrated from within the confines of Hannibal's cell challenge us to evaluate our own choices, were we young Clarice Starling. An amazing, breathless read, The Silence of the Lambs stands out above cliched horror and worn-out suspense as the crowning achievement in an often redundant genre. Never stretching beyond the realm of the absolutely possible, Harris shows us through the eyes of FBI agents, petty politicians, and the maroon gaze of The Cannibal himself, that they are not improbable characters, and perhaps irrevocable. Thoroughly exhilirating and well worth the long night it will take you to read."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Hannibal Lecter staring into rookie FBI agent, Clarice Starling's eyes, with unprecedented menace and intelligence- a voice like metallic sandpaper, and a thrill for deadly games. This is the image that comes to my mind when I think about Thomas C. Harris' classic horror/psychological thriller, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.Harris based this novel (and the two main antagonists, Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill) on true-life aspects of FBI legend John Douglas' work with Gary Heidnick, Ed Gein and Theodore Bundy. And, like real life, this novel is dark and gritty without all of the unbelievable aspects some neophytes of the genre think are realistic. When reading this, you can tell Harris researched and knew his stuff, but more than that, that he was DRIVEN to tell this tale. That this is a tale Harris HAD to tell, and he does it splendidly, never failing to cause the little hairs on my arms to rise to attention. If you are wondering what all the fuss is about re: this book... well, let's just say it's not misplaced! A truly great novel."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"If you enjoy books that will keep you looking over your shoulder for a few weeks, then this book is for you. Full of excitement and nail bitting page turns. After reading you may just want to sleep with the lights on."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"If you enjoy books that will keep you looking over your shoulder for a few weeks, then this book is for you.

After reading you may just want to sleep with the lights on."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"It's hard to write a review of a book that has been turned into a well-known and very good film. It's easier to do so when the book itself is brilliant. &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; is a fabulous story, well-told, intelligent, gripping, thrilling and downright disconcerting in parts. It's a compulsive read, one of those books in which you truly spin the pages just to see what lies ahead.The book's use of an antihero (and, wow, what an antihero) is jarring and gives the story a foreboding feel, but is also one of its greatest strengths. You feel caught up in Lecter's mindgames and empathise strongly with Starling.Even if you haven't seen the film, you really should read this book. It is sheer entertainment. Five well-deserved stars."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Great writing, great characters and great dialogue (the head games between Hannibal and Clarice are extremely entertaining)! A brilliant psychological thriller of the highest order. Much better than the movie--not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Reading Silence of the Lambs is like working out. As I read it I got so into it that I got frustrated just like Clarice Starling did. Thomas Harris did a wonderful job at creating a suspenceful setting that left you wondering what is going to happen next. The end was terrific and totally set up Harris' next novel &quot;Hannibal&quot;. I was greatly pleased with this book and would recommend it to everyone.I think that Thomas Harris did a wonderful job at showing how Hannibal Lecter got into Clarice Starling's head. The mind games that Lecter put Clarice through are written wonderfully. Please, if you have the time, read this book."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Unlike a lot of people, I have never seen the movie &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; I have indeed seen parts of it, but never the whole thing. I decided to read the book first, and then watch the movie afterwards. So far, I love the book. It is suspenseful, I can barely put it down at night, and end up staying up until all hours reading it. Every chance I get I pick it up and read the pages, each page more thrilling than the last. A definite read, and a must buy, this book will scare even the bravest of book readers."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"After being truly gripped by the movie, I decided that this book must be worth reading. I chose not to drop straight into it though and decided to read Red Dragon first. I'm glad I did, partly because it's an excellent book but also as it built up the feel of Harris's style and introduced Hannibal Lecter, one of the most vivid characters I ever encountered in a book. The story traces the rise through the FBI ranks of a talented and pretty young agent who treads on as many toes as she makes friends. Clarice Starling is also a character developed to just the right extent who by the end of the book will have you breathing in time with her let alone feeling mere empathy!!Apart from the obvious main storyline of the hunt for a brutal serial killer which is very powerful in itself the book has several other strands to its bow which the movie missed. The first of which is the relationship between Starling and her superior at the FBI. This is a fascinating sub plot which really puts the icing on the cake of Starlings' character. It helps not only to give her more depth but also to give the main story a more substantial feel.Most people will know the movie, those who don't and those who think that it was flawless I urge you to read the book. This has to be one of the finest of the genre, along with Red Dragon, and I can't recommend it highly enough. A thriller of pure adrenalin and razor sharp twists."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Thomas Harris did a tremendous work in this story. I read the book before I saw the movie, so after reading such a brilliant book, I was excited when I was watching Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster developing the main characteristics that had been described in an intense way in the book. Clarice Starling hadn't faced a case like Lecter's case. So it was a tough challenge for her. Lecter has a very intriguing personality. It's scary and has lots of enigmas around him. So a good reader will enjoy the style of Thomas Harris's Silence of The Lambs. Nice Work!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Sir Anthony Hopkins was the perfect man to play Hannibal. This book was brilliant and I strongly recommend it! From page one, it draws you into it's pages with the constant happenings. The autopsy is gripping. You're actually in the room with them and can smell the foul stench of the decayed corpse. That's how realistic the words are. Mister Harris is a wonderful writer and had me hooked after the first page. I'm looking forward to reading Hannibal."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Silence of the Lambs takes on a vivid imagination as he details the account of a serial killer. It is fantastic as was his other book Red Dragon!! I keep looking for his next book. He writes dramatically and sensitively. I keep looking for his next one!!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This may very well be the greatest fiction book I have ever read. Harris' brilliant character Hannibal Lechter is the most multi-dimensional eerily likable psychopath ever developed.

Harris,...PLEASE publish the sequel."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I have a theory. The &quot;good&quot; Dr. Lecter actually exists.

This is of course the book that made Dr. Hannible Lector one of the most well know names in fiction today, but the one question I have about the Lecter series is this. When is the next one going to be published? C'mon Mr. Harris we have been good, please let us know what is going on with our favorite psychopath"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"When alone on a desert island, you'll never long for fava beansafter reading this page turner!

If you enjoyed the movie, the book is an absolute must!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The second book in the Hannibal Lecter series is the most famous. After reading it its easy to see why. Thomas Harris crafts a creepy tale where there are so many different incarnations of evil at work. The introduction of FBI trainee Clarice Starling is done wonderfully. Her character is equal parts intelligence, ambition, doubt, and courage. There was good deal of time dealing with her boss, Jack Crawford, who is a good foil for Lecter. This was a real horror classic!

But Lei-Ling's intelligence is more like instinct. I think she sees things in people, leik their innermost secrets without trying to. And when she's sitting int a room with a villain and she's so still just before she strikes she's terrifying. Hannibal Lecter is a genius and I wonder what would happen if she ever met Lei-Ling. This book had some beautiful sentences and I've been waiting for Hannibal Rising to come out. If you loved this book you should reed the Secret Life of Douglas Manson by Robert Sturtevant and meet the scariest woman in literature, Lei-Ling. She's kind of like a femal Hannibal Lecter but young and terrifying. This book rocks.

Mr. Harris really keeps you on your toes with this one, as he always does. So, yeah, get this book! It's a great suspense novel and it will keep you thinking."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This is the one that everyone else looks up to as their big brother. Everyone knows the name Hanibal Lecter, Hannibal the Cannibal. It's the typical Gothic style story, but Harris has someone levels and paths and doorways to send you down and put you through that you just can't put it down. I read the first six chapters for class one day and read the rest of it the next day because it is just that good. It has intelligence and wit and sharp suspense and bone chilling thill rides on ever page. How is any one person supposed to able to have such a masterful grasp on the English language. I want a DNA transplant of this guy, start me over and give me his juice because I want to be this good. It's horrific and wonderful, beautiful and full of terrible images all at the same time. It's the complete package."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Surprisingly, I enjoyed the movie much more than the book.Thomas Harris did an ok job of writing this book, but he definitely isn't strong in the details department. If I hadn't seen the movie first I would never have been able to picture the things going on.For example, when Clarice is photographing the body of the girl, in the book you really can't get a feel for what the woman really looked like, and what Buffalo Bill had done to her. Also, Anthony Hopkin did an amazing job portraying Dr. Lecter ,and without seeing the movie, you can't feel the terror that Clarice felt upon meeting him.Some things are much more interesting in the book, though, and it was helpful to get a feel for who Clarice really was, instead of being such a sweet person as she seems in the movie, she really had a temper.The Silence of the Lambs was definitely a made for movie book, and I am very glad that they did make a movie out of it.Overall, I'd give it three and a half stars, but alas! no such possibility exists."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"If you have trouble following horror books this book is one exception. Don't judge this book by it's thickness. Even though it was over 250 pages long it seems like it is half of that. Unlike the movie you know what the characters are thinking. When in the movie you have to figure it out for yourself. In the movie you don't really know what Buffalo Bill's motive is for making a human suit. In the book Hannibal Lector explains that Bill thinks he is homosexual but he is really just confused. There are little differences like in the book Hannibal has six fingers on one hand and in the movie he has five. There are also more characters to keep track of in the book. It would tell you about the character and then they wouldn't show up for a while. Then when you forget about them they show up and you have to flip back a couple of chapters to see what their importance is. Even though I knew what was going to happen in the end it still made me want to read it again. I recommend this book to anyone who likes any kind of book. It covers all the different book types."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Thomas Harris' The Silence of the Lambs is much more than just an airport thriller. It is a bona-fied literary achievement. Yes it is a psychological thriller, but the novel also works on a deeper thematic level. I could tell that there was equal thought put into the composition of both the suspenseful drama, as well as the poignant themes. Harris is also aware of the issues that exist between men and women in today's society, and he exposes the problems that arise from these gender relationships. Suspense is the driving force behind this book and Harris is a master at using it to consume the reader. From the start the reader is anxiously anticipating the direction the plot will take. Following the path of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, F.B.I. trainee Clarice Starling is thrown into a world where women are objectified and have to struggle to obtain any form of power. She encounters opposition and encouragement from both sides of the gender line, which further fuels the conflicts at hand. The tension constantly rises throughout the sixty-one chapters, reaching a boiling point where forces collide, causing one side to be rewarded, the other, punished. While the suspense contributes solely to the plot, the careful use of characterization pushes the thematic level as well as the intense drama. Harris employs a wide array of characters in his analysis of gender relations. There's Clarice Starling, her boss Jack Crawford, the dangerously intelligent psychopath Hannibal Lector, the serial killer Buffalo Bill and the devious Frederick Chilton to name a few. The interactions between all of these characters scrutinize the psychological implications of gender relations in America. The fact that two of these people are extremely dangerous dramatically intensifies the conflicts within the novel. The aspect of gender is at the heart of this book. Every character's gender must be taken into account in order to understand their place in the world as Thomas Harris sees it. The language Harris uses is fairly simple, but it is incredibly real. If he were to use prose in an unconventional manner, much of the dramatic effect would be lost. Instead he presents the scenes in a very clear, yet chilling manner, enabling the reader to concentrate less on complex syntax, and more on the literal happenings of the book. This allows for a fuller experience with the story. From a cinematic standpoint, it is great to finally see an accurate interpretation of literature on film. The movie accurately depicts the gender driven thematics as well as the suspense riddled plot. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to experience a great mix of dramatic and thematic devices. Harris places equal importance on both aspects of literature, therefore creating a masterpiece for the literary community. If you have not read The Silence of the Lambs, don't approach it as a mere psychological thriller. Keep in mind that other levels exist, and that this book should be viewed from a literary perspective. If you have read it before, try it out again and see what else you can find. I bet you'll be surprised."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"What a treat this story is (in a sadistic kind of way). We get to delve into the evil and twisted mind of one of the greatest characters in modern fiction, Hannibal Lecter. This is the only novel I can think of that after a while I ended up actually liking the bad guy (Hannibal). Don't be misled. The story is about catching a ruthless and creative serial killer, but the 'real' story is between Hannibal and Clarice. For some odd reason Hannibal is facinated with this young FBI wannabe and therefore helps her by dangling tiny morsels of information that could lead to the capture of the 'other' bad guy in the story. How Thomas Harris takes us into Hannibals thoughts is a scary trip to make, but one that entertains as well as frightens. After reading this book, I found 'Red Dragon' (said to be much better than 'Silence') and read it, only to be disappointed. Sure it was good, but in MY opinion, far behind Hannibals 2nd outing in 'Silence of the Lambs'. I SHOULD have read them in the order they were written, but that was MY mistake--don't YOU make the same.

It appears to have been written so as to become a movie. Each chapter covers a typical seene in the movie. Thus each chapter is short and the book is ideal to read in 10 to 30 minute increments. With a few exceptions and omisions the movie parallels the book. Some parts stretch the imagination and discredit the story's believablity. Lecter escape from jail in an ambulance is a good example. Also any good FBI agent or trainee would call for back up before chasing a serial killer down into a basement. He should have developed some parts better. But, what the heck this is fiction with some fantasy. I am now motivated to read &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; and then &quot;Hannibal.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Silence of the Lambs was a simply superb, electrifying book. What a writer Thomas Harris is and what a character the infamous Hannibal (the &quot;Cannibal&quot;) Lector is. With Lector, Harris makes you look at the face of evil, and stare! Spine chilling novel that is truly very dark and defiantly creepy. My only problem is I felt Harris took some things a little too far and was a little &quot;too&quot; rough at times. Other than that, an unbelievable novel with simply beautiful, touching writing."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I like this book intensely because it shows what might go on in a serial killer's mind. The religious distortions are funny, but I have to agree totally with the reader from Alexandria, Virginia. While Hannibal is pretty cool, Buffalo Bill is simply more interesting. Some chapters it talks about what is going on in his mind and it is frightening. All in all, a frightening book. Can't wait for Hannibal."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"While most thriller writers are content to leave the killer's motivation as a mystery or a sort of given &quot;evil,&quot; Harris seems to genuinely understand the psychopathologies of the unfortunate individuals who, like Jame Gumb or Hannibal Lecter, find relief from their inner torment in bizarre acts of violence. Looking forward to &quot;Hannibal.&quot; Six years of waiting should be worth it!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"the movie comes pretty darn close! I read this book before I saw the movie, so I was not so swept up in the suspense of the film since I already knew what would happen. It's rare that a movie follows the plot of a novel so closely. You will find it hard to shake the dark, brooding atmosphere of the book. One of the most unforgettable scenes is when Clarice visits the storage unit - that is the ultimate in claustrophobic, insect-crawling, suffocating creepiness! I thought the sub-plot involving Jack Crawford's dying wife was very affecting. It humanized him and made him a more subtle and interesting character than in the movie. Unlike most people apparently, I was not fascinated by Dr. Lechter. I found Buffalo Bill to be much more interesting, for his chilling calculation and the fact that murderous evil can (and frequently does) hide behind such ordinary exteriors. His macabre basement &quot;workshop&quot; will haunt you for a long time. It's like a nightmare world unto itself. The pitch of terror at the climax of the story leaves you breathless!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Clarice Starling is an FBI trainee.

He is one of the greatest writers living. But what I would like to say is I was very impressed by the performance of Kathy Bates as narrator of this cassette book. Maybe this cassette book is better than movie."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"From the day I finished Silence of the Lambs (the day after I started) I have searched for other novels by Thomas Harris. Red Dragon is equally as good as Silence and Black Sunday is slightly different but just as good. Unfortuneatly there is no book about Hannibal Lecter's own life before prison.We need more entertaining, detailed and analytical authors like Thomas Harris. You thought Stephen King was evil?"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This novel is by far the most intricate and deeply troubeling book ever written. The illusions to the Bible and such master poets as William Blake are masterful. Harris does an excellent job of creating sympathy not only for the antagonist Clarice Starling, but also for the psychopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Lecter is a character that a reader will never forget and has managed to carve a niche in popular culture. The movie is fantastic, but as always the novel is ten times better! Alas it is not for the weak of heart."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Dr. Hannibal Lecter, what a subject for analysis! The profile of Jame Gumb is really interesting, but I think Clarice Starling should have picked up on it earlier. I love this. Know I know about flayings and moths. An amazing book."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book was brilliant and was outstandingly detailed, the author has a great mind to imagine all the horrific events. I have seen the film and the book is far better, it gives out so much description."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"In my opinion, Thomas Harris' great genius is his ability to give the reader empathy for all his characters, even ones who kill and eat other people! Harris writes with an incredible and rare respect for his subjects, Hannibal Lecter comes to life within us, Clarisse Starling, Jack Crawford, Jame Gumb, we come to feel and empathize with each.The movie version was great, but was not totally true to the book. The book is, of course, better, but it's not just because books allow us to create the images with our minds. The Hannibal character is actually not as monstrous as the movie Hannibal, in the book, he has more depth, more refinement, more humanity. In the book, unlike the movie, when Dr. Lecter says to Clarisse: &quot;Don't try to reduce me to a set of influences, can't you bear to say that I am evil?&quot; we, the reader, ask ourselves, what is he hiding? Whereas in the movie we just think: &quot;Yep, he's evil.&quot; What I want to know is: how come his victim mentioned in the movie was a female, when all of Dr. Lecter's victims in the book are male? Why are we so much more comfortable with dead women? Anyway, Harris' treatment of women in the book is with the utmost respect, and the utmost disgust of the system which pushes women down to the level of second-class citizens. Clarisse Starling is fighting this force as best she can: by being the best in everything she sets out to do! Her intelligence attracts Dr. Lecter's attention, and she's able, with his hints and her wonderful brain, to capture a serial killer, who kills women for their skins.This book is not a second rate horror novel, but literary fiction which will stick with you for a long time to come."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"For anyone who has only seen the movie, this book is a must! Not only is there more insight to the characters, but there are subtle differences which I feel add to the overall personalities, especially Clarice Starling's. You won't want to put this one down, I finished it in an afternoon!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"What's more scary than a human monster, a man that lives to literally feed off the weak and the vulnerable? A man that eats people's livers with fava beans and a nice chiante? Not much. But Hannibal Lecter's I.Q. of 160 certainly doesn't help!From the moment I started reading this novel, I was captivated. The characters are well-developed and each performs the function he or she was intended for. Clarice Starling is the universal symbol of youth searching for a way to better the world, and because of this, many of us can identify with her. We root for her. Buffalo Bill is chilling in his crazed, unreachable way. And Hannibal Lecter chilled my blood with his odd physical appearence (crimson eyes, small neat teeth, polydactylism) and metallic rasp of a voice. This tale is a classic, and for good reason!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I really don't have much that's helpful to add after everyone else's reviews here - this is an incredibly written, psychologically enthralling, immediate page-turner with some of the most memorable characters I've ever read. DO NOT miss out on reading this novel."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Hanibal Lecter is a truly demonic character, but the reader developes a likeing to him, we find ourselves liking this evil killer, and that is what makes this a hrryfing thriller. We feel for Clarice Starling and feel her fear at dealing with lecter. As a former FBI agent, i found this to be an incredibly belivable book with realistic and semi realistic circumstances. If you liked the movie, read the book its a helluva lot better. The book also developes characters and their inner conflicts a lot better."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This is my favorite Harris book followed by Red Dragon. The character development and great storyline makes this book an easy read. I read it in 3 days. Hannibal Lector is one of the best villians in any series of stories.

Better than the movie."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I haven't yet read &quot;Hannibal&quot;, but I think I can alredy guess that Lambs will remain my first pick.Of course, I saw the movie first (how many of us can claim the opposite?) but reading the book revealed that the movie followed the book quite closely.Harris' details are all covered well, no 'loose ends'-- which really annoy me-- and the twists and turns of the plot are a thrill ride! No wonder they made a movie of it!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"If you've seen the Silence of the Lambs movie already, you're not missing much as far as the novel is concerned. The movie was quite faithful to the book, so any plot differences between the two are small enough to take all the suspence away for the reader. The extra dialogue isn't nearly as good without Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster saying it. If you have never seen the movie before and are into serial killer/thriller novels, than this is one of the best, and you should read it before you watch the film. If you have seen the movie, than try the other Hannibal Lecter books, the Red Dragon or Hannibal."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"A splendid book.Very readable.By the master of suspense,Thomas Harris.You owe to yourself to read it;the book is one thousand times more satisfying,and chilling the oscar winning movie.It's as good,if not better than the master's earlier work,the Red Dragon,which was very good,though the movie,Manhunter(1986),didn't quite match up."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"When I was in high school, I thought that the movie version was the greatest thing since sliced bread and was(may the gods forgive me) superior to the novel. Ten years later, the film doesn't hold up as well but the book is one of my favorites (up there with Harris's &quot;Red Dragon&quot;).Everyone talks about how gruesome and gripping &quot;Silence&quot; is, and heaven knows they're right. But what makes it powerful upon repeat readings is its surprising tenderness- the acute emotional sensitivity you rarely get in this kind of story. Everyone talks about Hannibal the Cannibal because he's the flashier character; but this is Clarice Starling's story and it is she who haunts me the most, years after my first reading. (Which is why the end of Harris's uneven followup &quot;Hannibal&quot; feels like such a cheap betrayal.) And she is the main reason this book deserves to be read and respected as a classic for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"when I started reading this bool I was a little sceptical, because the movie was so great I couldn't belive how the book could be better, boy was I ever wrong! the book blows the movie out of the water. it was almost flawless. I say almost because there is one thing I don't like about thomas harris' writing, he doesn't take the time to introduce us to the characters. Mabey I've been spoiled by authers like Stephen King who take 30 pages to explain a character, but I think its important.If you liked S.O.L. you'll love Thomas Harris' earliar novel Red Dragon, it's even better than this book."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I have to say, that for as scary as the film is, this book is even scarier. The hairs on the back on my neck stood up on end when Clairice was in the darkness of Buffalo Bills house. Thomas Harris has created probably the most interesting characters in Lecter and Clairice.The story goes along without a flaw and you become so engrossed in the plot. It took me only a weekend to read it, I could not put it down.So, like the old saying goes, &quot;If you liked the film, you'll LOVE the book!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book is already a classic for me. Mr. Harris seems to know what he is talking about for the duration of it, and keeps up the pace of suspense, as well as action. Hannibal Lecter is a wonderful villian crafted by Harris. He's every bit as creepy as Sir Anthony Hopkins plays him. I won't bore you on more details, just buy the book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I go back and forth over which treatment of this story I like better, the book or the movie. I have decided finally that though I love Foster's and Hopkin's performances, the book tops the film by a nose. Harris' writing is both beautiful and horrifying, and one can feel the clock ticking as one races to the end of this very scary book that is as much about a recruit coming of age in law enforcement as it is about her catching a killer. In both instances, Starling learns to face her greatest fears and stops the lambs from screaming."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I LOVED this book. A great psychological novel of the utmost importance. Dr. Lector is just great and the novel is left open for a sequel. (Which I'm glad was written!) All of the key factors and characters bring it all together for a well written and highly involved book! Great job!!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I loved this book...what a thriller! Harris is a great writer - he is adept at painting a picture with words."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I have recently read the book The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris for an English assignment. Overall I thought the book was excellent, and I cannot wait to read Hannibal. The book had so much detail on the characters I could see Doctor Hannibal Lecter. Also the detail on the murders was really sickening on what the killer did to his victims. I loved where Dr. Lecter kept FBI agent Clarice Starling guessing on who a serial killer was. I thouroghly enjoyed the book even when it was hard to follow or when there was not a lot of detail on the location. I can definately say this is one of the best books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"\\"Hannibal\\" the movie has come and gone, and, well it has left a lot of people feeling deprived of a thrilling tale of the infamous Dr. Lector. So why not read Silence of the Lambs? I believe it is more bone shaking, heart racing, and thought provoking than the movie itself. And it expresses gender roles in an uncomfortable way! Is there a better way to spend an evening than reading a tale of flesh eating violence while critiquing the social portrayal of feminine culture in this novel? I think not.If you are saying to yourself \\"I have already seen the movie, why read it.\\" STOP thinking that. This book, though very similar to the movie, has more of a literary movement in it and some scenes that are quite different than on screen. Plus, you get the added bonus of letting your imagination scare the you know what out of you not the Hannibal, Anthony Hopkins.If you have not seen the movie, definitely read the book first. You will get so much more out of it thematically and you'll get to read scenes not in the movie. Plus, you'll be that \`smart' person for having read the book before actually seeing the movie. What better way to impress friends!?But down to the important stuff, Thomas Harris has beautifully illustrated feminine struggles in a masculine world in this novel. He captures the awkwardness of women when men doubt their abilities and he displays frustrations deeply rooted in this gender battle to make it to the top. Fall in love with his characters, hate his characters, but you will be befriended by the Hannibal himself. It is truly a love-hate relationship with Dr. Lector. As for the main character Clarice Starling, readers will follow her through strenuous F.B.I training all the way to Buffalo Bill. See her strengths, feel her weakness, hear the lambs, but side with her anyway.Silence of the Lambs by Tomas Harris is beautifully written with chilling scenes and likeable characters as weird as that might sound. The author portrays the struggles of women, stereotypes that apply, and double standards. He explores the objectivity of women through scenes with Clarice and men opposite her. Read this book and find out what exactly the title means and see what it takes to silence the lambs.Methodical prose will leave you clinging to blankets, covering your eyes with every strange sound, and yet, you'll still turn those pages. Is there a better way to spend an evening than reading a tale of flesh eating violence while critiquing the social portrayal of feminine culture in this novel? I think not."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Silence of the Lambs is a remarkable novel for many different reasons. On the surface it is a nonstop suspense novel that performs at the peak of its genre. However, at the novel's core is an emotional struggle that the main character, Clarice, must deal with both her past and stereotypes of her gender in order to achieve her highest goals. Thomas Harris flawlessly blends the suspense and themes and leaves the reader fully satisfied with their experience. As an aspiring FBI agent Clarice Starling is given a chance to prove herself when she is given an assignment by Jack Crawford head of the Behavioral Science division. Her assignment is to interview Dr. Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter. The assignment is far from routine since Hannibal Lecter is one of the most notorious serial killers in recent history. As a result of her first frightening meeting with Dr. Lecter, Clarice is sent on a roller coaster ride as she searches for clues to capture the FBI's latest serial killer &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;. As Clarice begins to evolve in the real FBI lifestyle we learn more details of her past and discover the source of what drives her determination. Dr. Lecter is the ominous interviewer/interviewee that brings out Clarice's past. Surprisingly Lecter also serves as a man that seems just as invested in Clarice's achievement as the reader. The pace of the novel is quite fast. Harris does this by giving us characters that we can relate to and that have issues of their own outside of Clarice's. Characters like Jack Crawford become more real to the reader as he deals with his wife's terminal illness at home. Also, as Clarice gets more involved in the case we find out more about Dr. Lecter and &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; the pace picks up because of the reader's fascination with that which is unknown to them. At the novel's heart, Clarice goes through a dramatic metamorphosis as she learns to deal with men who believe she is best left in a typing pool. Like Dr. Chilton, a man that often seems just as emotionally dead as the serial killers Clarice profiles. Clarice struggles with trying to capture a man who brutally murders women and as she struggles she becomes more successful by using skills that she alone has. Being female give her advantages in detective work that men don't have. If you want a novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat to the very end and has a character that triumphs despite adversity then Silence of the Lambs is it. From Lecter's cell that he calls home to remote areas of West Virginia, prepare for a journey into the minds of madmen and into the discovery one determined woman's soul. Thomas Harris' novel should not be overlooked as one capable of sustaining itself in the modern literary canon. Throughout the novel he maintains his poise as he keeps his characters true to themselves and at the same time not losing sight of our fascination with crime."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"At first glance, Silence of the Lambs is a suspense thriller about the tracking of a skin flaying serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. The main character is Clarice Starling, the beleaguered, yet dogged young FBI agent who is trying to catch Buffalo Bill, with some help from an incarcerated, supra-genius, psychiatrist turned serial killer, Dr. Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter. It is a mouthful, but it seems simple enough.But Silence of the Lambs goes far beyond the tenets of the genre, and it is certainly more than it's pretense of being a suspense novel would suggest. It includes very well woven themes of the concept of a glass ceiling, and Clarice being essentially alone in a man's world. And, further, it is able to communicate all of this while maintaining its tone of suspense and avoiding pretension when facing these issues of a woman in a male dominated field. The novel is a delicate and very well executed balance of dramatization and thematic development.And the character of Hannibal Lecter not only fuels the suspense exponentially, but also is the primary vehicle for the theme of equality. The interactions between Clarice and Dr. Lecter are based on a give and take, \\"quid pro quo\\" as Dr Lecter calls it. And this is definitely a good way to build suspense, as Dr. Lecter knows the answers Clarice is seeking, but will only reveal them through cryptic hints in exchange for information about Clarice herself. I found myself unable to stop reading this book because I the lures that Thomas Harris places are so irresistible. The suspense is embodied in the question of how Clarice can use the next mind game with Lecter to get more information about Buffalo Bill. The thematic development of the concept of gender equality comes through the ways in which Lecter interacts with Clarice. Their relationship is a two-way street, give and take, equal. And, even more impressive, Harris is able to keep this pace throughout the book. He delivers on his themes, while still paving the way for a dynamite ending.Also, I found Hannibal Lecter to be one of the coolest characters in any book I have ever read. He is by no means a hero, but his relationship with Clarice presents a relatively sympathetic picture of a man who would often be considered an absolute monster. And I think it is Lecter that makes this book a suspense thriller. The unusual case of Buffalo Bill notwithstanding, I do not think that the book would have the same quality of suspense without Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He made this book for me.For a book about ghastly murders, Silence of the Lambs is also quite moral. And much of the book's picture of morality is twisted around. It is not so much Dr. Lecter, who fed one of his patients to his friends at a dinner party, that is the moral villain, but rather a member of the FBI, the good guys. Paul Krendler is constantly up in Starling's grill, abusing her in all of the ways implemented commonly by men with power over women. From Starling's perspective, Krendler is the monster; Dr. Lecter is simply \\"misguided\\" (for lack of a better term).So Silence of the Lambs will most certainly impress those readers looking for a good scare and some psychological, mind bending suspense. But it may will appeal to those of us who are not so fond of the suspense\\\\thriller genre as well. I thought that Silence of the Lambs was well written and kept well to its themes while maintaining its suspenseful viscera. It has a little something for everyone, and, oh yeah, it is way better than the movie."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Impressed with the storyline after watching the movie (of the same name) adapted from this novel, I found this book quite intriguing and captivating. And I got this paperback version for ~$5, which was a great bargain!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I saw the film 17 years ago, and it made a steady imprint on my mind -- how could it not? Reading this tightly plotted novel was rewarding. The characters were dimentedly interesting, and the pacing was fast. However, that I saw the film is why the novel lost some of the punch it packs for the unsuspecting reader. This is one of the better suspense novels I have read. Although Harris struggles with his prose in Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs is more smoothly narrated. But Red Dragon is a more captivating character read."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Oh how I wish I hadn't seen the movie before I read this. Both the novel and the movie are terrific in their respective media, but the movie's faithful (for the most part) representation of the book didn't leave much in the way of surprises for the late reader.As with Red Dragon the story mainly revolves around an intelligent and uniquely capable investigator, attempting to solve a string of murderous crimes through thinking like the unknown perpetrator. Clarisse Starling is a student at the FBI academy and is presented with a rare opportunity to do some field work through several interviews with the famed and detained Hannibal Lecter.The conversations between Lecter and Starling provide some semblance of brain teasers and foreshadowing, as well as being very insightful psychologically and interesting.As far as reading the book after seeing the movie goes, there is little that hasn't been spoiled for you already, but there are some interesting expanded developments and the added bonus of reading what goes on through the characters minds.I recommend this book for fans of the movie, or fans of horror/thriller/crime novels in general. It is a short read and will not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Usually I don't read books with such horrific themes as this one.

Buffalo Bill is more disgusting than the tooth fairy and Lector's role in the book is greatly improved. I read this after watching the movie, so I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen, but that didn't stop it from being one of the more interesting books I've read in the past year. If your considering reading this I'd recommend picking up Red Dragon first because the ending of the last book is spoiled about ten pages into this one."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely and got it for a great price in good condition."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Thomas Harris is the real deal, and this is the second time I've read Silence of the Lambs. I loved everything about the story, including:- The well-drawn characters, esp. the heroine: Clarice Starling, the FBI trainee from a poor background. How Harris describes her--her hillbilly idioms, the chip on her shoulder, her perception of sexism from her colleagues--is flat-out brilliant. The other characters are equally well-defined, like her boss Crawford with his dying wife and, of course, Dr. Lecter.- The original, interesting prose. Harris writes prose that's both unique yet utterly unpretentious. For example, in describing a guy nervous about asking Clarice out on a date, Harris writes, \\"Pilcher polished his teeth, his tongue moving behind his lips like a cat beneath the covers.\\" Brilliant!- The excellent dialog. Again, like the prose, unique yet not contrived. There are so many zingers in the novel, and the dialog adds to the character of the person speaking. Roger Ebert commented about this line in the movie--which was, of course, taken from the novel. In looking over a dead body, Clarice notices the body wore glitter polish on her fingers, and she says, \\"Looks like town to me.\\" Here, not only is the expression interesting, it shows Clarice's poor background growing up.- Structure. Though Harris doesn't write in super-short prose of, say, James Cain or even Ira Levin, you're never bored in this novel. From beginning to end, you just trust that Harris knows what he's doing--and he does.So . . . overall, 5 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Don't take this wrong, the movie was excellent. But the book has so much more riveting detail that wasn't incorporated into the film. Thomas Harris is in a league of his own, the master of creating suspense. Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb are two of the sickest fictional sociopaths ever created. The Silence of the Lambs is one of my all-time favorite books. If you haven't read this book yet, now is the time."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Writers of &quot;thinking people's horror&quot; novels face an interesting challenge. Once a franchise viably captures the public's imagination, readers demand sophisticated, exciting innovations on a familiar theme. However, as the bar gets raised higher and higher, and as readers become de-sensitized, most series inevitably go stale or become far-fetched. A good example is the sagging work of Canadian author Michael Slade, who like Thomas Harris, launched a series based on brilliant serial killers with a flair for ingenious, over-the-top gorefests, replete with historical context and arcane erudition. The difference is, Thomas Harris takes a very long time between installments; and therefore, Harris fans are justified in believing they deserve better.The Hannibal Lecter series reached this &quot;what next&quot; juncture in the last decade, with The Silence Of The Lambs. At the end of that novel, readers were left with the impression that the series would follow a Hannibal Lecter let loose on the world, free to travel and kill in new and creative ways, in diverse and exotic locales, while staying one step ahead of the law - a cannibalistic version of Anne Rice's globetrotting vampire superstars.In writing Hannibal, Mr. Harris was clearly cognizant of the need to keep his series unpredictable. His choice of plot does accomplish that objective, but in ways that may leave fans feeling disappointed.Instead of a dashing Scarlet Pimpernel of cannibalism, Hannibal Lecter 3.0 is a stuffy, academic type, ensconced in a low-key arts curator job in Italy, indulging his appetite for fine arts and foods rather than for people. Indeed, one almost suspects that Lecter's violence is justified under a reluctant vigilante ethos, and that he'd gladly not bother a soul, as long as he's left alone under protective cover, free at last to pursue his arts research. Hannibal's charisma is dimmer here (as an offbeat analogy, compare Harrison Ford's roles today with his Han Solo character in Star Wars).This plot judo gives Mr. Harris license to turn many tables on us. First, he dials down Lecter's threat quotient to purely reactive mode, morphing Lecter into an almost sympathetic character motivated by a desire for anonymity and a need to heal the scars of his own childhood.Having put Lecter in neutral, Mr. Harris stokes the fires of dementia in a Class A nemesis, Mason Verger - an abominable child abuser and clever manipulator of political power, whom Lecter had horribly (justly?) victimized in times past. Driven insane by a need for revenge, and suitably well financed, Verger insists on bringing Lecter out of his shell; a laborious plot strand that is moderately entertaining but too obviously telegraphed to be particularly disturbing. Third, the author reduces the FBI to Mason Verger's tool -- a bunch of infighting, incompetent bureaucrats, venal and corrupt, concerned more with media politics than with apprehending criminals. Allegorically, the real monster in Hannibal is not Lecter, but &quot;the system&quot; - wealthy bad guys and the goverment that colludes with them.As if all this were not enough, Mr. Harris puts Clarice Starling on an emotional intersection course with Hannibal Lecter. The results of that strange alliance will strain the credulity of even the most flexible-minded readers. Even the author's elegant prose and stylized horror scenography backfire, lending an aura of John Cleese-like formal absurdity to a final dinner episode that was supposed to horrify.At the end of the day, this series' fans probably deserved an outrageously wild and energetic Hannibal Lecter novel at this point in the series. Instead, Thomas Harris decided to give us the literary equivalent of an Adagio. Therefore, Hannibal leaves open some questions that may be more interesting than the novel itself. Is Hannibal the beginning of the decline in the Cannibal series? Did Thomas Harris &quot;go Hollywood&quot;? Or is he transitioning into fresh, creative new territory? Let's hope we don't have to wait ten more years to find out."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Twenty-one (21) years after seeing the movie, I finally read Silence of the Lambs (1988) and I'm glad I did. (However, I must confess, although I liked the movie, it did not inspire me to read the book.)When the time is right, like magic, a book can seem to reads itself. And that's what Silence of the Lambs did for me. I was favorably struck by how easy the book was to read, like candy, and how the author seemed to go out of his way not to get bogged down in too much detail, so as not to make the book dense and a chore to read.I did have some concerns about the book's plot:Why would the FBI rely so heavily on Hannabal Lector, a very bad guy, to help them solve their case?Why would Jack Crawford pick Clarice Starling, an FBI student, to interface with the dangerous Lector?Also, I thought Jack Crawford's struggle with his dying wife Bella's illness (cancer?) was amazingly similar to retire Detective Edward X. Delaney's struggle with his dying wife Barbara's illness (Proteus infection) in Lawrence Sanders' The 1st Deadly Sin (1973).Additions concerns:What is the probability Hannabal Lector would actually know Jame Gumb a.k.a. Buffalo Bill? (A case of birds of a feather flocking together?)Or that Lector's fictional name for the killer: William (Bill) Rubin would contain the same name the newspapers' tagged him with: Buffalo Bill, and the police not question the coincidence?Also, what's with authors (Thomas Harris, Lawrence Sanders, John Lutz, etc.) using West Virginia (my home state) as a source of villains and as a dumping ground for bodies?"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I finally got around to reading Silence of the Lambs.

Thomas Harris superbly brings together suspense, drama and probably the most recognizable and original characters EVER!! This book incorporates material of a technical nature from the nature of moths to established psychological methodology, this book thrives with chills, it has a protagonist, a woman (different maybe) Federal Agent/Student Clark Starling who is assigned to talk to renowned cannibal/serial killer andex-psychiatrist Dr Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter, to help her try and catch another killer on the loose - Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb who is quite content on abducting women and using their skins to make an outfit - Gruesome. He is clever to leave no traces and the FBI have a real battle on their hands when the U.S. Senators daughter, young Katherine Martin falls prey to the killer, she is trapped in his basement lair and fed scraps of food, as the plot thickens and Clark has a few more visits to Hannibal maximum security prison the plot finally reveals that the nutter on the loose is in fact a sort of practicing transsexual and the FBI are now in a race against time to save Katherine Martin's life, before the monster flays her body for the skin.With magnificent dialogue and build up to the tense stuff, including Hannibal's miraculous escape, this book is a serious candidate for best book EVER!! In my opinion. The fundamentals of psychiatry are very well explained and the actual simplisity of the final lesson on how to find the killer is quite revealling, \\" What does he covet\\" - \\" we covet what we see every day\\" - he knew her, quite easy to figure out funny how they missed that detail."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"In my habit, I insisted on readin 'The Silence of the Lambs' before seeing the movie. While the movie is great, the book is even better.In this book, we meet Clarice Starling, a student at the FBI academy. She is a very bright, driven woman, but is haunted by memories of her past: The death of her beloved father, the sound of lambs scraming before they are slaughtered that she cannot erase from her head.Hannibal is an intelligent, charming criminal who feeds on bad feelings and will happily kill those who are rude to him. Although he is made out to be a villian, I don't know anybody who has read the book without growing to like him.Clarice is sent to interview 'Hannibal the Cannibal', at first just to see if they could get a psychological test done on him. Soon Clarice learns that Hannibal has knowledge involving the brutal killings of several young women that have been occuring recently. Soon, she is plunged into to search, frantically trying to rescue the next young woman. But there are some people who will do their best to make sure that she does not succeed.'The Silence of the Lambs' is a brilliantly written psychological thriller, with great insights into the human character, characters will cannot help but have feelings toward(be the feelings love or hate), and a good amount of tension.

No-can-do!There is almost no suspense because the action lies with Hannibal who really has nothing to do with the story.The author obviously loves his character Hannibal too much, so he gave him a major portion for an insignificant roll.Which makes for monstrous boredom."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book is based on true events.

Unfortunately, the story and charatcers are a complete wash. Clarice Starling is a pasty, uninteresting heroine, devoid of distinctiveness. Basically, for all the attention bestowed upon her, she comes off as nothing more than a young woman who can't get over her haunting childhood. And Buffalo Bill makes for a ridiculous serial killer; there's no insight or alluring texture to this particular killer -- he's simply a sensationalistic boogy man. In RED DRAGON, author Harris brilliantly conceived a fascinating hero and a just-as-fascinating villian for his nerve-jangling tale. Here, we have a generic plot and characters who just aren't worth engaging in. A bust"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I can't say anything that's not already been said about this novel. For years, I refused to read \\"The Silence Of The Lambs,\\" because I love the movie. I've since been kicking myself, because the novel is slightly better. Although, I love the movie, this novel lets you truly step inside the story. It's chilling, it's thought-provoking---it's just plain BRILLIANT!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"What more can be said about this book? Harris is as meticulous about the study of human behavior as his characters are about the science of criminal profiling. Yet, the science does not war with the primitive creepy crawly feeling presented by the characters. Buffalo Bool is deranged and fascinating, Hannibal Lecter is charming, captivating and something very close to genuine Evil. This is a novel that is already being studied in classrooms and that will continue for generations. But Harris won't let you forget that this is a horror novel. Learn all you want from it and glean all the insights you can handle. It will still make you feel like a five year old concerned about what might be living inside the closet across the room.-- Mark LaFlamme, author of \\"The Pink Room.\\""},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"In the middle book of the Hannibal Lecter series, FBI trainee Clarice Starling is given the odd task of questioning Hannibal \\"the Cannibal\\" Lecter to build up a psychological profile on him.

This is probably one of the best books I've ever read. It really sucks you in and won't let you go till you're finished. Harris has an interesting way with characterization. A simple, unimportant fact about a character can render you emotionally connected to them. You'll like this book if you like the movie. You'll like this book if you like thrillers. You'll like this book if you are just a fan of well written books. Whatever, just get it!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I've read every novel by Thomas Harris and this has to be the top one. If you have a pulse then the movie has been in your VCR or DVD player at one time or another. I must say if you rely solely on the movie you are missing some wonderful writing. Most people have seen the movie and it follows the plot of book, so I won't bore people with a long-winded review. The novel starts out with an eager student (Clarice Starling) being offered a chance to interview Hannibal Lector. The purpose is to extract information that can be used to catch a killer that is kidnapping and skinning young women. The interview turns interesting, and Hannibal has himself a new toy to play with: Clarice starling. The book is a step up from RED DRAGON, which is the first novel in the Hannibal series. Although a very good read, RED DRAGON'S killer can't compare to Buffalo Bill, and Hannibal is a charismatic character that breathes life into the pages. I missed his prescence in the previous novel, as RED DRAGON has small snippets of Hannibal Lector; which is why THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a step up being that the entire novel revolves around Hannibal.I've read many nonfiction books on serial killers and Thomas Harris has done his homework (Harris modeled Jack Crawford after John Douglas who has written several books about the monsters he's chased while in the FBI. MINDHUNTER is the top book if serial killers are your thing). If you want a glimpse into the mind of a killer, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is the book; it has to be one of the top thrillers of all time. I would highly recommend reading RED DRAGON first, and then THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS; it will give you some foundation in which to follow Hannibal Lector. Silence is an excellent read and I will read it again many times."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The Silence of the Lambs is possibly one of the most enjoyable and worthwhile reads that has been written in the last fifteen years. Beyond the power of its suspense (if there is any life in you, then you honestly won't be able to put it down), there is a grim thematic development that covers a good deal of psychological territory. Through the story of Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, there is a horrific comment on what drives us, what scares us, and what opposes us. Clarice interviews the cannibalistic psychopath, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and comes closer and closer finding the elusive serial killer \\"Buffalo Bill,\\" but while doing so must come face to face with her own fears and inhibitions. One of the most important themes of the novel is gender empowerment. This becomes apparent in almost every character of the book. Buffalo Bill's motive for murdering so many innocent women is for the simple purpose of using their skins to create one of his own. He wants to be a woman, but sees women only as the society Thomas Harris has created sees them - as skin. It seems as if Clarice is constantly fighting to advance and overcome the restrictions of being female. Jack Crawford gives her a first assignment, giving her a chance to advance and break through the glass ceiling. Her conversations with Dr. Lecter reveal the secrets of her childhood - a mother that failed to conquer the limits of being a woman when her husband died. A mysterious moth, found in the throat of a victim becomes, psychoanalytically, to be symbolic of the image of a parent buried in the subconscious. This is what Clarice, as a woman, has to go on, but as the story progresses we see how she becomes a stronger and more resourceful person. Just as Senator Martin's political sway helps her in the search for her daughter, and Catherine Martin uses the dog Precious to hold Buffalo Bill at bay, Clarice learns to use what is around her to reach her prize. There is a drastic change in Clarice's abilities from when she first enters the asylum and meets Dr. Chilton, the director. He is looking for a date, while she is looking for information. She realizes she could have gotten more if she would have used some charm. After her first meeting with Lecter she is hit in the face with most masculine thing possible - semen. Later in the novel she will learn to overcome her gender restrictions, using charm and wit in the investigation - with the entomologist Dr. Pilcher, and others who can give her information. Of course, there is also the strong element of suspense, which is the driving force of the dramatic aspects of the novel. It is truly a nail-biter as we follow Clarice on the trail towards Buffalo Bill. Harris crafts the tension of the story, revealing one piece of evidence after another to bring us closer to a thrilling climax in a dark basement. This book is on the level of other suspense writers such as Stephen King, and should not be overlooked as a powerful addition to the modern canon."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Clarice Starling is an F.B.I. agent in training who is chosen by Jack Crawford, the head of the federal department dealing with serial killers, for a very unusual assignment. She is to talk with Doctor Hannibal Lecter (nicknamed \\"The Cannibal\\" because of his tendency to dine on his victims) to further a study of the intellectual and psychological aspects of a killer's mind, and possibly aid in the capture of a murder still at large. Jack Crawford warns Clarice that Dr. Lecter is a brilliant man and she should use caution when revealing information about herself, for Lecter loves to manipulate people using their history and emotions for his own benefit and enjoyment. Because Lecter knows the identity of the murderer (nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kidnaps, kills, skins, and makes clothes out of girls to satisfy his transsexual needs), he begins to play a twisted game of Clue with Clarice. In exchange for personal information about herself, Dr. Lecter provides riddles that lead her in the right direction, if she is smart enough to figure them out. The most interesting aspect of Hannibal Lecter comes from the conflict between his brilliance and his insanity. Thomas Harris does not go into great detail about Hannibal's past crimes (the dreadfulness of his deeds is left to the reader's imagination). He makes it known that Lecter is a madman, prone to serving up his victims with fava beans. One would expect such a character to be completely off his rocker, but Lecter is very calm, controlled, even serene when he speaks with Clarice. The reader comes to admire his brilliance and is intrigued by Lecter's psychological insights. But, the reader asks, how can such a madman be so human? Thomas Harris portrays him as your next door neighbor, your co-worker, even your best friend, and, in doing so, implies the theme that ANYONE can be a maniac. As a result, the reader begins to see the reality in which he lives in a new light. The reader begins questioning everyone's true being, looking over his shoulder, and fleeing at the mere mention of fava beans. Hannibal Lecter is truly a beautifully thought out character who everyone loves to hate. The Silence of the Lambs is a well written psychological thriller that will keep any reader on the edge of their seat. Although the plot is frightening enough, Thomas Harris brings the reader to a new level of fear, one which can only be reached by allowing the reader to enter inside the mind of the antagonist. This book is smart, exciting, horrifying, and even funny at some points. The Silence of the Lambs has something for everybody."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"After I read Red Dragon (the fabulous prequel of The Silence of The Lambs), I couldn't wait to read The Silence of the Lambs. I was totally blown away by this book. I could just sit for hours and read the things Hannibal said. As a matter of fact, I did! It was great when Hannibal would ask Clarice about the screaming lambs and the way he played with people's minds. Anyone with a weak stomach shouldn't read this. You'll know why when you get to what Hannibal did to Pembry and the other (his name slips my mind). Everytime you begin one chapter, you can't wait to get to the next. It's hard for me to talk about this because it was so well thought out and it's the best book I have ever read. I'm now reading Hannibal and I already love it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This was a fascinating, masterful work of suspense. If you've got a strong stomach, don't hesistate to read it. Harris expertly twines suspense, drama, and action into a gripping page turner. His characters are rounded and deep, his plot has terrific flow. It's hard not to admire Hannibal Lecter and his creator. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"After seeing the movie some time ago, I was really curious to read the book and see how it was. I am so glad that I read it, because I think it's a work of art. Thomas Harris has created a masterpiece of a frightening tale that will send shivers down your spine and keep you up at night. You will never forget the name, \\"Hannibal Lecter,\\" no matter how hard you try.Here is the story: Clarice Starling is a young and promising FBI trainee who is a lot more clever than she leads others to believe. She is sent to talk to Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter. This evil fiend is so frightening and brilliant that it will scare the hell out of you. He loves to play mind games and get into the heads of others. He has an agenda of his own, and claims that he can help Starling become famous by catching the notorious woman killer, Buffalo Bill. As the plot gets deeper and deeper, the more evil and darkness lurks about. Killing is only part of the plan, as it turns out. Clarice just might not make it so graduate to an FBI agent if she's not careful.This is a very suspenseful novel that is very well written. A classic, at that. I actually enjoyed reading this just a little more better than seeing the movie. Though the two are almost the same, the descriptions Harris gives us are unforgettable and horrifying. I especially like how Harris describes Lecter's great escape. Very well-constructed, indeed! The dialogue that spews from Hannibal's mouth is terrifying and ingenius at the same time.I really enjoyed this novel, and I plan to read it again. I also read \\"Hannibal,\\" but I didn't find that one as enjoying. All in all, this is an outstanding novel that paints a nightmarish world with evil so terrifying it makes us shiver with ever word that is read. This book will make you thank your lucky stars that it's only fiction...... or is it?"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee at Quantico, is called by Jack Crawford, special agent to go and question Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

She uses this information with minimal sucess. Meanwhile, the killer has kidnapped the daughter of the senator of Tennessee. She makes a deal with Lecter that will give him a cell in New york if he gives the name of the killer.I will not give away any more information regarding the plot because that would ruin your reading. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is one of the best books written in the genre and all books period. I must admit that the first 60 pages or so are slow but don't stop because of it (I almost did). Read this novel and be sure to read &quot;Red Dragon&quot; too. A definite must read.

This book was definitely a page turner."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Silence Of The Lambs, by Thomas Harris, is a well written and totally engrossing novel. Harris's tightly woven plot holds his reader's attention from the beginning to the very end. For anyone who hasn't read this book, it is about the FBI and their efforts to catch a psychopathic killer. In order to achieve this goal, the FBI enlists the help of an FBI student/trainee and an incarcerated madman. Harris's writing in this novel is very descriptive, but not bogged down in detail. And with it, he successfully paints excellent pictures of the plot and action in the minds of his readers. Harris's characters are all well written and well thought out. Readers come to loathe some characters, like Dr.Chilton, while at the same time becoming quite attached to others, like Clarice Starling and Jack Crawford. Because Harris has drawn his characters with a great deal of consistancy, by the end of the novel readers are able to predict what certain characters will do based on their personalities and past actions. Starling, the main character, is strong-willed, yet sensitive because she always tries to do the right thing and also takes into account other character's best interests. The ending of this novel is just as good as it is built up to be. Harris successfully wraps up The Silence Of The Lambs, and also skillfully manages to leave the ending open-ended, so that a sequel can follow. I think that this is an excellent book for many reasons, but most of all, because it kept my attention from page one on, and because Dr.Lecter, the madman, always has something thoughtful yet bizarre to say."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"When I tried to read this book for the first time, on 1998, I gave up. Found it a bit dull. But then, last year, Thomas Harris released HANNIBAL, and it gave me some input again because I wanted to read the sequel, and to read it, I didn't want to without reading the part one, last call it so.Then, when I started reading it finally, I took only two days to read it. Though, I really saw no reason for this book to be that famous.It's the kind of book you do enjoy reading. It has many detective and psychological elements that makes the reader want to know what's next. Clarice Starling is a loving character, and Dr. Hannibal Lecter is really a complete enigma. He's so good you hate because he doesn't appear so much in the book as you'd like to. I think the book would be better if Dr. Lecter appeared more often in the plot.Anyway, it's a very good reading. The kind of book you read fast and reaches the ending thinking you've just read a nice work. Thomas Harris is really a good author. But we have to admit, the wonderful movie based on this book was really what made the book in fact be so famous. Though, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is really the kind of book for any lover of the genre to read. Even because this book was the first real thriller ever written, that inspired many other books. You won't be disappointed. It's really worthwhile.Also recommended: THE BONE COLLECTOR, by Jeffery DeaverMarco Aurelio."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"When you hear about &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, you probably start immediately to remember some scenes from the movie starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. It is difficult to write something about a story that is so well known, basically by its adaptation for the screen which has been buried under a heap of academy awards.There is hardly something I could add with respect to the other customer reviews. It is a well-written, gripping, interesting novel about the evil side of life. You probably know the story: A young FBI trainee is sent to &quot;Hannibal the cannibal&quot; with the aim of finding something about his (Lecter's) psychological situation. But soon it turns out that Hannibal Lecter knows something about a series of murders in which the victims are skinned and scalped. This case is the main interest of Clarice Starling's boss. The discovery of new victims, the kidnapping of the daughter of a U.S. senator and the jealousy of the director of Lector's prison make some complications which speed up the story and keep it going until the final confrontation of Trainee-Agent Starling with the murderer is reached.Of course, it is impossible to adapt a novel for the screen without losing details. But especially in this &quot;psycho&quot; thriller, the thoughts, surroundings, and feelings of the people are of interest; and this &quot;fine structure&quot; is likely to get lost in the movie. Also in this case. The details of the figures are far more interesting (and are far better developed) than the struggle to find something out about the psychological motives and situations of the murderer. The latter was a tiny bit disappointing for me since I had hoped that more information would be contained in the book than in the film.But nonetheless, this story is a page-turning roller-coaster into the depths of the human souls, not frightening, but terrifying."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Of all three of the Hannibal novels, this one was the most enthralling. It grabs you by the throat from the moment you pick it up. Clarice Starling's character is a lot more developed and glimpses into her past is more revealing than the cursory glance the movie gave her. Hannibal himself seems more human somehow in this storyline as well...still psychotic, but human nonetheless. Start with this book if you're new to the Hannibal trilogy."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"It's splendid when a book or story can envelop you for days.

Thomas Harris is a genius in writing chilly books. While reading this, I thought every night that Hannibal Lecter would come and kill me. I gave this book a 10 and THE ALIENIST, to which this has been compared to, a 9. Why? Because Harris acheives his goal totally-he gets the hell scared out of you, he doesn't bore, and all the facts are neatly in line. The Alienist had some boring parts, so I gave it a 9. But The Alienist was a much better book overall-great description, great plot, great research, great characters, great suspense."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"As usual, if you read a book and then see the movie, you are disappointed, even if the movie was pretty good. There is so much more here in the novel - the description about the difficulty of holding a freshly removed human skin comes to mind. I first read the book after hearing Roald Dahl recommend it on a particularly snooty BBC radio show about books. On the radio show, guests picked books and everyone had to read everyone else's selections. Roald Dahl chose 'The Silence Of The Lambs', the other guest chose something like 'Travels In The Holy Land With A Camera'. She was particularly incensed at Mr.Dahl's selection and had to admit she had had difficulty retaining her copy as people picked it up and did not return it. &quot;Urgh&quot;, she said and &quot;it is repulsive&quot; and &quot;once I started it, I had to finish it&quot;. That got my interest and of course, Roald Dahl's recommendation sealed it. This is a tremendous, dark, foreboding story with probably the greatest bad guy in recent times. If you still can, read the book and then maybe see the movie."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I never read a darker, better, more shocking and fascinating book than SotL.

Some may be afraid to read the book, fearing it will be too intense. To these readers I say: Hodgeposh! Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece. With every sentence litereally tying into the next, and every turn of the page a surprise; no reader can say they have read a book, until they have read this. The award-winning film did an excellent job mimicking this book, but the book succeeds in wraping the reader into a hypomotized state, like no other book has before. Pick up this book and prepare for a long night, for it will be hard to go to sleep without finding out what the mysterious Buffalo Bill will do next."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Sets the standard in psychological terror. If you haven't seen the movie yet, read the novel first, then see the characters brought to life brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. Absolutely spellbinding. I wish more novels were like this...Thomas, you're due for another :)"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I regard this novel as a 20th-century classic. I wore out my paperback version and had to buy the hardback. It annoys me to hear people so often say that they haven't read the novel because they found the movie too disturbing. Yes, the movie did a good job of representing the novel - but this is a truly extraordinary work of literature! Not since Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; or Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; has such a masterful work been written about the darker side of humanity. I will defer to the other reviews listed here and use this as a place to ask my own question: where has Harris gone? Did he intimidate himself with his own novel? I understand he only finishes a novel once every 5 years or so, but he is certainly overdue now!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I'm a Thomas Harris fan, so I enjoy all of his books. Thisnovel isn't as good as THE RED DRAGON but it is better thanHANNIBAL. I love the escape sence. I would recommend this book. *** I would also recommend a novel called, THE FIST OF GOD by A.T. Nicholas. It's a great supernatural thriller! He's signing the first three thousand copies sold through Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read this book years ago, and was absorbed by it then. I'm about to reread it now because I've recently read Red Dragon and Hannibal, and want to go back with the dual advantages of hindsight and foresight. What a lovely treat this will be.I remember several things about this book: how cinematic it was, especially the butterfly scene; how fascinating the characters were; and how chilling Lecter's raw violence was when unleashed. Then I saw the movie, and was delighted by the actors' interpretation of the characters, the butterfly scene, and how nicely the movie followed the book in portraying the violence. It can be good to know when to look away.Do read this if you haven't. Harris manipulates both his words and his readers with rare mastery."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book was just incredible and I recommend it to anyone who likes to read phsycological thrillers."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Silence of the Lambs is ten times better than Hannibal, but not quite as good as The Triumph and the Glory, or Memoirs of a Geisha.

I don't know why, but it is a shame."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I'm an avid reader, though I don't usually read horror. I've dabbled into some Stephen King, and that's it.

For horror fans, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best books I have read to date. A smart, gruesome novel.

It was spectacular beyond anything I could have predicted. The depth with which you see the characters is amplifyed by the skillful subtlety which Mr. Harris uses.

A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read the book, \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", written by Thomas Harris. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with five being the highest) I give it a 5. It's definately a 5 because the details are extraodinary. The Silence of the lambs is a fast paced book, which makes it hard to put down. There is never a dull moment. Thomas Harris is an excellent writer. The charecters Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starlingare each unique, and the psycological aspects of this book, are outstanding. \\"well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming?\\" (Harris p.366). Harris' amazing use of words and interaction between charecters makes this book \\"spine-tingling\\" and \\"master of suspense,\\" claims the Boston Herald. In this book you can follow Clarice Starling, a trainee of behavioral science unit of the F.B.I as she tried to find a deadly serial killer on the loose. As well as tracking the killer, she is beginning to learn the psycological games of the one and only Dr.Hannibal Lector as he is locked away in a dark prison chamber. If you are into suspenseful, scary, mystery-horror books, then \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" is definately a book that you should check out. If you liked Hannibal by Thomas Harris or \\"Felony Murder\\" by Joseph T. Klempher, you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read- or, should I say, for purposes of being more apropos and hip, feasted- upon this scrumptious delight of a tome many years ago, and still, it is my belief that THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS by Thomas Harris deserves all sorts and kinds of heralding accolades. It is a wicked, gruesome book full of morally-slack characters cavorting amidst lustily evil situations, sickly slick and smooth as viscous chocolate syrup sliding richly down a voluptuous dinner pastry, the high-caloric content of which threatens to pop your literary centers with hyperglycemic glee- it is that much fun, and more.Forgive the rococo opening, never mind the baroque veneer, it somehow seemed not only fitting, but requisite. The truth of the matter is, it was such a joy to take the text in. This is one of the few books I keep right by my bedside, always at the ready so that I may open to any random section and peruse little bits of prose or gorge myself on macro clumps of paragraphs. The tale was told with such a proficient and savant-like manner that it kept the reader as satiated as an ion that has finally hooked up with a stray electron, thus allowing it to indulge in its octet-rule impulse; I say you will find yourself employing as stable and spontaneous an equilibrium of attention span in the face of Harris's plot motives. The arachnid muse at the center of the spooky writing weaves a silky, cocooning thread, mummifying and preserving as it goes, so that we may all survive to the bitter, venomous end, where we willingly allow all of our blood tissue to be sucked away so that the terror may finally cease.I'm telling you, it was just that kind of book. Seriously. LAMBS is the story of a bitter character triangle composed of three vertices: Clarice Starling, neophyte member of the Quantico FBI academy, Dr. Hannibal Lector, a brilliant psychiatrist whose quotient of intelligence is only exceeded by his aptitude for sadistic cannibalism, and Jame Gumb, the serial-killing creature behind the sarcastic nickname of Buffalo Bob. Starling is given the task of conducting a series of interviews with the maximally imprisoned Lector for informational purposes, but the goal eventually shifts into a schematic for snaring the elusive, moth-raising Gumb. The daughter of ritzy senator Ruth Martin is held in agonizing captivity at the murderer's abode (or, dungeon of horrors might be better phraseology), and Special Agent Jack Crawford, Starling's superior, allows his underling to probe Lector for help in finding her. Hannibal knows who Buffalo Bob is, but he isn't about to just hand him over to Clarice, now, is he? No. There is fun to be had. The good doctor knows the inner workings of the mind, he is aware of all the switches and buttons, he wants to flick and press them all. Through a series of taut, alluring exchanges, Lector gives as much as he gets, and what he gets is personal background on Starling. She tells him about the death of her father and her not-so-affluent upbringing and the shrill shriek of the slaughtered sheep she had the bad luck to hear, a hellish auditory tattoo on her challenged psyche. Lector wallows in all of it like a porcine mammal in mud, and he allows his analysis to run free and unfettered, even as it plays upon the sensitivities of poor Clarice. But besides entertainment value, it also serves as a way of escape- a quite gruesome one, in fact.One of the great things about LAMBS' design is that it deals with plot, concept, and characterization all at the same time, providing an efficient and streamlined course of events. When Starling and Lector engage in dialogue, we see the main hook of the novel in action. But, at the same time, we chip away at the granite slab of mystery as well, coming ever so closer to the sculpture of denouement hidden within. Further still, the dimensions of the main players involved begin to expand inward, outward, and upward, covering all the bases necessary to exert fully-formed theoretical people that we both care for and want to know more about. Harris achieves mesmerizing results with such a strategy. LAMBS also works as a complex police procedural, a multitude of technical allusions always present; this allows a vicarious feeling to form, placing the reader in the shoes of an agent on a hot trail. In this sense, Harris can be compared to Michael Crichton, an author at home with adding verisimilitude via detailed jargon.The star of the show is, of course, Hannibal \\"the cannibal\\" Lector. His character inspires and extracts an odd, contradictory awe. On the one hand, he is at home with a boundless sense of civil propriety; on the other hand, he is at home with gutting a person with a gourmet knife and then consuming the eviscerated edibles. There is never an actual intimation that Lector is any sort of hero, anti or otherwise, but his smooth sophistication, coupled with his incredibly intelligent pronouncements, cast a shadow over the protagonist inclinations of Clarice; she is the main character, she is the heroine, but it is Lector's shameless torturous debauchery that we covet.THE SILENECE OF THE LAMBS excels as a piece of prime pop literature. If there is to be any criticism, I would note that there is a small subplot- not even that, really, maybe sketch might be a better term- involving the aforementioned Crawford's dying wife (I am still searching for clues in regards to its involvement). But that quibble is minute; I think this is a great book, and hope you do as well."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Then this book is for you!Personally, I found that the book would get highly intriguing when Lecter and Starling were sharing thoughts but its almost like Mr. Harris wanted to lull you to sleep with high detail about whatever it was (say when he injects you with high detail &amp; blandness about Jack Crawford &amp; his wife).If you want to delve deeper than the movie did, then read the book (and you can do that with the sequel, Hannibal).. it gives you more detail about Starling and Lecter than the movie shares. It makes for an interesting read when you've got more detail to work with the next time you watch the movie.And if you're just morbid &amp; looking for psychological depth, have fun!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I simply LOVED this book. I enjoyed it a lot. A great psychological novel of the greatest importance. Dr. Lector is just great and the novel is left open for a sequel. (Which I'm glad was written, the movie wasn't too shabby either!) All of the key factors and characters bring it all together for a well written and highly involved book! Great job writing &gt; Mr. Lector! make sure you read the sequel!!!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The Silence of the Lambs, written by Thomas Harris, is a thrilling look into the eyes of a serial killer. Showing us what a person is truly capable of doing. In this book as well as Thomas Harris's pervious book, Red Dragon, the charactor Hannibal Lector is introduced, showing us the extreme evil that one person can pocess. Harris was most likely influenced while writing writing this book by the serial killers of the time, such as Ted Buddy and Jeffrey Domer. Which he used in creating Hannibal Lector, so it really touches and often grabs your inner most sence of fear. If you just watched the movie you will never understand the true terror this book contains, for the movie doesn't capture the events taking place as Harris does. The elaborate usage of description, such as how Clarice Starling, a FBI student asided to study Hannibal Lector, feels as she searches the storage room that Lector told her to look through. Harris makes you feel as if you are there with Starling and you feel what she feels, as her heart jumps so does yours. Clarice Starling, an extremely detected FBI trainee, is called by her boss, Section Cheif Jack Crawford, and asked to make an analysis of serial killer Hannibal Lector so to learn anything useful for the carture of an other serial killer still at large called Buffalo Bill. As in real life Harris shows how the FBI uses profilling to help make an assumption of how the criminal mind thinks. Starling is told to be cautious of what she reveals to Lector for he is a gifted psychopath who knows how to mulipulate people to tear them down so he may lead them to their deaths. Nicknamed &quot;Hannibal the Cannibal&quot; because he likes to eat the body parts of his victims, Starling is very apprehensive of what to exspect but reluctantly agrees to the assignment because she knows it would be very good for her career. Taken from every bit of physical contact from people, Lector is locked in a glass cell so to protect outside people from him. From here Lector is able to toy with Starling by giving her a little bit of information that she is suppose to use if she is cleaver enough to lead her to the murder. She is also faced with a struggle with time for Buffalo Bill has taken another victim. Can Starling figure out what Lector has shown her before another young woman is found dead?"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I can't say that I had high expectations for this book, which turned out to be a good thing. I felt like I was reading an episode of Law & Order. There was zero in the way of character development. Sure, I knew what school the protagonist was going to and basic information about her room mate and a flashback here and there to her childhood. But overall, I didn't really get to know or care about the characters.I kept waiting for it to get scary but it really didn't do it for me. The tension wasn't built quite well enough for me, nor was the writing particularly interesting. In fact, I noted that there were 3 pages in a row where every single paragraph started with, \\"Starling...\\" (which is the main character's name). \\"Starling went to the bank..\\" \\"Starling thought long and hard, \\" Starling woke up and then walked around for awhile.\\"Everyone was either good or bad, there was just basically no depth at all.Overall, I'm not impressed."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Everyone knows the story of silence of the lambs, so i wont summarize it.I had a huge problem with the pacing of this book. The opening of most of the chapters was crisp, compelling, and engaging, but it often faulted mid chapter. The last few chapters seemed to play catch up, helplessly attempting to fill in the blanks.my biggest problem was the fact that it missed its mark on engaging me. It had numerous opportunities to shock the reader by pushing the boundaries, however it failed to do this on numerous occasions. What is ultimately really disappointing is the fact that the movie was scarier and had a more \\"edge on your seat\\" feel. At times i felt it used too much descriptive words, what at others i felt it failed to 'fill in the blanks'.i know i know, im sorry. it just wasn't enough of a thriller for me."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I loved this book. But not as much as I loved Red Dragon. Halfway through reading Silence of the Lamb, I felt like something was missing and soon realised that what I missed was the monstrosity that was Francis Dolarhyde aka the Red Dragon.Francis was one villain who had balls and character. I was enchanted by Thomas' depiction of this family killer. He even had the courage to want to consume Dr. Lecter, in aid of his Becoming. And at the same time, he wowed us with his humanity as he grew to love the blind girl (I forget her name now...) Francis Dolarhyde, for the most part, managed to easily outshadow even the terrible Hannibal.Compare that to Jame Gumb (the name sounds lame, reminds me of Forrest Gump..). Jame seems to be some sort of queer who doesn't seem to terrify us at all. I mean, the guy's sewing a dress for himself...! I guess Silence of the Lambs' saving grace was Lecter's turning of the tables in the second half of the book as he made his daring getaway.Starling's character was well established, though we do miss Will Graham's intensity and vision. All in all, a great book. Read it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I absolutely thought that the best parts of this novel were the sections that contained Dr. Lecter's dialogue.Harris did a wonderful job when inventing this character.The last chapter was great!You should definitly read this book.I can't wait to read Hannible"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Few can give readers the veiw from inside the head of a serial killer like Harris, and from deliciously evil Hannibal Lector to demented Jame Gumb, this is a psychological thrill ride.Whether you need a good book to read or liked the movie and want more detail, this is the book to you. It is as fast as it is gruesome, and engaging as it is original. The characters are beleivable and interesting, the buildup wonderful and the payoff rewarding. I have no qualms with this book whatsoever, and highly reccomend it to everyone aside from those with a weak stomach. 9/10"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book is about Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee on the hunt for Jame Gumb, a.k.a Buffalo Bill. He is a serial killer who is searching for large women to starve them for four days to a week to loosen their skin, shoot them, and skin a certain part of them, only to sew them all together to make a suit out of women. He has been denied a gender change because of crimes he has committed. Catherine Martin, Bill's latest victim, is still alive, and this reminds Clarice of the lambs at the farm she lived at for two weeks. They were slaughtered at night and she couldn't get to sleep while this took place. Their screaming is haunting her dreams again, and she thinks that if she rescues Catherine Martin while she is still alive, she will silence these lambs that have started to scream again. There is a problem, in order to rescue Catherine, she must enter the mind of Dr. Hannibal Lecter to unlock the mind of a serial killer. Hannibal is a former serial killer that has been put into an insane asylum. He has a reputation to toy with his interrogators, so it will be extremely hard to rescue Catherine in time.The main character is Clarice Starling. She is a young, beautiful FBI trainee from a small town in West Virginia. Her father died when she was just nine years old, and was forced to move to her uncle's farm, which held sheep and horses. I don't resemble her in a lot of ways. Maybe by the fact that she is a little insecure I resemble her. Other than that I don't act like her at all.In my opinion, this was a great book. I really enjoyed reading it. There were a lot of twists and turns in the book and it made a great movie, too. This book is for mystery fans and fans of murder stories mainly. If you are one of these, then go out and get this book! It is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The Silence of the Lambs has to be the most gruesome book I've ever read. The good news is that the characters are really well developed and the plot is thrillingly twisted. In other words: there is more to this book than cannibalism and the ability to shock.I have never seen the film (although I'm definitely going to now) but on it's own the book is still very disturbing. The smallest things that Hannibal Lector said could be construed as threatening - the fact that he was behind bars and locked away did not diminish his scariness. Lector is incredibly intelligent and perceptive, as well as possessing a twisted sense of humour, which makes him a fascinating villain. The matter of fact way that the author retells his horrible crimes only makes them seem more terrifying. The other killer in the story, Buffalo Bill, was equally demented, although in a less intelligent way than Lector.I really enjoyed reading about Clarice Starling and I felt that she was a great lead character; brave, decent and driven. The insights into her childhood and her fears of inadequacy were very well done. Jack Crawford, Clarice's superior, was described really well too and the parts of the book set around his home life and dying wife Bella made him seem more real and sympathetic. The plot was impeccable and the tension that was built and maintained throughout was extraordinary.Overall The Silence of The Lambs is a crime novel that will go down in history as something special.JoAnne"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Whether you saw the movie or not, buy the book and read it. Even if you know what's going to happen, Harris' way of telling the story is magnificent and spellbinding. Talk about your page turners! While not for the faint-of-heart, it was nowhere as graphic as I expected. Still, it will get your pulse-rate up. Don't miss this one.Also recommended: Bark of the Dogwood by McCrae and Lasher by Rice"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book was amazing. Hannibal Lecter has to be one of the most enduring literary and film villians of all time.

This is one of the best novels ever written, bar none. Everything is top notch, the plot (witness how many novels in the nineties and beyond basically steal most if not all of their plots from this book), characters, writing, etc. If a crime novel could be called perfect, this is it. And as with any work of art, the novel will leave a definite impression on you and make you think when you finish it.There's a reason why every book reviewer compares a book's villain(s) to Hannibal Lecter.

This truly Harris' peak as a writer, so far. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys crime novels or even a good psychological thriller because, this book isn't just about the crime. Harris always brings his stories to life as you learn more and more about each person's innerworkings. If you want a good book to read, this is a great choice."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This is Thomas Harris's second book in the Hannibal Lecter Trillogy. This book is much different than the first in the series &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. But will keep you on your toes just as much.In &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; we follow FBI trainee Clarice Starling who gets caught up in the search for the Tennesse Governors Daughter who dissappears. This search ends up leading her to the world known cannibal, Hannibal Lecter. What starts as business meetings between the two, turns into a game for Lecter. If he gives out info to Clarice, she must in return tell him of her life. Soon it seems that Clarice becomes a major infatuation of Lecters that just makes this already suspensfull novel even more thrilling.If you have seen the amazing movie and liked it, as most of u did. You will love this book. The movie follows the book very well. But as always, there is much more to learn by reading the book. I would highly advise reading this great book by Thomas Harris, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; long before I ever watched the movie. The movie was therefore, a slight disappointment for me as I think they really failed to truly capture the suspense the Harris is so adept at weaving.Hannibal Lecture is truly one of the most fascinating characters that has ever been created. (In my humble opinion, of course) Harris truly sensed what he could do with this work as he created just enough trickery at the end to ensure a sequel.Dr. Lecture has that unique ability to get into someone's mind, but he met his match in Clarice Starling. In the end, they both sacrificed little portions of their personal histories to get something out of each other. For Clarice, the information she obtained ensured her acclamation as a modern heroine. For Dr. Lecture, the chance to renew his participation in &quot;real world&quot; revived his spirit and utlimately led to his escape.Serial killers happen to be a particular fascination of mine and no one quite matches the lore of Hannibal Lecture.This is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"\\"Silence\\" is a Joseph Campbell hero story about encountering demons and particularly terrifying \\"wise old men\\"/trickster gods who give you weapons to fight evil. This is probably the first time a young female was used in a classic Joseph Campbell \\"hero\\" arc--or at least really successfully. The story's central engine is the heroic coming-of-age tale, which gives it resoundingly satisfying wholeness and closure and populism, despite its horrific elements. Thomas Harris degrading Clarice in \\"Hannibal\\" shows an almost George Lucas level of incomprehension of what he was originally doing--or hubris. Only J.K. Rowling re-engineered the Joseph Campbell hero's arc for every novel--and I think that worked out for her, arguably.I hate to frame this in movie terms, but the iconic film forces any reader to have a hard time dissociating the two. The best way I can sum up reading \\"Silence\\" is that it's like having great, massively-expanded \\"deleted scenes\\" and interior monologues to supplement the classic film. The plot unfolds at a slower, more measured pace, but you love the characters so much every expansion of detail is fascinating and engaging. This is not true of everything. I'm contrasting this particularly with \\"The Godfather\\" (where a fine film was surgically salvaged from a serviceable novel--the novel's \\"extras\\" almost degrade the film.) Even \\"Red Dragon,\\" which I read before this, compares a bit poorly to \\"Silence,\\" as the story kind of deflates and extra details just get boring."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Most people would know the story of Silence of the Lambs and the famous Hannibal Lecter within the novel, so I won't mention that aspect. What I will say is that as this novel explores the mind of Lecter, Starling and Buffalo Bill, it does so with deep compassion. The compassion underlies everything, evident in such scenes as Jack Crawford weeping over his wife's shoes and his man protecting his feelings by pretending not to have seen ... moments like these make Silence of the Lambs not just a rivetting thriller but let it achieve beauty. It is a beautiful novel."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"It's hard to describe how exceptional \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" is. It's one of those books which appeals to readers with widely varying reading preferences. The writing craft here is exceptional on almost every level, but it's hidden behind deceptively simple writing.The story begins with a series of straight-forward situations for the protagonist, Clarice, and the rest unfolds from there. We're eased into the story, and Harris manages to introduce his main character and make her subsequent involvement throughout the story plausible. At the same time, we're introduced to most of the important characters and given alot of information and set-up. As Clarice is dragged into the story, the reader is dragged with her.From there, the story unfolds and expands. The first quarter or so of the book is almost exclusively from the perspective of Clarice. From there we get more perspectives, developing the existing plotline with Buffalo Bill, and also introducing new story developments with their own distinctive sub-plots. The characters also move apart and begin to focus on their own distinct activities.Every scene in this book has a purpose. The writing is tight and clear, and not a word is wasted. If a chapter requires two pages or twenty pages, that's what you get. But more than that, the placement of the scenes and chapters is perfect. Additionally, because the writing is so clear and precise, Harris often communicates his meaning, be they images or information, clearly, briefly, and with precision. His brevity doesn't result in less depth. I think it lends to a more engaging book; the chapters are shorter, the scenes are to the point, and that helps the story move along at a fast clip, but also to be more engaging.Similarly, his characters are crafted incredibly well. On the surface their layering and depth is somewhat simplistic (e.g., pretty girl with extensive inner reserves, tough cop's cop with a tender personal life, etc), but there's so much more to them than that. I didn't feel like I was reading about characters, I felt like I was reading about real people. There's alot of restraint in Harris' writing here; in the hands of a lesser author these characters might be caricatures. Alot of information about these characters is simply implied by the way they act, speak, and hold themselves. Occasionally information is told or shown about a character, but this is often in a roundabout way, and is never used as a clumsy method of exposition. Instead it creates a solid core to build on and around, with new information being complementary. These character traits aren't belaboured, nor are they constantly brought up for dramatic tension. They just exist.Through this, we get some incredibly compelling characters. Hannibal Lecter is, effectively, the centrepiece which the story moves around. His presence is felt on almost every page, despite his absence for much of the book, and even if he weren't he's such an interesting character. Clarice is also fairly exceptional, and she undergoes a subtle character transformation over the course of the story. The only real problem I had with Clarice's character arc (and, on further reflection, most of the character cast) is that it's focused almost exclusively on the plot; there's a little background, but beyond that I can't conceive of her as a character that has a life outside this story. In a way it's remarkable storytelling that she's such a vivid character, and it helps bring the story to a satisfying conclusion, but it also blunts my feelings about her because I can't fully conceive of her life going on after the story is finished. Hannibal Lecter, on the other hand, doesn't have that problem - and that's scary.It's hard to limit the character cast down to favourites past that, but I really liked Barney. The other characters are merely great, and I rarely found any of them unbelievable.As touched on before, the dialogue is exceptional. The pacing is exceptional. Harris also takes an unconventional approach and changes up the tenses where it suits him. Some reviewers have complained about sloppy editing, but I think it's deliberate; it gives those particular sections immediacy, a feeling that they exist, that they are. And there's some more tricks in the writing - I refer, particularly, to chapter 36, and how the pacing in this chapter sl-o-o-o-o-o-ws down. It's just one of many exceptional stylistic choice.Also, the awareness of gender and its attendant issues here is remarkable, and included subtly throughout the story. This is incredibly important when writing a female lead, and Harris does it on multiple levels.The only real problem I have of note is that sometimes sentences aren't structured properly, and read instead like summaries or prompts. E.g., \\"A big bathroom, all white tile and skylights and sleek Italian fixtures standing against exposed old brick.\\" I think it's obvious that this is scene-setting, and written so that it conjures a clear image without having to use additional words to explain the situation. This way we get to the heart of the scene, and what's happening, sooner. But it's jarring and confusing. I'm conflicted about it; on the one hand, I can see how it's justified, but on the other I can see a fair criticism.Ultimately, though, still an exceptional read. Even nit-picking and being a miser, there's very little I can complain about. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read.5/5"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Ok, keep this in mind; while the film adaptation stands alone as one of the greatest films ever made, the book really doesn't stand alone as well. Sure, a casual reader can pick this up and follow it just fine and enjoy it all the same, if they saw the movie or not. But, the real excitement come forth if you've read Red Dragon first.Let me explain, I'll admit, I liked Red Dragon a little more. Will Graham was extremely interesting and diving into his mind and the unique way he solved problems was fascinating to say the least. But, the real meat of the story came from Francis Dolarhyde, who in both film adapations of the novel, wasn't captured quite right, although I think Ralph Fiennes came pretty close! The deep psychological study of these characters as well as the tone of the overall book really holds up, even 30 years later! But of course, what everybody remembers is Dr. Hannibal Lecter, whose appearance in Red Dragon is no more than a cameo, but I think that's what upped the tension for the character. You wanted to know more about him, he appears so briefly but his impact is so great on the story (and the reader) that it leaves us all thirsty for more.Enter The Silence of the Lambs, where Lecter's role is amped up. And here's where I'm glad I read Red Dragon first. His mystery, intelligence and scariness really come from his mysterious role in Red Dragon, so when we meet him again in Silence of the Lambs, we already know just how dangerous and terrifying this character is, just by how Red Dragon ends for Will Graham and how it's alluded to in The Silence of the Lambs. Once the audience reads that another FBI agent is going into the asylum to speak with Dr. Lecter, the audience goes, \\"Oh s****!\\" because we know how dangerous this really is based on what happened in Red Dragon.However, here's where The Silence of the Lambs works it's charm. Where in Red Dragon he hated Will Graham and was able to attack and disfigure Graham through Dolarhyde even behind bars, here Dr. Lecter is gentler to Clarice Starling, it is implied in a weird way that he actually falls in love with her. That's scary.The character of Clarice Starling is a nice contrast to Will Graham as well, and is a good indication why Lecter acts very differently around her. She is young, feisty and tough on the exterior, and Thomas Harris does a great job on conveying this to the audience. In fact, she seems almost two dimensional to the reader at first. But that's Harris's genius! That's how she wants the world to view her, tough and unbreakable. It's not until Lecter sees right through her that we do as well! Once he breaks her down, so do we, giving her character more depth and we start to relate to her almost instantly after that.I'd say overall, this book is really right on par with the quality of Red Dragon. It has mystery (even though in both novels, we know who the killer is and what he's doing early on), suspense, relatable characters, deep investigative stories and a quick, page-turning pace. We explore Lecter's character much more and we even get a deeper view of the life and struggles of Jack Crawford, which I really love too.However, The Silence of the Lambs falls just a little short of Red Dragon because of one thing, its villain. In Red Dragon, we had Francis Dolarhyde, aka the Tooth Fairy. We not only knew his evil ways, but his entire childhood and back-story and how he got where he is today. My God, I felt so much sympathy for this character. I cringed at his past and saw how he really wasn't born a monster, but shaped into one. What a perfect villain, bravo Mr. Harris! But in The Silence of The Lambs, Jame Gumb, aka Buffalo Bill is not sympathetic at all. He's this crazed sexual deviant, twisted and disturbing. While this works just fine in the context of the crimes, I really would have loved to see this developed a little more, although it is briefly touched on. I would have loved to had more on the character, his full back-story, his real struggles, I wanted to understand him more. And it could fit, the book is about 100 pages shorter than Red Dragon; why not devote the same time and attention to Gumb that was devoted to Dolarhyde? He comes off more here as just evil. While that's not bad for a villain, we're sort of already getting that evil mystery from Lecter in this story, so putting more of Jame Gumb's background in would have been beneficial.Overall, if you're a fan of horror, mystery or crime novels, I highly recommend it, even if you have already seen the movie, just read Red Dragon first, I feel like you get more out of it. Both are excellent novels!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"My husband turned me onto this book years ago. I read it years after seeing the movie, and let me tell you that the movie does not hold a candle to the book. I was afraid to sleep for weeks!

If you love a good thriller (even one as old as this) that scares you sleepless, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Red Dragon was creepy and extremely well written, but Silence of the Lambs is the go-to book of the genre. It defines what a truly great serial killer thriller should be like, if a little long in places on descriptive narrative. A top shelf book that's a must read for anyone who has missed it to date. Five solid stars for one of the greats."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"If you are looking for a superlative audio edition of this fine novel, you cannot go wrong with the one read by the amazing Frank Muller. His narration is so fine you almost feel as though you are inside Hanibal Lechter's head at times. Mr Muller won the AudioFile Magazine Earphones Award for his performance. Unbeatable!!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Harris' excellent thriller, known to audiences not only in book form but also through the Academy Award-winning 1991 film, brings back one of the most familiar villains of literary history: Dr. Hannibal (\\"The Cannibal\\") Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist serving nine consecutive life sentences in a Plexiglass-like cell at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane for his hideous crimes.He is here as a supporting character as FBI Section Chief Jack Crawford attempts to find a serial killer named Jame Gumb (but known to the world as \\"Buffalo Bill\\" in the media) while caring for his ailing wife, Bella. Crawford enlists the aid of whip-smart West Virginia FBI trainee Clarice Starling, who's sent to get information from Lecter regarding Bill's possible habits and potential victims.What transpires between Starling and Lecter is a rather twisted game of \\"Clue\\" wherein Lecter provides ideas and clues as to Bill's whereabouts and victims as well as his methodology but for a price: he demands personal information from Starling for these clues. Harris gives us brief but intense descriptions of the characters and places, and allows for the reader's imagination to do the rest. He also provides harrowing descriptions of what the characters feel including both victim and killer points of view. Even if you've already seen the film, do yourself a favor and read its source material."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I had to read this book for summer reading before the beginning of the school year. It is not an uplifting book but pretty suspenseful. It does make you think about alot of different issues in life(and I have thought alot about how to protect myself)."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Sometimes I worry that I might be wasting my time reading a thriller after seeing the film version. After all, if I know what's going to happen, how can there be much suspense, right? On reading The Silence of the Lambs I discovered my fears were completely unjustified.Thomas Harris is an excellent writer. I just sat for ten minutes trying to think of how to review his writing without sounding over-the-top gushy with praise...sorry, can't do it. Within the pages of the novel, his characters ARE alive, even those that appear in only one scene. The plot is intricate, compelling and it blasts forward like a rocket. Harris' descriptive ability is outstanding. He leads the reader right up to the point where the reader's own imagination takes over and almost makes the world of the novel an immediate concrete reality.This book will take you to some dark and scary places, but don't worry - Clarice Starling is there with you and she's got a gun and fast reflexes."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Thomas Harris is a masterful suspense genre writer. This is common knowledge. What often get overlooked are the wonderful literary aspects of his work. Silence Of The Lambs works as both a suspense novel and a fine piece of literature.Gender issues are a major theme in this wonderful novel. Buffalo Bill does not kill his victims for money or sexual pleasure or fame. He kills his victims, all of who are female, for the most superficial aspect of their beings, their skin. Buffalo Bill wants to become a woman and he believes wearing women's skin will make him one. I do not need to tell anyone to ask a woman to find out if it is skin that makes a woman what she is. Women are being objectified by Buffalo Bill.Also supporting the theme of gender issues is the compelling character of Clarice Starling. Clarice is an up and coming, star student in the FBI Academy, who wants to become part of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit. This unit is extremely difficult to get into. Jack Crawford, FBI Section Chief, wants to give Starling a job, however it involves a lot of paper work. \\"It was tempting to get into Behavioral Science in any capacity she could, but she knew what happens to a woman if she's ever pegged as a secretary - it sticks until the end of time.\\" Starling is trying to avoid falling into the common stereotype of women in the workplace.There are many instances of gender issues in this novel, and if you still do not believe me, read the novel and figure out which room the well is under that Buffalo Bill keeps his victims in. These are not coincidences. The literary aspects are there. There are no \`throw-away lines' in this novel. To say so would insult Thomas Harris. Every sentence in this novel is there for a reason, whether it be to advance the suspense or to advance the literary themes.Thomas Harris writes an incredible novel that can be enjoyed on a purely suspense genre level or on a literary level. It is a gripping story and one that propelled one of recent American literature's most famous characters, Dr. Hannibal Lecter into pop-culture icon status."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"&quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; is the second book of the Hannibal trilogy, and the best. Although &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is a magnificent story, the emphasis is more on the psychology of the book's killer, Francis Dolarhyde, than in &quot;Silence&quot; where we have a shift of emphasis towards the psychology of the FBI trainee, Clarice Starling.What this allows is the close quarter psychiatry that Lector employs on Starling, and very unnerving stuff it is too. The relationship between the two is the most important part of the book, the actual story of Buffalo Bill is secondary. Harris weaves his plot at such a pace and with such intelligence that the reader, like Starling actually feels some kind bond with Lecter even though he holds all the cards and is intellectually running rings around her. A ludicrous thought when we consider the man's crimes, but it is there none the less.It is also good to see that the film actually follows the plot of the book closely, and is all the better for it. One advantage that the book has over the novel, however, is the brilliant depiction of character that Harris can provide. The insect expert is far more repulsive in the book than the film where he comes across as just lonely.&quot;Silence&quot; also overcomes that rather big barrier that accounts for the failings of so many other trilogies; namely that the second book is just a bridge between the stronger first and third novels. Rather unusually &quot;Silence&quot;, as the second of three, is actually the best. It is marginally better than &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, which I also rate very highly, and is a lot better than the disappointing &quot;Hannibal&quot;.&quot;Silence&quot; should be read regardless of whether you have seen the film or not. If you have seen the film, you know what happens, but Harris' storytelling is a joy to behold."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Hey! My name is angy. I come from Austria (Europe). I've to write this review because of school. I like the book very much. I can definitely recommand it. Although I know the movie, it was very hard to understand and it took me a long time. One reason why I've chosen this book was the film 'Hannibal'. After watching this movie I thought of reading the book of the first film. I specially like the character of Hannibal Lector. He is a mystic person. Only the describtion of his eyes and his look made me afraid. In general I think that this book is one of the best thrillers I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"&quot;Silence of The Lambs&quot; transcends genre. When the lights go out in Buffalo Bill's cellar, you CARE what happens. Thomas Harris' narrative tone subtly changes to suit each character. It almost seems a woman wrote Clarice's paragraphs, an arrogant maniac wrote Lecter's, and Harris just coordinated the characters with the plot.Clarice Starling is the most three-dimensional female character in modern crime fiction. She doesn't fall into bed with the prime suspect, nor does she have to save the Handsome Detective Who Gets Shot in The Shoulder. Her dual mentorship under FBI supervisor Jack Crawford and Hannibal Lecter is an interesting dynamic. Crawford is retiring soon - you know who that leaves.With Lecter, we can't expect a full portrait. An extreme character requires an incomplete background. Better to let Lecter explain Lecter, as Harris has done. Buffalo Bill is as sociopathic as Lecter, but without Lecter's charisma. Bill's house is a chilling metaphor for his mind. He's lost, and he's searching for a way out through other people's skin.Even the throw-away lines add emotional content. Late in the story, Starling's roommate finds her slumped over a washing machine, asleep. It takes a poetic touch to describe the comforting vibration of a washing machine as a brief return to &quot;our last memory of peace.&quot; (The womb.)Strong conflict, strong heroine, frightening villains. Harris demonstrates that when you ditch the cliches, crime fiction can be as thought-provoking and poetic as &quot;real literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This is the first and best book I've read. My dad suggested this book so i read it. I later read all of the Thomas Harris books. The Silence of the Lambs was the best of the Hannibal series and I highly reccomend this book to all readers. If you saw the movie and liked it, you will for sure enjoy this book. The parts with Hannibal are by far the best parts of the book. His escape is the best part of the book, better than the ending. You will love reading this book"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Written as a sequel to Red Dragon, Thomas Harris's Silence of the Lambs is set in Virginia, about 1991. It introduces a young, now internationally known FBI Academy student named Clarice Starling, eager, freah and smart, ready to break into the field of Behavioral Science under veteran Jack Crawford. Starling gets her wish when Crawford remembers her from a seminar and recruits her to interview Hannibal &quot;the Cannibal&quot; Lecter for possible information on their current target, Buffalo Bill. This leads to a suspenseful exchange leading up to an explosive climax well worth the time invested in the bulk of the book. As well-done as the movie is, the book is so intelligently written that the movie almost seems dumbed down. Anyone familiar with the movie will notice some differences. This story never gets boring. From start to finish, the book manages to stay intense."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Thomas Harris proves his ever growing reputation as a writer of supreme talents with this intriguing mix of suspense and horror. The infamous Dr Lector is shown to be both a character of fear and subtle mystique. Harris introduces a female heroin (Clarice Starling) who is worthy of so much attention she recieves in the novel. The one true masterstroke that this book has, is that Lector is only really a bit part in the plot. Thus, when he does make appearances, he is all the more frightening. If anyone is ever turned off by Harris' frightening attention to detail, once they become absorbed in this fine novel, they will learn that fear is a good thing!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a truly horrifying novel.

I could not believe that a movie that was so great could be topped, times a hundred, by a book.

Any would-be author should read any of these as textbook examples displaying how &quot;brevity of description&quot; --as opposed to long drawn-out descriptions of a person or place in a scene--can be so powerful. For instance, Clarice Starling is simply described in her own thougths as someone who &quot;knew she could look allright without primping&quot; and that left you with the image of a great-looking female protagonist. Harris, and lesser known but equally as talented fellow Mississippi author Charles Wilson are two of the best I've ever read at being able to pull this &quot;brevity&quot; off. In fact, the above mentioned books of Harris, along with Wilson's GAME PLAN, DONOR, and NIGHTWATCHER, are among the most visual books I've ever read, without boring you with &quot;too-much&quot; description to get that effect. By the way, for those who loved SILENCE in particular, and haven't read Wilson, they should try NIGHTWATCHER for a read very similar to SILENCE in its story line and fear factor, with possibly better laid-out character development in NIGHTWATCHER--but hey, all of them top notch reads."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Having seen the movie adaptation of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" several times, it seemed at times that I could see the action on the pages of the book rather than just reading them. I cannot help but see Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling and it is the voice of Anthony Hopkins I hear when Hannibal Lecter speaks. While this may limit how I view the characters, this does not detract at all from the book and I feel that in many ways, the novel is superior and is still gripping despite my familiarity with the story.Clarice Starling is in training at the FBI Academy. She is a star student in the Behavioral Sciences Division when the Department Chief, Jack Crawford, calls her into his office and gives her a job. She is to interview one Dr Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter in order to help get into the mind of a serial killer. There is an open case with a serial killer who has been nicknamed \\"Buffalo Bill\\", and Dr. Lecter may be the only chance to solve the case without there being many more murders. Starling is only a trainee, and this may be why Lecter is actually willing to speak to Starling about Buffalo Bill, though he is always holding something back.Lecter is a villain of extreme intellect and this comes through in his dialogue. Like \\"Red Dragon\\", Dr. Lecter is not the central villain and the story does not revolve specifically around him (though he has a larger role this time around). Lecter does play a pivotal role because without him, the story cannot move forward. We never truly get into the psyche of Jame Gumb (not as much as we did with Frances Dolorhyde in \\"Red Dragon\\"), and it seems as if most of his actions happen off camera.While Lecter is a very interesting character, it is Clarice Starling that we get to see grow as a character and become more confident and insistent in her work with Lecter and to catch \\"Buffalo Bill\\" even though she is only a trainee. She was put on this case and she intends to see it through.As creepy as the movie could be, I loved this book. It had a very fast pace and stayed interesting throughout the story and it didn't matter that I had seen the movie multiple times. I was interested in the story Thomas Harris was telling. While Harris goes into detail about crimes, it doesn't feel very gory or unnecessary. It seems that this novel was a best seller in the late 80's and it is easy to see why. \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" is a well told thriller and any fans of James Patterson and that genre should definitely give this one a look."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Thomas Harris' book The Silence of the Lambs has been reissued with a subtler, more artistic design, displaying a moth but no screaming death's head, and in a larger size that hints at the literary heft to be found between its covers. The publishers at St. Martin's Press know what they're doing, and if they want to argue for Harris a larger place in the modern canon, I will agree: we're being asked to pay attention to Harris with more than airport-reading consideration and we will be rewarded. The Silence of the Lambs stars Clarice Starling, a student at the FBI training academy, who becomes enmeshed in a disturbing serial murder case.As the only woman in a male dominated behavioral science department, Clarice brings fresh insights to the search for mad killer Buffalo Bill. Strangely, the other person with insight into the case is locked away in a high security prison vault, sealed from the light of day-Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a madman in his own right. The two, bright-eyed, young, but worldly Clarice and human-organ-eating Lecter, make for an interesting team. But each has power in his or her way and each wants something precious from the other.Lecter wants freedom and, to some extent, Clarice's company, while Clarice needs to close in on Buffalo Bill before he maims another woman. Along the way, she may also silence some of her self-doubt and lingering need for closure with aspects of her past. Buffalo Bill is on the lose trapping, holding captive, killing, and skinning overweight twenty-something women. The fact that he believes himself to be a transvestite and is making himself a dress out of woman skin has uncertain thematic implications, but there it is. The imprisoned Lecter, who originally seems to have uncanny and brilliant insight into the mind of this lunatic, draws Clarice closer to him by lending her clues in miserly fashion. With their dangerous tango in play, Clarice shifts back into the world of the FBI and on more than one occasion is forced to deal with a sexist environment to simply do her job.Harris takes care to show us how the mind of this young trainee works systematically and deductively, qualities her male superiors can immediately appreciate, but also how she draws from her own unique experience as a woman and someone raised lower class. Driving her throughout the text is a deep sense of connection with the victims, a heightened empathy we fail to see demonstrated by the other investigators, and more importantly, with the living Catherine Martin. Buffalo Bill's latest detainee, Catherine is the daughter of a senator, and the question will be whether she and Clarice Starling can not only actively resist, but overcome the forces that move to stifle them."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I saw this movie well over a decade ago, and remebered the gist, but had forgotten much of the story. I recommend to anyone that saw the movie a while ago (and don't mind some graphic descriptions)to read this book. It is enthralling. When a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill begins to kidnap, kill, and skin young women, FBI trainee, Clarice Starling, begins to interview the criminal mind of Hanibal Lecter, a deranged psychiatrist. Lecter offers clues to Starling about the Buffalo Bill case, and Starling becomes heavily involved despite being just a trainee. However, Lecter doesn't share clues for free and she must reveal her past to Lecter in exchange for the information. The investigation becomes a race against time when another young woman is kidnapped. Will Lecter reveal enough clues for Starling to nab Buffalo Bill? You need to read this eerie, sometimes disturbing, and suspensful novel to find out."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Like most people, I was first introduced to Silence of the Lambs by the movie version; it blew me away, and no small part goes to the always ingenious acting of Anthony Hopkins. You get extremely close to the two main characters: Clarice Starling and Hannibal &quot;the Cannibal&quot; Lector. The pacing is fast, and the writing is perfect for the mood. Harris doesn't waste a word or page, and not a moment is dull. I ripped through this book in a remarkably brief time. This is a must read which did for the thriller what The Exorcist did for the Horror genre."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"When you read &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; or hear about the book, you probably start immediately to remember some scenes from the movie starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. The movie comes pretty damn close! And it's rare that a movie follows the plot of a novel so closely.It is difficult to write something about a story that is so well known, basically by its adaptation for the screen, which has been buried under a heap of Academy Awards. Like many others, \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" proves the fact that the book is always better than the movie.Clarice Starling is an FBI trainee. The FBI's chief of Behavioral Science has called on her to help solve a serial murder case. She must interview Dr. Hannibal (&quot;the Cannibal&quot;) Lector, a psychiatrist jailed for killing and eating various patients, to get inside the mind of Buffalo Bill, a serial killer on the loose. Starling becomes close to Lector who helps her discover how to find Buffalo Bill, and how to find closure in her personal life.\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" is simply a superb, electrifying book. What a writer Thomas Harris is and what a character the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lector is. With Dr. Lector, Harris makes you look at the face of evil, and stare!This book sets the standard in psychological terror. If you haven't seen the movie yet, read the novel first, then see the characters brought to life brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. I thoroughly enjoyed the two principal characters Dr. Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling. And I look forward to Hannibal. I wish more novels were like this."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"What can I add to this novel that hasn't already been added?

I have never seen the \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" movie, but I read the book. You see, I was checking out my grandma's book collection, and I happened to catch a glimpse of one book sitting on the shelf. I picked it up, dusted it off, and discovered it was \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\" I had heard the movie was really good, but I'd never heard anybody talk about a book. In fact, I didn't even know there was a book. I thought it might be an adaption of the movie, but the (really cool) cover said \\"The #1 New York Times Bestseller Is Now The Movie Event Of The Year.\\" It was a pretty old book. My grandma let me borrow it, and I started reading it. It started a little slow, but quickly got pretty exciting. I think that it is best for me to review this book without seeing the movie, because I wn't make comparisions and stuff. Later, I'll write one after I've seen the movie.Clarice Starling is an FBI trainee with a wierd past. She gets a call from Jack Crawford one day, and meets up with him. He tells her a killer only known as \\"Buffalo Bill\\" is on the loose and killing young women. He thinks that Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lector might know somehing. Hannibal is locked away in a very high security mental institution, where he amuses himself by reminiscing (sp?) about the past, drawing things and writing letters or words of wisdom. Hannibal is a genius, but an evil one. After eating a bit of a nurse, he's been locked away for a long time. Clarice meets with him, and discovers he is a true gentlemen. He is polite, uses appropriate grammar, but happens to have a fondness for eating meat that's not quite the kind we get at the store. He agrees to help her, if she'll exchange information about her past. With every complicated hint, she gets closer to finding out who Buffalo Bill really is and where he is. The clock is ticking, he has just kidnapped the senator's daughter, and it's up to her to solve the mystery!This was a good book. I didn't think it was great, but I enjoyed it and finished it quickly. I'm aware that there are other Lector books (and movies) which include \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Hannibal.\\" I haven't read these. I don't think it's important, because I understood the plot fine. I thought the creepy thing about this movie was that it was realistic and could actually happen. There are tons of sickos in this world like Buffalo Bill, and some evil geniuses like Hannibal Lector. My favorite part of this story was the final showdown with Buffalo Bill and Clarice Starling. The suspense leading up to it was great.The way Thomas Harris writes was very strange. It was written almost like something you would read in a police file. It sounded factual and not fictional. I think that added to its sense of realism. I liked the character of Starling, but I found her a little dull. Maybe in the movie she's better.Anyway, I'm gonna go have a movie marathon of Lector (in this order: \\"Manhunter,\\" \\"Red Dragon,\\" \\"The Silence Of The Lambs,\\" and \\"Hannibal\\"). This was a cool book and I think you should read it.Incidentally, the one my grandma had was old, and had a cover way cooler than the ones now. It showed half of Clarice Starling's face on the left side, tinted blue. On the right side was half of Hannibal Lector's face. The moth symbol was between them, and there are wings covering their lips. If you find this at an old used book store, get it because it is way cooler that the ones out now.Hope my review helped. I'll write another after I see the movie.John"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Usually my policy is that it is better to watch the movie before you read the book - that way you avoid disappointment as the book is almost invariably better than the movie.However, with &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; I feel I should have read the book before watching the movie. Somehow the excellent depth of the characters that was created in the movie made the book appear to be shallow. What's more, I felt like I was just reading a script of the movie, as the movie stuck to the plot of the book so well. I couldn't visualize the characters at all differently from the way they were in the movie. Maybe Anthony Hopkins' excellent acting is to blame for that.So maybe I shouldn't be blaming Thomas Harris. It isn't his fault I chose to see the movie first. However, I don't feel the movie was the books ONLY problem. Somehow I found the book to be unconvincing. The idea of a big-wig in the FBI inlisting the help of a lowly student seemed ... rather unlikely. I mean, an Army General wouldn't send a new recruit on a black-ops mission into occupied territory, now would he? Surely the FBI must have someone who is actually a QUALIFIED agent who has taken a few sociology and psychology courses into the bargain. I suppose the movie suffered from the same problem, but somehow it didn't bother me in the film context. For me, this aspect reduced the quality of the book substantially. I felt like I was a ten-year old child again, reading &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot; and marvelling at how inexperienced kids can beat veteran detectives at their own game.What is more, the nature of the relationship between Starling and her friend at the Academy reminded me of 14 year old school girls, and hence did nothing to convince me that Starling was a mature, socially aware and intelligent adult. Call me an outdated stickler, but I also prefer authors who use gramatically complete sentences. &quot;Clarice Starling driving in a hurry through the perilous Memphis traffic, two tears of anger dried stiff on her cheeks&quot; just isn't a complete sentence. Sorry.However, I can't deny that I read the book in pretty much one sitting. &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; isn't a great work of literature, but if you are looking to pass the time on public transport, well maybe you should consider it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS by Thomas HarrisAugust 30, 2007Amazon Rating: 4/5 starsI had read RED DRAGON about five years ago and I enjoyed it a lot. I also saw the first two movies featuring Hannibal Lecter, and I decided I had to read all the books. So I finally got to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I am going to admit that I probably cannot give a good unbiased review because I remember a lot of the movie starring Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins, but I don't remember enough of it to say whether the movie deviated at all from the book or not.With that said, there are two story lines. The main theme is the search for a serial killer referred to by the press as BUFFALO BILL. But there is another theme which caught on with readers and viewers, that of the murderer Doctor Hannibal Lecter, a criminal so insane that his acts will make you nauseous. His cravings for sweet meats is what leads him to his heinous acts; for example, he attacks a nurse while in jail, breaking her jaw and then eating her tongue. But what is so fascinating about the good doctor is his intelligence and his uncanny instincts pertaining to other people, especially towards other murderers.With Lecter's help, the FBI goes in search of the mysterious Buffalo Bill, who is murdering and flaying overweight women for unknown reasons. There is no obvious pattern, no clue as to who he is. Jack Crawford of the FBI's Behavioral Science section pulls out a student from class, Clarice Starling, to help track down this killer. The latest missing victim is the daughter of a high profile senator, and knowing what has been happening so far with Buffalo bill, Clarice and Jack know that their time is limited to save Catherine Baker Martin. Every step they take is crucial, and must be precise and calculated, in order to get Hannibal the Cannibal's cooperation. Unfortunately, not everyone is cooperating, and because of some errors made, they may lose Catherine to the serial killer, who has an obsession with moths, one of their first clues.The journey in search of the killer is of course an important aspect of the novel, but what readers will enjoy the most is the relationship that develops between Clarice and Dr Lecter. It's difficult to describe, but it is one of the more fascinating components of the story. While Dr Lecter has an evil streak, something changes when he is in the vicinity of Clarice. And Clarice knows that she has an edge with Dr Lecter for whatever reason, trusting Dr Lecter to a point that they behave as equals. The two play cat and mouse while she gets as much information out of him, while at the same time she gives him information about herself. The game is a race with time, as she has to figure out who Buffalo Bill is before this serial killer decides it's time to skin his latest victim.While I'm not a regular reader of suspense and thrillers, I seem to enjoy them a lot when I do read them. So far I am enjoying the series of books by Thomas Harris, and while Dr Lecter was not the main focus in RED DRAGON, I found it interesting how Harris decided to turn the doctor into a full-blown main character in the rest of the series. My overall assessment of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was that it was one of those books that I thoroughly enjoyed and savored every page, just as Lecter savored his fava beans and Amarone! Fans of horror and thrillers should enjoy this modern day classic."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"It is a cliche to say the book is always better than the movie. It is not. Although rare, one can point to the sluggish novel THE BOURNE IDENTITY or the real life trek across the Australian Outback of RABBIT PROOF FENCE as instances of the movie far outperforming the source material. It is a testament to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS that, despite an excellent and modern-day classic movie, the flick still does not reach the standard of the book. If Thomas Harris' previous bookRed Dragonset the standard for the modern serial killer novel, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS picks up the baton and runs with it very well on its own.The plot is well known. When a killer leaves a trail of skinned women in his wake, the FBI turns once again to the psychopathic Hannibal Lecter for some helpful hints. Upon taking a liking to Clarice Starling, Lecter engages in a tit-for-tat with the young heroine, providing clues to the killer's thinking in exchange for Starling's personal history.Despite the viciousness of the plot, the true strength of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is its subtlety. Harris refrains from delving into Lecter's inner thoughts or past history and simply presents him, instead, as the embodiment of pure evil (a portrayal that Harris later spoils in the atrociousHannibal). That he is smarter than anyone else around makes him more interesting still, but also exposes a personal flaw. Like many people who rely too heavily on their own superior intelligence, Lecter fails to notice other defects in his personality that allow others to gain a tactical advantage over him.Clarice Starling is also excellently drawn. Just enough of the \`awe shucks' country girl left in her, combined with that loss of naivety one usually develops the hard way, she provides the perfect foil for Lecter's malevolent sophistication. You know she will hold herself together in the end. But you also know it will take its toll on her.Harris later tarnished these excellent characters in subsequent books, so badly, in fact, that it is hard not to see them as diminished even retroactively here. But THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS should be judged on its own. And on its own, it will keep a reader turning the pages until the end."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The book would never receive the accolades that the movie did, because it doesn't rise head and shoulders above the pack in terms of quality.While the movie was seen as a genre-topping masterpiece, the book is merely very good.The book, like the movie, hinges on the powerful character of Hannibal Lecter, a man whose viciousness is almost overshadowed by his preternatural genius. Lecter is what makes the book special, and Harris deserves plenty of credit for coming up with a twist on the \\"evil genius\\" that is both fresh and iconic.I would recommend that you read the Lecter books in sequence, although you might want to forgo the closing entry, \\"Hannibal.\\""},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The Silence of the Lambs is the second novel featuring the renowned Hannibal Lecter. The FBI is pursuing a serial killer known as \\"Buffalo Bill\\" and Jack Crawford sends trainee Clarice Starling to interview Lecter for possible insight into the case. Lecter takes something of an interest in Clarice and feeds her a few tidbits of information. When a U.S. Senator's daughter is the next victim kidnapped by the killer, the pressure to solve the case is ratcheted up even more. Lecter schemes to escape and toy with those who want information, Starling and Crawford struggle to find Buffalo Bill, the Senator's daughter fights to stay alive, and Lecter's hospital administrator uses the situation to gain fame for himself.For those who have seen the movie, this book will not contain too many surprises. The movie streamlines things as you would expect but the basic story and major characters are unchanged. At less than 400 pages, this is not an overly long novel and the pace moves along pretty well from start to finish. Starling, Crawford, and Lecter are the most interesting characters. Interestingly, I found Buffalo Bill to be pretty dull despite an obvious effort to give him a background and personality. It was not particularly original of Harris to feature a serial killer who wants to transform himself in this novel after doing the same thing in the prior book,Red Dragon.My only gripe with the book is that the author lapses into very sloppy grammatical and tense errors throughout the book. The narration is largely in past tense as most novels are but isolated paragraphs or sentences suddenly speak in present tense. In other cases, he uses sentence fragments in narration that could easily have been made into complete sentences. These fragments usually involve setting the scene and read more like notes for a screenplay than prose from a novel. These probably sound like petty flaws (and they are to a certain extent) but without fail they jarred me out of the story and represent nothing more than lazy writing and sloppy editing.Overall, this is a very good novel. Fans of \\"Hannibal the cannibal\\" will see much more of the good doctor than they did in Red Dragon and he loses none of his charm or menace. Clarice Starling is interesting and likable and her relationship with Lecter is electric. As noted above, I dislike the Harris has abused the English language but the story is well worth reading and I would recommend Silence of the Lambs to anyone looking for a good thriller."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Step into the world of Hannibal Lecter. Entertaining and fast moving story line will keep you glued to the book. This book is better than the movie (just like Godfather and every book that was made into a movie) and worth your time if you are a mystery/thriller fan.highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This is an absolutely excellent book. If you have an interest in unusual, unique characters like I do, you'll defitnitly find what you're looking for here. As a fantasy/sci-fi fan, I don't usually read suspense thrillers, but I believe this book spans the genres flawlessly. It is engaging, harrowing, and sure to raise more than one goosebump. I also like the very effective use of a strong female protagonist who more than holds her own without degenerating into a \\"sword babe.\\" If you enjoy suspense thrillers, or if you simply enjoy deep, engaging, and thought provoking books, you should give The Silence of the Lambs a try."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"For those who have seen the movie, I recommend reading the book too. Whether you read it before or after seeing the movie, I don't think it matters. You'll find that Hannibal is much creepier in the book. Though Anthony Hopkins is so excellent playing him, when you read the book's character interaction the written word inspires imagination to take you places way beyond where a movie can take you."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"'The Silence of the Lambs' is my favourite book and film of all time; I love the eerie chemistry between Agent Clarice Starling and Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector and the opportunities to delve deep into a psychopath's mind. If you've seen the film, you'll know how good it was; well, the book is better. If you haven't seen it, read the book before watching the movie; I did it that way and was really pleased I did, because having read the book gave me a greater appreciation of the film. Thomas Harris writes about Hannibal in such a subtle and clever way that it's possible you'll find yourself, as I did, liking the cannibalistic psychopath. As for Clarice Starling, her enigmatic past is pieced together at just the right pace, so there aren't whole chapters devoted to her past, but snippets here and there that keep your mind on the ball. All in all, though the movie was fantastic and, in my opinion, one of the best thrillers of all time, the book is unequalled, and when you've finished it, you'll find yourself wanting to start all over again."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Clarice Starling is the star of this story. She's an up and coming FBI agent who gives chase to a serial killer named &quot;Buffalo Bill.&quot; Starling meets up with a psychiatrist named Dr. Hannibal Lecter. &quot;Silence&quot; is pretty much split up into two different sections. One section includes Hannibal the other does not. The relationship between Starling and Lecter is what kept me interested in the book. I suggest this book to anyone. The thing some people might not like is the subject matter, it is extremely graphic. Other then that, it's great."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read first The Red Dragon and I like it very much, then I read Hannibal and I didn't like it so I didn't want to read this book, but it happens, someone give it to me and I read it, and what a book! you wont be able to put it down and maybe you will never go to a psychotherapist again, the story is not out of reality at all, the descriptions of the bodies are excellent, so don't read this book late at night."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I had heard so much about this book for sucha long time that I finally decided to give it a shot...The book was riveting, the ghastly ideas were original and scary, but the giddy queasiness one should get by reading a book like this was missing. The gruesomeness was absent, the ideas were there, but the descritions were falling short of evoking the very eerie feeling. At no point did I shudder and close the book saying, &quot;Oh! My Gosh! I can go no further&quot;. It all sank in well, it was as if such a story could happen in reality. And I must say, I have quite a faint heart!!!The character of Hannibal Lector was awesome though. He comes across truly as a genius, who cannot be despised for being a criminal, but revered for his fertile and intelligent brain. He embodies all the traits of a thinking mind, deducing, observing, extrapolating facts to comprehend complex mental processes. His character makes the story fashionable and appeals to the intellectual minds. Due to him, the story no longer remains a man-hunting, cruel, bloody saga... it becomes a mind game played by a magnificent brain.The book makes a good read, but doesnt live up to the hype surrounding it. But I still recommend it becuase it is still one of the best in its genre!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I usually make a point to read the book before I see the film adaptation of it--I'm a bit OCD about it, to tell the truth. However, in this case I didn't realize that The Silence Of The Lambs was a novel until I had already watched it--my only frame of reference was that my dad loved the film, and my mom couldn't stand it. So I watched it, and was suitably impressed. Then I discovered it was a novel, and resolved that should it ever cross my path I would grab a copy. Somehow I ended up with two, both identical......oh well. The book was marvelous, but is a bit overshadowed for me by the film. This is mostly on the strength of the performances therein, Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lector completely formed how I pictured his character all through the book. But this is not a strike against the book so much as a testament to how well executed the film was. This is still worth reading, for my money, but those who choose to stick with the film will not lose out on a great deal. And no, I cannot believe I just said that.....I think I must now consider myself a heretic....."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Technically the 3rd book involving the charasmatic Hannibal Lecter, but the 2nd written.

With some crypticc help from Dr. Lecter and she being manipulated by her boss; will she find out everything in time? That is for you to find out through the book.

As an advanced reader and an avid writer, I tend to be a little picky with books. Very few get me 'obsessed'. But this book had me hooked from page one! I had seen the movie a short while earlier, fell in love, and prayed quietly that neither book nor movie would be better than the other. I was delighted to see that the book followed the movie pretty much word per word, while the movie simply freed the characters trapped within my mind.The plot of this book is very well-written, and the characters easy to fall in love with. {The sociopathic, yet very smart, Hannibal Lecter soon became my favorite} I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good, creepy story that will keep you sleeping with the lights on."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I admittedly saw the movie long before I read this book.

It was hard not to picture the actors from the excellent film as I read along, but that almost made it better anyway. I've always wondered about what turns people into serial killers. It's a hobby fascination of mine. The book hints at this, but doesn't spell it out. I like that. It gives you a clue, a direction, then lets you fill in the blanks however your own brain sees fit. Can't you just picture Buffalo Bill's childhood. Yeeeesh! A hot mess I am sure. Anyway, a great story. Unparalleled in the genre in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It snatches you, making you unable to put the book down. It was nice to envision Hannibal Lecter in the way the author described him instead of JUST thinking of Hopkins (who was phenomenal in the film but had hardly any of the true Hannibal Lecter physical characteristics).

Red Dragon being the first one was quite enjoyable. I'm not big into 'thrillers', but Red Dragon kept me interested.The Silence Of The Lambs is noted as a classic horror movie. Hopkins and Foster played amazingly in that film. So the book should be even better right? Wrong. Sure you get to know the serial killer more, and what his history was, et cetera, et cetera. But basically I was quite amazed to find out that the film contained basically everything good about the novel!Whenever I was reading the Lecter scenes, I imagined Hopkins slow deep voice saying the words. They were the best parts of the story.I was planning on reading straight through the series if I really liked the novels, but now I think I am at least going to wait until Hannibal comes out on paperback.

It was good and kept me pulled into it and reading. I had a hard time putting the book down and finished it in 5 days, which for me is fast.The subject matter of the story, however, was too gross and disgusting from my point of view. I won't get into it and ruin the story for someone that does not know what it entails. I will just leave it at this; had I known about what the serial killer was like and what he was doing as well as some of the other details, I would have passed on the book.The next thing I noticed about this book is that the writing was on your typical 1st grade level (most current thrillers and romance novels are now days). This book definately did not use the english language like Alexandre Dumas or Ayn Rand. I also did not care for the profanity that author seemed to feel he had to use. To me profanity in a book just means the author does not know how to use more than 200 words from the dictionary and as a result resorts to other means to put across a point.So talking story, subject matter, and the unstimulating use of the english language, I have to give the book an average review of 3-stars..."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I have not yet read Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon, but I do plan to in the near future, hoping they end better than this one! It started out as a terrific book, with thrills, suspense, and twists. I wish I could tell you what happens at the end just so you won't read the book. It just doesn't make sense and is not realistic. Everyone is hoping for the book to end one way, but......"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Perhaps I've watched the movie too many times. I found the book itself dull. Nothing compares to that look in A. Hopkins' eyes ... watch for it in &quot;Hanibal&quot; at the end of the slide-show scene!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I saw the movie adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs when it was first released, years ago. As an edge-of-your-seat suspense thriller, it was a great movie. So why read the book? After all, I was familiar with the plot. I would be prepared for all of Harris' dramatic choices, Right? Sure, maybe. Yet after reading Thomas Harris' \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" I realized that this book goes beyond its genre level of suspense. Unlike many traditional genre-based stories, this novel works on an intricate thematic level as well. Harris' dramatic choices may fall into the suspense genre, yet they serve a thematic function that is just as rewarding to interpret.Clarice Starling, the main character, is a young female FBI student working in the behavioral studies institute. Clarice comes from a poor uneducated family. She has broken away from her background in that she has succeeded educationally. Although Starling wishes to distance herself from her background, her past actually empowers her in many instances. Starling is always striving for something more. She wants to save Catherine. She wants to silence the lambs in her dreams, to overcome her fears. She wants to communicate with Hannibal Lecter. Clarice longs for control, she must always strive, she must always claw her way to the top.Starling's experience as a woman growing up in a particular social class in a particular part of the country helps her to connect to certain victim's families. Unfortunately, Starling sees her past as more of a hindrance than a help. Starling struggles for respect and advancement in an predominantly male-dominated field. Harris shows the reader the double standards that occur between men and women, the gender stereotypes prevalent in both groups, and the repeated objectification of women.Starling is asked to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a former psychiatrist declared criminally insane. The detectives believe that Starling's femininity and naivete will convince Lecter to talk. On the contrary, Hannibal Lecter sees beyond Clarice's skin, and becomes very interested in her personal history. So interested, in fact, that he is willing to exchange critical investigative information for Starling's personal anecdotes. Clarice will risk almost everything to help save Catherine, and agrees to interact with Lecter.Starling parallels the character of Catherine in many ways. It is no coincidence that Catherine is most frightened by the sight of fingernails on the well's wall. It is no surprise that the well is located directly below Jame Gumb's kitchen. Both of these women are objectified throughout the novel. Both women are striving upward, Caroline literally striving to get out of the well, and Starling striving to advance from the situation she was born into. Both women must use what they have in order to survive. In Catherine's case, it is merely a string, a bucket and Jame Gumb's dog. For Clarice, it is her past, the ambiguous clues from Hannibal Lecter, and her perseverance.Harris' subversion of cliches are subtle. Jame Gumb sews his suit of human flesh on a sewing machine that says \\"I never tire, I serve.\\" Starling feels the need to sew her blazer that has been frayed by her gun holster. It is in these small details, that the reader can delineate between the straightforward dramatic action, and the more subtle thematic concerns.I strongly recommend reading \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\" Harris' ability to write a novel that works so perfectly on both genre and literary levels is amazing. Every detail has meaning. Every dramatic decision functions on a thematic level. Yet these details are not overwhelming- the suspense factor makes this novel a fast paced read."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I would never have picked up this book on my own because I don't like to read (or watch, for that matter) bloody, gory suspense/thrillers. I was surprised and definitely not overjoyed to see it on my class syllabus at the beginning of the semester. Having only seen Silence of the Lambs on the \\"suspense\\" genre shelves, I was fairly confident I would hate it. A lot.I was wrong.While it did have quite a bit of that bloody gory stuff (probably not a negative aspect for most of today's readers), I found that it was also very accessible to people who are not looking for the quick thrill. Thomas Harris really delivers when it comes to pleasing the masses as well as those who want a little more meat to the mystery. Most particularly, the characterization is wonderful. All descriptions fill the characters out; they are very realistic. While Harris makes it clear that the main character is still working her way up the ladder, Clarice Starling is one of the most commendable strong female characters I've ever read in a genre type novel. It was also great that he didn't take the Xena-ish route of creating a strong woman character and then, as a \\"consequence\\" of that strength, make her a lesbian. Harris does very well also with catering to the real desire of \\"everyone getting what comes to them\\" - the outcomes stay congruent with the ongoing themes throughout the novel, but he also takes conventions and twists them - almost beyond recognition. In his portrayal of Jame Gumb, however, I am left hoping that those who read this book on a very basic thriller level are not left with the impression that all male cross-dressers are going to have some sort of sick, twisted mind set about women or about becoming a woman.Hannibal Lecter, of course, is far and away the best characterization of pure intelligence I have ever read. He provides Clarice with the facts she needs, barely in time, and much, much better than some omniscient narrator leading the character through to the end. This adds quite a different dynamic that I thought worked extraordinarily well as we follow Clarice attempting to find the murderer in time to save the next victim. I personally thought that it only figures, the police and everyone finally get running on the case as soon as the next victim is the daughter of a Senator. A woman senator is certainly anti-clich&eacute;, but I think the plot would have worked just as well had the next victim been an ordinary young woman. Harris does have the plot set up so that the senator's moving Hannibal Lecter to a different location is crucial to the book; however, with Lecter's intellect, he could have escaped from just about anywhere (including his original cell).This novel is majorly about Clarice's struggle to overcome her past - to silence the lambs. Thomas Harris follow this through to the end, which, I recommend you not to read first. It'll ruin everything."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"As I was reading some of the reviews for this novel I realized that not too many people liked this book. Well, I have to defend it all the way...I love this book. I thought it was way better then the movie (although the movie was good as well). I have to say that I enjoyed reading it more so then watching it. I feel that reading this book is more suspenseful then just watching the movie because the movie shows you everything. When you read any book, but especially, The Silence of the Lambs, you give your mind a chance to use its imagination. You allow it to envision what's going on by itself, rather then force it to see what someone else wants it to see.I also like this book because it is told from a woman's perspective. However, this woman is not just any woman; this woman is Clarice Starling. Clarice is a young woman with a great body, an enticing smile, an accent, and a drive to succeed. However, her drive to succeed does not take off in the kitchen, where women are \\"meant to be\\"(yeah right). Instead Clarice's drive to succeed takes place in the \\"man's\\" field, the FBI.The novel is not just a book about trying to put an end to a serial killer but more so, I see this is a novel as being about the will to succeed. An even deeper underlying theme one may consider would be that the novel is about the life of Clarice Starling or even as being about the life of women in general.Granite there is a lot of gore in this novel, but I believe that there is an underlying theme. This theme deals with the roles women play. For example, look at the character of Mrs. Starling. We see her playing the role of a working mother, trying to keep life, as she and her children know it. But at this she fails. Then look at the women who are killed by Buffalo Bill. Their roles are as helpless victims, taken advantage of by something more powerful then themselves. Now look at the character of Catherine Martin. A kind young woman, taken advantage of, but continues to fight and use everything that she has to survive. She is gutsy, witty, and full of determination. Next look at Mrs. Martin, a woman who is in a high political position. However, in this novel we are able to see another side of her. A side that begs and pleads and bargains and cries for the life of her daughter. Finally lets look at the character of Clarice Starling. A bright attractive young woman trying to make it in a world of men. We the reader, get to see many sides of Clarice. We get to see her as a motherly/caring figure, a figure of control, a figure of sex, a figure of power, a figure of weakness, and a figure of success; as well as many other figures. The roles of women that I've described above, are not only for women, but are roles that men play as well. However, we don't see too much of male role playing in this novel, unless you consider the stereotypical \\"male power trip\\"(no offense men).As stated above, this book is not for everyone, it is very gory and frightening in ways, however if you can handle all that then this is definitely an excellent book to read. It has many underlying themes and I think that due to the way it is written in some strange way, people on some level or another will be able to relate to it. So just read it!!!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This novel is an entertaining novel that seems to do well with the literary types as well as fulfilling its expectations as a work of suspense fiction. Thomas Harris gives us a character, a theme, and a plot plus an interesting style. These all fit nicely together. This is a novel that comes close to breaking the bounds of its genre and becoming accepted as &quot;real fiction&quot; by elitists. One can ask how Thomas Harris did it? My answer is he took the time to care more about the story than any convention or artsy style.The plot is simple enough. It is well grounded and simply done. Suspenseful, yet not all that surprising. Harris drives the story foreword at a strong pace, not fast, not slow. But you will not be bored with the story by any means.The themes are expressed in a straightforward way, using the form as a reflection of the function. For example, the book speaks a lot about the roles of women and any thing else you can imagine about the male female dichotomy. Buffalo Bill is after these women for their &quot;femininity&quot;, not to have or posses, but to become. Other themes given attention too are the efforts of Clarice to get past her flaws, her own natural or biological advantages/disadvantages, and to outgrow her past. When you read it, just wonder what &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; means.Character is where Harris shines. Clarice is an interesting and complex character without being unbelievable. She has simple wants and goals and is not an unreasonable or whacked out character like those that usually embody the scope of literary fiction. Most important, however, she is a likable character. You go through the novel wishing her well, and hoping that she will succeed, unlike many other stories where your sympathies are not where they should be. As far as Clarice goes, she is believable and likeable, without being radical, which allows you the ability to put your self in her shoes, heightening the suspense!Hannibal Lecter is the second of Harris' great characters. All the things above that apply to Clarice don't for Lecter. Lecter is a genius and a cannibal. He is not normal or reasonable. Harris, however, does a good job for making him believable. I personally found him an unsympathetic character, but most others I have talked to think he is really &quot;a good guy down deep&quot;. Harris goes to great lengths toward crafting this character, I think we are meant to feel something towards him.Another thing that Harris does really well, which is rewarding to the storytellers among us, is writes in a simple manner. He doesn't use incredibly flowery sentences, yet he is no illiterate. His description is direct and to the point, and most importantly, the story MOVES. It doesn't stagnate for 20 pages on a little bird that happened to fly past Clarice's eye. No, the story spends reasonable time on relevant concepts.All the good points about this book come back to the care and love that Harris put into his novel. He didn't just type type type to make a buck and he didn't just plop down a hundred pages of stream of consciousness to fill up space. HE LOVED IT. The way he lovingly crafted the story speaks for his care of the thematic implications. This is the big difference; this is the one thing that makes a good story good.I definitely recommend this novel. Read it for yourself, for pleasure, or for study, either way you'll get something out of it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"The book Silence of the Lambs is a superb book. It had great characters that you could learn to like. Hannibal Lecter semmed so real that,it was scary. Also, the plot was detailed and exciting you could not put the book down. The only downside was a disappointing ending with a showdown with the killer.The best part of the book was Lecter's escape from the Memphis institution. he uses a key to pick his cuffs that he made from a pen he stole. After he was loose, he kills both guards, hides one body, and pretends to be one of the dead guards. He is then put on an ambulance and escapes.The two most vivid elements of the story were the characters and the resolution. The characters were very mysterious, and Clarice Starling seems almost like a real person. The characters had a lot of emotions and the author expresses them in his writing. Thr resolution was great because I could see skin hanging from hooks, the pit, Jame's old sewing machine, and the pitch back of his basement. Well that's silence of the Lambs. It was great and I hope you consider reading it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Actually, I would rate this book at 4-1/2 stars.

And it sums up the razor sharp yet unwittingly tenuous relaionship that the book's two most powerful characters share. Clarice Starling, trainee FBI agent determined to zoom in on Buffalo Bill, the serial killer before another innocent victim gets skinned alive. Hannibal Lecter, cocooned in a maximum security hospital, will lead her on, giving clue after clue and then make his daring, incredible escape. The scene where Lecter bolts out of the hospital is perhaps one of the most chilling and carefully crafted executions to ever find portrayal on paper. So are many other subtle yet superbly horrific parts of this book. This masterpiece sparked off a whole new dynamic genre of psychological thrillers. It doesn't matter if you've seen the movie( which is incidentally, brilliant), it's no substitute for what I could best describe as a monster of a novel. I liked this book for the delicate and shocking way in which Thomas Harris explored the dark depths of perverted psycholgy and also for the novel's shimmering characterization. Lecter and Clarice are legends today. The latter, a metaphor for courage in the face of fortitude. The former, a metaphor for calculated evil behind a sophisticated veneer.If you haven't yet read this book, buy it.When Clarice cocks her gun and steps tentatively down the stairs to the basement in the novel's climactic terminus...look up from the book and at that half opened door and the shadows beyond..."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"First of all, you should review the book, not the movie. As usual, so many people compare the two and there is no comparison.I have read Thomas Harris, including Red Dragon and Hannibal. All outstanding books. The movie does expand on his writings, but also it does leave out some excellent parts that could have been included. I loved Silence of the Lambs and have personally read it more than once. I did read the book before I saw the movie and was, frankly unhappy with the results of the movie. The book kept me awake for hours, not wanting to put it down.I thought the character of Hannibal Lector was excellent and a great contrast to the Starling character. I will say one thing about the movie, they could not have gotten a better actor to play the role of Hannibal. Hopkins was wonderful. I am looking forward to seeing the new movie, as I have just finished the book!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is an incredible book because it works fantastically on two levels. Yes, it is extremely suspenseful (it kept me up all night because I was both afraid to keep reading and afraid to put it down), but it also works on a deeper thematic level, and that's what I would like to pursue here. Harris delves into the difficult subject of the role of the sexes in life. Clarice is striving to succeed in a male-dominated world, but her role-model and source of great strength and courage is her mother, the same woman who failed to adapt to this gender-biased soceity. Mrs. Starling could not keep her family together after the death of her husband. Mrs. Starling did not have the money, education, or resources to make ends meet, regardless of the fact that she worked two jobs. Clarice does not want to fall into the same trap that caught her mother. Although Clarice wants desperately to be part of the FBI team, she will not take any role that will land her as a secretary. She knows too well that once a women is dubbed a secretary she can never more upwards. Instead Clarice finds herself interviewing Dr. Hannibal Lecter and pursing the serial murderer Buffalo Bill. In order to succeed (which is arguably the thing that Clarice wants most) she 'uses' everything at her disposal. In fact the other women in this book 'use' everything they can as well. It is a motif throughout the text; some women use their political power (Mrs. Martin), some the garbage that is thrown at them (Catherine), and Clarice uses whatever she has at the moment, whether it be her ability to flirt, to talk with an accent, or to immitate a mountain midwife. Whether this book is read on a thematic level or simply on a dramatic level, it is a riveting, edge-of-your-seat novel. I'm reading it for the second time in only three months because there is more to explore than first meets the eye. I whole-heartedly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This was an excellent book, great fun to read. It is definitely a great buy and probably a great gift too."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"If you are reading this after seeing the very popular movie, you won't be dissapointed.

The real villan is \\"Dr.\\" Chilton...few of us will meet a Hannibal or a Buffalo Bill in our lives (thank, god!!) but we meet folks like Chilton every day. They are everywhere among us.And they would do to us, what he did to Clarice. The Chiltons of the world are the ones we should worry about. Enjoy Hannibal, but fear the Chilton's of the world.The book doesn't say, but I hope Hannibal got Chilton in the end. It would be his just desserts, though Hannibal, who did have a sense of honor, would probably spit him (Chilton) out as being distasteful. Hannibal, like Darth Vadar, is a villan we love to hate...not so with Chilton."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"In AMC channel, I couldn't help but notice the repeats of the movie \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" The title was appealing and unique, but I never got a chance to encounter it fully until about a month ago. In that month, I had to go on the airplane and decided to buy a book. My choice was not \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" but its prequel, \\"The Red Dragon\\"Though I only went through half of it, The Red Dragon was above expectations. And if the prequel was that good, how good would the book that I heard was thrilling be? So I decided to check it out in the local library. I managed to finish it in 4 days, though I probably could have done it faster. This was the kind of a book that I wouldn't regret having in my shelf.Thomas Harris, a slow writer I assumed, went in a great deal to show how evil human mind can be, and the complexity of human mind. The killer, whom the FBI calls Bufallo Bill, is not one of those killers who murder people because they can and feel like it, but has an agenda of his own. But the true terrifying character of this book is the captor of FBI, Hannibal Lecter, or Hannibal the cannibal. He is what you would call an evil genius, who is interested in the darkest corners of human minds, and apparently, the only person who can help FBI catch the killer.The story is not a simple fairytale, but is another ingenuity of its own. The FBI trainee Clarice Starling is a woman with a wounded past. And she is also apparently the only person Hannibal would talk to. Since opinion of the captive doctor is believed to be helping to catch the killer, FBI must send Starling to interrogate, should I say, Hannibal. Hannibal, on the other hand, also wants something for himself, like a better room, and more likely, the nightmare that chews away Starling. And so the interrogation of Hannibal Lecter makes up a strong core of this book.The fear generated by this book shouldn't be taken for granted. Complex twists and amazing wording makes this book an amazing book to read as well as a terror."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"In recent years, serial killers, like vampires, have come to occupy their own sub genre. Many authors have attempted to tackle the subject, with varying degrees of success. No one, however, does serial killers better than Thomas Harris, author of RED DRAGON, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and HANNIBAL. Taken together, these books constitute a bridge between such groundbreaking work as Robert Bloch's PSYCHO and the surfeit of serial killer novels published over the last fifteen years. These classics also introduced the public to the concept of serial killer as media star, featuring the most popular anti-hero of modern times, Dr. Hannibal Lector.Lector is enigmatic, highly intelligent and erudite. Before his capture, he killed and cannibalized at least nine people (the media later dubbed him \\"Hannibal the Cannibal\\"). As you might suspect, Lector's activities created quite a stir, eventually bringing Will Graham, an FBI investigator, to Lector's office (Lector had actually been the treating physician for one of the victims). During a conversation with the doctor, Graham has an epiphany and realizes Lector is the killer. Lector, perceiving that Graham has found him out, attempts escape. Catching Graham off guard, he guts him with a linoleum knife and flees, only to be captured later by the authorities.All this is background taken from RED DRAGON, published in 1981. As that novel begins, Lector resides in a high security mental facility, placed there by a court. Graham, recuperating from his wounds, is in semi-retirement. He is approached by Jack Crawford, his former boss at the FBI. Crawford seeks Graham's aid in the pursuit of a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (so-named for his penchant for biting his victims), who has already slaughtered two innocent families.Graham reluctantly agrees to help. Hoping to revive his investigative instincts, he visits Lector in his lair. Lector, unhelpful, nevertheless takes an interest in the case and manages to insert himself into the action, providing the Tooth Fairy with Will's home address. This information puts Will and his family in danger, as the hunted turns on the hunter. At book's end, the Tooth Fairy is dead, and Will is disfigured for life. From his cell, Lector has managed to achieve a measure of vengeance on Graham.Lector also plays a key role in the sequel to RED DRAGON, 1988's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, is asked by Jack Crawford to interview the good doctor for a study on serial killers. Clarice visits Lector, but is unable to convince him to participate in the study. Lector, intrigued by young Clarice, offers her something better--his assistance on a current case involving a killer nicknamed \\"Buffalo Bill\\" (so named because he \\"skins his humps\\").Clarice becomes an active participant in the hunt for Buffalo Bill, acting as intermediary between Lector and the FBI. Lector, with previous knowledge of the killer, cunningly manipulates all involved. His orchestrations eventually provide him with an opportunity to escape, one which he eagerly seizes. Clarice, acting on hints dropped by the doctor, eventually tracks Bill down, but her victory is tempered by the knowledge that Dr. Lector is once again at large.These two novels are acknowledged classics of suspense and the aforementioned serial killer genre. Well written, they don't rely on shock value alone to jolt readers. Harris masterfully creates and sustains tension, building to tremendous crescendos in both books. Other authors have written successfully in this genre, but they tend to rely on splatter to achieve their horrific effect, each subsequent novel trying to outdo its predecessors in terms of gore and perversion. One quickly becomes inured to that type of book--instead of revulsion, you react with a yawn. If you read of such actions in the newspaper, you would be horrified; in fiction it is old hat. Harris avoids this trap, relying on good old-fashioned story telling to make his point.Harris resisted the obvious temptation to feature Lector more prominently in these novels, showing admirable restraint in reining in this strong character, using him to enhance, rather than dominate, the action. It would have been very easy for Harris to allow the good doctor to move to center stage--Lector is mesmerizing. Like Sherlock Holmes, he transcends the boundaries of literature, leaving his many \\"fans\\" clamoring for more. Anthony Hopkins' riveting portrayal of Dr. Lector on the silver screen only added to his luster, introducing him to an audience unfamiliar with Harris' novels.1999's HANNIBAL changed that forever. Featuring Lector as its chief protagonist, and Clarice Starling in a supporting role, this ambitious novel began to unravel the mystery behind the killer, providing tantalizing glimpses into his history and motivations. Many were upset by this, preferring Lector's past to remain murky. A large portion of Harris' readership was also turned off by the book's ending, feeling that Starling's fate was inappropriate. However you see it, you have to admire the risks Harris took, making Lector into an almost \\"Bondian\\" hero, having him square off against the obsessive Mason Verger, a horribly scarred, megarich supervillain he helped create.Supposedly a fourth book (listed as BEHIND THE MASK on Amazon) is forthcoming, but, until it's finally published, we all will have to be content with these three books. If you haven't read them, get busy. If you don't think rereading them will be rewarding, think again--none of the thrills or scares are diminished, despite the fact you know they're coming."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Chances are good that you have already seen this movie. If you are curious, the book differs from the movie in several ways. Having just finished the book, I would suggest it is much better than the movie. Given how much I like the movie, this is a high compliment. This review is more based on differences between the movie and book. It is intended as encouragement for those who enjoyed the movie to read the book.One of the great weaknesses of the movie is the inability to demonstrate all of the conflicts that went into catching Buffalo Bill. Between Dr. Chilton, the FBI, local police, and the Tennessee governor, there were numerous conflicts in the competition to catch the ultimate prize. This is a realistic conflict that has prevented many serial killers from being caught earlier or at all. But the greater piece to the puzzle missing in the movie is the complete profile of Buffalo Bill or Jame Gumb. Without knowing his backround, you really do not know the whole story. Also missing is the conflict in Crawford's life that acts as a distraction as he chases the serial killer.It is difficult for a writer to create a villan which the audience enjoys. In the book, I found Hannibal wit to be even sharper. Many of his best jibes were omitted from the movie. Hannibal is a complex villan which attacts the reader's attention with his enigmatic mind. This character is the mark of Thomas Harris's skill in writing.All things considered, I think the movie was masterfully done. However if you only have seen the movie, you do not know the whole story of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I'm sure everyone knows who Hannibal Lecter is by now. If you're reading this review, you are probably contemplating reading the book. The book is a spellbinder. It is well written, to the point that it makes you short of breath at times.

There are thoughts that characters have that just can't be portrayed in movies as well as they were originally described by the author.The bottom line: This book is done exceptionally well, it is incredibly scary, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"After seeing part of the movie I was left wanting more.

Myself, being 14, found it to be an easy read with deep meaning. Read this book and see the movie. Don't leave yourself out."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"What can anyone say more about this story? It is a masterpiece of crime fiction. You have to wonder if Harris was in law enforcement himself. Or maybe psychology. Abnormal psychology. He just knows too much (as shown by his stories) to be just who he claims to be (a \\"reporter\\"?)."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Initially I was reluctant to read the Hannibal books - my mother initially was the one that made me watch it, and our tastes in any sort of media are completely opposite. I watched the movie because of my mother's prodding and was instantly hooked. Without turning this into a movie review, I'll say that I enjoyed the movie very much. I moved on and bought the book.At first I was hesitant about reading it. Would the book be as good as the movie? Would the style of writing bother me? I'll say that Silence did not disappoint. I was captivated by Hannibal; something about him was alluring despite his disturbing history. He had depth; I wanted to know more about him, see what had turned him into a killer. I wanted the case of Buffalo Bill to be solved (he reminded me of sort of an Ed Gein).I breezed through Lambs because I wanted to see what happened next. I found the other movies and read the other books. I'm glad that this has a place on my shelf."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I am an \\"avid fan\\" of Thomas Harris, but this is my first reading of \\"The Silence of the Lambs.\\" The book has much more detail, of course, than the movie, and gave me many new insights about Hannibal Lecter and the other characters in the story. That's reason enough to buy it. The Kindle price is reasonable at $7.99, and the additional detail was, although expected, almost a shock. Harris provides psychological and logistical details about the hunt for \\"Buffalo Bill,\\" who is killing women [possible spoiler alert!] to \\"make a girl suit out of real girls.\\"There are some significant changes from the book to the movie, which add to the suspense and terror of both Hannibal Lecter and the character of Buffalo Bill. The scenes when Clarice Starling has conversations with Lecter are extremely engaging, pulling the reader into the world of Lecter, who cannot be measured by any standard tests or traps, and always seems to be several steps ahead of all the law enforcement people who try to capture or contain him. We also have the slick, disgusting character of Dr. Chilton in much more detail, and knowing (from having seen the movie) of his ultimate end just makes his smarminess all the more enjoyable. He is, in his inept way, as much a criminal as any of the antagonists in the story.\\"Silence\\" is a long book with a lot of twists and turns, and digressions that develop the characters (for example, Jack Crawford's wife), to create a richer world of both good and evil. My feeling is that no character is entirely one way or the other: everyone has something in their past that is a powerful motivator for their present actions and choices. It's hard to write a review of this book without giving away details that the reader needs to discover for her or himself, so I'll just say that I did not \\"know\\" any of the characters from the movie on the level that I did after reading the book.Harris has certain moments when his prose almost becomes poetry, yet most of the book reads more like a documentary; it's very realistic, apart from the extraordinary abilities and intelligent evil (for lack of a better description) of Dr. Lecter. I highly recommend this book for anyone who hasn't read it. Let the movie become a background, and the book will move into the foreground of your imagination, enabling you to go deeper than, perhaps, you bargained for."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I've read this book more times than any other book.

To re-establish a digital library of all those tattered-but-classic paperback novels you finally had to throw away circa 2001.Harris' flagship Lecter story is still as deliciously, deliriously demented as it was when you first threw-up a little in your mouth reading it in the early 90s.

I would reccommend that you read this book, but if you love movies with a lot of content I would watch the movie first and then get the book. The book is not a good resource for making a decision about the movie because the movie is a lot different.

Harris' novels have a great tempo, and I like his \\"cut out the fat\\" writing style that keeps your attention on the story. Silence of the Lambs exemplifies Harris' great writing style. I can see why Hannibal Lecter has become one of the most well-known book villains of our time; the way Harris develops Hannibal's character, you really feel as though you're listening to a crazed psychopath. That being said, I actually enjoyed Red Dragon a bit more than Silence of the Lambs. For one, I liked Graham as a protagonist better than Clarice Starling. I also thought the \\"Tooth Fairy\\" was a bit more interesting than Buffalo Bill. These are both great and recommended reads though."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read the book, \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", written by Thomas Harris. On a scale from 1 to 5 (with five being the highest) I give it a 5. The Silence of the lambs is a fast paced book, which makes it hard to put down. There is never a dull moment, due to the excellent writing of Thomas Harris. The characters Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling are each unique, and the psychological aspects of this book are outstanding. \\"Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming?\\" (Harris p.366). Harris' amazing use of words and interaction between characters makes this book \\"spine-tingling\\" and \\"master of suspense,\\" claims the Boston Herald. In this book you can follow Clarice Starling, a trainee of behavioral science unit of the F.B.I as she tries to find a deadly serial killer on the loose. During the investigation we discover that Starling has a number of frailties in character. A strong-willed woman coming from a \\"low class\\" upbringing, Starling fears that her peers will associate her abilities with her background. She dreads the idea that others would not allow themselves to see past her upbringing towards her unique ability to succeed. While tracking the killer, she begins to learn the psychological games of the one and only Dr.Hannibal Lector, who is locked away in a dark prison chamber. If you are into suspenseful, scary, mystery-horror books, then \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" is definitely a book that you should check out. If you liked Hannibal by Thomas Harris or \\"Felony Murder\\" by Joseph T. Klempher, you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I open the cover, expecting to read a page turning thriller, with little more that one plot twist after another. Harris completely surprised me. Yes, is a page turner, but it is also a well balanced novel with complicated characters such as Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. It is reassuring to know that sometimes, in the best steller lists, there are actually well written and interesting books. Granted, there are a few passsages that should have been written differently, but overall, Silence of the Lambs surprised me."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This whole book is written excellently with surprises and intrigue. I read it in two days. 'Nuff said."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Saw the movie well before reading this book. Usually when a movie follows very close to the book, I don't enjoy the read. This was different, and I can only make a few guesses as to why. One is that I could enjoy the style and intelligence of the author without having to be visually and audibly pummeled by scenes of depravity and torture. In contrast, the movie provided such strong characters--especially Hannibal Lector by Anthony Hopkins and Clarice Starling by Jodie Foster--that they were right there for me to favorably draw on while gaining the extra insight and better pacing that books usually provide. Whatever the reasons, the book is most enjoyable, and well worth read, after seeing the movie or (I suppose) prior to as well."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"If you think you know everything about Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter after watching the movie... you're wrong. Not only is the plot different in some ways, but some of the best (and most intelligent) dialogue never made it into the movie.Speaking of intelligence, Thomas Harris isn't afraid to drop cultural references (such as Glenn Gould and Marcus Aurelius). That's refreshing at a time when many editors are forcing writers to &quot;dumb down&quot; their work.Yes, this is a novel about a serial killer who terrifies a nation. But it's also about Clarice Starling and her journey of self-discovery. And about the nature of evil. There are grisly scenes -- but this novel rises above being a mere gorefest.I've read lots of other serial killer novels. None came up to the level of this one. Many were but pale (but sleazy) imitations.P.S. Many thanks to Thomas Harris for introducing me to the music of Glenn Gould!Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I first read this book on an airplane prior to the release of the movie, which I have since seen at least a dozen times. I've gone back recently to read the book once again, and even with such a familiarity to the story, it still scares me! Although Red Dragon was good and definitely worthy of reading, this is still my all-time favorite and, in my opinion, the best of the series. Harris writes such depth into his characters that you feel as though you know them...the character of Lechter is my favorite...he can be diabolical, sinister, and a genius, all in one scene. While reading the book, I always pictured him to look like Anthony Hopkins, so the film was just a natural transition.I am always the kind of person who prefers to read the book, and it will always get a star above the movie. Not the case here. Both are equally enrapturing....you won't want to put this down until you're done, and even then, the story stays with you.An absolutely terrifying read...lock the doors before you sit down with this!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"This book is a classic. It is a must read! You should also check out the movie. They are equally phenomenal."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I LOVE Thomas Harris. And out of all of his titles, this one ranks #1 for me. I was captivated from page one. I saw the film adaptation years before I read the book and just \\"liked\\" it, so when my lit agent recommended I read this title, I wasn't all that excited about taking the time to do it. But I'm glad I did because I LOVED it. It was one of those rare books that I enjoyed so much I couldn't seem to read it quickly enough.JenniferNever Smile at Strangers"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"In Starling and Lecter Harris created an unforgettable protagonist and antagonist. Starling's background added beautifully to the depth and dimension of this novel. Ardelia Mapp, Barney and Crawford were characters in their own right, fully brought to life and three dimensional, and not just servants of the protagonist or the plot.Harris leaves plenty of room for the reader's own imagination and some of his prose is just wonderful - far more engaging than one often sees in a book of this genre. The book builds steadily to a hair-raising crescendo, and then adds a most pleasing twist.I picked this up out of boredom, expecting it to be rubbish, but at three o'clock in the morning I was still reading it. I finished it within twenty-four hours. It is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"There probably isn't much more that I can say about Silence of the Lambs that hasn't already been said by other reviewers, or questions left unanswered by those who have surely seen the movie by now. While the movie is a pretty good adaptation for its time (and certainly earned its Oscars for the leads), I would recommend those like me who saw the movie first, to go back and read the book for all the minor elements that were obviously left out of the movie. It is those small nuances that will shed new light on this story and on Hannibal Lecter as a character for you.Many people ridicule this book because Starling is not a lead character here. You have to remember she was a pawn. Sure, she's a heroine by the end, but she's not really supposed to be a likable character. Foster did a superb job of making her cold and distant on film.Instead, Harris wants you to oogle and ahh over Lecter, and the reader is afraid to like Lecter because he is pure evil. And in that lies the pure genious of the book. Remember Lecter was in the background in Red Dragon. He's up front and center here and demanding attention.While we do get to know Lecter very personally now, we aren't always given all the information about his past. We want to know more, and that's what keeps the pages turning. Most of the time Harris only hints at Lecter's past victims and what he did to them. Ultimately, you become a secret agent yourself and have to piece the story and the clues together to really figure out who Lecter is.When Lecter escapes and bows out of the storyline almost gracefully, it is that fear in us that he'd pop up at any moment unexpectedly that Harris as an author knew would keep us hooked. And that's why this is one of the best serial killer mysteries ever written. We've been watching Lecter when all of a sudden, Buffalo Bill is calling! Lecter is so psychologically damaged but he is a genious, like a rare beast in a zoo, but sickly attractive. We like him, but we don't want to admit to it.As I said before, read this book for all the little details that the movie left out. Lecter has an extra finger on one hand that comes in handy when he escapes. Starling has a relationship with one of the entomologists. And lots of other little character developments and traits that just don't shine through on the big screen.I've read lots of good suspence and mystery novels since this one, but none of them compare. And sadly, I'm always comparing! Though practically a hermit, Harris created one of the best villians of our lifetime and Silence of the Lambs puts him at center stage!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Picked this up on a recommendation. I'm not a horror/thriller fan, but I gave it whirl. Of course, I saw the movie, but this was said to be a well-written book. And it had been so long since I seen the movie, so... I did not regret reading it.Harris does something with characters that I've rarely experienced. Each one has depth, both complex and compelling. By the end of the first chapter, I already felt snagged deep into a story with three vivid characters. And Lecter is one of the most fascinating antagonists of all time. In fact, is he an antagonist? It's so refreshing to have a villain you should despise, yet can't quite hate. He's intelligent and wiley, honorable and sensual. And despicable. Bravo.Harris writes with unfathomable expertise. He's so convincing on a variety of topics. How Washington works. Entomology. Sewing, for crying out loud. (As a horticulturist, the entomology seemed spot on). It made the experience much richer.There were times the writing seemed inconsistent with verb tense. I don't know if this was intentional, but it sometimes flip-flopped during the same chapter. Also, I'm not sure the POV was always correct, but I could be wrong on that point since I'm not an English major. Nonetheless.I realize having seen the movie and having forgotten much of it besides the iconic scenes most likely enriched the reading experience, but nonetheless I'll be reading the rest of Thomas Harris's books as he's skyrocketed to the top of my favorites list."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Well first off, it is obvious that anyone that has seen the movie (and who hasn't?) will not be as captivated by the gripping suspenseful plot, as a first time read is. That being said, the book is a must read. . FBI trainee, Clarice Starling matches wits with notorious serial killer Hanibal \\"the Cannibal\\" Lecter, picking his brains (get it) to try to catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill. Very engaging plot and excellent characters keep Silence of the Lambs moving along at break-neck speed. A great book for anyone that enjoys a nail biting suspense with a little blood and guts mixed in."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I noticed another reviewer here mentioned an all-time best legal thrillers list. I'm not sure whether I've seen that list, but I thought I might do my own. However, I thought I'd include some classic crime thrillers, because thinking about my favourites many readers might in fact consider them to be more crime thrillers. So some of them are purely legal thrillers, some purely crime, and some crossover between the two.I'm sure having finished the list, I'll think of some I've missed out - so look out for either an expanded top-twenty list, or a lot of joint twos, threes and fours.1. To Kill a Mocking Bird - Harper Lee. 2. Past Imperfect - John Matthews. 3. Mystic River - Dennis Lehane. 4. Presumed Innocent - Scott Turow. 5. The Client - John Grisham. 6.

Do yourself a favour and read this. Better off getting it from the library though. Save yourself money and save paper."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read this after seeing the movie. The movie itself is really good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Hannibal Lecter, but the book itself has plenty that isn't in the movie (typical of any book to movie adaptation)There's lots of scenes in the book not in the movie, so you get an awesome story here. There's not much I can say that other reviewers haven't already said. This is a nice, thick book with a long story, so you're guaranteed at least a few hours of good reading here."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I mean, what can I say? This is the book where Hannibal Lecter first took center stage, and it's a doozy. Harris handles the relationship between the genius serial killer and the newbie FBI agent with a sure and nuanced hand. It's not fair to call this a great genre novel; it's a great novel, period. Harris started the serial-killer trend in fiction, and despite the slew of successful imitators, he's still the grand master. While I like his RED DRAGON just slightly more, SILENCE is still a must read. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Unlike Thomas Harris' first book, Red Dragon, this one does not seem to unintentionally make a villain that is worse than Hannibal Lecter. Despite the fact that Lecter is, for the most part, behind cell doors, he gets into your mind and the minds of the characters in a way that no other villain in Harris' novels can. This was what made Red Dragon a bit short of the mark for me. Silence of the Lambs, however, focuses and uses Lecter to benefit the story.Perhaps my only complaint is that we do not get into the inner psyche of Jame Gumb as much as we did with Francis Dolarhyde. I, personally, enjoy the reasons behind the madness if it is done in a proper, intriguing way. Instead we get bits and pieces that perhaps Harris wants us to piece together ourselves. That, however, would have us assuming and Crawford would sneer at the idea. Speaking of Crawford, he's much more vibrant in this novel. He is a lot less flat and his guidance of Clarice Starling certainly helps him to come out of the pages from a secondary character to one that has personality, pain, nerves, and gentility.Clarice Starling is our main character. She certainly does not have the genius of Will Graham which makes her relationship to Hannibal much less platonic and much more invigorating. She must depend on him as much as she depends on Crawford and it puts her in a vulnerable spot. Throughout the entire novel she is vulnerable, but she shows her heroine side often enough to keep us rooting for her. We know that when the novel gets dicey there will be no one there to save her but herself and so we like her. She is not our damsel. Because of this and her courteousness, Hannibal becomes, for lack of a better word, enamored. Which, of course, throws another wrench in the gears.Jame Gumb, our other villain, a pussycat in comparison to Lecter, is a curious blend of interesting traits that makes us reflect on Ed Gein. Though he does not make furniture out of his victims, he is fashioning himself a suit to fit over his own body so that he might become a woman. His last words make us slightly perturbed but also sad at mental instability, something that Lecter never gives us but Dolarhyde and Gumb have.This is a home run in my book and worth the read even if you have watched the movie. Many things are different about the book despite the fact that the movie is a great interpretation of it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"As a general rule, I don't read horror too much, but when my father mentioned that the &quot;most evil&quot; character ever was Hannibal Lecter, I knew I had to read _Silence of the Lambs_. Not surprisingly, I found it spectacular. Having always been of the opinion that a good story centers around its characters, this book snapped me up from the start. All of the characters are developed and detailed, not to mention unique. Thomas Harris doesn't stop there; he mixes symbolism (I love the way the title is made!) and suspense in as well, bringing the classic countdown to death into play, but somehow he does it without reminding the reader too much of how often it's used. My only regret is that there's but one other book with Dr. Lecter in it."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"When I read this book it scared my pants off. The thought that wierdos, such as described in the book, could be living next door disturbed me. I read Mr. Harris' excellent novel before I saw the intense movie. The book, in my eyes, was much more shocking. I look at this book, in some ways, as a psychoanalysis. It vividly explores the minds of vicious psychopaths. It leaves you wondering: What will happen to Dr. Lecter, the personification of evil? Was he really all evil? Among many other questions. Yet it was not the least bit unsattisfying. I would suggest this book to anyone who hasn't had a nightmare in a while. But don't waste your time listening to me. BE YOUR OWN CRITIC!"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I read the book years ago, and was delighted to see how well done the film was.

Also, if u like Hannibal Lecter u can also read about him in Harris' prequel, Red Dragon.

This is because I was about eight years old when Silence of the Lambs won its academy award for best picture. I love thrillers and this was right up my alley. It was impossible to put down. By far the best thriller I've ever read. I also loved Red Dragon. I hope Mr. Harris decides to bless us with another novel, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, he's amazing."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I admit having watched the movie before reading the book, and was somewhat surprised when someone urged me to buy it. I wasn't aware there was a book at all! But even without having seen the movie, the book is a delightful maelstrom of emotions, intelligence, manipulation and horror. Doctor Hannibal Lecter is both brilliant on-paper as he is on-screen (thanks to Anthony Hopkins scintillating performance). But I prefer reading him - watching in my mind's eye as he manipulates any conversation and manages to outshine any of the more conventional methods of investigation. Clarice Starling, who manages to both impress Lecter and the reader, is indeed nothing ordinary, as Hannibal relates. A fabulous book, easily my favorite, and I'm on my way to reading Red Dragon as we speak. Thomas Harris deserves utmost praise! (And how about another movie with this intrepid duo? I wouldn't mind it in the least!)"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"Harris is such an effective writer that when you create the scenes in your head, they end up looking just like the movie, even if you have not seen it.

My dad passed on &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; to me long before &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was published. I loved it. And then you blew my socks off with your next.

And it was one great thriller! Suspenseful, intriguing, and mesmerizing, this book held me until the very end. Which is exactly what thriller/suspense books are susposed to do so by that I could tell that it was a modern classic. The descriptions are vivid; not just of the actions but of the characters and their ways of thinking as well. I am now about to read HANNIBAL and I hope that it is just as good. With an author like Thomas Harris, I'm pretty sure it will be."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"I enjoyed this book greatly. I feel that it was better then the predecessor to this book, 'The red dragon'. In this novel I had far more contempt for the 'serial killer' involved than in 'red dragon'. I felt that I could understand the forces that turned Francis Dolarhyde into 'The Red Dragon' but could not understand what made Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb so evil. Because I did not understand Jame Gumb it made him seem more frightening and more evil. In my oppinion that made 'Silence of the Lambs' a scarier and more enthralling book. As a character I liked Clarice Starling and found her more interesting than the main characters in the previous book. Haniibal Lecter is a very interesting character, the way in which he gradually led Clarice Starling to the identity of 'Buffalo Bill' was very clever, yet full of his very own brand of evil.I thought this was an excellent book, it was very easy to read and understand, and the storyline was very cleverly constructed. The characters were well thought out and the ending left me wondering what would now the 'Buffalo Bill' case was closed.I would recommend this book to any adult reader, especially to anyone who likes to read horror titles.I would recommend that you read this book after having read 'Red Dragon', and then afterwards read 'Hannibal'. These books are now a trilogy and I feel that reading all three would be a good reading experience.I will no doubt be reading the third 'Hannibal Lecter' book ,'Hannibal', within the next few months. I am sure I will enjoy that too."},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","review":"A rarely seen great book that attracts readers from all age groups. The detailed description of characters, and the insights on each chracters' inner mind attach all characters to the readers.

There are also details of life on the homefronts, life in prison camps(the section on the Berga prison is great) along with quotes from witnesses- both famous and not.There are also some real strengths including some really good insights into the centrality of anti-Semitism to Nazi ideology along with provocative topics such as the discussion of bombing Auschwitz.This is a good introduction that does not skip controversy.Works by Gerhard Weinberg and Martin Gilbert are much more complete and insightful but if you want a good refresher or a solid starting point- this is the book.

I knew parts of the war, but did not know how the entire war unfolded. My basic foundational knowledge on WWII was incomplete.I am most grateful fo this book in that it definitely provides the foundational framework for future WWII studies. Granted, this is a comprehensive study of World War II, however, due to the large amount of material available on World War II, this book gives the reader an adequate foundation of knowledge without going into great detail. Enough explanation is given to lay the foundation for understanding the entire war. The book progresses chronologically showing the unfolding of the war both in Europe and in the Pacific. The underpinings of the war are traced from World War 1, the Treaty of Versailles, and the Great Deprtession. Hitler's rise to power is discussed: what forces influenced his development, his hatred of world Jewery, his racial ideals, and his thirst for brute (empire) power. The multiple alliances of nations which lined up the Axis-Allied powers is thoroughly explained. The battles large and small are chronicled, as well as their importance. The major and minor personalities who made a difference in WW2 are also given adequate attention. Finally, the book concludes with the monentous decision to drop the two atomic bombs, and the aftermath of WW2.This is an easy and fun book to read. It is interesting, informative, and creative in its approach. There are lots of good illustrations, maps, and pictures too. For me, it laid an excellent foundation of the war, that will help me put further studies in WWII in proper perspective.Another resource I recommend for a comprehensive understanding of WWII but visual in nature is Ken Burns' \\"The War\\",The War - A Film By Ken Burns and Lynn Novick.

I give this book my recommendation for a good, quick overview read of WW2 and I strongly recommend to other college students out there to read this book before you take a WW2 course."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"I bought this book because I figured--based on the \\"idiots\\" stamp--that it would give me a very basic overview of the war. And it does...to a point. It clearly lays out the events leading up to the war, and the early days, but once the war gets complicated, this book falls far short of explaining it coherently. For example, it will give a specific date, describe the event that occurred, then move on to describe a broad sweep of events, and then pick back up at the date previously mentioned, which you've long forgotten. Or it will say something like \\"Also in August....\\" but you have no idea what year is being discussed. Sometimes it's easy enough to go back and determine what date the author is referring to, but many times it isn't.The book is also factually wrong in some spots, as at least one other review has pointed out. For example, it says Emperor Hirohito had little to do with Japan's aggression, but I believe that has since been proven false. In reality, the Allies decided not to publicize his central role because they needed him to remain at least a partial figurehead after the war in order to manipulate the Japanese people.I also object to the \\"cartoonization\\" of history--especially a history as awful as this one. I hate the cartoon face (of a civilian woman) that accompanies the \\"Words of War\\" boxes. The face and its expression would be more likely to offer shopping advice, not quotes from famous war speeches. And I hate headlines like \\"Making hamburger of Hamburg,\\" which leads off a section about the bombing of Hamburg, Germany, in which 40,000 people died, many of them women and children. In this case, I think it is probably the editors rather than the author who are responsible.Another shortcoming: The book jumps all over the planet, but there are hardly any maps! So you are left trying to understand the logistic and strategic points without knowing exactly where a lot of places are. One of the few maps that is included does not show the locale talked about on that page and does not appear to relate to anything specifically mentioned in the book.All in all, a disappointing history. For a more respectful, and coherent perspective, I'd recommend watching \\"Ken Burns' The War\\" instead."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"This book is fun to read, entertaining and light hearted. Unfortunately the authors, to entertain, look for off beat sources that are funny but simply false. For example, the portion on the 1940-41 campaign in the Balkans is based exclusively on the works of an aide de camp to the thoroughly incompetent British General who lost the campaign. This unworthy chooses to blame Britain's ally -- Greece -- for a disaster that he largely caused. This episode is typical of the book. Do not waste money on it."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"As a high school teacher of college-level material, I will not prepare a class lecture on World War II without this book. It is easy to read, explains things very well, and has so many interesting details that no one can read through it without learning something new on each page. This coming from someone whose favorite reading subject IS WW2.This book will help anyone understand World War II, and is a lifesaver to those of us who need fast reference in clear English."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"As the generation that lived it fades from view, the memories must not pass as well. The events that led to the only true worldwide war are almost unknown among the younger generation. While they do cover the events of the war in their classes, the incremental incidents that paved the way are often ignored. It took several years of piecemeal surrender and manipulation before the war became a truly hot one. Most of the history of the last half century cannot be understood without this knowledge. Nearly one fourth of the book is devoted to this topic, with many significant events highlighted. The most telling quote is one from Adolf Hitler immediately after the surrender at Munich, \\"I saw my enemies at Munich and they are worms.\\"As one who is fascinated by the events that led to this conflagration, the most impressive parts of this book are the honesty of the presentation. Some may argue that the war in the Pacific is cast in a secondary light, which is true and that this is a flaw in the book, which is wrong. Despite the importance of the Pacific theater, Germany in conjunction with her allies of Austria, Italy, Finland, Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria was by far the stronger foe. In reality, the war was won on the snow swept plains of Western Russia. It was there that the overwhelming majority of battle casualties occurred and the mighty German army was reduced to a shell. If it were not for this, the allies could not have successfully invaded North Africa, much less Western Europe.Events such as the \\"success\\" of the evacuation at Dunkirk are also placed in their true context. A rout led to the evacuation and nearly all of their equipment and ammunition was abandoned, only to be used by the Germans against their other foes. Furthermore, had the order to halt not been given to the Germans, few of the British troops would have been retrieved.Another point where the author stays on task is in the section on the use of atomic bombs against Japan. After over fifty years, it is easy to argue that the bombs should not have been used. This point is not addressed from either perspective, as the author sticks to the facts which led to the decision.Although it took many years and events to make it happen, the six years where the second world war was global were the most significant of this century. Lessons concerning international relations and nuclear politics were learned then and still shape how nations interact with each other. However, it is more important that we all remember what happened in those years and this book will teach you all the basics in a clear and concise way."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"&quot;The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II&quot; is definately an &quot;easy-read&quot;...but it is a fascinating one as well. For instance, did you know that &quot;Nazi&quot; was originally a term of derision? Or why Hitler's Germany was called the &quot;Third Reich&quot;? (What were the first two &quot;Reichs&quot;?) The book is filled with scattered bits of information like that.You'll find much information in easy-to-read little boxes under such titles as: &quot;GI Jargon&quot;, &quot;War Lore&quot;, and &quot;Ask the General&quot;. Each chapter also has several divisions with titles which make one want to read more: &quot;Hindenburg Without the Air&quot;, &quot;Stalin's D-Day&quot;, &quot;War is Easy as ABC&quot;, &quot;War Without Rules&quot;, &quot;Hungry for Hungary&quot;, &quot;What's Different About the Jews&quot;, &quot;Bataan Death March&quot;. Every chapter ends with a section titled: &quot;The Least You Need To Know&quot;, which is a summary/review of what you just read.If I were to find fault with this book, the only shortcoming would be the fact that the War in the Pacific receives short change. The author of this book seemed much more interested in the War in Europe."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"Excellent overview of one of the most written-about subjects in our lifetime. Bard gives us many familiar facts, but also includes information not found in many books, such as about Berga, the POW camp for Jewish soldiers.Easy to read, well-organized, and with an extensive bibliography. A book not just for beginners in history, but a informative book for everyone. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"there are so many books on ww 2 itself as well as individual battles fought in ww 2. for the novice or a person who wants a general overview of this war should start here. the book starts off with the end of the first war and the build up of the second world war. it touches on key battles and a few lesser known ones. the book ends with how nations are rebuilding and US and USSR start an arms race - basically starting the cold war. overall this book is terrific! a must!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"Definitely not the typical book of war history here. Instead of focusing on only one point of the war (i.e. the diplomacy or strategy) this book gives a very informative overview of the events leading up to the war as well as the important happenings during the great conflict. The book also provides interesting side-bar facts that help tie today's world to the world of that time. An excellent account, and a great addition to anyone's history library."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"I enjoyed this book as a overview of WWII. I would have liked to see more grahphics, maps, timelines, etc. Sometimes a page is spent trying to explain something that could have been much easier to visulize with a map or diagram."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"An easy read from the begining. IT details events that shaped the pathway to World War II and the rise and fall of the Third Reich and how they managed to defeat themselves. It also proves a EXTREMLY important point as to the reason why we SHOULD get invloved in foreign affairs and not let them escalate.It discusses how Hitler wanted to shape Europe into his empire and how backstabbing the Russians were and so forth. It is detailed in a lot of places but I would have preffered more pictures and a little more details in some aspects.I recommend this book to anyone either just getting into the events of World War II or need some more facts about it."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"This book had me. This thing kept me up late. While reading this I felt like the events were unfolding anew to me. When Hitler took control of Europe I felt like I was living it. When Pearl Harbor was bombed I felt like it just happened. The retaking of Europe and the invention and use of the atomic bomb all felt like they were current events. This book gives the perfect overview of such a gigantic subject. Everyone should learn about this. Going into this book I knew little of the subject besides the few key events like Pearl Harbor, D-Day, Hiroshima, Hitler, but after reading this book I can realize a larger whole and where these events fit and many more things that went on. Also the book begins with a brief overview of World War One, which is essential to know in order to understand World War Two. I cannot believe what happened in this war and in this modern age.The only complaints I have are that because it's an Idiot's Guide book the tone is sometimes a little too comfortable with the little side notes and anecdotes, but still the author does a good job of not letting the tone get too too casual. The one other thing is that I wish that it had better maps. There are a small number mixed into the chapters, but they are not too detailed. I found myself consulting my own maps. All that aside, for anyone who has no clue about this war and what all went into it will find this the perfect start."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II","review":"I know very little about World War II and whenever I've wanted to learn the basic facts about what happened during this time period, I'd get discouraged by the books on the market. The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War II is perfect for me. It gives me general background about the war, insight into the main battles and people involved and interesting facts. I bought a copy for my son and father!

Fantastic read. What does it mean when authority no longer controls/certifies knowledge?

Wrong! Diana Karanikas Harvey and Jackson Harvey offer even the most diehard Neil Diamond fan facts and pictoral documentation that they won't find anywhere else. Beginning with Neil's birth in Brooklyn, this fascinating and indepth book details all aspects of Neil's life - personal and professional- right up to the present day. Even the most diehard fans, who think they've read and seen everything about &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, will discover something either in picture or text that will pique their interest and add to their knowledge of Neil Diamond.

It's very well written, and filled with tons of great pictures! I learned alot about him that I didn't know, making my appreciation for him and his music even greater."},{"Title":"Neil Diamond","review":"The photos are quite good, really excellent quality. Many of them are cropped to show just faces (you can often find the full versions of these photos online). Even though these cropped pictures are enlarged, they are not grainy in the least. The detail is lovely. My only qualm is that some of the 1970s photos have that familiar pink tint to them from age, and I would have liked to see those restored to a more natural color before being included.By all rights I should have given this book one star for plagiarism; chunks of information from both Rich Wiseman's Solitary Star and Diamond: A Biography by Grossman et al. are used in this book. Entire swaths of Wiseman's book are used almost verbatim, especially during the chapter dealing with Neil's divorce from Jaye and marriage to Marcia. Reading this book immediately after Solitary Star makes this issue blindingly obvious. This book takes so much from other sources that it even repeats their errors, except for one curious change: The dates are not the same. Since this book very clearly used Solitary Star and Diamond: A Biography as sources, and given that plenty of these dates are easily verifiable (the dates he appeared on The Clay Cole Show, the date of his second marriage, his son's birth, etc.) there is no reason for the dates to be wrong, but they are consistently wrong to the point of distraction. Also, Diamond: A Biography mistakenly claims that the spinal tumor Diamond suffered from in 1979 was cancerous, so this book simply repeats the error because no one involved bothered to check sources. (A quick look at an easily-available People article from 1982 would have cleared the mistake up.)Everything is given a ridiculously positive spin, often done deliberately to counter what has been written in previous books, and usually overdone with flowery rhetoric such as \\"blissful\\" and \\"flawless,\\" \\"awe-inspiring\\" and \\"the most wonderful thing\\" punctuated with just a few too many exclamation points to be taken seriously.Ultimately, for a coffee table book there are too few photos, and for a true biography there are too many mistakes. I can't really recommend this book."},{"Title":"Neil Diamond","review":"I love this book, it's even better than I expected! It's very well written, and filled with tons of great pictures!

If you're looking for a well-written, can't-put-it-down gay page-turner, consider your search over. Here you'll find a sensuous older man-younger man romance complete with hot sensual lovemaking and details of growing up gay in a 1969 South by several characters. Much of the novel's setting is at a huge remote villa overlooking a vast forest-fringed lake. Mr. Anderson is quite adept at setting a mood whether it be the uncertainty about Vietnam facing draft-age males in 1969, a blazing fireplace with bone-chilling cold outside, the rampant 1960s drug use, an almost-drowning or the claustrophobic feel of being buried alive(I could almost literally feel the dirt coming down on me). While applauding Mr. Anderson's depiction of gay life(several worthwhile role models in the book!)in 1969 and taking into account the intelligence, awareness and world travelling of the gay characters, my only complaint is that no mention is made of the Stonewall Riots which predate the novel's opening by barely a month(and the novel's main action is the next 5 months)and which had such a huge impact on gay life. Aside from that one tiny gripe, my advice is buy this book, curl up under a warm quilt and read the night away."},{"Title":"Someone Bought the House on the Island","review":"A teenager is seduced into gay sex by an older &quot;sophisticated&quot; man. Then he is encouraged to participate in drugs and orgies. An innocent gay is raped and commits sucide because he is gay. Every conceivable negative stereotype of gays and gay life finds its way into this novel. It is propaganda for the religious right, confirming their worst fears. There is nothing here of tenderness, of love, of reality. And this review will not be printed because Amazon (who wants to sell books) will not print a negartive review."},{"Title":"Makai Kingdom (Chronicles of the Sacred Tome) Official Strategy Guide","review":"Strategy guides were made for games like this (RPGs and Strategy games). They help you get to the end without missing some of the smaller, harder to find moments in the game, as well as revealing some of the more noteworthy secrets.Makai Kingdom's strategy guides offers all this. It gives you a detailed listing of every major battle as well as all the secret battles. It tells you how to find and defeat all the secret characters. It has a listing of every item, weapon, and piece of armor in the game, as well as a listing of the abilities and character classes.The gold in this book, though, is the section that helps you create the best character. It details the progression you should take to make your character as strong as possible, all the recommended abilities, and the best ways to getting the character from start to finish.What I like about this book is that it reverses the pages that will spoil the story of the game for you, making it clear that they have no wish to ruin the experience. I'd recommend this guide in conjunction with the game."},{"Title":"Makai Kingdom (Chronicles of the Sacred Tome) Official Strategy Guide","review":"Though not as packed and bursting to full as Double-Jump Books' other guides for Nippon Ichi's strategy games, that fact can be chalked up to the reality that, as a game, Makai Kingdom is hardly as in-depth as Disgaea or Phantom Brave. Regardless, this book does precisely what it should do, and that is provide the player with every last iota of information one would otherwise need months (or even years) to discern entirely.Makai Kingdom is a tough little enterprise even for those veteran gamers who've cut their teeth on previous titles in the genre. The gameplay is not particularly intuitive and this guide does an excellent job of staving off an otherwise pervasive sense of frustration."},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"I truly enjoy this book. It was the first romance book I have read were the main character is Jamaican and the story setting was in Jamaica. Note, I said in Jamaica, not just Ocho Rios or Montego Bay, but places that as a Jamaican from Spanish Town recognized and gave me familiarity.She did an excellent job of developing the characters in the beginning of the book, but the ending was a little rushed. I had two problems with the book and the author.1. I had a problem with the book was when the author tried to incorporate patois and English in her book. When most American read the book, they will view it as grammatical errors. As a Jamaican, I read it with pure patois, but I can see where American will have issue reading it. She should have used either patois or English and try not to mix the two.2. When Lance brought his god-daughter to visit and Summer had a fit and became hysterical and wanted to end the relationship because she thought he had a kid. The fact that he loves his child is something to respect and appreciate in a man not to run the other direction."},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"The author presents word-pictures of scenes and events with specific details that peaked my interest. She described each character and location as if I was literally experiencing each moment from start to finish. She uses explanation and analysis to present a subject that clarify her idea. All in all I enjoyed reading Hot Summer and considered it to be a very good read, linking cultures, love, sexy,family and friendship values."},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"The story was well thought out and well written. I really like the development the characters go thru not only in their romance but also their personal development. Summer is strong yet imperfect, which I really liked about her. She spoke her mind but occasionally put her foot her in mouth or let her temper get the best of her just like any true redhead. Strongwilled and independent but all it takes is a man who truely cares for her and respects and admires her willpower for her to truely fall in love and I felt this was the true heart of the story.My only issues were first, there were more spelling and grammatical errors then I felt a book of this caliber should have, it would have really benefited from better editing. When I really enjoy a story I tend to get lost in it, as I did with this one, but when I read grammatical errors or missing words its pulls me out of the story and I hate that.The final detail I feel may reflect more on the author, I have to wonder if Ms. Powell is southern and if she has spent much time in the Midwest. I happen to be a southern born woman who is now living in Michigan. First of all, midwesterners don't say ma'am, in fact I usually get very strange looks when I say it...which is something Summer said quite a bit in the book. Also many phrases and illiterations throughout the book from her, her mom and sometimes Lance came across very southern to me and are just not things you hear in the Midwest. With Lance being Jamaican and Summer and her mother being presumably from Chicago this was a big detail for me. Although it maybe just that way for me since I am southern and am used to getting strange looks here in the Midwest for my more southern phrases.All in all I do recommend this as a light and enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"Summer Jones is a steadfast and feisty college student trying to balance a full plate both on the job and off.

If this romance doesn't make you tingle I don't know what will."},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"Hot Summer started of great a real page turner, however somewhere near the middle it seemed to lose steam. Lance and Summer's relationship started off intense. He was mysterious and she was fiery then they got together and the story seemed to fizzle. It went from them building a relationship to go on and on about the interviews and her thesis. I think the story could have been better, if half of the middle fluff had been edited out. Summer and Lance went from spending time together building a relationship to living their lives so separate, that I had to wonder if they were still in a relationship. By the time I got to the middle of the book I was just ready for the story to be over. I think if there has been more focus on developing their relationship and less focus on the mundane interviews, it would have made for a better story. They didn't even really have a dialog once they started having feeling for each other. If Lance hadn't express how he felt to Derrick, the reader never would have know he had fallen in love with Summer. When Summer and Lance were together, there was more focus on his praise of her work than the chemistry between the two. It started off great, died in the middle and ended predictable. I not sure I would recommend this, however I intend to read her other books since this is the first time I have ever read anything by the author. I hope they get better, because this was okay, but just barely."},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal! Lance & Summer made a great couple!

I found them to be strong, opinionated, and arrogant as they bickered in their intriguing power struggle with one another.About halfway through the book I noticed the female lead to become less fiery and strong-willed, and more and more of a damsel in distress. I was also frustrated that such a seemingly smart, intelligent lady would make drastic assumptions and just cry about them believing them to be truth with absolutely no investigation into her assumptions at all. For these reasons, I could not respect or sympathise with the main character, Summer.I found the last couple of chapters of the book and the epilogue disjointed from what I had enjoyed in the first half of the book. There was nothing of the opinionated vixen I admired in the first half of the book. I found the ending too soppy and predictable for the characters. The difference was so apparent that it reads like book was either finished in a rush, or finished by another author."},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel.

The main characters of this book, Summer and Lance, are just totally unbelievable and not developed at all. Even during parts that should have been really hard on her I never felt any established connection. And talk about a cry baby! The smallest thing would send Summer into sobs. Like one minute she was an independent strong women, then be crying like an idiot over nothing. She was totally irrational to say the least.

She really needed some people and personable skills, I don't see how anyone could like her to get to know her enough to see the 'softer' side. She was plain old irritating. I understand she was to come off as no nonsense because of what she saw and went through growing up and the responsibility on her. But that is no excuse for her horrid behavior, attitude, mouth and whatever. I've read many books where the heroine is no non sense, @itchy even but likeable and they usually reserve the tongue lashings for appropriate times and situations, not to any and everyone that said hi to them. Summer took away from the story to me so much so she took the light from surrounding characters, I couldn't even begin to like her by the end because by then she'd only had a few 'good' moments and they weren't big enough. She reminds me of a woman who'd grow up old and alone with a million cats yelling at the kids about not stepping on her grass, nobody liking her, nobody wanting to be bothered with her. So while the story was good, she just sucked the joy out of it to me, therefore it was hard to see anything else or even relish in the good parts of the story. Summer as a heroine simply sucked."},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"An intriguing saga of a whirlwind romance that encapsulates true love at its best.

So I would recommend it but I feel that the story could have gone even further, especially by getting deeper in the love and sexual scenes.I am just very much into the love scenes and feel for such a story to be complete you really have to magnify the sexual chemistry between the two main characters.I would strongly recommend you check out any of the stories fromHot XXX Erotic Stories: The Sexual Adventure And Chronicles of Mark Taylor Bundle- Volumes 1-5 (The Sexual Adventures and Chronicles of Mark Taylor)these are my favorite erotic stories"},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"Bored could not finish if after the first 20 pages I put it down.

The end is completely ridiculous and summed up in a hurry. Again, I repeat, do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"The writing in this book is terrible.

Well, the book was so predictable that I ended up skipping parts. I didn't feel the characters were well developed. Don't waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"The story line flowed effortlessly. While reading about Summer & Lance it was great to see how their relationship progressed from employee/employer to something deeper. With everything she was dealing with (as it pertained to school, life & her mom's health situation) Summer was always focused, intellegent & strong, yet in a lot of ways I found her naivete about other areas of life & in relation to Lance refreshing. I loved that Judy Powell portrayed Lance's character to be a man of integrity who from the beginning realized that Summer was to be (for lack of a better phrase) handled with care due to her inexperience (which he sensed/knew based on his prior experience with women / from being in the field that he was in where women are literally a dime a dozen).I love it when a book makes me smile after reading it & Hot Summer by Judy Powell definitely did that :-)"},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"Summer Jones is always cool, calm and collected unless she has been pushed to the limit. While working as a waitress at the Southern Belle, Summer has a verbal confrontation with a customer and gets into a world of trouble. Lance Munroe, record producer and owner of Munroe Productions, who is having dinner with some of his colleagues, witnesses the incident and is immediately attracted to this spunky little she devil. Summer gives as well as she receives when it comes to putting people in their proper place.Deciding that he would like to get to know her better, Lance decides to visit the restaurant alone. After making small talk, he finds out that she's in grad school majoring in Communications and offers her a job in public relations at his production company. Lance, the one always saying that he will never fall in love, finds himself falling and falling hard. Never in his wildest dreams has a woman been able to get under his skin.HOT SUMMER, set in the bustling city of Chicago and in Lance's hometown on the enchanted and tranquil islands of Jamaica, is a delightful romance. With Summer's feistiness and Lance's calm demeanor, the two are constantly at odds. Ms. Powell also throws in a few secondary characters and enough drama to add spice to this tantalizing tale. The story is well-written and readers will enjoy how it unfolds to reveal a novel of true love.Reviewed by Pamela Boldenof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Hot Summer","review":"I loved the way the writer gave background info on all the characters.

The narrative ranges from anecdotes about him being attacked by Northern Goshawks, to the story of when he lost the power to his home due to a squirrel electrocuting itself on his power line - these tales can bring a tear to your eye, or have you laughing out loud.With Robert Winkler, National Geographic, have found a genuine birder with an obvious talent for writing - you can tell he has a deep passion for the wilds of his native Connecticut home, and for all of nature\`s finery. His writing displays beautiful style and is clearly heartfelt - a treatment which does justice to the subject matter.My only gripe [and this is purely jealousy on my part] is about his different opinion to mine on what constitutes a suburban area! The forested mountains and lakes of his stories are hardly the same as my own suburban patch, which is surrounded by industrial units and housing!Whether you are American, British, or any other nationality, this book will translate to your own experiences, the species and locations involved will likely differ, but the stories hold true no matter what. I can give no better plaudit than saying I will recommend this book to all my birdwatching compatriots, and anyone else who harbours the slightest feeling for the natural world."},{"Title":"Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness","review":"Robert Winkler's Going Wild: Adventures With Birds In The Suburban Wilderness presents the experiences of a veteran birder and nature writer who observes literally hundreds of birds from within a few miles of his suburban Connecticut home. Funny encounters, intriguing observations and natural history blend in a whimsical yet educational gathering of birding wisdom and lore which makes for light, delightful reading."},{"Title":"Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness","review":"This is an excellent book describing what birding is all about;well written by someone who has , if they pick it up in their youth, maintains the interest the rest of their life.Winkler is very typical, even though hardly any two birders are identical and all alter the area of their interest as the years go on.He talks mainly about his birding experiences in the general area around where he lives in Connecticut;but it reflects the same things a birder partakes in no matter where he/she lives in North America.If Winkler were to relocate to Key West,Tucson,San Francisco,Detroit,Denver,Vancouver,Halifax or where I live,Toronto,he would be able to pick up his birding in a very short time.I guess it's a bit like fishing;where there's water,there's fish;and where there is outdoors there's birds and all that nature provides along with it. I also believe that it is the great variety of activities that come under the umberella of Birding that makes it so attractive.Winkler touches on a lot of these things and there are many more.Just to name a few; many birders \\"get into\\"..banding,club activities,Hawk Watching,photography,drawing,listing (building the greatest list of species you can in an area,town,county,state,your own property,from your car,country,life or year,winter list-total species from Dec 1-Feb 28,..it is up to the individual to choose and make the rules.That is the whole idea of a Rare Bird;a new one for your list.So you can see volumes could be written;but this book gives a person a real smattering of this hobby,sport,activity,interest,pastime, or as some might call it an obsession or madness.There is another aspect of birding that probably transends all this is the friends one makes.As a matter of fact,birders often meet another birder in the field and strike up an acquaintace immediately.They enjoy sharing what they know or have found.Winkler also shows that along with birds there is the great experience of being outside and enjoying all the other nature and animals that go along with it.If one travels ,you will encounter all kinds of interesting and wildly different areas.What comes to mind is being in a small boat out in the Gulf Stream,on the trails in the mountains of Yosemite,walking along the banks of the river at Niagara Falls in the winter,in the heat of the desert in Arizona with the snakes tarantulas and lizards,in the Everglades or your own local spot as Winkler talks about.What he really does is show that the enjoyment can come wherever one lives.Overall, this is a book every person will enjoy whether you have been into it for a number of years or just thinking about it.His experiences are just like any other birder who has been doing it for years.It is all there ,just for the taking.The only shortcoming of this book is there was no photo of the author.You can read all the description of a bird you want,but nothing compares to a picture.Come to think about it,looking at birders is great sport when the birding gets slow."},{"Title":"Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness","review":"I bought this book because the writter bought my sister house.Stange dude, but the book was interesting and truthful for a Ct. resident"},{"Title":"Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness","review":"I originally bought this book for my young nephew who is interested in birds. I am glad I took up this book myself, borrowing it from him a few days after giving it to him.Reading Going Wild had the effect of exploding the natural world, seen through the prism of birds, before my own eyes. Being a life-long resident of suburbia myself, for the most part living in northern Virginia close to the Potomac River, I have had some memorable encounters with birds, most notably perhaps when a Bald Eagle played tag with me (there's that anthropomorphizing). What is inspirational about reading Going Wild is that it revs you up for even more bird interaction than you've been accustomed to. And you can't blame a dearth of bird experiences on living in a suburban setting. Once you read about Robert Winkler's adventures, from dodging a maternal goshawk to watching the life-and-death scenes unfold around the backyard bird feeder, you'll be eager to rack up your own.Going Wild is also an excellent primer on birding, full of practical knowledge deftly delivered. I am lucky to be introduced to this world (my own world, it turns out) by someone as uniquely gifted as Robert Winkler."},{"Title":"north american indian sign language","review":"If you do not know and want to learn the basics of American Indian Sign Language then this is a good book to start with. If you are looking for an in depth book to build on what you already know then this is not the book to purchase. For anyone looking for an overview or American Indian Sign Language or wanting to teach American Indian Sign Language to young people then this is the book to start with."},{"Title":"north american indian sign language","review":"This book is an excellent resource for late elementary and early middle school social studies teachers when the topic is diversity or the history of Native Americans. The role of sign language in the lives of Native Americans is explained, which is followed by a series of diagrams showing you how to make the signs. They are split into categories according to topic, and some of the topics are:*) Family*) Counting*) Seasons*) Weather*) Mind signs*) Clothing*) Personal namesUntil I read this book, I was unaware that many of the treaties that were negotiated between the whites and Indian tribes were carried out using the universal sign language understood by all Native American tribes.Since the diagrams make it easy to learn the sign language, it would be an interesting and effective class activity for the children to learn this sign language. The children could be required to learn and carry out conversations using only sign language, or the teacher could occasionally communicate simple requests using the sign language. Teaching diversity is an excellent tactic, but it is very difficult to teach the diversity in forms of communication, as languages are difficult to learn. The ease of learning the Native American sign language gives teachers an opportunity to teach young children the diversity of languages and forms of communication."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"Cons-Multiple choice questions repeat in the six practice tests.-There are a few typos and errors that get annoying sometimes.-It is not as comprehensive as Amsco-BoringOtherwise, it is a nice choice for AP Exam preparation."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I took the AP test and pulled a 4. I used this book mostly in companionship with the Kaplan SAT Subject Test US History book. However, this book is far more comprehensive and is worth it for the practice tests. All the sections are comprehensive but a little on the boring side. Of course, you should have your US History book (American Pageant or Enduring Vision) very handy throughout as some parts are not as comprehensive in this book. But this is definetly an awesome review book by all standards."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"This book was the best test prep I've had yet for any of the AP Exams I've taken. I read the entire review when I purchased it a few months before the exam, then I re-read it two days prior to the exam. Everything that is on the test (aside from recognizing artwork--1 problem on the test) is covered in the book. I went into the test feeling intimidated, but left knowing that because of this review book I did very well. It covers EVERYTHING you need to know, and gives explanations to all the multiple choice responses, explaining why or why not each response would be a correct or incorrect answer to the question.

I bought this book from amazon and was extremely excited. I opened it up and my jaw DROPPED! It is comprehensive, but that's not why I was shocked. IT IS DOWN RIGHT BORING. If you're like me, you need something to keep you awake. I love test prep that works and that's is why I am warning you to stay away.Yeah, it has information, but not even as comprehensive as Peterson's or Princeton Review's. The sections were very minor and didn't have much detail on certain events. There were no practice questions after sections! I guess I would buy it for the practice tests but even those weren't great. Check out Arco, Kaplan, of Princeton Review. Any Barron's or REA book is horrible (even the format was boring:just plain paragraphs, no margins, sidenotes, concentrated material, jokes, pictures)."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I prepared for the APUSH exam last May just by reading this book for TWO WEEKS (and I read an older version of this guide).

The review section, while lengthy, lacked information on specific historical figures and left out many of the unifying themes that are indispensable when writing essays for the exam. At best, I skimmed some of the sections, but I found some irrelevant information. This book is great if you have lots of time on your hands to read all of the review section carefully. As for me, I found the information presented in a less than stimulating manner and I ended up relying on course-notes outlines, rereading my American Pageant, the Princeton Review book and my teacher's afterschool review sessions.The multiple choice questions on REA were alright, but a bit on the easy side. I didn't attempt any of the essays at all; the questions were oftentimes far too specific or presented in a format that they don't use in the actual exam. The sample answers they provide for the essays are far beyond what most people could write in 45 minutes or less. The Princeton Review book on the other hand has better practice tests because they go through different approaches you might take with the question by bullet-pointing some key details you should include instead of writing out an essay for you. Also, the CD had a few errors.Overall, it's probably a good book to accompany your text throughout the year, but for studying in April right before the exam, it hinders rather than helps.And since most people seem to be touting the virtues of this book without giving any concrete evidence of it working, I'm going to tell anybody considering this book outright that I got a 5. Just goes to show that you don't need to depend on a killer book like this to score well."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"great review of all the material. a little boring but if your serious about the AP than it's an amazing book to have.

The multiple choice questions usually give the average person a lot of trouble but this book gave me confidence and i got to take actual tests with actual questions and a FULL explanation on the question and it's answer. Wether it be for last minute cramming ( and you will choose to study the questions and learn the format and see strategies and gain confidence) or for a full time studying with the GREAT review that focuses on ONLY the RELEVANT material, then this is definetly the book to get.

The information it contains is brief (only about 230 pages compared with my 1000+ page textbook!), but informative enough to do well on the test.

When I look at these reviews, I always want to know what the person got on the test with the book, so here goes: I got a 5. I read some great reviews of this book and I decided that I should get it. It was really thick, and kind of intimidating at first. But your best bet on AP tests is to set aside about a month before the test in order to study. This book keeps you busy through your studying time. It has comprehensive reviews of each major event in US history, from the Europeans coming over to the horrible attacks of September 11, 2001. So I recommend setting aside a little time each day and curling up with this book, and just reading over the sections (all the while reviewing text and class notes). If you do all of this, I guarantee that you can get a 4 or 5. Another great way of learning is to use this book as a supplement for your everyday studies (not just in the month or so leading up to the test). Just an idea, but anyways, BUY THIS BOOK and you'll enjoy your great grade come July."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"This book was a godsend throughout the year of AP US History. It helped me on my teacher's tests, and helped me thresh out the facts from my HUGE, overly wordy and flowery textbook. When it came time to review for AP, I gave this book a really good, focused read (I didn't review with my textbook because it would have been a waste of time), and I took the three tests on the computer. I read all of the explanations for all of the questions, and this really helped come test time. I also read the Princeton Review's book, another good, but not too detailed review. I took the test in there, too, and then I was ready for the test. The multiple choice section was not bad at all, because I had my facts straight thanks to this book's review and tests. And the essay was not too bad either, mostly because of this book.Get this book, read it all year, and read the review hard in the weeks leading up to the test. Take the tests, read ALL of the explanations, and read the Princeton Review's book and take its tests (I only took one). You will then have a good grasp of both the themes and facts of US History, and you should do just fine on the AP test. You could very well be surprised with a 5 like I (very happily) was!"},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I used this book throughout the year during my AP class.

Hands down, this book has the best AP US History practice exams.As for Review. This book is not for lightweights or last minute crammers. It has a hefty and comprehensive guide that covers every nook and crannie of the AP. I advise you to buy this book at the start of your AP History course, and read it while you cover the material in class. As i said before, the review is comprehensive and accurate.

Their grading scale is off on the Free Response portion- some very very minor typos- No review questions at the end of each section unlike most other review books- Does not emphamize much about how the test is graded- Key Cases and Names are hard to find ( I ended up highliting them the first time I read them for easy reference)- *My* CD did not work.

Don't expect to get through it and get something out of it one week before the test! Now that that's been addressed, let's talk about this book. I read the whole summary and took about 5 of the 6 practice tests. This book is really great. The summary is concise and outlines everything you need to know for the exam. I really recommend pacing yourself and highlighting the important ideas. As the AP exam was creeping close, everyday I would look over my highlights - I think this really helped me on the test. The practice tests are very realistic and fair, try to take as many of them as you can - it's great practice. Make sure that you give yourself the correct allotted time so you can make sure you know how to pace yourself on the real one. With the practice questions came a TON of essays - great ones! I found it so helpful to look over the key essays provided. There were key topics like the The New Deal and Immigration. I really recommend getting this book, but make sure you have enough time to finish it! If your strapped for time, maybe try the Princeton, which is lot shorter. But if not, this is the way to go! With the help of this book, I got a 4, which I'm very happy with.

Since there is such a large amount of review material though, I would recommend purchasing this book early in the year and highlighting important things in each section, so when you study for the AP test a month or so before the actual AP test you won't have to freak out about what parts you'll need to read out of the entire 200 pages of review (or just skipping it altogether.Besides the excellent review this book provides, the best feature of this book in my opinion would be the six review tests it provides, along with about 6 sample essays for each of the tests. I did not do any of the essays myself; beginning in early April I simply went through ones I thought might be important topics on the exam, read them, highlighted them, and then studied them. As for the 6 multiple choice parts of the exam, I completed about 3 of these, and highlighted ones I got wrong. I would recommend doing one practice test a week before the exam (since I started them in april I only completed three) and reviewing only the ones that you get wrong.By doing everything I mentioned above with this book, I got a 5 on the exam (2006). The two FRQ (Free Response Questions)'s I had to write for the actual AP exam were practically the same as two of the essays I had read in this book, so it really was an invaluable tool.All this being said, if you buy this book at least a few months before the AP test it will really help you on it; if you buy it only a short time before the test you should probably just skip the review and try a few practice tests, look at the ones you got wrong, and study that time period (and of course read some of the essays)."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I would like to start off by saying that this book is not perfect.

It has six practice tests, and a 270 page review to read. It provides plenty of info and practice.(...)

This is an indispensable, excellent book in terms of a general review for the test. The review is helpful in the following areas:1. Events leading up to Revolutionary War2. Events leading up to World Wars I and II3. Causes of the Great Depression4. Truman's and FDR's responses to Depression5. Presidential policies and Cold War foreign policy ensuing WWII.6. General review of post 1980 eraThe multiple choice tests are slightly more detailed and require a little more extensive understanding to achieve well on them, but they model the actual AP tests right on the money.However, obviously this book has not performed enough research into the actual AP test. It focuses excessive attention to the wars themselves, and the AP test since its inception has NOT tested specific military events (how many people died, who won here or there in Europe campaign, etc...). Especially awry are the essay questions...my advice is to not practice them but to read over the samples they wrote, which are helpful in providing info.If you really, really want to get a \\"5\\" on the AP US history test, I recommend that you do the following things ASAP:1. Don't just read, but study the review in this book2. Do all the multiple choice tests and read the answers3. Monitor your progress4. Utilize multiple books (I suggest the Princeton Review book also and if YOU ARE REALLY hardcore, get the \\"Arco Master the AP US history Test\\" book...if you know the material in that book, you might as well get a \\"6\\" on the test!!!5. Go to the AP central website and do the 40 MC samples the test committee actually put out for everyone to do.6. My most important advice to anyone desiring to do well on the test....go to apcentral.com for US history and do every single one of the free-response essays and DBQ questions (1999-2006 now) they have generously provided for ambitionous students like you. I cannot stress how vital it is to complete them and strive to improve on every subsequent year's essay portion. Then, read the sample student essays they gave out and read the guidelines for the essays. Mark which facts/concepts you had no idea about and investigate it in your textbook or REA's review book.After a few essay practices, you will discover that the questions are extremely closely-related. They are worded slightly differently and may ask you to draw different conclusions, but importantly the facts and concepts are still there...if you know those, and have a reasonable ability to apply them to general historic trends, then you will find the essay questions a breeze.you guys reading this must be gungho about doing well on the exam; so, in a summary, get as much PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE as possible!!!!

It was helpful the entire year through, as it is good for catching up on missed notes, reviewing for class tests, and writing essays. I only wish that it had an index, as it would have made the information easier to find when necessary. Also, the testprep software seems to be only for show. I was lazy and didn't touch this book for about a month before the exam, but crammed the night before and the morning of, and just barely passed with a three. But I passed, amd I'm sure this text had something to do with it (especially as my class did not make it past WW2, and this book did)."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"Pros: In depth, great explanations, organized very wellCons: Lengthy, does add extra details that will not be on the testOverall, this was a great book.

However, it goes very in-depth which is bad for cramming. The actual AP test doesn't ask for dates; it asks for social and political trends. Sometimes it asks for dates and specific things, which is where the REA book really shines. The REA book goes by time periods then breaks everything down with clearly labeled, easy to read section and subsections. If used to study early and not for cramming, I think it is an invaluable, handy book to have."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"yo,i don't usually rate products, and maybe this one is extinct, but i feel it is my duty to tell the world how awesome this guide is. in the week leading up to my us history ap test in high school (may 2004), i blew off my friends every day at lunch and instead hung out by myself and read this book COVER TO COVER. this, combined with having memorized all of the us presidents in order, allowed me to blow the ap exam out of the water.if it's no longer being sold new then step up and get it used. jeez. or get the new version, but this was the one that enabled me to kill it after blowing off the class all year.-zachary burt[...]"},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I scored a 5 on the AP U.S. History exam using this book.

While other books give topics and short summaries, REA gives all the important details. It is like your textbook, condensed. Buy it if your looking a few weeks ahead of time and want a comprehensive review. If you want a skim review, buy a different book because REA lacks any timelines or lists of important details. Also, the setup within can be a little confusing, so it may be helpful to have some sort of timeline to keep track of events. However, for pure amounts of information condensed for the multiple choice questions, you can't do better."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"i took this as a sophmore and we didn't have an official class but i had a pretty good teacher, the book was pretty good for looking up events and the tests were really helpful because they explained all the answers and essays. there wasn't any index though so you have to look up things using the chronology. i don't reccommend buying the version with the CD Rom because some of the tests are the same. i passed the AP anyways =)"},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"Nobody's going to kid you, AP U.S. History is a tough class. If you're looking to do really well, you're probably going to have to work hard all year preceding the exam. Choosing a test-prep book is a confusing process, considering the myriad options. Your first step to doing well is buying this book. I've flipped through every other test-prep book out there; none come anywhere close to being this comprehensive. Instead of memorizing facts that may or may not be on the test (your sorry luck if they're not!), this book will give you enough information to understand the course of events, making it easier to deduce a correct answer within the options presented. If you give yourself enough time to actually review all of the material in the book, there will be no surprises on the test. The practice tests will over-prepare you if anything (I wasn't doing particularly well on any of them, but I managed a 5 on test day). Just a note, if you're looking to save a few dollars, consider the edition without the computer software. It might be easier to point and click while you're reviewing, but that option won't be there when the proctor hands you the test."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"This book helped me a lot on the AP US exam. THe information review is about 200 pages long, so it it very concise and most important of all, you can do the entire review within a week easily. My only complaints are the dated material regarding grading. The DBQ used to be graded on a 15 point scale, but now it is graded on a 9 point scale (The book says it is worth 15). Also, the practice tests are so-so. They are somewhat different than the real test and don't buy this book only because it has 6 tests while others have 2 or 3 (there is NO way you can do all of the tests unless you stay home all day and study. Still the practice tests do help a bit. I recommend this book to anyone. Cracking the AP US I'm sure is fine, but they spend too much time mocking the test and the College Board, and when there's only a few days until the big test we all hate the College Board enough, we don't need to be reminded."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I've seen every prep book out there for AP US History and I must say, REA is the best. Having already taken the AP test last year (and might I add scoring a 5 on the exam), all my studying and preperation came from this book. I didn't even bother to look over my volumonous notes... REA provides extensive information about literally every subject covered in the AP US History course. Looking even beyond this, this book also provides several tests as practice. Might I add, these tests are accurate representations of the actual mutiple choice section on the offical exam. I cannot stress enough how important it is that one take all of these practice exams before the actual test date. Not only does it provide you with a fairly accurate depiction of how you will score on the AP test, but it also allows you to review events and concepts you may have overlooked. If you are serious about scoring well on the AP test for US history I urge you to purchase this book -- and this book alone. To be honest, this is the best of the best... buying anything else in my mind, seems wasteful and unintelligent."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I was unsure what AP review book to get at first and like everyone else, I checked out reviews online, trying to decide which was the \\"best.\\" The two that had the best reviews were this one and the Princeton Review. I got both. I must say that the REA test prep book is the best BY FAR. You may not want to rely on the questions too much, because they aren't exactly the same as the AP exams, but the review section is excellent. I was never a studious note taker in class, but this book covers not only the political events but also the cultural changes too. All the major time periods are covered, all the information regarding presidents - their actions and their times - are covered, and even the social movements - including the arts, literature, and some music. The book provides a thorough overview of all that you need to know for the AP exam. If you read this book the few nights before the exam, it is extremely useful. I got an easy 5 using this book as a very helpful review. I highly recommend it to anyone hoping to do well on the exam."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I took Ap U.S. History last year, and after getting a 5 on the exam in May 2001 I decided to review this book in hopes it will be helpful for future students taking this exam. Overall the book is very well done, with a good review section-not too short, and yet not too long. The real gem of the book for me, however, lay in the 6 practice tests. Even though the practice exams are not entirely like the ones on the Ap, they have very good questions and practice essays, that are worth doing. I used this book as a supplement to my class, and doing the practice questions not only increased my knowledge of U.S. History, but also helped me to better analyze and deconstruct AP questions. If you have an interest in history and are a decent essay writer, and are willing to memorize and analyze many facts, then i would reccomend taking this class, and purchasing a copy of this book."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I was not in the American History (AP) class, and I took the AP Exam using reading only this book.

We were only learning about the 1st decade of the 1900s when the AP exam came along! I ordered this book because it had good reviews, and I was desperate to get at least a 3, but with the help of this book, I got a 5!! The AP test is pretty tough, but this book does a good job because it gives you a summary of each important person, event, document, etc. without going into too much or too little detail. All of the other books I've used either inundated you with so much information that there was no possible way to read and memorize it all, or barely gave you any information. REA, however, gave the perfect sized summaries. It also has some very helpful practice tests, but you should be aware that they are not actual AP tests. I would recommend the Princeton Review's AP book if you want to take some authentic AP tests from years past, or if you want help with writing the essays or DBQ, but their summaries of U.S. History are vague and short. The only other problem I found with REA was that it did not cover enough of the civil and women's rights movements, which unfortunately happened to come up about 4 times on the AP test I took. However, this is only a minor detail because I still ended up getting a 5 even though I skipped those questions. Without ever taking an AP U.S. History class, I think you could get a 3 if you STUDIED from REA's book, but if you're in the class you can definitely get a 4 or a 5 if you STUDY hard. I've seen a few other U.S. History review books, but this one is by far the best."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"With one week left before the 2001 A.P. U.S. History exam, I picked up a copy of this book at a local bookstore. The most helpful feature of this book is the outline of all of the important material that you need to know for the test. The textbook used in school was very wordy; with the outline, I got the bottom line right away. I ended up with a 4 on the exam, so I was very satisfied. Now, I did have to work throughout the school year, but this book definately made it easy to review.One warning...while the sample tests are helpful in reviewing, don't use them as a guide to determine how well you'll do on the test. The ones in book tended to be more detailed than the actual test."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"I took the AP US History class my junior year of high school. While we had a fairly good teacher who had us take practice tests every few weeks, I scored higher than most of my peers because of this book. This book is invaluable if you are genuinely interested in scoring a 4 or a 5 on the AP test. For someone like me, who really needs as much credit as she can get for an out-of-state college, this book was a godsend! Two weeks before I took the official AP test, I completed all the tests from the software and received a reasonable score from that. Come test day, I was completely prepared and knew basically every multiple choice question on the test. The essay portion of this test was a different story (a marathon 3-hour test is sure to fatigue anyone), but I ended up receiving a 4 on the test. Many reviewers have said buy the book withOUT the software, but I recommend against that. For a test such as the AP US History, you will need to be as familiar as you possibly can with a litany of questions, and the TestPrep software ensures you will have plenty of opportunities to improve your score."},{"Title":"REA's AP US History Test Prep with TESTware Software","review":"No CD come with this book.

I took the AP US History course my Junior year in high school and had a leftist teacher who didn't know how to teach. Without this book I would have probably gotten a four at best or even a three (ouch). That Junior year April and May was at best hell. I had two weeks to prepare for two ACTs in the same month, then I had two weeks to prepare for the AP Test, then two weeks to prepare for the SAT II's. Two weeks are all you really need. I took all the multiple choice tests and read the 229 page recap of american history. By the time I was done I had written three or four free responses, taken 8 multiple choice tests (two supplied from my teacher) and done three dbqs. I knew I was prepared. I was worried that my writing was a little disorganized but I was confident. I got a five, I couldn't have done it without this book. Buy this book and it will improve your grade. It even helped for the SAT II's which I scored a 750.

While it is an okay book, I definitely recommend other books. At my school library they had two books which I found much more helpful then this one.1) Cliffs AP: United States History - This book gives great tips, giving the basic outline of US History. It doesn't go into details, but tells you for each period in history what the most important things are to remember. In the back there are some practice tests.2) United States History: Preparing fot the Advanced Placement Exam, by John J. Newman and John M. Schmalbach - This book goes through the most important events in detail. At the end of each chapter there are sample multiple choice and Essay questions and a DBQ question. It also points out the key terms to remember in each part of history.Basically, I don't use the REA book at all. For me it turned out to be a waste of money. A combination of the two books mentioned above is the best way to go. However, everyone likes to study differently, so go check out the books at a bookstore before deciding what to buy.

In meeting this personal challenge, she threw herself into a project of dramatizing a collection of her poetry. I helped her gather the rest of the cast and we met at her home in Ann Arbor, Michigan for tea and rehearsal. She was a heroic woman, widely traveled and deep of feeling. She engaged life, read \\"Stand in a storm\\" to get the sense of it.Her faith was profound. She and her surgeon husband were missionaries to China. The artifacts from asia included a thank you silk scroll from the Dali Laama for the eye surgery he successfully performed. Mrs. Smith treasured the framed letters to her from Lord Dunsany, the English author and fantasy writer. She had lived in the church, teaching Sunday School and attending on into her eighties.She told me that she was very popular in England. One of her many poems is set in three parts of the day at Glaslough in Ireland. I cannot remember the landed gentry's name, but she was a guest there. The evening part of the cycle is my favorite of her poems. It evokes a deep longing for Celtic lands, \\"beneath the window's sudden glow\\". Something about it reminds me of reading Lewis Carrol in my great-grand-mother's library.Hazel Smith had a profound gift of finding common points. Her poetry is full of the imagery and feeling that is part of common humanity. Her poem \\"So brave the human heart\\" paints a picture of the frailty of mankind and the strength and bravery of rising to meet the challenges of mortality(see her book Mortal Harvest). When last I saw her she gave me a thin, self published, volume about her family history. She wrote a note, remembering our ancestors were both Michigan pioneers and lumbermen. This was her way, giving entre into her life. She noted, with satisfaction the shared experience with literary flourish.I shall always remember our first meeting. I was summoned with an invitation through our pastor. \\"Its tea at four o'clock.\\", he said. \\"Do you know what that means? Wear a jacket and tie.\\" She spread a poetic high tea. The cakes were delightful. I think there were cucumber sandwiches and the tea was Chineese Jasmine. There were flowers floating on the surface. I could write my own poem about the smell of Jasmine tea.Of all the things I learned from her, I treasure most the rehearsals in reading her poetry. Sometime when I recite a piece of hers, I hear the resonance of her voice. Being a man with a bass range, makes no difference. I often thought she liked her words best spoken by a man. Her spirit was bigger than her, then, frail body. I remember her talking about building a lake on her fathers farm. I see her, in work clothes, digging and building. Damning that water into a lake."},{"Title":"The ABC's of Chakra Therapy: A Workbook","review":"Deedre Diemer has a wonderfully clear and concise knowledge of the mysteries and applications of the Chakra energy centers and the healing applications found within all of us.

It is a book by an analytic philosopher, for analytic philosophers. Even among them, it will interest only the mandarins, the true devotees of contemporary analytical metaphysics and modal logic. But, for that select audience, this book is a treasure. It is a paradigm of philosophical analysis, lucid, concise, rigorous, and informed throughout by a luminous clarity of vision. The book concerns itself with a single problem of fundamental philosophical interest and importance: what do counterfactual conditionals mean, and when are they true? And such is the author's consummate brilliance that he manages to solve this problem, in its essentials, in less than a hundred and fifty pages. In this review, I will not attempt to detail its contents, since Amazon already has information about that. I will simply give my own opinion of its significance. The reader who wants to know more should get a copy.&quot;Counterfactuals&quot; is that rarest of things: a truly original philosophical work that actually *succeeds* in its stated aim. To my knowledge, the only person, in the whole history of philosophy, to have developed an even remotely similar approach to the problem of counterfactuals is Robert Stalnaker, and Lewis' work is I think indisputably superior, subsuming Stalnaker's approach as a special (and doubtful) case. (Both works were, historically speaking, made yesterday--a mere generation ago.) If I am right in thinking that Lewis' theory is substantially correct, then he would seem to be the first man in history to have achieved a philosophically adequate understanding of counterfactuals. This book, in my opinion, represents a fundamental breakthrough in logic and metaphysics, for which we owe its author a debt as great as that owed to Kripke, perhaps even comparable to that which mathematics and logic owe to the works of Frege."},{"Title":"Counterfactuals","review":"This is an excellently written book on modal logic.

Unfortunately, it didn't pan out that way.Spread over a whopping 359 pages, the book lists exactly 100 tasks that you can accomplish with a regular expression. As the solution, the author not only gives a regular expression, but also a complete source code snippet in C#, VB.NET, JavaScript and VBScript. Not all solutions have snippets in all languages. Some solutions also have a snippet for ASP.NET.Obviously, the examples have a heavy bias towards Windows and .NET. If you're using open source languages, you may want to look at this book's precursor \\"Regular Expression Recipies\\" instead. It's essentially the same book, with almost the same list of recipes, but with examples in Perl, PHP and Python.Each recipe also has a \\"how it works\\" section, essentially transcribing the regular expression in English, similar in approach to RegexBuddy's plain English regex trees, though the book uses a flat description rather than a tree. The descriptions are brief though. While all the source code snippets easily take up two or more pages per recipe, the explanation is often barely half a page long.The book does suffer from some sloppy editing. The regular expression in the source code snippets isn't always identical to the one in the description. E.g. in recipe 6-21, the JavaScript snippet uses named capture, and the explanation then proceeds to explain a regex without named capture (which isn't supported by JavaScript). Most of these issues are trivial, but it isn't good for a book that's obviously aimed at beginners.Most of the recipes solve rather basic problems, organized in six chapters. The first, \\"Words and Text\\", deals with finding blank lines, repeated words, words at the start or end of a line, etc. The \\"URLs and Paths\\" chapter has examples for finding URLs and file paths, and extracting bits from them. The \\"CSV and tab-delimited files\\" has a few recipes for converting between the two and extracting fields.The \\"Formatting and Validating\\" chapter shows how to validate numbers, currency, dates, phone numbers, addresses, etc. The \\"XML and HTML\\" chapter has recipes for matching and replacing tags and attributes. Finally, the \\"Source Code\\" chapter has a bunch of recipes for manipulating software source code and related files. Most of these tasks are odd jobs that .NET programmers may want to do sometimes.The book would have been a better deal if it had focused on regular expressions, and left out the many lines of source code, not to mention the redundant copies in several languages. Without the source code, a book of the same size could easily contain 300 examples. That would have made it far more useful for programmers who know how to program, but aren't well-versed in regular expressions.As it is, I can only recommend this book to people who are not only new to regular expressions, but also relatively new to programming. The book does contain many recipes that solve basic problems you're likely to encounter when writing .NET applications or scripts for a web site. If you happen to use C#, VB.NET, JavaScript or VBScript, and are looking for a cookbook approach, you'll certainly find the book useful.But don't expect to really learn how regular expressions work from this book. If you develop software for a living, you're better of with a good regular expression tutorial such as the one at www.regular-expressions.info or a book like \\"Mastering Regular Expressions\\"."},{"Title":"Regular Expression Recipes for Windows Developers: A Problem-Solution Approach","review":"Regular expressions are one of the most abstract topics for the average developer to master. Nathan does a real good job of producing something that any developer should be able to start and build their own base library of core expressions.The approach he takes by presenting some introduction to Regular Expressions, then presenting usable code in three languages is so useful.

I feel the need to rebut some of the reviews here especially the \\"most helpful\\" one that 18 or so obviously deluded people have voted for. Jan Goyvaerts clearly hasn't got a clue.I actually own this book so I looked up section 6-21 that he calls out for \\"sloppy editing\\". He mentioned that the JavaScript version doesn't use named captures like the .NET versions because they are not supported. I'm not sure what his point is. This fact is called out specifically in the \\"How it works\\" description and it's the JavaScript version that is then broken down _because_ it's the odd one out.I love this part:\\"Obviously, the examples have a heavy bias towards Windows and .NET.\\"He says it almost like that's a negative. Look Captain Obvious, Windows and .NET is right in the title/subtitle of the book!I also think that he's missed the point of the book entirely. His suggestion to leave out the source code is ridiculous and the whole point of the book is to show you how to _implement_ the regular expressions in the different environments as there are subtle differences between them. It would be like leaving the directions out of a food recipe and just listing the ingredients.Mr. Goyvaerts also recommends you go a certain web site for RegEx help and information. I wonder why:\\"Page URL: [...]\\"\\"Copyright 2003-2012 Jan Goyvaerts.

I was hoping that this book would do my homework/job for me and am disappointed that I might have to think instead of just copy/pasting.Reviewer Chris Love hits the nail right on the head.

The poem, a grotesque, pathetic languorous sentient Wertherian whirl was written at the beginning of Musset's liaison with George Sand.In 1833 there appeared in Paris a \\"blisteringly erotic and sacrilegious novelette\\" called Gamiani, or the two nights of excess.The rights were pseudonymously, if by a feeble veil of anonymity, accorded to a Baron Alcide de Mxxx, but the erotic tale went unnoticed by the upper circles of Parisian salon society or it would have been but an easy effort to devise the genius behind the devilry.The narrative is all the more lush in character and flush of interest because it explicitly fictionalizes the psychological corruption that besotted the last great French Romantic. George Sand, a glamorous Sapphic literary heroine renowned for both her gender-bending transgressions and for her seductive ways rendered myth by her contemporary social circle and the jurisdiction of Historical reprises. Sand has been the subject of a couple of Hollywood dramas, particularly respecting her relationship with Frederic Chopin, wherein she is blithely imputed to having acted as the spurring whip that defined Chopin's break from Liszt's serenading style, the experience however was at the expense of his health, stability and innocence.Likewise, undeniably, the rupture of the liaison that is foreshadowed in Gamiani, both passionate and lascivious, resulted to affect the playwright of Fantasio in a most destructive way. Arguably even his art was changed for the worst, but the hereon demise of his health and his moral character's depression does not allow for much debate.The story of the Italian journey and its results are told under the guise of fiction from two points of view in the two volumes called respectively Elle et lui by George Sand, and Lui et elle by Paul de Musset. As to the permanent effect on Alfred de Musset, whose irresponsible gaiety was killed by the breaking off of the connection, there can be no doubt.But what about this erotic masterpiece. It is genuinely breathtaking. A novella that entertains and surmises the sublime mawkish dandyism of a voyeuristic slant as it evolves and culminates in a fashionably irreverent and fascinating sensual exploitation. The beauty however transpires irrespective of the lewd character of the sensationalism because of the language and the depictions that vacillate between excesses of despair and effusions of ecstasy. With in between but the expression of the most intimate and poetic diction erotic literature has ever encountered. It will seduce you from the first few pages. The psychology of sex is here seen to animate a desire that throttles and tantalizes as it suffers the ardor of a sexual initiation.Here is a sample of the lyrical precision of the tale:A hidden door opened and a monk , clad in a costume like ours, approached me mumbling some words, Then drawing aside my dress, separating the skirt so that a piece fell on either side, he brought to light the full posterior of my body.A slight quivering ran through the reverend brother. Doubtless roused to ecstasy from the sight of my flesh, his hands roved everywhere, halted for a moment upon my arse, finally found a resting place a little below them.\\"Tis by means of this place that a woman sins, intoned a sepulchral voice. - It is here she must suffer.\\"and again with more inflammation:\\"Gripped, as I had hoped, by the frenzy of the moment, and without a moment's hesitation, the lsutful countess toppled forward on her hands, creating an arch over the bodies of myself and Fanny - who as my supplicating tongue probed the most fiery crevices of Gamiani's body, reached up and - insensate, lost - caressed the breasts that swung ripely above her. The double stimulation aroused Gamiani to unendurable ecstasy. Her entire body shook in a spasm so intense I feared for her life. Letting her body fall heavily onto the bed, she lay on her back, panting, sweating, arms outstretched, utterly spent into a depthless abyss of infernal joy.\\"Granted I am not a connoisseur of such a genre, but it excites enough to warrant reading with your mate, and it is soulful enough to seem innocent as to compared the Sadian literature that was ripe during and about the same years. Edwardian and Victorian erotica has received a stirring of interest and a belated revival during the last two decades, but allow me to make the assumption that the terrifying tenderness that sparks this quick arousing read should be given due time, for its brilliance, its fire and its psychological coils of eros-thanatos writhing amongst a lyricism that by way of debauchery teaches the senses the gripping hold the imagination favours in times of desire."},{"Title":"The Art of Poetry: Poems, Parodies, Interviews, Essays, and Other Work (Poets on Poetry)","review":"There are those who speak of the &quot;anxiety&quot; of poetry, but there is a case to be made for poetry that results not from agony or a confessional impulse but out of pleasure, the desire to communicate pleasure to an audience hungry for it. Koch generates as much pleasure as any poet, and it is not only the comic value of his poetry that recommends it but the spirit of creativity itself. In &quot;The Art of Poetry&quot; you get a kind of guide to poetics, an &quot;ars poetica&quot; in the Horatian manner with an American accent.

I had full class participation too, which was very surprising to me. They were answering all of the questions as a group, but managed to maintain a reasonable noise level. They stayed with it until the very end, and afterwards I asked them what they thought of the story. I was told that they liked the interactive (not their word exactly) way the story was told.

It's impossible to like him, so he he has no friends, but it is possible to admire him by the time this lyrically beautiful tale ends. Aymer is a bourgeois liberal. The depth of his empathy for enslaved Africans and for struggling English laborers is difficult to discern, yet he does suffer physical hardship and severe injury for his beliefs. Life for this novel's sailors, fisher folk and kelpers is, indeed, \\"nasty, brutish and short.\\" Aymer talks the good fight and does as much as he easily can to alleviate their distress -- how many of us do better than that? Crace's prose is luminous, a joy to read."},{"Title":"Signals of Distress: A Novel","review":"I plucked this book off of a library shelf on a whim, and now I'm a fan of Jim Crace. I've heard it said that if there is a common theme in Crace's writing, it's that he sets his stage during times of social change. Here, Crace brings us to a town about to lose its economic basis to technological innovation. The author takes us into its Christian racism and its moral quandaries, even as the town lives in denial of its own doom. Denial seems to operate the mind of the protagonist as well, and his own high-minded timidity hangs over the age as its defining quality. Crace is an gifted writer, whose work offers the reader joy and lends insight into our contemporary geist."},{"Title":"Signals of Distress: A Novel","review":"The excruciating detail with which Crace describes each event and each stretch of English coast are but the beginning of this book's power. His unflinching portrait of the lives of his characters leaves no corner unturned. With the smallest of observations, worlds begin to shift and characters head towards inevitable decline or ascent. Aymer Smith is an almost unbearably painful creation. He is at once utterly sympathetic and detestable. He seems to be the sum total of every self-conscious fear a modern liberal might have. We watch him with compassion and fear and horror and smugness. And those with whom he comes into contact are drawn no less sparingly. There is not one character one would hope to be, and yet we may see ourselves in pieces of each of them. This kind of writing and acuity grip the reader from the opening gale and refuse to let go as we squirm to avoid knowing the end of Aymer's story. Wonderful and terrible."},{"Title":"Signals of Distress: A Novel","review":"The beautiful J.M.W. Turner painting on the cover of this book really suits it--an eerie balance of cheery and grim. The setting inevitably reminds one of Dickens, and even the characters seem Dickens-inspired up to a point, with names like Alice Yapp, Palmer Dolly, and Preacher Phipps. But the language is decidedly more modern and the characters, in the end, much more complex, with the possible exception of Fidia Smith, who is so fastidious as to place a napkin over her mauled brother-in-law's feet as he is carried through her house. The brother-in-law, Aymer Smith, is the book's protagonist, and is, as the copy on the back cover states, &quot;a foolish well-intentioned prig.&quot; He is gullible, horny, and weepy by turns, utterly scrutable in the most loveable way. He is a lonely loner whose best efforts at connection with other people always seem to be thwarted by his good intentions. He is a staunch and outspoken abolitionist, which seems to annoy everyone in this small English town, since slavery is outlawed and the general attitude is &quot;Why the hell do you want to talk about it then?&quot; But Smith's greatest signifying act is to secretly set free an African slave who is cargo on an American ship wrecked in the town's harbor. The African, Otto, disappears entirely from the story, except in the superstitious-racist minds of the town, who happily blame all unusual or undesirable occurrences on his appeareance in their world. The novel comes to a grinding, hair-raising halt in a whirlwind of desparation, violence, and, ultimately, eerie silence. This is a great book for any reader of fiction, whether or not you have any interest in things nautical/historical/British. Its brilliant character portraiture, quirky plot twists, ghosty morality, and many Truly Weird and Interesting Moments make it a top-notch novel that deserves a lot more attention"},{"Title":"Signals of Distress: A Novel","review":"I was uncertain choosing this at the library.

Now I am so glad I did! This book is wonderfully atmospheric, similar to Island by Jane Rodgers but less dark, and I was hooked immediately. As the characters are introduced they are wonderfully rooted in time and place. And Aymer Smith the main character is a real achievement: a contemptibly dishonest windbag yet pathetically human and somehow sympathetic.

There is only one inn in Wherrytown, so the sailors and survivors are housed together, sharing cramped quarters. One passenger, Ayer Smith, stands out against the rougher denizens, choosing a couple emigrating to Canada for his companions. Smith is a partner of Hector Smith and Co., the soap manufacturer that buys kelp ashes from the inhabitants of nearby Dry Marston.An officious busybody typical of his class and education, Ayer has come to inform the agent and kelpers that the company will no longer need their services. He plans to rectify the situation with a personal visit to each family. Espousing the philosophy of Skepticism, Smith is also an Amender; he believes that for every act of evil, he can perform a corrective act of charity. A bachelor and a virgin, Smith is so out of touch with reality that he cannot identify pragmatism. In such misplaced attentions lies chaos.Naturally Smith gets sidetracked by the beaching of the Belle of Wellington, particularly interested in an African slave, Otto, who is saved from the wreck, and the newlywed wife who shares his private quarters with her husband. It is through Smith's meddling that Otto is released, much to the consternation of Capt. Comstock, who locked him in the tackle room. As for the Captain, \\"hard winds, bad luck, a bar of sand had beached his ship. His masts were down, the cattle lost, the African set loose.\\" To add to his burden, snow has begun to fall and \\"every half-wit in the land\\" is staying at the only inn.The cast of characters is Dickensian, written with particular attention to their connections with the land from which they eke their livings, some well, many meager: Walter Howells, the agent who has his fingerprints on every transaction that occurs in Wherrytown, busy with the events of late (\\"Everyone would earn a decent crust. High tide, high times!); mother and daughter Rosie and Miggy Bowe, kelpers soon to be out of work, although Miggy has set her sights on one of the American sailors, Ralph Parkiss, though already courted by a local, Palmer Dolly; and the innkeeper, Mrs. Yapp.With the impetus of the priggish Aymer Smith, a series of events is set in motion, events that would serve as high comedy were they not so tragic. Referred none too kindly to as \\"old spindleshanks\\", Aymer realizes his flaws, determined to be more reticent, less interfering: \\"He would be reckless in his reticence, a pleasing paradox.\\" The passengers of the recovered ship sail off to what they hope will be a happy future, Ayer left watching. With one final, clumsy action, he takes his leave, returning to the world from whence he came, none the wiser for his adventures.Crace has written a comedy of errors with Ayer Smith the central player, a dangerous fool under the best of circumstances, confronted by the real world of Neo-Industrial England, where life is lived on the edge of the ocean in all its splendor and random brutality. Blissfully unaware, Ayer is adamant, \\"There was a calm to maintain between oneself and one's behavior\\".

Smith, while well-meaning, is unable to communicate with anyone, and leaves much anger and confusion in his wake. One person on the shipwrecked boat is a black man bound for slavery in North America. Did Smith take it upon himself to free this man and let him wander the winter shores of Wherrytown? If so, did the freed but shivering former captive find his death by exposure?

As such, I shouldn't be complaining here. Crace is a great writer. But, with this book, I found the characters dull and unpleasant. Crace knows how to construct an interesting sentence, compose a clever metaphor, and interweave comedy and tragedy seamlessly together. Still, after reading this, I feel that I didn't learn anything new (other than about 100 word definitions I had to look up over the course of reading the book). When I told my fiancee that I'd finished it and he asked if it was good, I said no. I liked the writing, I didn't like the storyline. I do recommend Crace's The Gift of Stones--I liked it much more: http://www.amazon.com/Gift-Of-Stones-Jim-Crace/dp/0880014504/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1350076922&sr=8-1&keywords=the+gift+of+stones"},{"Title":"Signals of Distress: A Novel","review":"I'm cold and wet. I'm tired and hungry. And, I'm sitting comfortably at home. Crace uses words to paint pictures. He uses words to awaken all your senses. I've just left the England of a century and a half ago.To get the full effect of this book you have to have lived in a small town, as I do. City folk should realize these are real people and their counterparts exist even in today's small town America (as I'm sure they do elsewhere in the world). I can put local names to many of the characters. It's hard to explain the relationships and dependencies that can bring disparate people together - or push them apart. Crace understands this and presents it amazingly well.If you haven't read any of Jim Crace's books, this is a good one to start with. Great fun!"},{"Title":"Signals of Distress: A Novel","review":"Crace is one of my favorite authors and I'm almost done reading his entire oeuvre. This 1995 novel has a surfeit of signals of distress and a singularly irritating protagonist. It's hard not to agree with the good people of Wherrytown about Aymer Smith: he is a nave, self-centered and pompous prig. It is Crace's skill that we know what Smith is thinking and we learn what others are thinking of him. His adventures in this small fishing village exacerbate a difficult situation when a ship runs aground, a local industry is closed and an African slave escapes. The only problem Aymer is not responsible for is the storm on the sea. Yet, by the end of the book, we're ready to give him a benefit of the doubt. We also come to know the hard-scrabble life of the townspeople; as he did in The Gift of Stones, a bygone lifestyle and historic industry is recaptured and made real."},{"Title":"7 Steps to Fearless Speaking (Wiley Audio)","review":"We are living in a world where we are all expected to communicate as effectively and (seemingly) effortlessly as media stars. There is no better way to learn how to do this than to follow the instructions of the woman who has taught so many consumate communicators to do their jobs. Some people can afford to pay thousands of dollars to speach coaches to improve their public speaking. If you can't, this book is the best substitute. It's clear, action-oriented and contains principles to incorporate into virtually any oral presentation - from second grade teachers to corporate officers. A Must Have for anyone who cares about their public speaking."},{"Title":"7 Steps to Fearless Speaking (Wiley Audio)","review":"I purchased this book expecting a book that would ease my anxiety of public speaking, and Ms Wilder certainly &quot;claims&quot; in her introduction that this book is to help you become less fearful, but the tips actually are for speakers who are ALREADY fearless but just need to improve their speech skills: For example: Get immediate response from audience. You know, the last thing I want to do in a presentation is further prolong it by asking what they think of it. My plain goal, Ms Wilder, is just to complete a mediocre if dull presentation WITHOUT anxiety, not get responses from my audience and so forth. I can hardly find any good books on stage fright. They either don't help at all or are off the subject."},{"Title":"7 Steps to Fearless Speaking (Wiley Audio)","review":"The first few tracks of the audio CD does an excellent job of identifying all of the fears of public speaking, HOWEVER the majority of advice given in this book is theoretical. The book goes into stating the individual step (the theorectical help) then gives pseudo-testimonials of how her steps have been implemented by former students towards giving a great speech.There are seven primary steps, followed by several sub-steps. As you attempt to follow along you begin to forget what step you are on. I felt that the organization of the book was not effective and the advice given was based on theory. When it came down to it, there were only a few practical steps on getting over the fear. This book would be the equivalent to a book on Getting Rich which states \\"make wise investments that will only double your money\\" but neglecting to spell out what type of investments to make. I would not recommend this book as a way to overcome the fear of public speaking. Just my $0.02."},{"Title":"7 Steps to Fearless Speaking (Wiley Audio)","review":"Lilyan's 7 Steps to Fearless speaking was a godsend.

If you're looking to overcome your fear of public speaking, join Toastmasters and skip this CD."},{"Title":"7 Steps to Fearless Speaking (Wiley Audio)","review":"I recommend this book as one of your first books to read on public speaking along with Simply Speaking by Peggy Noonan. 7 Steps is more complete and more like a text book to read. Wilder is a writer that uplifts you and encourages you rather than talking down to you like some other speach books by well known authors. Interestingly, the book begins and ends with your voice as an instrument of vocal production. Most other speech book writers don't address how to make your voice sound better. They take the: &quot;Live with it approach.&quot; Great singers practice and practice on the sound itself. Why not speakers. May be they don't know any better or their publisher says: &quot;too complicated.&quot; This author knows but does not overwhelm you. One speaking book was so hard to follow on vocal production I had to set it aside for a while. Wilder made the exercises so easy to follow that I was not overwhelmed. Most of the book is about developing a content filled speech and then how to deliver it.

He describes events from as early as the French Revolution in the same breath as current happenings. He is not shy to express a viewpoint that strongly supports the French model of the Jewish Citizen. Birnbaum is confounded with the destiny of french Jewry because French Jews today do not all share his vision of the Republic. This Americanization of France (multi-culturism, etc.) and the traditions of the Sephardic immigrants frighten Birnbaum slightly, but he does not provide firm answers as to what exactly he is afraid of.

My seemingly endless search finally come to fruition when I picked up Gary West's &quot;Razoo at the Races.&quot; I never thought anyone would have the forethought to actually write a book on horse racing that was both entertaining and educational. I would like to thank Mr. West and his partner Marvin Small for leading me into the world of insomnia. Most books are as good as the over-the-counter sleeping pill for solving the issue of elusive nocturnal slumber, but &quot;Razoo&quot; kept me awake until 3 a.m., &quot;reading just one more chapter...No, just one more.&quot; Couldn't put it down. I recommend this book to not only the avid race fan, but to anyone who can appreciate colorful characters that will lighten your day and make you forget your troubles and isn't that what we're all trying to achieve. In that respect, and in many more, &quot;Razoo&quot; is a major success.

It detailed the entire history of Studebaker from its beginnings as wagon makers to its entry into the manufacture of automobiles.Particularly interesting was the postwar era, especially after the disasterous merger with Packard. It SHOULD have worked, but in reality it was a total failure. The Sherwood Egbert era was very well detailed with his last-ditch efforts to save the automobile operations of what had by then become a conglomerate. At the time of their death, cars were but a small part of the empire.I am fascinated by the Studebaker story, although I was only 8 years old when the last Studebaker was produced. I have often wondered what would have happened had they survived. Would they have survived the increasingly oppressive government safety and emission requirements? Would they have survived the fuel crises of '73 and '79?I have had the pleasure of visiting the Studebaker National Museum in South Bend, IN. Having seen these beautiful cars, particularly the &quot;Loewy coupes&quot; of 1953-55, I couldn't help but draw the conclusion that Studebaker was too far ahead of their customers.Even if you are not a &quot;car geek&quot; as I am, you would likely enjoy reading &quot;More Than They Promised&quot;."},{"Title":"More Than They Promised: The Studebaker Story","review":"I was born in South Bend and my neighbors and relatives worked at Studebaker. This book is an excellent portrait of a company sliding inexorably downhill. Some of the factors that killed Studebaker were internal (labor relations, high unit costs, lack of due diligence about the company's condition in the Packard merger) and some were external (George Romney's refusal to form a fourth major out of American Motors). Discussed in detail are the beautiful cars Studebaker built and their skill in managing the difficult transition from wagonmakers to automakers. (Lincoln rode in a Studebaker carriage to Ford's theater) Bonsall doesn't hesitate to point out the flaws and missteps Studebaker made, though. This book is an affectionate portrait of an American company that was part of the landscape for a century and has now vanished without a trace. Recommended."},{"Title":"More Than They Promised: The Studebaker Story","review":"This is an excellent overview of the life and death of an important part of the history of the U.S. auto industry. It covers all periods of the company's history well and combines the stories of people, products, and the entire industry very nicely.The chapter on the Avanti is a marginal addition to the narrative but the last chapter on why Studebaker failed is excellent. The author points out that most readers of auto industry history focus their interest on product and forget the impact of other factors such as competitors' actions, shifting consumer taste, and the health of the overall economy. The role of the UAW in Studebaker's demise is also presented clearly.The book is well laid out with enough photographs to keep it visually interesting without being overwhelming."},{"Title":"More Than They Promised: The Studebaker Story","review":"If you want to understand how the US car market got to where it is, this is a great book to start with.

You'll see the sights, hear the sounds and experience the smells through his teenage eyes. From the mystery of the rose-beetle man, to his distracted mother, and the various friends he makes in Greece, you'll love it ALL.When I first read this book, I couldn't put it down until the very end.

With people like Gerald, and the London zoo. In this book, he collects animals, deals with his demented siblings and his long suffering mother who has to raise four kids and fend off the advances of a really persistent Colonel who gets increasingly vulgar and \`grabby' when he drinks.

Read it!!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This wonderful book is a gem for true animal lovers. It brings a refreshing bit of humanity and hilarity to this chaotic life. You'll want to immediately move to Corfu."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I read this book with a certain amount of jealousy. Like Durrell I had a childhood fascination with animals and Nature in general. Unlike Durrell I did not come from a leisure-class family and my mother would not have allowed me to revive heat-struck water snakes in the bath tub.This is a very funny book and it is related in a very dry tone of voice. Durrell succeeds in limiting the narrative to the perspective of a 10 year old boy. His older sister Margo remains an object of derision throughout the book and the young Durrell seems to have had no interest in or respect for 'girl stuff'. He is the perfect little Edwardian naturalist; you can just seem him poring through his big thick references books to try to figure exactly what insect he's got in his jar of alcohol. The book is filled with Wodehousian eccentrics including his entire family, but also other ex-patriate Brits (Theodore and Mr. Kralkefsky) and Spiro, the mountainous cab-driver and unofficial island potentate.Each chapter is fairly self-contained and the book is organized as a seasonal precession. One of the most memorable chapters, and the one that most approaches the level of literature, is Durrell's initial encounter with one of his many tutors, Mr. Kralkefsky. This chapter has the least to do with natural history and includes an almost surreal passage about Gerry's encounter with his tutor's mother. There really isn't a dull moment in this book, however, with elder brother 'Larry' Durrell fairly consistently serving the purpose of a sort of Bertie Wooster-with-brains figure. One particularly funny comic device is Durrell's description of the arguments between Larry and his mother over where the family should live. The chapters always end with his mother's adamant refusal to accept her son's suggestions, but things never come off as expected. The chapter on the final dinner party on the island is a comic tour de force.More than any other book I have read, this narrative made me want to visit the Greek islands. I only hope that some remanant of the natural and pastoral landscape that Durrell describes remains on Corfu."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This and the sequel &quot;Birds, Beasts and Relatives&quot; are among my all-time favorite books. Recently a friend of mine declined to read the latter book in Fontana paperback because the type was too small but it looks like this new edition is a little easier to read. These books would be better still if they were accompanied by photographs of Corfu and of Gerald's animals, so its probably a good idea to read these while also stealing a glance at a photobook of the Greek islands."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"our whole family enjoyed this book aloud, and we heartily second all the expressions of enchantment and tears. Our 8 and 11 year olds cried at the dual parting at the end of the book, the Durrells leaving Corfu and yes, the book ending for us. Truth be known, we all had tears.If you are considering homeschooling, as we do, this book can be reassuring to parents that there can be learning without school. I was proud of my children's appreciation of the book, and felt it set a good and accessible example for them of the wonder with which we can view the world, learning from nature and appreciating the human and other living inhabitants.The dynamics of the family with each sibling carving out their own niches are lovingly and humorously described and will probably ring true with your own family."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"As a young boy I was forced, with some considerable reluctance, to read 'My Family and Other Animals' by one of teachers at my school in England, 'in order to improve my vocabulary'. All is forgiven, Mr Cox, for within my rather battered copy lurked, without doubt, the most hilarious account of familial eccentricity, and light-hearted feuding that I have ever come across.The book, as Mr Durrell explains in introduction, was intended to describe the glorious flora and fauna of Corfu, a greek island where he spent some time as a child. In this goal, he has succeeded admirably, as the whole atmosphere of the island is exquisitely recreated, to an extent that even on a rainy afternoon in Sidcup, it is not difficult to be transported to a sunny morning in the Aegean watching a young Gerry discovering a nest of a trapdoor spider, or perhaps discovering something of the mating rituals of the greek tortoise.It is in the descriptions of the family, however, where this book really comes to life. As Mr Durrell describes in the introduction, the family, as in life, once they had begun to appear, muscled their way into the rest of pages as well. From tales of the rotund, pretentious Larry (Lawrence Durrell, of the Alexandria Quartet fame), the gun-mad Leslie and the 'muslin and gauze' swathed sister, Margot, to the desciptions the long-suffering mother, the family had me laughing out loud at the most inopportune moments.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I read it regularly, and am still crying with laughter all the way through. Not only a splendid book for the evocative descriptions of the natural history, this is the most witty book I have ever read."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This book is absolutely, brilliantly funny. The wit and unique characterizations are woven with great descriptions of the animals and plants of Corfu. That Durrell can hold the attention of readers who have no interest in biology simply demonstrates what a fine work this is. Gerald's depiction of a larger-than-life expatriate family on a larger-than-life Greek island is a tremendous celebration of life. The variety of different Greek characters parading through this book rivals the variety of Corfu's flora and fauna.

I keep a book by my bedside and if I awaken in the middle of the night, instead of worrying, I read. This isn't the best book to use in this fashion. I have, on several occasions, awakened and thought, \\"I'll just read a few pages\\" only to find myself engulfed in oxygenated laughter that has kept me up for the duration of the night. I don't know when I've laughed out loud so often at a book. The mother is the mother we've all always wanted...and she was no doubt the perfect mother for this child. Who else could take in stride the unleashing from a matchbox of a small cache of scorpions during dinner. I will reread this book again and again. Such light hearted appreciation of nature is a rare find. This would be a great gift for any child or adult who loves the outdoors. Very special and very rare."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"My Family and Other Animals is about a ten-year-old boy named Gerald who moves to the sun-soaked island Corfu, Greece with his family to escape the dreary and gloomy climate in London. There, he encounters many different animals and people. I absolutely loved this book because it was really funny. There was a lot of action in this book. Durrell lovingly described each and every animal that he owned. He also told every detail of the settings, so I felt like I was really in Corfu!If you want to spend your money wisely, use it on this book!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I too read this book in my childhood as a compulsory exercise in English class. Years later when I reread it out loud to my children, and was reduced over and over, frequently on the same page, to helpless, tearful laughter, I wondered how we managed to get through it in school. The book is an autobiographical rendering of the author's boyhood experience as his family of five travels from dreary, cold England to the sunny, whimsical reality of Corfu. The pristine island and colourful inhabitants embrace the family and all its idiosyncrasies. Gerry, the little boy, lives a blissful, completely free existence as he explores the flora and fauna of the island with the occasional French lesson thrown in as a silly gesture to seriousness. The day-to-day experiences of the whole family rush with sparkling hilarity through the pages, leaving the reader gasping for air from laughing too hard. This is a completely delicious book, the kind of book you want in your library forever. I have misplaced or lost several copies, and I've just ordered my latest. I think it is just about my favorite novel of all."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"After reading Gerald Durrell at school (it was probably &quot;Menagerie Manor&quot;), I was put off reading his books for over 10 years. One of my friends recommended this as a wonderfully cute book about how a young boy perceives the world and his eccentric family and after hearing descriptions of Larry, the (then) aspiring novelist, acne-ridden Margo and gun-obsessed Leslie, how could I resist? It is a beautifully written book of short stories chronicling Durrell's magical childhood in Corfu, with a kaleidoscope of characters ranging from the human to the animal, all drawn with great affection. The stories are often hilarious and this is definitely one you will want to read again. And for those who are put off by too many descriptions of animals, the descriptions here aren't too long (and they are described charmingly, with Durrell attributing human characteristics which are very amusing) and most of the book focuses on his family. Sequels are &quot;Birds, Beasts and Relatives&quot; and &quot;Garden of the Gods&quot;."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"&quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; has charmed me for years.

My present copy has been in the house for about four months but I'm about to lend it to a friend at work so I'm sure I'll be back at this site soon to reorder. The previous copy walked off to college with my daughter and I'll wager that she's passed it on to one of her friends by now."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This book is my secret weapon against depression and the blues. I have never been able to read it without collapsing into helpless laughter (and I have lost count how many times I have read it!). In the book, GD describes his boyhood sojourn on the Greek island of Corfu and while the various animals and birds are fun, the most interesting specimens are the humans. Start with GD's own family, a wonderfully eccentric English mother, his 3 siblings with their own peculiar foibles, the innumerable friends on Corfu who add their own twists to the story and you have a bubbling cauldron indeed. The humor ranges from the tongue in cheek to the cannonball but it never lets up. The episode of the scorpions is my personal favorite but it is hard to pick a favorite when there are so many contenders. GD's descriptions of the various personages is superb and his retelling of anecdotes very good indeed. His particular gift is to make the non-human creatures interesting. Both human and non-human characters alike come alive and seem to spring from the pages. And GD's love for nature comes through in his descriptions of the surroundings; you can almost feel yourself in the story. One realizes that not only was GD a first rate naturalist, he was a very good writer as well. This book is a guaranteed pick-me-up; it will bring a smile to your face no matter how tired or sad you may be. A warning though: it is very dangerous to read this book in public.

How I wish I could have known this family!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"My only regret is that I did not read this book years ago, when Gerald Durrell was living, so I could tell the author how much I love his book. The praises of \\"My Family and Other Animals\\" has been sung by many readers. What I would like to add is that Mr. Durrell has a wonderful gift for writing and observation. His book takes us on a journey to the sun-drenched island of Corfu, that for Mr. Durrell is a place near to paradise. The natural world he is surrounded by fascinates him, and the reader, as we are introduced to the varieties of creatures that inhabit the island. We come to appreciate the life that can be found in a ditch filled with water. Then, there are the animals Mr. Durrell collected as pets: Quasimodo the pigeon, Ulysses the owl and the Magenpies. This is to say nothing of his dogs: Roger, Widdle and Puke. I only wish there could have been photographs in this edition.Coupled with this are wonderful portraits of his mother, two brothers and sister and their sometimes eccentric guests, along with the people of Corfu they meet. From the moment the Durrells arrive on Corfu, followed by a pack of dogs, their adventures are non-stop. One wishes for the chance to have been on Corfu and be able to pay a visit to whatever villa they happened to be living in. \\"My Family and Other Animals\\" is a book that you will not want to end."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"The story of Gerry Durrell and his family, who decides to move to Corfu in order to escape the inclement British weather. This book follows Gerald as he explores the island, fascinated by creatures great and small. We also get to know his family and their different quirks.It is a lovely book, but beware: the language is richer, far richer than most books today. There isn't a lot of action, as the book is more like a memoir than a novel (ie it meanders, aiming at creating a picture, not following a tight plot).If you keep those two things in mind, you'll enjoy it greatly, and feel as if you'd want to move to Corfu -but, alas, I went there in 2005, and Durrell's Corfu seems to have been replaced by mass tourism."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"My Family and other Animals was a great book about a truly eccentric family. The characters quirks spiced up the novel but the lengthy descriptions of animals and plants by the author and zoologist, Gerald Durrell, were a little dry. I often found myself tempted to skim through these passages to get back to the plot of the story. It was truly amazing to believe that all these incredibly detailed descriptions could be thought up by a boy at age 12. But it was equally amazing that he experienced all these awesome adventures and was able to remember them and pen his story later on in his adult life and let the reader enjoy his experiences as much as he did."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This book, ironically, was on one of those horrible \\"summer reading\\" lists so many of us are forced to do in high school. It's the only one I was ever forced to read that I truly, genuinely loved. I laughed out loud literally every two or three pages, and though I have no natural interest in animals (especially insects), Durell makes his descriptions of the nature on Corfu as gripping and as touching as his descriptions of his family.It's been ten years since I first read this book, and when I get together with my old friends, we STILL argue about our favorite scenes, the best character, the most troublesome pet. This is a book you won't be able to put down the first time you read it, and will want to re-read the moment you finish it."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Wow! This is an amazing book. It has made me want to go to corfu! The book is the true story about gerry durrel and his stay on the greek island of corfu. Gerry has an extreme intrest in nature, (Much to the anoyance of his writer brother, Larry, lover of things hunting, Lesly, and his sister with an acny problem, Margo.) The story takes many twists and turns, in which he comes across many different animals including Dodo the dog, the maggenpyes, and Geronamo the gecko. Five star!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Charming and delightful. A true story which made me want to pack and return to Corfu again."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Gerald Durrell was not only a naturalist and a gifted writer about his beloved animals, but a loving brother and son whose descriptions of his family and their foibles will keep you laughing all the way through. This is one of those books which I've reread so many times I've lost count, and which I've given to many friends who needed cheering up. Always works, too!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"the innocent curiosity of the main character inspired me to become a biology major."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I read this 25 years ago and am again now, 9/2001. Its just as funny now and the wry British humor is just great! However, ... listed this as \\"hardcover.\\" I thought I would be getting a clothbound with clothbound size print. ... sent me a paperback with a hard cover on it. Anything for that price should not have been a paperback original. The print is too small for me. Be aware!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Rarely does a book come along that so moves, embraces, and captivates you that you emerge from the experience a truly changed person. My Family and Other Animals is such a gem. The author graciously transports the reader into the magical childhood world of Gerry Durrell, a British youth whose eccentric family whimsically decides to plop themselves on the Greek Island of Corfu. With the touch of a master sculptor, Durrell crafts the reader into his childhood world, allowing us to experience Gerrys's family, their unusual assortment of visitors, and his relationship to the natural world around him, hilarious episodes and all, with the same kid-wonder that we all sadly abandon upon reaching adolescence. The result is an uproariously funny account (all true, according to Durell), mixed with both the innocence of youth and the literary gifts and hindsight of a perceptive, nature-loving litterateur.Get this book, read it regularly - and you'll soon notice that both the book and its episodes are things that you simply can't leave behind."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Ok your eleven years old and have to move from jolly old England to Greece. Ahh Greece with its meditteranean climate and diverse culture who wouldn't want to live there? Well in Mr. Durrell's book based on his experiences living on a tiny island in Greece, you get all this and more. &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; is a delightful and amusing book that you just can't put down. In his book Gerald, as the naturalist wannabe in his younger days, stuffs spiders in his older brother's matchbox( you can imagine what happens when he tries to smoke)and scares his mother out of her mind with the exotic animals he brings home. He even ends up having a 'zoo' in his attic complete with snakes, owls, lizards and the occasional magpie. In conclusion, if your looking an amusing book to read that will also make you quite the intellectual (people dig others who are knowledgable about animals) than &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; by Gerald Durrell is the book you want."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Bit of a classic. Recollections through the eyes (but not the vocabulary) of a ten year old of family and insects/snakes/birds on Corfu. Funny characterisations, well retold anecdotes of eccentrics (including this biology mad kid). Similarities to Herriot. Interesting that the animal obsessed writer, inspirer of many of today's naturalists, is still of his generation enough to see no tension between being fascinated by animals in this idyllic setting - or going out shooting with his brother."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This book is simply incomparable. Classic Durrell, packed with tall tales and descriptions that will whisk you away to the sunny isle of Corfu. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Ever wonder what kind of person takes such an interest in every form of flora or fauna there is? One who is hyperobservant, apparently. And when Gerald Durrell turns that eye on the eccentric characters in his family and around him on the island of Corfu, you'll absolutely love reading his words."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This is a fantastically written book that anyone who appreciates literature can love. The immagery rich and deatiled, the charccters are wonderfully brought to life by some witty dialogue, and the charm is undeniable. It also arrived on time and in perfect shape. Reccomended."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This is one of my favourite books. Durrells humouristic way of describing his family and happenings really makes you smile. In my opinion this is a must read book for everyone who likes people, places and life."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I am so excited that this book is back in print! I first read it as a class assignment in 7th grade (almost 20 years ago) and still have that copy, dog-eared and falling apart. I have probably read it 100 times since then, no exaggeration. It is the one book I can always count on to pick me up when I am down. I am so glad that they are publishing this book again so a whole new generation of lovers of animals and quirky families can enjoy the escapades of the Durrell family. You will laugh yourself silly!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I got hooked on Gerald Durrell because he is a hilarious story teller. This book is by far my favorite. The tale of his childhood is beautifully decriptive and tear-inducingly funny. Sometimes I can't beleive these people survived without killing one another! A patient mother puts up with her very different children: a surly writer, a gun-toting maniac, a whiny and vain girl, and of course, the nature obsessed Gerald. I envy their adventures and mishaps, I wish my childhood was so funny!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I can't number the times I've read this book, they're so many... And everytime I found something I hadn't noticed or appreciated before. The story is very simple: a messy and likeable british family that moves to the wonderful island of Corfu in Greece. Each member of the family has its own manias(animals, weapons, cooking, parfumes and literature); their own needs, obsessions and personalities conflict really often and these conflicts lead to the funniest and most unforgettable pages of this enjoyable book. But the very magical characteristic of the book is the power it has to make you feel on your skin the kissing warmth of Corfu, the silence of summer, the chirp of the cicadas and the smell of myrtle. It was just like being there."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Gerald writes about his family's advertures and manages to describe each member, including himself, as a very funny character, while still making them look like real people."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Gerald Durrell's books are the most touching but important books on a subject that is crucial for this earth. He was a &quot;naturalist&quot; of a very unusual mould: one who believed that animals have the same rights as us. As for this book, it is a humorous and compelling look at pre-war Corfu. A must for anyone who is interested in animals."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I first read this book when I was a child, and have reread it more times than I can count. Every time I read it I laugh out loud until tears are streaming down my face. It is interesting, educational, and hilarious. Gerald Durrell's rich use of the English language is also one of my favorite things about this book. Go get it!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I first read this fifteen years ago and to this day it remains one of my favourite books ever. It is truly funny and will surely appeal to readers of all generations. The descriptions of Corfu is blissful and will make anyone want to go there. I highly recommend it. You won't ever get tired of it."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I first read this book in 1979 and was so captured by it that in 1980 I pack up and went to Corfu. I spent two weeks following the places described in the book. I kept on reading G. Durrell and I have to credit him for my travels and my occupation (dog behaviorist). I highly recommend his writings to every person with a sense of humor and a feel for nature."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Do you adore British wit? True English eccentrics? The REAL story behind Great Writers?Books that make you laugh out loud again and again?This is a warm autobiographical remembrance by famed Zoo-Keeper Gerald Durrell,of the years in his childhood in the 1930s when the entire family took off on a whimto live in the Island of Corfu, Greece.It is quite simply such a wonderful -- fun -- read that it promptlywent to the best-sellers lists round the world when it was first publishedmore than 35 years ago. Which enabled Gerrald to realize his life-long dream ofbuilding his own zoo for endangered species -- and annoyed the daylights out of hisvery SERIOUS novelist and writer older Brother, the award-winning Lawrence Durrell.(Poor Larry, not only to be beat at your own game by a kid brother who doesn'teven care about writing, but to have the follys of your own early 20sexposed to the literate world just when you hoped to be taken seriously by everybody!)Read this book. Buy this book!I guarantee you'll find yourself laughing out loud uproariouslyand then you'll rush out to buy extra copies for all your friends!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Gerald Durrell's comic account of living on Corfu with his family as a child is as much fun as you will ever read. At 10 (and 60, if you read his other books) Durrell had a mind for little but the animals in the environment around him. In one episode he relates how his tutor was only able to get him interested in history by adding in \\"anecdotes\\" such as Nelson's collection of birds, including detailed lists of what species and who got the birds after Trafalgar.If you have a 10 year old who is only interested in collecting snakes and butterflies, this will be immensely enjoyed (the story of the geckos living in his room alone will surely be worth hours of wide-eyed fun)...but you may not want to encourage full Durrell emulation (such as when he saved a bunch of baby scorpians in the house, until discovered by his long-suffering brother Larry)."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Gerald Durrell, age 10, and his family take up residence on the Greek island of Corfu in the years between the world wars. Young Gerry carefully writes down all his observations of the worlds both natural and family, one minute collecting scorpions in matchboxes, the next cataloguing sister Margo's many affairs of the heart, and the next tooling around the island in his faithful boat, the Bootle Bumtrinket. There's a reason the Greek immigration official calls them \\"a traveling circus.\\"Followed by Birds, Beasts and Relatives, The Garden of the Gods, and The Picnic and Suchlike Pandemoniom."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"From a young age, Gerald Durrell, an early environmental preservationist, had a love for all types of animals. This interest was greatly encouraged during the five years Durrell and his family lived on the island of Corfu, an undeveloped paradise before WWII. Durrell's calm and rather long-suffering mother brought her three sons, including the not-yet-acclaimed writer Lawrence Durell, and daughter to the island as antidote to England's year-round gloomy weather. A warm and witty look at an eccentric British family also introduces the reader to the rustic residents of Corfu and flora and fauna ranging from insects to owls. This wonderful family read-aloud for ages 12 and up."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I first read this book at age thirteen and proceeded to re-read it when ever I wanted a lift. Some of the stories made me laugh out loud and I found myself in love with Greece and even Dung Beetles.I recommend this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"If you're lucky, an acquaintance loans you this book and thereby becomes a good friend. That's what happened to me, anyway. I was not in the mood to read a \\"romp\\" or an \\"idyll\\" (such patronizing terms!) and was in a particularly dark mood when this book was pressed on me. I was heavily reading and researching electromagnetic pollution after my daughter began exhibiting curious neurological symptoms and was brooding about topics like altered DNA and blood-brain barrier permeability. And this happy little book seemed like something to get through quickly and return.And then I found I couldn't not read it. I began reflecting on the radical nature of happiness and in particular on the link between empathetic intelligence (a young boy's loving gaze on the natural world) and wholeness. As I alternated between my readings on EMFs and Gerry Durrell's \\"idyll\\" or lost world, there seemed to be a link, on the one hand, the joyful specificity of flora and fauna on the island, on the other, the cognitive impairment of people in our fragmented wireless world who lack \\"awareness of the fragile dimensions of living systems.\\"I'm an unlikely nature lover. (I remember an ill-fated \\"English Department hike\\" during which I cursed nature and longed to see it all paved over and replaced with P.F. Chang's bistros. I never liked the curious mix of kill-joy Marxism, Puritanism and Environmentalism I found in English departments, and I remember how the English prof who led that hike wanted us all to pose for an arty photo holding rocks in front of our faces, and I just hated that symbolism.) But having children radically changes one's awareness of the fragile dimensions of living systems.Can you imagine a child ranging over an entire island like Gerry Durrell does, feeding himself from the land, living with such intensity? I guess I'm saying, this is a funny, funny book, but I take it seriously. Not seriously enough to sell my possessions and move to Corfu, as I've heard some have done."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"\\"My Family and Other Animals\\" is one of the best books I have read in a long time (and I read a lot of books). Not only is it entertaining and very funny, but it is also incredibly well written, with impeccable use of adjectives on every page. It is a fairly quick read, but also one of those books that you can open up and read just a few pages if you need a smile."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This book stands out in my mind as 1 of the very best i've ever read.This story is great for all who want to relive their youth.& for women who want to be AMAZING mothers of sons.Enjoy..."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Lovely book. Nicely written. If you didn't want to go to the Greek isles before, you will after you read this."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Gerald Durrell originally intended this book to be primarily about the flora and fauna of Corfu, the island off the northwestern Greece mainland to which his family moved from England when he was a child. As it turned out, however, this delightfully entertaining series of mishaps includes a great deal of local color, including rather interesting (read \\"wacky\\") Corfian characters and experiences. A great believer in \\"You Are There\\" reading, I timed my own to coincide with a trip to Corfu in late May, where I finished the book at a villa set among olive trees above a stunning little bay overlooking the Ionian Sea on Corfu. Absolutely delightful! By the way, this is a wonderful book to share by reading aloud."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I've lost my old copy of this book and am just about to purchase a new one because I want to read it to my children. I first read this as a 10 or 12-year old. I loved it then and I love it as much now. If I had to name a favorite book - it would definitely be a contender!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"My Family and Other Animals is an interesting title for an interesting book. It's a very fun, easygoing read, and well done in addition. This book makes you think, but not too much. The main character is a great descriptor and narrator of the story, and can really be sympathized with. With the main part of the story taking part in a fascinating Greek Island named Corfu, the book has an excellent setting as well. Definitely a very well-written book, and a great read. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Gerald Durrell (younger brother of author Lawrence Durrell) writes engagingly of his family's life on Corfu.I laugh till I cry, every time I read it (and I must have read it a dozen times by now).If you've never read anything by Gerald Durrell, and if you enjoy stories of young boys growing up in an extraordinary environment, with a delightful cast of his family and other memorable characters, READ THIS!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Gerald Durrell had a childhood most children only deam about. He had a crazy family, a shaggy dog, various flying pets, a donkey for his birthday and a most indulging mentor.Most of all, he had halcyon days on the Greek island of Corfu.This is the first of many Durrell books that have enchanted generations of young nature lovers. Most have grown older reading his adventures throughout the forests and savannahsSome have even made pilgrimages to his Jersey zoo to see for themselves the animals he collected.But most of all, Gerald Durrell brought magic and escape from boarding school solitude and like his brother, Lawrence, created a literary legacy for generations to come.Sadly, how many will discover his books? And how many of the creatures he wrote about will survive our lifetimes?Get the book. Get all the books.At least we can preserve the memories on our bookshelves."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"All of Gerald Durell's writings are terrific, but the ones about his family are truly laugh-out-loud wonderful! This is a book I have enjoyed over and over, and have given as a gift many times."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Not many adults ever reminisce about their childhood dreams. Those who do, generally label these as wishful thinking and sigh them away. Rarer are those who live lives of fulfilled dreams. Gerald Durrell, an eminent author, naturalist and expeditionist, was one of those uncommon individuals whose life's entirety was one long childhood dream come true. \\"My Family & Other Animals\\" is his most famous work, and is the first of his Corfu Trilogy.The kid Gerald Durrell, or Gerry, was eight years old when his family moved from England to the Greek island of Corfu. Through the eyes of the young, fauna-loving and ever-inquisitive Gerry, Corfu seems to be the strangest place on Earth, and all humans, whether inhabitants of Corfu or not, appear to be strange people. The book describes Gerry's meticulous observations and detailed experiences in Corfu amongst dogs, cats, toads, snakes, scorpions, owls, magpies, gulls and other creatures he keeps as pets in his house, and his family members who are bemused as well as troubled by Gerry's love for these animals and insects. Young Gerry's mother and siblings stay engrossed in their own worlds, leaving Gerry alone to spend his days as he wishes, free from burdens such as going to school and being nagged by elders. Thus begins Gerry's exploration of Corfu, starting with the garden in his villa, and eventually his domain of knowledge crosses over to the neighboring islands.The book will make you roar with laughter right from the preface itself. Descriptions of animals are unconventionally funny. Humans also are not spared. Imagine an entire family changing residence from one villa to another, just because one of them foolishly invited his friends so many that they would not fit in the current villa. After animals and humans, the third elaborately portrayed element is nature. Detailed descriptions of fig trees and setting suns create a Wordsworthian aura. Once Gerry sets on describing some of these, he can be drawn back only by some exquisitely crafted squirrel or a raucously howling dog.The best way to savor the book is to read it over several sittings, by allowing the excessive laughter to brighten many a dull day. An enlightening perspective of the work can be seen through Gerry's eyes. Animals, unlike humans, know exactly what they want. They are easier to please and easier to be understood. Most importantly, animals are easily befriended and are almost always loyal. When the book ends, it feels as if an intimate and jocular friend has left you forever.\\"My Family & Other Animals\\" is a beautiful comedy, and is highly recommendable for reading by people of all ages.http://readsafe.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I picked this up when I was in Spain because it was one of the only books I could easily find that was written in English. I loved it!!! Durrell's amazing depiction of Corfu made me really want to go and explore the magical island that he brings to life. Almost twenty years later, this is still one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"A well-written, amusing account of Durrell's stay on Corfu as a boy. Hilarious, light reading. The only reason I did not rate it a &quot;10&quot; is that it is such light reading that it doesn't seem to give any fresh insight into anything, or have any purpose or point, and thus although highly entertained I was left feeling somewhat unsatisfied."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"My Family and Other Animals is a bare-bones story in terms of plot. The Durrell family goes to Corfu, lives through what could be termed as a soap opera, and leaves. It's humourous, but not particularly challenging.However, the older Gerald Durrell utilises vivid vocabulary over and over when describing the setting and people of Corfu. Fifteen-letter words that paint a crystalline picture are used frequently, relieving the never-ending roller coaster that is the life of the Durrells.Overall, this is a highly entertaining book that will keep you engaged for the week or so that you will spend reading it every spare second you have."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Though perhaps too often slowed down by the detailed description of an insect or bird and its behavior, Durrell does a fine job of balancing autobiography and his naturalist-writing tendencies."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"The book was disappointing to me simply because I had enjoyed the video as shown on PBS.

I must admit that the author's descriptions of the misadventures of his eccentric family (including his brother, author Lawrence Durell) were my favorite parts of the book.

Years later, at the end of the 1980s I finally got to go to Corfu for a holiday (and I went the following 3 years too!).

Sharing the spotlight are thefascinating flora and fauna young Gerald stumbles acrosson his island. Even if you thought you couldn't standBiology as a student in school, Durrell's descriptions areso beautifully written, each discovery so exquisitely etchedthat you cannot but wonder at the beauty of Nature - andthe amazing gift of prose that Durrell, a naturalist byprofession, brings to this unforgettable book.

Furthermore, it got me interested in Gerald Durrel's style of writing and prompted me to read similar books (Filets of Plaice, A Zoo in my Luggage, etc). The book humorously sketches the simple lives of the inhabitants of Corfu, the Durrel family (including their gradually acquired arsenal of pets), and the diverse Mediterranean fauna."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I cannot remember when I enjoyed reading a book so much as this one. It is about the five years the author (Lawrence Durrell's younger brother) spent living on the island of Corfu as a youngster and budding naturalist. It is full of anecdotes about collecting animals and about the family that delight the heart and tickle the funnybone. His collection of animals includes snakes, birds, furry things. There is a collection of dogs with peculiar names. Theodore Stephanides, a real life person, a doctor who helps Gerald organize his collection in more or less scientific fashion, figures in some of Lawrence Durrell's writings. He was apparently a wonderful and possibly brilliant person. Concerned over the young boy's education, or lack of it, his mother sends him a few times a week to the Belgian consul, who tries to teach him French by reading out of the dictionary, starting with ''A''. Of course he learns no French. The consul spends most of the lesson time shooting mangy cats on neighboring roofs. This is not an act of cruelty: the town is overpopulated by cats and they are mostly ill and dying and spreading disease. Then Mother sends him to a British person with a Slavic surname for lessons in just about everything. This strange looking man has a collection of rare birds and a mother who never leaves her bed but has wonderful fantasies about her own lost beauty. Older brother Lawrence is, of course, a writer still learning his craft. Leslie is the gun expert who builds the youngster a strange boat for use in collecting marine specimens. Margo is the sister who cares for little in life but how she looks in a bathing suit. Spiro is a hefty Greek with a big belly who drives the family around in his car and helps them in unexpected ways, even getting them out of innocent scrapes with police and customs officials. The mother is a marvelously sensible English lady who behaves very properly and cooks up a storm, almost constantly. The author's language and style are elegant, and one gets the sense of looking at the world through the wondering eyes of a young boy, but always with the idea that behind him there is the mature and accomplished writer. Yes, reading this one again next week would not be a bad idea."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"When the Durrell family decides to relocate to the Greek island of Corfu, they each have a decidedly different agenda. Oldest brother Leslie is off in search of his writing muse, brother Larry just wants to shoot guns, sister Margo is long suffering in love and Gerald cannot wait to explore. Told from the recollections of a ten year old this delightful tale is populated by these family members, headed by the benignly forgetful mother and faithful dog Roger, along with a series of characters from the island. Adding to this mix are animals collected by young Gerry, the narrator. Consumed with a love for all nature he adds an owl, water snakes, puppies, seagull, various insects, and the infamous magenpies to the mix. I cut my reading teeth on the Cheaper By the Dozen books and I think this measures up. After reading a description of the mating ritual of tortoises, as observed by a ten year old, I cannot look at one of the beast without laughing. This book is not only funny but suffused with a genuine affection for the people who inhabit it."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I first read this book more than forty years ago, and have re-read it periodically since then a half dozen times. I have given copies to my children, and to nieces and nephews. If you love children, or nature, or Greece...this is the book for you. If you do not fit in that category, get a life!Gerald Durrell may have written his books to fund his Zoo, but he is a born story teller, and the stories he tells are the best. I spent three summers in Greece as a child, and he has captured the langorous, limpid azure of the Greek skies in his prose, and the fascination of the abundant Nature of the Mediterranean. It does not hurt that his family, including Lawrence Durrell, are obviously all characters, and that their life was peppered with nutty occurences that may or may not be embellished a tad.To give this luminous classic anything less than five stars is niggardly and down right mean. Buy it. Treasure it. Reread it and give it to all the kids you know (and a few worthy adults as well)..."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I read this book years and years ago in some public library in some small town far far away. I could vividly remember some scenes but couldn't for the life of me remember the text's title. I rediscovered it thanks to a \\"hilarious books\\" thread at a forum I'm a part of, and am so glad to have finally found it!This book should be required reading for every little kid who loves animals -- and what kid doesn't? The narrator moves to a (beautifully described) villa in Greece and lives an idyllic existence there, collecting a real menagerie of pets as he does so -- and his adventures obtaining/living with those pets are as funny as they are charming. His interactions with his family members are just as hilarious (I love in particular his prissy older sister, and his perpetually sniffling mother).Re-reading this as an adult, I have come to appreciate the author's skill as a writer -- this book made me want to visit Greece and find my own little cove with hot pebbles for a beach and a brilliantly blue sea.

Also, I want a praying mantis.This book is going on my \\"Dearly Beloved\\" collection in my Kindle."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I am not the kind of person who reads a book twice.

Some of the best reading I've experienced in a while."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This book is absolutely, brilliantly funny. The wit and unique characterizations are woven with great descriptions of the animals and plants of Corfu. That Durrell can hold the attention of readers who have no interest in biology simply demonstrates what a fine work this is. Gerald's depiction of a larger-than-life expatriate family on a larger-than-life Greek island is a tremendous celebration of life. The variety of different Greek characters parading through this book rivals the variety of Corfu's flora and fauna. Absolute great read!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I am sometimes hesitant to read books that were written in the 1950's. I have a bias that says perhaps the book will be irrelevant or somehow dated. While this book was written in that time period, it is an absolutely timeless book! This book can be read anytime, anywhere, by anyone regardless of age, reading preferences or genre preference. I just loved this book. Never before has a book made me laugh out loud as this one did. The author has a story-telling style that will reel you right in. He tells stories about his very unique family in a very respectful, albeit hilarious way. When you read the book, (and yes, you absolutely SHOULD read it) pay special attention to the stories about the scorpion and magpies. I had to read these excerpts out loud to my family as I just had to share the hilarity. Aside from the outstanding humor, the author writes with exquisite detail about the flora, fauna and landscapes on Corfu. At times, while reading the descriptions of the ocean or olive grove or mountain lake, I wished I could step into the imagery and experience the loveliness. The author is unsurpassed in descriptive writing. This quality, paired with the humor and light-heartedness, makes this book a one-of-a-kind must read book. Read it! You really will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This was a book I hated to see end. The descriptions of Corfu, family members and residents of the island, and wildlife were lyrical and loving. The author was a keen observer of his environment and was able to share his observations vividly with the reader. His humorous anecdotes were of laugh-aloud variety.I.J. Crouch, Saratoga, CA"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"What a tribute to Gerald Durrell - to see how his writings have made so many people laugh! I, too, became an avid reader of Gerry Durrell's stories as a 11 year old kid growing up in Kenya. The whole family developed a passion for observing the small &quot;beef&quot; of the Kenyan highlands and an enduring appreciation of nature and ecology. Don't stop with &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; if you love Durrell's sense of humor and affection for animals! Try &quot;The Bafut Beagles&quot;, &quot;A Zoo in My Lugage&quot;, and whatever else you can get your hands on. Durrell had a rare and precious ability to find the humor in most any situation, often at his own expense. His deep love of the animals and people he encountered shines out from behind the funny stories. He paints masterpieces with words."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I am now ordering a second copy as I have lent the first one so many times I cannot keep track of it. This is a delightful series of essays that makes one laugh out loud and insist on reading the best parts out to friends and family. Having read a great deal of Lawrence Durrell, I was enchanted by his younger brother's irreverent view of the &quot;literary&quot; member of his family. The descriptions of people and animals on Corfu bring tears to the eyes -- tears of laughter and regret that the island life Gerry describes is gone forever."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"In all my life I've never read a book as wonderful as this.

I feel like I know the Durrell family almost as well as my own. While living in Europe a few years ago, I stumbled on part three of the Corfu trilogy, The Garden of the Gods, while greedily scanning the shelves of an English bookstore in Florence. It is just as good. Part 2, Birds, Beasts and Relatives, eludes me. Maybe I'll order it from here. I just love his writing style. This book never fails to cheer me up when I feel down.

I read it to my son when he was about 10, and he adored it.Thank you, Gerald Durrell. You made this world a better place."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"There is so much to love about this book. It's hard to know where to begin. Essentially, the book has three different themes. First, it is an exploration of a time and place that was. The Greek island of Corfu must have been truly enchanting, and the Durrell family's enthusiasm for the place and people is contagious. It made me want to see what Corfu is like now, and if any of that enchantment remains.Secondly, the reader sees how a young mind is shaped as the author, at age ten, discovers his love for all things zoological. Often funny, yet deeply interesting, I was surprised at how much I learned while exploring the native fauna with young Gerry. Even the bugs are fascinating!Lastly you'll come to know a family like no other, and their equally delightful friends. There were times that I wanted to brain Larry, the eldest son, (who was the noted author Lawrence Durrell), but he always seems to get his comeuppance, and in ways that are always very fun to read.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is laugh out loud funny from beginning to end. The good news is, Gerald Durrell was a prolific writer. I immediately ordered several more of his books, and look forward to many hours of pleasure with this author. A book lover couldn't ask for more!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This description and recollection of the author's (a brother of Lawrence Durrell) moving as a boy from England to the island of Corfu is an fascinating glimpse into a slice of life that is very different from what most of us are accustomed to (and may be a glimpse of a Corfu that no longer exists - I've not been there to see).

When/if I get this book, I will be glad to give it a fair review, if I am given a second chance."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"My Family and Other Animals is a lovely collection of short stories - most of them dealing with Corcyrean fauna - set in the years before WWII, which the author, then a boy in his early teenage years, spent with his family on the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian sea. Gerald Durrell is a hilarious storyteller, and page after page you will be entertained by the adventures of the young Gerry and his animal pets; his family, consisting of mother, brothers Larry and Leslie, and sister Margo; and their Greek friends: Dr. Theodore Stephanides, a doctor and polymath, their driver Spiro, and other mostly ephemeral characters.Having said that, a word of reservation. My Family and Other Animals fits into the &quot;Young Adults&quot; genre, and its target audience are early-teens boys with an interest in nature. I emphasised boys, as there is no character in the book a young female reader could identify with - Gerald's sister Margo is shown mostly as vain, whinny, and not too clever. The characters are rather shallow and predictable, and with few exceptions, the stories in the book follow the same scenario: Gerry takes a walk in the countryside, finds some interesting animal - a turtle, a magpie, a snake, a scorpion - and decides to bring it home as a pet. Then, interrupted by other pressing matters, he temporarily leaves it in some random place in the house, where it is discovered by some other unsuspected family member. The panic which inevitably follows increases, until there finally comes Gerry - cool, calm and composed - and gets thing back in order. It also smells of the British imperial grandeur, maintaining the view that the world is inhabited by two races: the Brits and the native peasants. One can observe the tenacity of this view from works written much after the British Empire has become a historical memory, e.g. the late Douglas Adams' Last Chance to See (don't miss it if you liked this one!).As an autobiography, My Family and Other Animals is not a very factual one, either. When faced with the dilemma of being factual or being entertaining, the author mercilessly butchered the facts. Thus, there is not even a slight hint of the fact that Lawrence was actually married to Nancy Myers during this time (he described his staying on Corfu in Prospero's Cell), and stayed with her in Koulouri, rather than with his mother, brothers and sister. Also, some of his stories from later years in Cressida are attributed to earlier years in Perama. However, if you are not exactly a Gerald Durrell biographer, these few details should not distract you from enjoying the book.If you are visiting Corfu and plan to visit some of the locales in the book - the strawberry-pink villa, the daffodil-yellow villa or the snow-white villa - you will probably find helpful a tiny booklet In the Footsteps of Lawrence Durrell and Gerald Durrell in Corfu (1935-39) by Hilary Whitton Paipeti, available in any bookshop in Corfu Town."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Author Gerald Durrell continues his fascination with animals in \\"My Family and Other Animals.\\" The true, personal narrative discusses the adventures that take place as ten-year old Gerald finds a family of scorpions in a plaster wall. The settings are full of frenzy as Durell becomes captivated with his new friends. The series of events show a typical family's response to the antics of the \\"Dennis the Menace\\" in the family.As the story proceeds, Gerald is ripping sections of plaster away from a decaying wall in order to capture his new-found friends. Finding a female scorpion with masses of babies clinging to her, the young boy decides to give them a new home. He sneaks the arachnids into his family's home by means of a matchbox. As the twenty-three year old brother, Larry, starts to light up a cigarette, the story becomes explosive. Even though the female scorpion means no harm, she hoists herself up and scuttles onto the back of Larry's hand as he slides open the matchbox. His scream of horror terrifies Lugaretzia, the maid, and she drops a plate, which in turn brings Roger, the family's black woolly dog, out from under the table. Larry flicks the enemy between Margo and Leslie, Gerald's older sister and brother. Margo swirls a glass of water towards the scorpion, but instead drenches Mother. In a comical sequence, the Durrell family exchanges a series of terrified comments.\\"Look out! Look out! They're coming!\\"\\"Quick...quick...do something!\\"\\"Look out...there's another one!\\"In the mean time, Roger the dog assumes the family is being threatened. Since Lugaretzia is the only stranger in the room, he feels it is his responsibility to attack. And, so, she receives a nice bite to the ankle. As the story draws to an end, the pandemonium stops, and the family retires to the drawing room. Gerald conjures up all his spider friends and take them on a one-way flight to the garden wall. The only repercussion for the ten-year old comes from Mother as she procees to update his education by means of the belt. The author's purpose to enact an entertaining event in the lives of the Durrells is met.The author moves form character to character in a spordic chain of events. What begins as a typical evening at home with the whole family ends in a total uproar in the household. The scenes definitely show the expressiveness Durrell is trying to present. From one character to another, each action produces a reaction. The auther presents great visual imagery concerning the chaotic nature of the whole affair. The personal narrative being told by Gerald, the ten-year old, adds an additional amount of humor.Durrell does an exceptional job in depicting a typical family and its struggles to survive. The character portrayed by Gerald shows the immense imagination and curiousity that most children of that age have. Gerald's nature of learning and growing could be overlooked by the reader, but a lot has to be said about his meantality. He discovers scorpions like to eat bluebottles, grasshoppers, moths, and lacewing flies. He even notices one scorpion eating another! At night he takes a flashlight and delves into the walls of plaster and catches the scorpions in their sexual acts. Mother fails to see that the best education Gerald is receiving is the one about life.The results of the events were many. Brother Larry developes a phobia about matchboxes. Lugaretzia walks with a limp due to the dog bite. Margo and Leslie wants to slaughter the whole batch of baby scorpions, but Mother allows me to release them in the garden. The author uses lively verbs and comical sequences in allowing the reader to enjoy the confusion of the Durrell family. My personal views on \\"My Family and Other Animals\\" include a pronounced invitation for others to read and enjoy its contents."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This book is absolutely, brilliantly funny. The wit and unique characterizations are woven with great descriptions of the animals and plants of Corfu.

Absolute great read!"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"The book is wonderful, however the hard cover edition that Amazon.com sent me is hideous. It was very upsetting to see such a great book in such a cover--it looked as if it was a rebound old book in bright red cover with no title, no author, no illustration. The quality of paper is very low--it will probably fall apart in 5 years and the font is so small that you have to read the book with a magnifying glass."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I laughed so hard reading this book on the bus that people started looking at me in a weird way.G.

Gerald and his eccentric family move to the island from England, where all manner of strange and hilarious events are staged. A minor cult following of the book has developed, where people travel to Corfu to walk in the footsteps of young Gerald as he sought out all the local fauna, picnicked with his family, and learned Greek and local lore from his neighbors.There have been several movies made of this book, but the most recent with Imelda Stanton as the mother is just wonderfully done. Do yourself the favor of savoring this book first. Fortunately, the book has recently been republished; when I went on the hunt I had to buy an old copy on eBay from Australia! Enjoy."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I read all of Gerald Durrell's books as a child, a pleasure I shared with my mother and brother. This one is my favorite, although the Bafut Beagles is a close second. The books were so much a part of my family that we all quoted catch phrases from them to each other. The writing is graceful, the humor is laugh-out-loud funny, and there are vignettes of people and animals that will take your breath away."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This is my favourite book, bar none.

But I am so enthralled with this little book that I can't contain my enthusiasm.This is a quick read, but that is not to indicate any superficiality in the story or story telling. The author reveals a world of discovery in his life on Corfu. Far from dull, his time there is filled with small adventures and big lessons. There is nothing the least preachy or even \\"teachy\\" in the story line, but the learning for the reader takes place in such a pleasant fashion that you don't realize until the end how much knowledge you have gained.His eccentric family provides light and very humorous moments, but, for the most part, I found them and the stories about them quite unnecessary.The author's curiosity about the animals, amphibians, birds and world around him drive the story. His observations of human kind, especially the island people he meets, are equally compelling.I could not put this book down and, as it was lent to me, I am now on a quest to purchase my own copy.It only makes me wonder why children in modern day society need the enormous amount of stimulus and involvement to be content. Young Gerald Durrell spent much of his time alone, save the companionship of his \\"zoo\\", and was quite happy. No soccer games, no little league baseball, no hang-outs at the mall necessary. Oh, for the simple life."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"The book My Family and other Animals is most definitely a different book. It is about a young boy, the author, who moves to a small island with his large and diverse family. Gerald is very interested in animals and such. So when they move to the island he likes to just wander around and look at the species and try to capture them. There are really two types of writing going on in the novel, a story part and an informational part. It is very interesting during the more story part, for me, since something is actually happening. However, I do no necessarily like the informational part since it is about animals. I do like animals, but I think it is a bore to read about them like it was a text book. Overall, this is a really good book and it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it makes you laugh when the whole family gets together with all their differences. I recommend it highly to all the animal lovers out there"},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Upon the recommendation of a good friend, I picked up this book - and was never disappointed. In fact, when I read the table of contents, listing the names of the chapters, I knew that this book was something extraordinary. It showed that the book lived up to my initial anticipation.Unlike most of the books ever written, there's not a single cloud in here to shadow the reader's mood. It's a delightful, warm, comfortable read, a mix of exceedingly beautiful landscape (I HAVE to go to Corfu, one day *sigh*) and hilarious family affairs. Add some animals and their interactions with the highly peculiar family, and that's what the book is all about. Thank God! Any attempt to insert a serious matter, or something sad, would fail because of the lightness and litheness of the narration.After reading this book, you might dream of shady olive tree orchards, of turquoise ocean, of age-old walls slumbering in the heat of noon. It's one of those books (at least for me) that made me long for being the narrator, young Gerald Durrell."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I first read this delightful book in sixth grade. I believe the book had just been published. The Durrell family found a place in my heart and they are still there, arguing happily, all these years later. This is the type of book that needs to be re-read every five years or so. There are so many levels to the book that as one matures, it can be enjoyed anew with each re-reading.The book, an autobiography, traces the life and adventures (both as he explores Corfu and with his large, slightly dotty family)of the young boy, Gerry. One cannot help learning about various flora and fauna, and the book also revels in dry humor; so much that the reader will find himself/herself laughing uncontrollably.The late Gerald Durrell brings the island of Corfu, Greece into one's brain and it is as if one had been there. The bright, hot sun, the cerulean blue ocean, the whitewashed houses ... and most of all, the slow-paced, often maddening outlook of the Greek people all help bring this book alive. To paraphrase Durrell: While on Corfu, it is good not to grasp reality too tightly, but rather to accept the lovely, unexpected siren-song of the island.I highly recommend this book, from about sixth grade through adult."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"This man writes with a flair and a great sense of humor.

I usually go for action or fiction books and went with some reviews to have a go at this. It's really a fun book and interesting to read how the young lad looks closer and with more thought at various beings, as well as his own family. It's pretty funny and you can see some of the events happening which are hilarious. You just want to travel to Corfu when you read it. Really enjoyable read and I was sorry to see it come to an end."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"Oh what a lucky boy to have such a childhood! You have adventure, wonder, and humor all in one small book. If you have a love of animals this is a great book to read."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"I have learned about Gerald Durrell later than many readers and animal lovers. I am so thankful that I did hear about him. I just finished reading and laughing through his book, My Family and Other Animals. Let me start by saying that my home is filled with animals. Currently, we share out house with two dogs and two cats, but at times we have also hosted frogs, guinea pigs, and rabbits. Our back yard is often visited by red foxes, beavers, raccoons, and deer.I tell you this about myself because I detect a kindred spirit in the young Gerald as he recounts his adventures in Corfu where he amasses an impressive collection of pets. Durrell's genius lies in his ability to make readers feel they know the members of his families as well as the personalities of the animals he encounters. In addition, his writing is so beautifully descriptive without becoming cumbersome.I heartily recommend this book to observers of animals and families. It is highly entertaining and I plan to read whatever else he has written."},{"Title":"My Family and Other Animals","review":"My Family & Other Animals was the very first book that made me laugh out aloud. My lifelong passion for humorous literature, adventure travel, wildlife and wild places was directly inspired by this marvelous work, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to every literate person on this planet. Indeed, I would have to say that Durrell has been the greatest influence on my own, far more modest literary career ... But don't let that put you off.For what it is worth, my absolute favourite Durrell book is The Bafut Beagles, however your lifelong love affair with Gerald Durrell should definitely begin with My Family & Other Animals - it is a genuine treasure. BTG"},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"Eisner's \\"Spirit\\" work is landmark watershed etc. no question about it. And perhaps the stories in this volume are cream of that crop (there were so many Spirit stories that it seems impossible to really assemble just a few into a \\"best of\\") but be warned that this particular package has its drawbacks. As another reviewer noted, they are reprinted at standard comic book size, while the originals were at magazine size, so the art is a bit cramped and details muddied. That's to be expected but the cheap paper doesn't help any, causing some of the finer lines to look blurry, at least to me. Add to that what could be a recoloring job that seems slapdash, and it's not the easiest read. I'm not sure if the coloring follows the originals, or IS the originals in most cases, but in the case of the character Ebony, Spirit's youthful sidekick, he is definitely recolored. The original was a pretty standard (and admittedly, to current views, extremely offensive) \\"boy\\" in his coloring: looking like he's stepped off the stage of a minstrel show. In this volume he's been recolored as a blond caucasian. It's an understandable alteration, given what I assume is the wide -- and not necessarily Eisner- or old-comics- fluent audience for this volume. I'm not really complaining about the recoloring of the character (though I'm not sure why he couldn't have been recolored black but w/out the white lips etc.), but if they recolored that, what else was retouched?In short, for the price (esp here on Amazon) and convenience, it's hard to beat this as an intro to Eisner and the Spirit. The hardcover archives are much more expensive, even for the better quality, and the old reprints (from Warren & Kitchen Sink) were the right size, but B&W;, so these are a good choice to start. But still, they look kind of crappy.Btw, my fave spirit stories (not included) are \\"The Spirit in Space\\" -- amazing Wally Wood art in a story about the Spirit going to the moon w/a bunch of convicts. Wood at his best."},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"Will Eisner is a genius, plain and simple and his genius extends to far more than his work on the Spirit. Eisner was only 19 when he and partner Jerry Iger opened the Eisner & Iger studio to produce comics for comic publishers. Among the artists they recruited were legends Jack Kirby, Lou Fine, and Eisner's high school friend, Batman creator Bob Kane. Then in 1939 Eisner was approached to produce a weekly comic supplement that would be syndicated in numerous Sunday newspapers. The shrewd Eisner agreed as long as he could keep the copyright to the characters, including the main feature of the supplement, the crime-fighting Spirit. This was quite a coup for Eisner as he knew he would never be able to get the same rights if he had his work published by an actual comic book publisher. And as the owner, Eisner also had creative control which other artists and writers of the day didn't have. Thus Eisner was decades ahead of his time.This collection from DC comics includes 22 eight page Spirit adventures beginning with the Spirit's origin from June, 1940. Eisner would lose a few years to World War II but returned to his strip when he got back home in 1945 and continued with it until 1952. The Spirit is Denny Colt, private investigator and criminologist. While tracking down the devious villain Dr. Cobra, he is saturated with experimental chemicals and goes into a state of suspended animation, making him appear to be dead. He crawls from his grave and dons a simple mask and the moniker of the Spirit to battle crime in Central City. The cast of the Spirit includes Police Commissioner Dolan and the Spirit's sometimes sidekick, the orphan African American kid Ebony White who provided some comic relief.Eisner loved sexy, beautiful, bad girls and women were the Spirit's antagonists as often were men. In \\"Postage Stamp he tussles with the beautiful thief Dulcet Tone and later with a spy called Satin as he tries to locate a secret letter filled with the names of war criminals. It's often said that artist Jim Steranko introduced pop culture and cinematic art to comics, but Eisner did it long before Steranko. Eisner often cleverly utilized the Spirit logo on the splash page making it part of the story. He lettered his text in creative ways such as pyramid or circular forms, not seen in other comics of the times.Eisner used true cinematic vision in laying out his panels, like a meticulous film director. He used downward perspective and other interesting angles that are still innovative today. What truly sets the Spirit is that while comic books were written for kids, Eisner clearly aimed the Spirit at an adult audience, employing sly, sometimes tawdry humor that would be over the head of most children. Another interesting device Eisner employed is that quite often the Spirit would barely make an appearance in his own stories. A good example from this collection is the story \\"Christmas Spirit of 1948\\". At the state prison, convict Basher Brains is sick of hearing about Christmas until he receives a visit from Santa Claus himself who says that even Basher is on his list. Basher's request is to get out of jail and borrows Santa's outfit to escape. But Basher would soon learn the true spirit of Christmas from some street kids. The Spirit does not make an appearance until the final few panels.It's utterly amazing that these stories were produced at a time when comics were churned out as quickly and mundanely as they were. Sixty years later they have lost none of their potency or their humor. This is a marvelous collection, especially if you are new to the Spirit. My highest recommendation! By the way, I am uploading a picture of the actual book cover, which is not the one Amazon displays.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"The only reason I'm holding one star back is because I'm old. The art in these stories is so nuanced and rich that it should have been presented larger than standard comic book size. But that's the only bone I have to pick with this volume. Younger readers who don't have to squint to read this will be well rewarded.And with a price like this, there's really no excuse not to treat yourself.Will Eisner may not have invented the comic book, but he was one of the people who made them good. His talent and influence helped transform the medium from kids' throwaway entertainment to literature. \\"The Spirit\\" is Eisner at the height of his powers, and this collection is the best of the best. The phrase \\"no collection should be without it\\" has become watered-down through overuse, but in this case it is no less than the truth. If you're at all interested in comic books, this is where you start."},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"I've always essentially liked Eisner. I have both of his how-to books on comics, and a couple of the B&W; Warren Spirit reprints from the 70s. But it wasn't until this collection that I got hooked.The stories in this collection have the elegance of the best harboiled crime writers, and a stylish approach to visual storytelling that must've inspired what was best about the early Mad Magazine (and other EC titles). While The Spirit himself is pretty much of an affable do-right, the villians are usually very textured and often very funny.And, for a vintage crime comics fan like me, the fact that this is pretty hard-hitting for the sunday funnies-- with somebody getting plugged in almost every story, and a few unsavory surprises besides-- make this a true addition to the genre. And man, could Eisner draw them dishy dames! I've now pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I'm going to have to get a few of the post-war Spirit Archives.The only problem with the book is that it's a flimsy trade paperback, and should have been printed to the same standards as the Archives. But, due to the inventiveness of the stories, I can't bring myself to give it less than four stars."},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"I'm new to The Spirit but decided to read about it before I watch the movie. I wasn't really expecting anything because I've read some comics from the Silver Age and they were not too good. The writing was very dated and the stories very uninteresting. Much to my surprise, this was not the case with The Spirit. I can tell why they would call this the Citizen Kane of comics since, at the time, these stories must be quite revolutionary. Some of these stories are just as good if not better than the current or more recent comic book stories and the artwork is quite beautiful and would put to shame a lot of the more current renown artists. If you enjoy beautiful women in your comics, look no more. The women in these stories are very beautiful and would make Lois Lane, Mary Jane Watson, or Gwen Stacy look average in comparison. My favorite story which I found quite touching is the last story on the origin of Sand Serif who is possibly the most beautiful woman in all the Spirit stories. It's ashame a certain actress that looks nothing like her is going to play her in the movie. Given these stories are quite old, I'm am extremely impressed overall by the quality of writing and artwork. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"I love Will Eisner's creation \\"The Spirit\\", but let's face it: when it comes down to buying all 26 volumes of the Archives at $50 a pop, I'm not THAT big of a fan. Luckily, I can purchase the affordable trade paperback THE BEST OF THE SPIRIT, containing 22 classic stories from 1940 - 1950 that I feel serve as an excellent overview of the series. Contents include:\\"The Origin of the Spirit\\", in which criminologist Denny Colt becomes the titular masked hero. This is a fairly typical origin for a Golden Age character, though the storytelling is much more refined - and the art, cleaner - than what was usually seen during that period.\\"Introducing Silk Satin\\", \\"Meet P'Gell\\", and \\"Death of Autumn Mews\\", which showcase Eisner's trademark bombshells.\\"Life Below\\", \\"Two Lives\\", and \\"The Story of Gerhard Shnobble\\": tales of the city and how it affects its inhabitants, a theme which would be used to great effect in Eisner's groundbreaking graphic novels of the \`70s.\\"The Last Trolley\\", \\"Wild Rice\\", \\"The Last Hand\\", and \\"Sand Saref\\": hard-boiled crime.And one of my favorite comic stories of all time: \\"The Killer\\", which shows a double homicide through the eyes - literally - of the guilty.And of course, there's more! This collection shows that Eisner was a pioneer of the comic medium, and perhaps its earliest master. His experiments in narrative, layout, perspective, color, and photo-collage show that he was decades ahead of the game, influencing a number of Silver Age writers and artists who were considered \\"originals\\" in their own right... and short of Jack Kirby, NOBODY can draw a fight scene better than Eisner. As far as the reproduction goes, it's just fine for a $15 trade format, and I don't see any recoloring of the Spirit's sidekick Ebony, as mentioned in another review; however, the Spirit does have a blonde white kid named Sammy as another sidekick later on.In closing, please note that the more recent movie tie-in trade collection, FEMMES FATALES, reprints quite a few stories contained in this volume. If you have THE BEST OF THE SPIRIT, there's really no need for the other book."},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"Reading the comics of the 1940s tend to be an \\"educational\\" experience. You can see the seeds of modern comic books. You can marvel at the kind of stories that probably entertained your grandparents in their youth. You can even enjoy some of the book until you get tired. However, most of these old comics are simply old. Despite the \\"golden age\\" monicker, you can't really call them classics because they spend too much time plagiarizing themselves and telling the same stories about mad scientists and master criminals who need a good solid sock to the jaw. Even old Batman and Superman comics get old after awhile.Even if you don't have those old comics to compare them to, this book can be a revelation. At first you'll not how crisp the artwork is and how much it looks like the original Mad Magazine artwork. The stories will move along at a fast pace than most Golden Age comics and there's a clarity to the artwork that eschews the cramped little drawings that tended to dominate at the time. Eisner likes to sprawl out and take his time with the art which means that he has to pack more into the pieces than usual.THen as the book moves along into Eisner's post-war comics, the title becomes even more innovative. Stories are told from the perspective of toy guns and men who can fly (but are sadly ignored by the Spirit as he's fighting crooks). The tonal shifts from noir to twilight zone to children's comedy are delightful. The last story in which the Spirit realizes that he must arrest an old girlfriend is beautifully tragic.A classic does not mean that a book is old. There are plenty of old books that are just terrible. They may have been popular in their time but a classic is a work that leaves an impression and can be just as relevant 100 years after its out as it was in its inception. By that definition, this is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"I really enjoyed this collection of Eisner's Spirit comics. I became interested in them during the hype of the now fate-fallen movie by Frank Miller. The collection here provides an excellent introduction to the world of the Spirit. I think viewers will be surprised to find the obtuse morality and self-analysis present in these comics; they are an excellent precursor to the golden age of great graphic novels.One criticism: what makes this the 'Best Of' collection? It seems to have been complied after the artist's death, and there is no reasoning behind the selections in this volume. It's a great collection, but I wish the introduction explain why these works were chosen as the 'Best Of' and why they were set in the given order. Also, I feel rude giving Eisner 5 stars because he stereotypes blacks and Muslims in a few of his stories."},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"I had never heard of THE SPIRIT until I saw a trailer for Frank Miller's film version. Curious, I went online to see what the book was all about. What I learned was that THE SPIRIT was a detective-type comic written in the 1940s. It was said that Will Eisner, the creator, had raised comics to an art form and that he was ahead of his time. I am inclined to agree.I purchased this \\"Best Of...\\" collection to see for myself why THE SPIRIT was so celebrated. The book is great. Each story is a mere seven pages long, but each story is filled with mystery and suspense. The artwork is terrific. It has style! I love the cover artwork for each story. It incorporates the words \\"The Spirit\\" into an image that sets the tone for the pages ahead. Eisner uses the panels not only to advance the plot, but to create a mood. Many of the narratives have a sort of \\"Twilight Zone\\", Rod Serling feel.The stories in this collection are thoroughly enjoyable, even after sixty years. The stories aren't too dark or mature-themed, but there are gunshots and fatalities. As I write this, Frank Miller's movie has not yet been released, so I cannot compare it with its source work. But where the film seems to have a colorless, Sin City-like quality, the comics are very colorful. There are dramatic shadows, yes, but it's not a black-and-white book.I encourage any curious readers like myself to check out this inexpensive \\"Best Of...\\" and discover THE SPIRIT for themselves. This sampler left me wanting to read even more of the adventures of The Spirit!"},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"This book isnt for everyone but for those who do appreciate the golden age of story telling then this may be the book for you.

The color is so intense it almost obliterates the artwork in some panels, and the black line and letters are fuzzy.

Only one minor minus here - the stories are printed on cheap paper. Hmm. Still a great collection for anyone who's unknown to the spirit."},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"When you hear someone or something praised a lot, you are often disappointed when you are finally exposed to the lauded subject. Certainly, over the years I had heard a lot of great things about Will Eisner, so when I finally got an opportunity to read a collection of stories featuring The Spirit, I was wary. I needn't have worried: Eisner and The Spirit is well-deserving of all its praise, as shown in The Best of the Spirit.The Spirit is really Denny Colt, a criminologist and private detective, who is exposed to a chemical that makes him appear dead. He gets better but maintains the ruse that he died, using his guise as the Spirit to fight crime. He is hardly a typical superhero character: for one thing, his disguise is merely a mask over the eyes; otherwise, he goes around in suit, tie and fedora. Furthermore, he as often loses his fights as he wins them.In fact, in many of the stories, the Spirit is almost a peripheral character, with the focus on other characters that get involved in crimes; the Spirit just seems to come in to wrap things up. What makes the Spirit stories magical, however, is that Eisner seemed unconstrained by the limitation of the comics genre. In the period he wrote The Spirit (principally the decade or so after WWII), many comics were very formulaic; with The Spirit, you never knew what you would get, only that it would be good.At least one of the stories in this story is really science fiction, while another is a Christmas tale and still another takes the form of a children's tale. While there is a lot of humor (often at the Spirit's expense), there are also nasty villains and beautiful femme fatales (most notably Silk Satin who has three appearances and Sand Serif who is in the only two-part story in this collection).Yes, if you compare The Spirit to today's comics, it would be rather tame, but in the context of its time, it was cutting edge stuff. And even today, it is still both wonderful to look at and to read. If you're a comics fan, this is a collection well worth picking up."},{"Title":"The Best of the Spirit (Spirit (DC Comics))","review":"An excellent sampler of Eisner's work on The Spirit, including an introduction by Gaiman, and the origin of The Spirit. The best parts, perhaps are the title pages, where the title is worked cleverly into the artwork each time. Pretty impressive stuff.

Dollar for dollar, this is absolutely the easiest and best course. Oh, there was one better one, for 600% more money! I also found that our very large sister congregation in the next city over also uses this course for their classes. Our Hebrew teacher starts off with a six-week course in basic reading skills first.I especially liked the way the music for most of the combinations was presented in one concise location in the index. I also like that they actually told us where certain \\"rare\\" tropes were used, so that we would know when and where they were coming and when during the year to review them. Lastly, I liked very much that the voices they used were in an average range, and they followed the notes consistently--unlike some I had listened to.The only improvement the authors would do well to consider is in the music sheets for the regular Shabbat Torah tropes. Because I actually teach my students to read the music, and, technically speaking, the authors have used the wrong key signature with unneccessary accidentals, I have found the first two music sheets too hard for beginning sight-readers. So, I have added a supplemental handount with a different key signature and no accidentals. In spite of this extra work, I would not have selected this course without the outstanding organization of these music sheets. No other course I looked at for any price had this advantage, and it was the primary selling point. The authors did an outstanding job for the High Holy Day trope sheets."},{"Title":"The Art of Torah Cantillation: A Step-by-Step Guide to Chanting Torah [Book + CD]","review":"This book & CD combination is perfect for the motivated self-teacher. Having both male and female voices in the examples makes it easier to find your own voice. However, motivation is important, as in any self-teaching. I started learning trop from this book several times in the past, and couldn't stick with it. This is not a fault of the book, rather the fault of being motivated. Once I finally set the goal of chanting Torah 2 months hence, I found it much easier to stick with the book.Possibly one of the best parts of the book is the last few pages, that actually show the musical notation for the trope marks. This is what most other sources are lacking, but it's immensely valuable to those of us who can read music. Once we've heard the trope a few times, we don't have to turn on the CD in order to be reminded -- just turn to the back of the book, or even just carry around a photocopy of those 3-4 pages."},{"Title":"The Art of Torah Cantillation: A Step-by-Step Guide to Chanting Torah [Book + CD]","review":"This book is laid out in a logical, accessible fashion. The book is clearly indexed to the selections on the CD. You can truly learn using this method. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Art of Torah Cantillation: A Step-by-Step Guide to Chanting Torah [Book + CD]","review":"There are many positive things about this book/CD, many of which have been noted in other customer reviews: clear presentation, beautiful voices. You should be aware, however, that the melodies themselves are likely to differ somewhat from the ones that you are used to. The words \\"dissonant,\\" \\"minor,\\" \\"sophisticated,\\" even \\"bluesy\\" come to mind, though I'm not enough of a musical expert to apply them definitively. I do know that when I went to an online trope-learning site, what I heard was easier to learn, in part because it sounded more like what I've heard in synagogues throughout my life, and in part because the intervals and melodies were simpler. I also appreciated the fact that the site showed the written notes together with the initial presentation. In this book, the written notes are small and are relegated to an appendix, and the key in which they are represented contains three accidentals, which is a bit more of a struggle for me to sight-read. Finally, the website had the advantage that it \\"cut to the chase\\"; it allowed you to go right to the individual trope and listen to them once, twice, or however many times you wanted. By contrast, the tracks on the CD that come with this book alternate between the tropes, words sung with those tropes, and repetitions. These are helpful from a pedagogical standpoint but not so much when you want to return to them as a quick reference.However, in defense of the book, it does explain the tropes better than the website, in a way that is more likely to help you keep them in your head. In addition, a book, merely by virtue of its physical presence, is easier to refer to and relate to than a website, or printouts from that website.In conclusion, I would say that your decision to learn from this book or from a website should be based on how ambitious you are and how willing you are to depart from what you (and your mainstream audience) find more familiar."},{"Title":"The Art of Torah Cantillation: A Step-by-Step Guide to Chanting Torah [Book + CD]","review":"It is user-friendly and easy. The CD was particularly helpful. It was helpful that the CD was labeled well. It was easy for me to tally the numbers on the CD with the exercises in the book. I also did appreciate learning from two different cantors. I will advise the cantors to make a \\"slower paced\\" CD for beginners. I will recommend the book to any learner.

The characters are likeable and the story is well developed.Penny was a diamond when she first had her come out. Now several years later she is laughed at and gossiped about. See, there have been several plans for her to marry but they have all fallen through. It does not matter that she is the daughter of Duke. She is worthless as a bride.Lucas is an American who has come to England with his brother and his nephew to seek vengence for the death of his sister. She died in childbirth and they are there to see that young Harry (his nephew) gets what he deserves. Harry's father is Penny's father and Lucas after a chance meeting with the beauty decides that she is the key to bringing the Duke to heel and giving Harry the legitemancy that he deserves. What he does not count on is his feelings for Penny. This causes all kinds of problems. He has made a promise to his sister, but he wants to follow his heart. Can he do both?"},{"Title":"My True Love","review":"Lucas Pendleton secured the map of the duke's house from a tavern maid, who assured him that the duke retired to the library after the evening meal. He spent weeks trying to gain a conventional meeting, but his letters went unanswered and his knocks unanswered. Now he intends, with the aid of his brother Matthew, to see that the duke lives up to his obligations to Lucas' family. Surprised by the duke's youth and attractive appearance, it seems odd he would slack his thirst for young women by preying on the innocent. The duke had made Caroline his mistress, and she later died in childbirth. Lucas only came to England from America to confront the duke when he found the letter Caroline had written but never sent. Now Lucas demands recognition for Caroline's young son named Harry. If the duke refuses to acknowledge Harry, Lucas intends to make the scandal public.Penelope Westmoreland had always been the wealthiest, the prettiest, the most sought after girl, but no longer. The excitement of innocent flirtations and romances is gone. Now when she goes out, people laugh behind her back, whispering about how far she has fallen. At twenty, Penelope is past her prime. She had once been betrothed to the Marquis of Belmont, but the week before their wedding, he married his mistress instead. Finally her father arranged a marriage to a Viscount, who unexpectedly died in an accident.Now her father has promised Penelope to Edward Simpson, who just turned sixty-three. Though he's bald and obese, he is a powerful and wealthy earl. When Edward tries to take inappropriate liberties in the garden, Penelope calls out for help. Her rescuer remains to assure her safety, even as he should be leaving to certain of his own. He gives he name, a knife to protect her, and a promise to back the next night.Lucas carefully plans to use Penelope to win the duke's acknowledgement of his nephew. Lucas didn't realize, when he first made his plans, what a palatable, hot, sensual energy would pass between him and Penelope. Lucas is dismayed by his response to the beautiful woman. She was supposed to be the one with the tender response, not him. When he learns Penelope's wedding is moved up to three weeks, Lucas refuses to abandon her to her fate. But Penelope, though she comes away willing, has no idea of the sacrifice she's about to make, or the ways her life will forever change, for the sake of revenge.Cheryl Holtz pens a strong, yet charming and compelling tale, weaving wonderful secondary characters into her vivid tapestry. With deft skill, she muddies the motives and complicates the lives of her characters, holding the reader's attention rapt with her machinations. This brilliantly crafted romance is Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"My True Love","review":"My True Love is my favorite Cheryl Holt novel.

For me, it has been a waste of time and money.There are two main problems:1) The author for some reason I do not understand chose to NOT use Visual Studio .Net tools or the Form Designer to do the examples. Duh! Apparently, by only downloading the .Net runtime you can compile programs from the command line and run them. All the samples assume your going to do that. Perhaps his editor told him to do this to 'reach a larger market'. But first off, if you don't have the development tools you probably aren't serious about development and won't be buying many books. Second, learning windows forms IMHO is all about using the VS.Net Form Designer and if you don't have that there is little point. The fact is when you get a real job, they're going provide you with and want you to know how to use the VS.Net tools. I consider this a MAJOR flaw for this book. If you buy this book, you'll spend all your time cutting and pasting his sample code into a real project and setting up the compilation etc. Yup, he doesn't even include project files since there's no assumption you are using the de-facto tools! What a pain. You'll also spend hours and hours trying to figure out how to use the Forms Designer to do what he did manually. 21 days, right. More like 21 weeks.2) The other problem with this book, though this is more a personal preference, is the author obviously focused on VB.Net and only seems to have added C# at the end of the process. Many examples are only given in VB and most of the text explains VB first and then makes a few comments about C#. As a professional C++ developer, I want to use C# and am disappointed about the VB focus. If you're learning VB, then great, you'll probably like this. If you're doing C#, then switching back and forth from the VB based text to your C# code can be annoying and time consuming.If your a VB developer and don't have the tools, then maybe this book would be for you, but I think it silly to write a book called 'Teach Yourself .Net Windows Forms' and not use the obvious de-facto tools.As for the content, it seems ok, but I'm having such trouble converting the projects and shifting from VB to C# that I honestly haven't gotten very far into the book (first 5 or 6 chapters) and have finally come to the conclusion I will have to find another book.I have from time to time used this book as a reference because I have no other (yet), and have found it somewhat useful for that, but as a tutorial on learning forms forget it.To be fair, there are a number of other books out there that don't provide samples with project files and don't assume the tools everyone will use (VS.NET), and I hate that too, but for a .net FORMS book, I think this a fatal flaw."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself .NET Windows Forms in 21 Days","review":"I'm currently working my way through Day 3 of this book. On the good side, I am producing working Windows Forms using the .NET Framework SDK and this book. I'm generally able to follow the text and the exercises. My forms are on the simple side, of course, and follow the book examples, but I feel I am progressing well.On the bad side, the book has numerous typos to this point (Day 3). The downloaded code does not have some image files such as .ico and .bmp files crucial to one of the Day 3 exercises. Also some code written in vb.net in the book is provided as C# in the downloaded code. Some downloaded code seem missing entirely. A bad omen for the remaining days. I visited the author's web site and emailed him a question. So far he has not answered. I used the publisher's web site &quot;Contact Us&quot; page to let them know the downloaded code is missing some files, and got a response that must have been sent by an email robot -- it didn't at all speak to my concern. There is no published errata on either the publisher's or author's web sites.I admit that I am getting some Windows Forms juice out of this particular fruit. I don't know how intelligible coming chapters will be. But the very poor product support means that if you buy this book and have a question or concern you are out of luck. Good technical writers are proud of their books and respond to reader questions. Some are also extremely active in mailing list forums. Good publishers like O'Reilly respond to readers with replies that speak to the questions being posed.I have a tough time reccomending this book. You might do better elsewhere. Maybe that Windows Forms title offered by the Manning publishing house will be a help? I don't know."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself .NET Windows Forms in 21 Days","review":"I'd like to offer a different perspective on this book than the previous reviewer. I think it's a pretty well written book and I still use it today as a reference in my job training MCSD candidates. One of the good things about the book is it's comprehensive coverage of so many topics (which is one reason I use it as a reference source). Also, Chris's writing style is enjoyable and he communicates well - his ASP.NET book is extremely popular and this book shares a lot of the same qualities.Yes, it would have been better if it had covered using VS.NET instead of just using text files and the command line compilers but like many .NET books this book was written while VS.NET was still in beta. If you publish a book full of pictures and instructions dealing with the beta version of a tool and then the released version is significantly different, you have big problems. So most publishers produced books on the command line tools. Besides, to really understand something like .NET it's good to know how to code it by hand. Ideally you'd read two books, one like this that codes by hand and one that shows you how to use the power of the IDE.As to having to download anything extra to compile and run the programs in the book, if you have VS.NET installed then you have the command line compilers. Duh!If you like the \\"teach yourself in 21 day\\" style of learning topics by working with lots of example programs and if you want to know how to code .NET by hand (so you can understand the code the IDE is generating) this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"The Dreamer's Dictionary","review":"Dr. Condron's work is inspired from the desire I have had, as well as all of humanity throughout the ages, to understand what is occurring within myself while I sleep. I once wondered if all the time I was asleep was wasted time that I could better use in more productive ventures. I even began to investigate techniques that would aid me to reduce the amount of sleep that I required. Meditation was one method I investigated for this purpose. The book Dreamer's Dictioary , however, confirmed the idea that I had pondered that perhaps something productive was occurring while I slept, that maybe this was an important function of the mind rather than an outdated hinderance of evolution. I realized that my dreams were teaching me about myself. The insights in these descriptions are the most accurate and thorough I have encountered.

This book allows room for applying these universal symbols to specific dream context. It also stimulates you to reason and figure out more specific symbols from the general ones. That's why there are often questions asked in the symbol entries.It's important to give some meditative thought to the symbols in a dream and to the larger image that from which they are cut. I've found there's a tendency for beginning dream interpreters to turn dream interpretation into an exercise in listing symbols and meanings without actually imagining the meaning or seeing the connection of the symbol to its meaning. And there's a tendency to just decide that a dream means whatever you feel like it means without understanding how or why, also. I guess this book tries to keep away from either of those mistakes.Really, it's a lot easier with someone to teach you.I do think that it would help to have more examples of entire dreams, their interpretations, and how they reflected the dreamer's waking life, as well as a little more on why the symbols mean what they mean."},{"Title":"The Dreamer's Dictionary","review":"This is THE BEST dream interpretation dictionary ever.

So, this approach doesn't really work for me.The book could have benefited from a comparison of major achievements introduced by each luthier, and focused on broad comparisons of different guitars. It instead focuses on the personalities of the luthiers.If the reason you want to purchase the book is to help you find a concert guitar, this book will provide a good reference to the major luthiers operating today.

What they don't tell you is that you have to post it back to America - and it's a large and heavy book!"},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"I've been looking forward to Chris Carmichael's &quot;Food for Fitness&quot; for some weeks now. I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, and I'm a beginner marathon runner myself, so this combination of cycling lore and nutritional information is something I thought would be both informative and fun.However, I have to say that I am disappointed by the quality of the final book. There is quite a bit of good data here, and the science behind how we process and burn energy is described in some detail. But the information is poorly organized, spread over multiple chapters and often contradictory. Sample meal plans are provided, but these are vague and sometimes incomplete. For example, one daily diet described on page 212 skips breakfast. This seems like a bad idea for anyone, let alone an endurance athlete.In addition to the factual inconsistencies, the writing itself is not very clear. I often found myself having to reread paragraphs to understand the point the author was trying to make. In a technical book such as this, a consistent use of the topic sentence would have made it much more readable. It feels as if the book is half-completed; with data, anecdotal stories, and recipes all dropped in and stirred around a bit, with not enough effort spent on making the text into a cohesive whole.Mr. Carmichael also spends a significant portion of the book promoting his other products; notably his CTS training courses and his affiliation with PowerAde. There are whole pages that read more like a brochure than a technical nutrition book.There is some good information here, and I will keep the book and use it as a reference in the future. But I can't help thinking that so much more could have been accomplished with better organization, a more approachable writing style, and less emphasis on the add-ons."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"As someone with insulin issues (Insulin resistance) I have struggled for the last year to find any information on nutrition that related to me as a runner. All the info I could find was either geared to marathoners who run 60-80+ miles weekly, or to couch potatoes...my 4-5 hour a week training didn't seem to fit in anybody's info, even though i was infinitely more active than anyone in my circle of friends. There was nothing in the middle for me and it was frustrating.I bought Chris's book 48 hours ago, the day it arrived in our bookstore. It is without question, the best resource on running and eating I have ever read, and I've done literally hundreds of hours of research trying to find information applicable to me.I was concerned about the book being too elitist, but it is amazing. He has absolutely done his homework on everything from low-carbing to sports drinks and I have no doubt my book will get worn out from all the referencing I will be doing. I haven't been able to put it down.He writes as an authority, but he his style is one as fellow athlete and not preacher. The book is a wealth of graphs and charts and things to help us individually. Some folks might get bogged down in some of the detailed nutrition info, but I have to admit it fascinated me. It was well-written and his stories involving real life athletes are engaging.I HIGHLY reccommend this book. Not only does the guy's reputation precede him, but as somebody who has struggled to find good info from the monotonous assembly line of books on running/athletics out there, I've found this book to be the cream of the crop. Chris has an all-encompassing, realistic and well written book for everybody from serious to recreational athlete."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"It's about time someone wrote a new nutrition book for active people. This book cuts through all the carb confusion to give people who exercise real information about how much carbohydrate and protein we need, and the reasons why. Carmichael gives low-carb diets credit for being effective for weight loss, but then provides all the reasons a higher-carbohdyrate diet is better for active people. More than that, he tells you how to match nutrition to training so you perform better and control your weight during the year. This is the plan Carmichael uses with Lance Armstrong, who just won his sixth Tour de France. I expected the book to be over my head, but I am impressed; Carmichael makes science easy to understand and applies his common-sense nutrition program to middle-aged, moderately-active, very busy men like me. I haven't tried the recipes or used the meal plans in the back of the book yet, but I expect they're as good as the information that precedes them."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"Within 3 weeks of implementing the basic concepts I noticed a massive difference in my ability to train productively on successive days and that my soreness after long runs of 10-20 miles was drastically cut.One of the great things about this book is that you can apply it's concepts in a macro or micro level pretty easilly, from grams to food groups to eating for specific training cycles.The organization and layout could use some cleaning up, but the content makes up for it.

It touches all of the main points of nutrition and really does a good job of applying the principles to active individuals."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"Over the years I have invested in many books on nutrition and fitness, but this is the first one that truly addresses my situation. I exercise regularly, but training and working out doesn't rule my life. I am not fat and I don't need a diet book, I need a nutrition book. I need a better understanding of what foods are best for my body based on my level of activity. What's more, I need to know why. I like the sections on carbohydrates, how they're used, and why I need them. As Chris says, low-carb diets are meant for some people, but not for my lifestyle. Carmichael's view of food as fuel was really helpful, as was the idea that exercise should be aimed at gaining fitness and not just merely burning calories. The book also gave structure and meaning to the ways my eating habits change during the year; now I see why I do and should eat more when I'm running more in the summer. Likewise, it's great to have a plan for reducing calories in the fall and winter, when I'm not running as much. The book gives the information behind its assertions, and it's readable and easy to understand instead of being overly technical.By giving up my coffee habit I realized having that wired up feeling all day clouded my concentration. Did you know one cup of joe raises your blood pressure by 14%! Fortunately for me I was able to find a wonderful tasting replacement made from soyabeans. You brew like coffee and it even helps lower my cholesterol. I found it online at www.S o y c o f f e e.c o m.

Contains a critique of low carb diets as a bonus so you can have factual response to the fad diet.While geared toward the athlete there is a strong sense that it is really for anyone that is not sedentary and that a sedentary lifestyle is what is really bad for you.Specifically though, contains recommendations for levels of carbohydrate, protein, and fat consumption based on what point in your exersize plan you are at. Also contains how your body uses these nutrients. The meal plans at the back are less useful, the recipes are very useful.The one thing missing is a specific step by step plan for applying the ideas to building your menu plans. You can glean it from the contents though given a little effort. Essentially, keep track of the nutritional content of what you are eating and adjust according to the guidelines contained. Make changes gradually or you are unlikely to stick to them."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"I was looking for advice on losing weight. It is really difficult to train and lose more than just a few pounds at the same time, and I figured that this book would at least give a few pointers.

Yet, I've been a runner for 30 years, with 40,000+ miles of running behind me. I have genetically high cholesterol, and found Carmichael's book to provide something the other nutrition books (for lowering cholesterol) lacked, namely, an insight into diet for an active person.After being diagnosed with somewhat high cholesterol, I went to see a dietitian. She recommended a diet of 1800 calories/day, despite my telling her that I average 2 hours of exercise per day. After losing 8 pounds in 2 weeks under her system, I bought Carmichael's book. It quickly became evident that the dietitian I was paying had the right ideas and science, but for sedentary people. Expanding her thoughts to include Carmichael's recommendation, my weight stabilized - and my cholesterol dropped 30 points in 5 months.

The meal suggestions are great and give some practical ideas about how to \\"eat right\\". The helpful hints and dietary guidelines have helped to increase my performance, even as weekend warrior."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"Nutrition seems to be one of those topics where everyone has an opinion and almost everyone has written a book. A lot of those opinions differ, and a lot of the books out there espouse some pretty wacky theories in order to try to create some buzz and sell a few extra copies.Chris Carmichael has solid cred in bicycling, of course, but also in other sporting areas like running, and even motorsports. So he doesn't need outlandish theories and \\"lose 20 pounds in 2 days\\" come-ons to get people to buy his book.So if you're looking for major revelations, or a meal-by-meal recount of Lance's training diet, this isn't the book for you. But if you're looking for common-sense recommendations aimed at amateur endurance athletes, you'll find a lot of practical, usable information in this book."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"Hi Folks,I just finished this book that I got as a gift this past summer. It's written by Lance Armstrong's prior trainer/nutritionist, so right off the bat you know your not reading a book written by just any chum.It can prove very useful book for both beginner and advanced athletes wanting to learn or solidify the fundamentals of good, sound dieting as and training concepts.It's thorough - it covers the importance of heart-rate targeted training (he provides instructions on how to run 'field-tests' used by his company to find your training HR). He goes over macronutrients (their importance, roles, recommended daily ratios, good/bad carbs/fats). He goes over young, old, and pregnant athletes.I've concluded that this book is better suited for endurance athletes. Sure, Carmichael helped train one of the best endurance athletes ever, but Carmichael does say that his nutritional formula (which varies depending on the time of the year, which divides into training periods) is roughly 65% carbs, 22% fat, 13% protein.I'm mainly a strength athlete. In tracking the percentages of my daily macronutrients, I learned that I feel optimal when I get 20-25% of my day's worth of calories as protein. Likewise, optimal when I get around 20-25% of calories in fat. That leaves my carbs at about 50-60% of my day's calories. He argues that a higher carb diet better replenishes glycogen stores, aids muscle repair, and provides energy - but I feel mentally and physically better when I stick to my percentages (I tried his percentages, as well as other extreme percentages such as the one in the mostly fruitarian raw vegan diet). I don't know if this is because of my body type (a concept he does not discuss) or because of my type of training.I also disagree with his view on carbs and feel that it is a bit incomplete. He categorizes carbs as empty carriers or nutritious. I think there are damaging carbs - I feel markedly worse after a snickers bar and feel it worsens my cardiovascular endurance. They also provoke a high glycemic response. This is an important concept that has helped me succeed athletically once I took it into account. Two other concepts not discussed are food alkalinity and their potential to promote bodily inflammation. I believe these are important concepts that DO make a difference in training.The bottom line is that this guy has A LOT of experience in the field of athletic performance an nutrition (he himself was an elite athlete). He runs an athlete training company and, thus, trains a lot of top athletes. He has seen what works and doesn't. It's just that I think it's better suited for endurance athletes, and that it's a bit incomplete since it lacks discussion about body type (and possible resulting dietary alterations), glycemic index and load, as well as carbs that can potentially hinder your performance. (And not just because you could be eating something more nutritious in their place...but because they're bad for you!)Beyond all that, the book contains a bunch of pages of cooking recipes (which I didn't look at, I'm happy with my cooking; maybe later), and advice on eating on the go. In a few parts of the book he pubs his PowerBar products, but it only caused chuckles and didn't degrade the quality of his advice.Recommended read."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"Decent book but not quite 4 star material. The book differs from other nutritional books in that Carmichael details a food periodization plan. He suggests periodizing your nutrition along the same lines as periodizing your training. The rest of the book is just a rehash of what every nutrition book details(fats, protein, carbs, recipes and meal plans)."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"A unique perspective on diet and nutrition needs for athletes, instead of a weight loss perspective.

There is lots of information but it is spread out all over the place. That is the bad news. The organization is spread out in seventeen chapters over four parts. Some parts are more beneficial than others. The good news is that there is everything you need to know in this book about keeping your body fueled at the optimun level for a top performance, whatever you choice of exercise is. The best section is probably the part entitled \\"The Best Fuels for the Job.\\" Within this section you can find your guide to carbohydrates, low carb diets, fats, proteins and other useful information about minerals and vitamins and fueling for performance before, during and after. There are charts to compare the different products(protein powders, energy drinks and recovery drinks) on the market for you to choose the one that best suits your needs. There are also many charts with comparisons of nutrients found in different foods to help you make a choice for which is best for your tastes. The training regimen is detailed with suggested meals and is just to linear for my tastes. I like to pick and choose so for me this book was too regimented. I bought this book when it first came out and have read it on and off since but have recently incorporated some of the receipes found in the back of the book into my lifestyle. Since I am more a free form cook, I use many of the ideas as a springboard for my own imagination in the kitchen. However there are several receipes that are great as is. The empahsis on nutrition and the benefits of certain foods is the books strong point and can benefit many people, even people who are not atheletes. If you are into health and are active in some type of endurance sport than this book will be of help you get the most out of your body. If you are sedentary and want to get off your duff this book might help you see you can still eat many of the foods you like(but others you will have to cut)as you begin to become more active. Overall this book can have a good effect on your lifestyle."},{"Title":"Chris Carmichael's Food for Fitness","review":"Quite simply this book is a must read irrespective of whether or not you are an athlete.

She recently lost her husband (though she did not love him), and her daughter is often sick. To make matters worse, the new owner of her estate is about to remove her from the premises.George Blake inherited Meadow House, but he sends his younger brother to do the dirty work. Charles, the younger brother, hates the idea of asking the widow to leave. Last time he met Nell, he fears he did not make such a good impression on her. When Charles meets Delphine, Nell's sickly daughter, the task of removing them from the house becomes nearly impossible.Charles feels drawn to Nell and Delphine in ways he never imagined. And Charles is nothing like the man Nell remembers. He is warm and thoughtful, and her staff falls in love with him. Can she find love as well?I really enjoyed \\"The Gilded Knight.\\" I think it's Donna Simpson's best novel since her debut. \\"Lord St. Claire's Angel\\" is my favorite book by Donna Simpson, and this one comes close. The story is very sweet, almost sad sometimes, but definitely touching. You learn to love the characters, and I think the ending is one of the best I've come across in a long time.If I had one problem with the book, it would be that it hung around in one place for too long. The setting didn't change, the activities hardly changed. But the characters and their problems are so absorbing, you hardly notice.If you're looking for a sweet, fulfilling love story, look no furthur."},{"Title":"The Gilded Knight (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Nell Simmons is now a widow, with a very sickly daughter, Delphine, and no longer has a right to live on her dead husband's estate. The new Viscount, having waited long enough in his opinion, wants her gone and the house available for his residence. To that end he sends his wastrel brother Sir Charles to remove her and Delphine with all possible speed. In fact he forces Charles to do this, as Charles is badly in debt due to his ruinous lifestyle of gambling and drinking. Charles has also been the butt of much cruelty through his club foot and been thwarted in his ambition to be in the army.Thus our stage is set.This is a well written, interesting and moving romance. Interesting, in that it upends our usual ideas about this type of situation. For usually the widow with a child being forced from her home has all our sympathy and the man evicting her is cast as a villain for so doing. However, during the course of the tale, we discover such not to be the case. The new viscount has waited for her to leave, she is not destitute, she has a perfectly good home to which to remove, she has a good income. Nell is being unreasonable, but I don't think, desptite this unreasonableness, that her thoughts and actions are unbelievable, maybe foolish ... She seems to have been under great mental stress and is only just beginning to emerge from beneath her husband's heavy handed treatment. She has been clinging to familiarity and cannot see out of her well worn groove.Similarly, Charles is also jolted from his pattern. As he leaves London, we can see his dissatisfaction with his ruinous, pointless life and once at Meadow House he is able to do more than moan. He is already rejecting that and wants to change. He is seen as looking back upon his childhood pain and understanding it, he is putting that bitterness behind him.Both he and Nell are wounded characters who are struggling to burst from the past and their steps forward are made more surely by their developing relationship. For they are undeniably attracted to each other almost from the first.Only Nell's reaction to discovering Charles' reasons for acting for his brother is overdone.A beautifully realized romance."},{"Title":"The Gilded Knight (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Maybe this book is a victim of over expectations on my part. I love Donna Simpson's work and she is one of my favorite romance authors.Lord St. Claire's Angel (Zebra Regency Romance)is one of my favorite books ever. So maybe my less than enthusiastic reaction to The Gilded Knight is more my fault than Simpson's. I found it slow, and I didn't care as much about the characters. For me, it was not a compelling read, and it was easy to put down.But... even Shakespeare had his off plays. I would still consider reading The Gilded Knight again (perhaps in a few years) to see if my first read opinion stayed the same. Hopefully, The Gilded Knight will improve as I age.:-)"},{"Title":"The Gilded Knight (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Lovers of Regency romance generally know what to expect and their satisfaction in reading these stories is based on the fact that there is comfort in knowing how the plot and characters will work. In this book, nothing is like the typical regency, neither plot nor characters. A few comments:Firstly, it took me a long time to warm to the hero and heroine and I even question calling them that. For a start, neither is instantly likeable, neither has traits to make them appealing and they do not behave in a formulaic way thus confusing and challenging the reader to stick with the story.Second, if you do stick with the book to see how skilfully the author makes such an unplausible scenario come to an acceptable conclusion, you will find this a satisfying read. Others have described the plot so I would just like to say that this one goes against the grain of the genre in that the hero must carry out the dirty work and thus does not enamour himself to the heroine.Third, both the hero and heroine have many faults and it is only by admitting them to each other that they are able to move beyond what appears to be a stalemate set-up. Sir Charles is a wastrel in the fullest sense of the word and although basically a nice man, has allowed an unhappy childhood to colour much of his life, opinions and actions. The heroine, Nell, was married off young to an older and indifferent husband but over-compensates through devotion to a somewhat sickly child. She nearly allows herself to be subsumed to the child which, of course, is of no benefit to anyone including the child.Hats off to Donna Simpson for this story because she brings it to a satisfactory (if not entirely happy) ending by carefully growing her characters in what at first appears to be unfertile ground. I can't say it was a happy read but I do relish the \\"difficult\\" Regencies wherein the lead characters must suffer a bit and use introspection to achieve happy conclusions. Well done and recommended for those who would like something out of the usual mould."},{"Title":"The Gilded Knight (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I have only read one or two of the author's others books, but after reading her latest, I will be exploring some of her other writings. This story was exceptional in how it presented the reasons why the two main characters were drawn to each other, and how the relationship helped both of them face past issues and mature. Sir Charles and the widowed Nell seemed to be a mis-matched couple at first, since they were on adversarial sides. Charles was sent by his hypochondriacal brother to evict Nell and her invalid child,Delphine, from the ancestral home. How Charles falls in love with Nell and grows to love her daughter as his own child is a touching story. Each of the main characters has flaws, like in real life, but they also have strengths that they didn't know they had. Charles had lived a life of gambling and drinking, without a purpose. It was difficult to show the progression of his maturing in such a short book, and I would have liked to see this story be in a longer format to fully develop things more, but the author was very successful in making me believe that the wastrel could turn over a new leaf. Delphine was a sweet character, and I also liked the personalities of the servants. An excellent book--one that is going on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"The Gilded Knight (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I found this story to be incomplete at best and slow moving. Almost all the action takes place at Nell Simmons home in the country at the estate home she must vacate since her husband had died 8 months before and the new Viscount wanted to take proper ownership of the house. Well, it is his home and not hers (which is a fact she conveniently ignores). Nell was not destitute; she was well off and had another home to go to sort of in London. Donna Simpson does not really make her reasons for refusing to go understandable. She was unhappily married, did not have many happy associations with the home so leave! It was also almost criminal to stay in the country and deny her sickly daughter the London doctors who one would presume were better. Her country doctor was old and always giving dire outcomes for her pretty, 9 year old daughter. As a mother, would it have have been her responsibility to get her daughter the best care possible? That leaves Charles. Lame since birth and taunted by just about everyone growing up, he has not made much of his life, he just drinks and gambles. His small allowence paid by his brother George is not adequate to cover his gambling losses. George says he will pay these debts if Charles can convince Nell to leave the home so George can move in. When Nell finds out Charles would have had his debts paid for this service, she gets very angry. But why? She already knew Charles came to evict her but he never did. If fact, he was a nice guest and very helpful. So what if he would get is debts paid? Why she become so frosty is unclear. Having lived her life among the nobility, she would be very aware of how unimportant second sons can be with no income of their own so how else would he get it paid, by working???!!!But for me, this plodding story fails most at the end. Charles has a revelation that he might be able to work and support himself after all. He has a idea to contact an old friend of his family to ask for a job. Good for him; but does he? The story ends with them deciding to marry. Since Nell has lots of money, does he end up working? Does the little girl get better? Does Nell have another child since she wondered about her ability? Did George, who was unmarried and in mid-30's, die and leave the title to Charles? I think the author could have left out some of the middle draggy stuff and had a last chapter completing the story. Why do so many authors not complete a story? Any writing class has that as a valuable lesson to learn. So in the end, it is a story which was not finished."},{"Title":"Allied Health Professions Admission Test: The Betz Guide (Serial)","review":"Beware: This book is an identical copy of the Ahpat : Complete Preparation for the Allied Health Professions Admission Test Williams, Wilkins Review / Paperback / Published 1998"},{"Title":"Mole Hunt","review":"1 1/2 Stars.Nigel West is one of the more prolific authors on espionage history, particularly the history of Soviet espionage in Britain, but do not mistake quantity for quality or accuracy. West is no more accurate of an historian than most other sensationalistic British journalists-turned-authors who write on this topic.The cover of this book would lead one to believe that West did a substantial amount of research, interviewing, digging in still- secret British records, etc..., about the possible high level Soviet spy in Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI-5, but that would be an erroneous conclusion. I do not believe that West obtained any information regarding the alleged mole that does not appear in Peter Wright's much better autobiography, Spycatcher.Essentially, Wright determined, after years of working as one of MI-5's chief counterintelligence officers, that MI-5 had so many gaffs and foiled operations against the Soviets that the only explanation was a high level Soviet spy within the organization. Wright narrowed his choices down to two men, Sir Roger Hollis, the Director General of MI-5 during the 1950's and 1960's, and his deputy, Graham Mitchell. Both men were guilty of substantial incompetence in their positions, both had access to all information contained in Wright's list of proofs of Soviet penetration into the service and both had connections to the Soviet Union in their past. Wright suspected Hollis in particular and was able to show somewhat more circumstantial evidence that he was the Soviet spy. West arbitrarily decided that Mitchell was the spy, but fails to explain why or substantiate that opinion. However, perhaps only half or so of this book is devoted to the topic of the mole - the remainder is essentially a history of the attempts for British authors, including Wright and journalist Chapman Pincher, to publish a history on the issue of Soviet penetration of MI-5 in light of British government attempts to suppress such information under the Official Secrets Act. Unless the reader is interested in the legal battle concerning this governmental censorship (which is rather dull), one can skip the entire second half of this book.So was there a mole, and if yes, who was it? Christopher Andrews and his two KGB defector collaborators in KGB: The Inside Story, and The Sword and the Shield, deny that there was ever a mole in MI-5.

I had a hard time putting the book down just to go to work.Ms Nail weaves the lives of the four roommates together in such a way that reader can truly get the feel of the difficulties and patriotism of the WWII era.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Girls from Hangar B","review":"In 1943 across the United States, necessity being the mother of invention, the manufacturing side supporting the war efforts advertises for women to fill blue-collar positions. Experience is unnecessary. The companies want women with a willingness to work harder than the men the females replace do.In Seattle, several women accept the challenge at the Boeing airplane factory though their reasons for leaving home and taking the jobs vary. Four of these women share a home. Twenty-eight years old Amazon Annie Tosh left Coos Bay because she cannot sit still while her siblings and her fianc&eacute; Howard fight the Axis powers. Mid twenties prostitute Sparkle Melody sees this job as a second chance if she can stay away from the Johns. African-American Birdie traveled across the country to obtain work to feed her four kids. Teenager Gloria Westfall, a pampered female, whose wealthy parents want to shield from the realities of war, needs to aid the war effort n order to prove something to herself. Together this group will learn that building planes is easier than constructing healthy relationships.THE GIRLS FROM HANGAR B is an appealing historical fiction novel that looks back at the home front during World War II through the eyes of several Rosie the Riveters. The story line uses historical tidbits to paint a relationship drama between the four lead characters as well as other people they meet on and off the jobs. Though not loaded with action, readers who delight in this character study concerning the recent American past. The audience will treasure Kristin Campbell Nail&#65533;s homage to one of the most influential periods in the women&#65533;s rights movement.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Girls from Hangar B","review":"Set in WW II Seattle, The Girls From Hangar B follows four eager, patriotic women who were selected at random to work in the factories while America's men went to war. A Scandinavian redhead; an African-American mother of four; a rich, academic young woman; and an ex-prostitute - each woman is radically different in looks and history, and each one knows nothing about building, yet each is about to begin labor on some of the most complicated machines of the era. A wonderful tale of the enduring bond between female friends, The Girls From Hangar B is a testament to the strength of the collective human spirit."},{"Title":"The Girls from Hangar B","review":"Kristin Nail has a style of writing that literally grabs you by the coat tails and pulls you into the storyline. Her characters are so vivacious and real you feel as if you've met them at many points in your lifetime. Her way of describing a scene will at times crack you up and then have you weeping big daddy tears with empathy over a character or a particular scene. Kristin is an amazing writer and her first novel, The Girls From Hangar B, is a definite five star selection!! I hope I don't have to wait too long for her next one!!!"},{"Title":"The Wilds (New California Poetry)","review":"These poems are inspiring in their unique voice. Tired of the same-old, same-old? Try these. Passionate in their pursuit of reality, poignant in their descriptions of a coming of age, and lighthearted in their playfulness with rhythm, lyric, and wit. Unashamed of occasional awkwardness in both expression and content, elevating that awkwardness to grace in the light of honest attempts to see just what is really going on. Each one is a stylish riddle. Some are grotesque, yet somehow manage to mitigate their dark subject matter with the stark gravity of observation itself. Some are a testament to the uncomplicated wisdom of the natural world. Some force you to acknowledge the unlikely interdependencies of underestimated characters, avoiding the distractions of cultural judgment. All through clever yet casual arrangements of words that reflect the clever yet casual arrangement of the world we all experience. Try out these poems and you'll find a door opened where the poetic form has new possibilities."},{"Title":"The Wilds (New California Poetry)","review":"There are many ways to get smart; a pecking order - nascent, nefarious - exists. Clever? Rather, I'd say: Emerged - which is the smartest route of all. Nothing else matters but that space which you want to enter. In the beginning was the word, but following the word was: suspicion."},{"Title":"A Heart Too Proud (Candlelight Regency #227)","review":"Anyone who is a fan of Laura London will have read her masterpiece &quot;the Windflower&quot;, in my opinion the greatest romance novel ever written (see reviews for confirmation). &quot;A Heart too Proud&quot; comes close to reaching the perfection found in windflower. The story is of a young country girl named Elizabeth, beautiful, orphaned and living off the largesse of her father's friend. When her benefactor dies, the estate eventually comes to the rakish Lord Dearborne, where he becomes Elizabeth's guardian. The rest of the story continues with their on/off relationship, and includes an interesting mystery. Elizabeth, like most L. London heroines, rushes into intrigue and danger where angels would fear to tread. The plot is wonderfully supported by an astonishing array of secondary characters, including Elizabeth's young twin sisters, and a boy named Kit Warrington who is Dearborne's ward--the mystery is largely due to Kit's presence. Kit is remarkably like Cat from Windflower and Lord Peterby, Dearborne's rakish friend, is a facsimile for Morgan from windflower. The story has wonderful interaction between Kit and Elizabeth, the mystery is fun and interesting and is truly a wondeful read. One note: the story is written in the first person, where Elizabeth talks to the reader, which is normally a literary style I loathe, but it works well in this book. Quite frankly, even the most feeble efforts of Laura London far outshine the best efforts of other authors, and this is far from that. Don't miss this one. It leaves you wishing for more of the same."},{"Title":"A Heart Too Proud (Candlelight Regency #227)","review":"I purchased this book after reading the legendary 'Windflower' (my all-time favorite romance). Predictably, it was not on par with 'The Windflower', but it is still quite excellent. I can't believe this was the first novel Sharon and Tom Curtis ever wrote! It effortlessly surpasses the work of so many seasoned authors. 'A Heart Too Proud' is wonderful because the authors simply write well- know how to create suspenseful action, charming characters, and build up the tension that gives falling in love its true thrill. Perhaps skip this book if you are looking for something that is dripping with steamy, explicit sex scenes, but you'll be passing up a true gem."},{"Title":"A Heart Too Proud (Candlelight Regency #227)","review":"This is a very good story.

I looked up this writer and purchased 2 more of her stories, which by the way, are hard to find because she wrote in the 80's."},{"Title":"A Heart Too Proud (Candlelight Regency #227)","review":"Although the book was well written, the heroine was too stupid and silly! I really detest novels where the hero is all knowing and wise to the ways of the world, and the heroine is a silly, completely innocent youngster who has to be rescued over and over again.Elizabeth actually fit much better with Lord Dearborne's ward Kit. He was her age and developed a friendship with Elizabeth. Lord Dearborne could have been her father and frankly seemed only interested in two things: Elizabeth's physical beauty and laughing at her expense!I also dislike books where the hero never tells the heroine what's really going on, so she keeps falling into trouble. As far as the mystery goes, you could see from the very first time he entered the book that the villain was up to no good.A much better book is &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; by Alicia Rasley. In that book, the hero and heroine are much better matched. They are true kindred spirits - of the mind as well as the body."},{"Title":"A Heart Too Proud (Candlelight Regency #227)","review":"It's remarkably close to being a perfect Regency romance.

The author tends to group non-violent/patriotic groups with racists and extremists. This is nothing new. Angry liberals have always linked their foes with criminals. This is the process of vilification.It is a shame that people who don't know much about this subject must read this book because they are getting a very biased view of the topic. For example, there are many militia groups out there which are non-violent and defensive in nature. The author fails to mention this.In conclusion, this book is NOT fair and balenced, but very bias toward the far left. My advice to someone looking at this book is don't waste your time and money. This book is not worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Torah : The Unveiling of Redemption","review":"This informative tome allows the reader insite into the inner working of the first five books of the Bible's Old Testament and examines closely the finite details that are overlooked by some scholars of the Word. A absolutely splended research companion and aid!"},{"Title":"Marsha","review":"Marsha is one of my very favorite books. All of Margaret Maze Craig's books are excellent. This is a \\"Malt Shop\\" era book, but with somewhat more adult writing than you'll find with Anne Emery or Rosamond du Jardin (I think Margaret is the best of this crowd).Marsha is the story of a seventeen year old who has always been in her sister's shadow. When she meets the boy of her dreams, she has to fight both her family and her own self image to learn that she is her own person and deserves the love that's offered to her.If you like the sort of story told in Molly Ringwald movies like Sixteen Candles and Pretty in Pink, you'll love this."},{"Title":"Marsha","review":"I have owned this book since I was a teenager.

I was rather satisfied by this book because it dealt extensively with the political wranglings which had to occur in order for Hungary to escappe the grip of the Societ Secretariats. In truth, it's rather amazing that a Soviet bloc nation was allowed to endeavour on such blatantly market oriented reforms (and, to soften the point a little, the reforms where indeed more paper than practice). This book deals primarily with the political, so if you need economic theory, this is not the place. For a great economic analysis of the reforms, I recommend Gabor Revesz's &quot;Perestroika in Eastern Europe: Hungary's Economic Transformation, 1956-1988&quot;."},{"Title":"The Faces of Womanspirit : A Celtic Oracle of Avalon","review":"More than just a system of divination, Dr. Torres has provided us with a beautiful system of self-transformation. The richly illustrated cards and accompanying book provide the true seeker with all they need to begin their journey within, initiate a deep and lasting change, and begin to live their truth, find their purpose, and discover the spiritual wealth resident in each of us.Every card contains symbols both timeless and timely. The reader would be hard-pressed not to find something in each card that spoke to them on any given day. The cards can be used as an oracle or simply as a means of chosing an aspect of one's self to work on for that day, week, month, etc.What I find most powerful about this system of divination is it's use of reference, as well as the many layers of meaning. For example, each of the 13 moon mother cards represents a month in the celtic year. Each has it's attributes unique to that month and represents the many facets of self. Each has its polarity, and so if one wishes to better understand one card they can look at the polarity of that card. Further, the deck includes cards of action (planets), levels of consciousness, and references to time. These many aspects provide for incredibly deep readings that are touching and inspiring in a way only a feminine system can be (as opposed to the stark masculinity of the Tarot).You may be skeptical of this deck as I once was, writing it off as a new system with little value and quite probably faddish. But I guarantee that if you have used other divinatory systems like the Tarot or even if you have not, this deck has the power to touch you as nothing else I have ever seen. May you be blessed by it as I have been and use it to its fullest for your best and highest purpose."},{"Title":"The Faces of Womanspirit : A Celtic Oracle of Avalon","review":"The Faces of WomanSpirit is one of the most beautiful Oracles I have ever had the pleasure to see and to use.Katherine Torres, Ph.D. wrote this wonderful system and Cruz completed the process with the beautiful illustrations.

It Doesn't Have to Happen Though. There Is a Solution.","review":"This book is a major wake-up call! Like most of us, I've been lulled by government and media into believing that our economy is golden. McAuliffe proves that it's fools gold.The biggest revelation for me in this book is the documentation of the inflation controversy. I realize that I hadn't understood until now what inflation really means. And I think that most of you won't know until you read &quot;Disarming the Debt Bomb.&quot;McAuliffe's convincing bottom line is that there has never been an economy in history with more inflation than we have right now in the U.S.of A. He calls it an &quot;inflationary cancer&quot; that will take us down if we don't make some radical changes, especially in the banking system, which he sees as the core of the problem.Furthermore, he makes a great case for how inflation leads to family breakdowns, the expansion of crime, corruption and despair.The good news is that he offers a cure, hence the book's title.My eyes usually glaze over when I try to read about economics, but McAuliffe's passion for his subject and reader friendly style make this book a page turner.He urges us to take the corrective steps he lays out. Otherwise, he says, we could end up like a banana republic with most of the money in the hands of an elite minority and everybody else scrambling to survive.Yes, I'm a conspiracy theorist. But only the ones that impact society and are provable interest me. There are more smoking guns in this boom market deceit than there were at the Saint Valentine's Day massacre, and McAuliffe spots every shooter.Read this book, weep, get angry at how you've been lied to by the economic spinmeisters, then join the McAuliffe brigade and let's turn this sucker around before we enter the dark tunnel of recession."},{"Title":"Disarming the Debt Bomb: America's Huge Debt Is a Bomb That Is Exploding & Devastating the Lives of Millions.

For example, the financial pundits keep telling us inflation is very low, but if that's true, why is everything seem more expensive now than, say, 10 years ago?McAuliffe says that the reason is that we are more in debt--everything we buy has debt attached to it (like the Mafia tax, but legal). Bonds are debt, stocks are debt, our credit cards are debt, hostile or friendly takeovers add debt to the cost of manufactured goods and services.But he offers some solutions as well, which makes this a hopeful book, not just a damning one.Read it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"Fake Warriors: Identifying, Exposing, and Punishing Those Who Falsify Their Military Service","review":"I have read \\"Stolen Valor\\" and loved it. I am a Vietnam veteran and I was so tired of all the 'wannabee's' that now say they were over there, but never were, I had to find out if some of them really were. Although \\"Stolen Valor\\" was informative, this book \\"Fake Warriors\\" helped me out the first few hours I read it. It exposed a fake who claimed to be a Navy Seal and was not. I went right to a website that led me to a man who had a list of every single Navy Seal that ever existed. I called him up and we spoke for 1/2 hour. My guy was nowhere to be found.

How they get away with it was a mystery to me, because it ain't for nothin' that San Antonio is \\"Military City U.S.A.\\": There are three Air Force bases, an Army post and two training grounds, a MEPS, and numerous Air Force, Army, Marine and Navy Reserve Centers and National Guard armories, and even a Coast Guard Auxiliary flotilla here!But, not everybody has served in the military, so to the average civilian it's hard to detect who's the real McCoy and who's just another Eddie Bracken. And, most \\"fake warriors\\" are angling for much more than pocket change: The seemingly endless parade of spurious Medal of Honor, Bronze Star, Navy Cross, and Purple Heart recipients, Army Rangers, Green Berets (Special Forces), Navy Seals, Seabees, CIA black ops, and gung-ho Marines better beware if more people get this book and get wise to their scams! There are millions of dollars of VA benefits, and well as social esteem, and unearned gratitude these guys (and a few gals) have wrongfully pried out of an unwitting public.

Fortunately, Tarzan gets much needed help, always just in the nick-of-time, from his small band of friends: Mugambi the chief of the Wagambi, Sheeta the leopard and Akut the king of the great apes on Jungle Island.

Unlike the first two stories in the series, TARZAN OF THE APES and THE RETURN OF TARZAN, I didn't feel this story moved well. There was a lot of action and great characters, but much of the story seemed redundant. I read over and over about Tarzan eating raw meat by preference despite his being \\"civilized.\\" I didn't think that added to the plot. Plus, there were several instances in which both Tarzan and Jane misjudged other characters or made poor decisions that put themselves or others in peril. Once or twice would've been believable; but when it kept happening, the story became less appealing.Don't get me wrong, THE BEASTS OF TARZAN is still worth the read. It has all the adventure and danger that you expect from a Tarzan story, and, for me, the dimension added by animal characters was extremely interesting. If the first two hadn't been so fantastic, I probably would have given this one a higher rating. I'm looking forward to reading the other Tarzan stories.

This novel originally appeared in serial form in the pages of \\"All-Story Cavalier\\" magazine in 1914 (the popular pulp had debuted in 1905 and would end its run in 1916), with a cover price of...10 cents. It made its first book appearance two years later. The shortest of the first four Tarzan books, coming in at a mere 159 pages (I refer here to the popular series of Ballantine paperbacks of the 1960s, which introduced Tarzan to a whole new generation of readers), it is a relentlessly fast-paced and compact affair, and fairly gripping from its very first page.On that page, Tarzan--now the father, with his bride Jane Portman, of an infant son, Jack--learns that his archenemy from book #2, Nikolas Rokoff, has just busted out from a French jail. And on page 2, he discovers that Rokoff has wasted little time in wreaking his vengeance on the noble Lord Greystoke. Jack has been kidnapped, and Tarzan and Jane are soon captured and brought by ship to the deserted \\"Jungle Island,\\" off the coast of west Africa. Tarzan is marooned and left to his fate, Jack is to be handed over to a tribe of cannibals, while the devilish and lustful Rokoff has other plans for the nubile Lady Greystoke. All this, in just the first 13 pages! Ere long, Tarzan explores his desert island, becomes friendly with an ape tribe headed by the intelligent anthropoid Akut, tames a vicious panther named Sheeta (Tarzan's rescue of Sheeta and subsequent bonding with the jungle cat may recall to some readers the Biblical story of Daniel and the lion), and finds his very own Friday: Mugambi, chief of the Wagambi of Ugambi (!), a black native who, ultimately, also bonds with the Ape Man. And so, with this motley crew of man and beasts, Tarzan attempts to make it to the mainland and rescue his son and wife....\\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" as mentioned, is absolutely relentless in its pace--indeed, the entire novel is essentially one long chase sequence--and wastes zero time whatsoever in setting things up. Bang, right out of the gate, we are off and running, and the thrills just never let up! Action highlights of this entry are Tarzan's underwater fight with a crocodile, Tarzan and his crew invading a ship full of cutthroat mutineers, Tarzan's escape from the clutches of a cannibal sacrifice, and Jane's solo flight through the jungle, the crazed Rokoff at her heels. As usual, the book's chapters are arranged in cliffhanger fashion, with Burroughs practically daring his audience to stop reading. Also, as usual, the novel is presented with overlapping and concurrent story lines alternating for our attention, a device that is a tad confusing in some instances. Still, it all ultimately manages to hang together. The character of Tarzan here is very much the savage we have come to love from book #1 (he was a man of civilization for at least half of book #2), killing his animal prey and cutting out bloody steaks to devour raw. In a fascinating early segment, Burroughs shows us how remarkably proficient the Ape Man is at staying alive in the wild and at woodcraft, as Tarzan, on his first day on his desert isle, makes himself a stone knife, a bow and arrows, a loincloth, an arboreal shelter and a fire; no one on CBS' \\"Survivor\\" has ever done better, to put it mildly! The novel is an excellent showcase for Jane, also, who has not previously seemed nearly as brave and resourceful; likewise, the villainous Rokoff is presented as more diabolical, vicious and cravenly than ever, and his comeuppance toward the novel's conclusion is a satisfying one.\\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" in short, is a highly successful, extremely exciting entry in the Tarzan series, if not a perfect one. Par for the course, Burroughs makes a few flubs here and there (such as when he refers to Rokoff's lieutenant, Alexis Paulvitch, as \\"Alexander,\\" and when he writes that Tarzan had, in book #1, given the ape Kerchak a chance to escape, rather than Terkoz), but most readers will be too caught up in the fast-moving sweep of events to care, or even notice. As I've written elsewhere, even after almost 100 years, these books can prove highly addictive. For example, in \\"Beasts,\\" Paulvitch manages to escape Tarzan's clutches and flee into the jungle. Guess I'm going to HAVE to proceed on to book #4 now, \\"The Son of Tarzan,\\" to see what happens next...."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"The first two Tarzan novels were filled with action, adventure, and excitement. The third book,the beasts of Tarzan is much less exciting, as the plot is very repetitive.This time around, tarzan learns that his son has been kidnpped by an old enemy. Tarzan tries to rescue his son but ends up stranded on an island.Possibly the worst parts of the book were the ones that focused on Jane, since she can often be very dull. She, too has been taken, and she again lands on the same island ss Tarzan.While this book may not be the best in the series, I would reccomend it to anyone who is interested in the Tarzan books because it concludes the second one."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"I like tarzan books. This one was great as well. Tarzan finally got to see some of his enemies die, which was satisfying for me. Also, I enjoyed the &quot;lord of nature&quot; aspect of the book. Anyone that can control a pack of apes and a panther is pretty cool. After I read this book, I just wanted to fight another animal to the death. After I killed it, I would stand above it with the blood running down my throat and scream like tarzan does. I recommend this book for any father who is worried his son might grow up to be weak. Once again, great book."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"Although this is not my favourite of the Tarzan books, it is definitely an excellent story. I just started to read about the adventures of Tarzan and can barely put the books down. Edgar Rice Burrougs is an amazing author. &quot;The Beasts of Tarzan&quot; is no exception.After Jane and their son Jack are kidnapped, Tarzan has to return to the jungle. Once more he has to rely on his wits and his above-human strength and physique to survive in the jungle. Making several new friend (not all of them human) he has to track down Jane, his son and the men who captured them.&quot;The Beasts of Tarzan&quot; is an excellent adventure story and well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"this third installment in the tarzan series does not in the least dissapoint. the new characters plot and setting make this book a must read for tarzan fans."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"While this novel was well written, I still often found myself bored silly reading it.The tale of Tarzan, Lord Greystroke, was wonderfully told and concluded within the first two novels (\\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" and \\"The Return of Tarzan\\")...but in all honesty, I really felt it should have ended there. A third novel (and I'm sure the 20 or so sequels that followed this one) was not needed at all.As mentioned in the title, I found this third novel really disappointing. I stopped reading it a couple of times because I found it so tedious and dull (which was never the case with the first two novels), and was glad it was over when I finally finished it!Honestly, the only good part about it was seeing Tarzan's determination to save his family, and the long over-due conclusion to a particular character. Other than that...I really felt it was a waste of my time.Which is a shame, because Mr. Rice Burroughs is quite a fine writer, and the first two books were fantastic."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"\\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" is the third novel about the Lord of the Jungle by Edgar Rice Burroughs. \\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" finds the ape lord settled in civilized London as Lord Greystoke. But he becomes the target of his enemy, Nikolas Rokoff, and his henchman Alexis Paulvitch. The pair abducts Tarzan's Jane and their infant son Jack. Tarzan ends up stranded on a desert island, but with the help of Sheeta the panther and Akut the great ape he makes it back to the mainland. There he meets Mugambi, the giant chief of he Wagambi tribe, a character who goes on to become Tarzan's lifelong friend and ally (a welcome relief after the way virtually all of the natives were just a different sort of jungle animal for Tarzan to torment and kill). This odd group heads off together after the kidnappers into the deep jungle and when Tarzan finds them he lets his inner beast come up with creative ways of making them pay for the mistake of taking his wife and son. If you start reading the Tarzan novels in particular, or the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs in general, in the same order that they were written, then \\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" is pretty much around the time that it becomes clear that the storyline is usually the same. Our hero is separated from the woman he loves and spends most of the book getting her back. You can throw a baby into the mix, change the impediments placed in the way, or alter the locale from Africa to Mars, Pellucidar or the Land That Time Forgot (far and away the best part of the recipe), but the basic plot remains the same. Burroughs was also getting tired of having to write about Tarzan, which he would prove in the next book in the series, \\"The Son of Tarzan,\\" where baby Jack grows up to become Korak the Killer. Unfortunately there were more than twenty more Tarzan novels to come, which would rely more and more of a formulaic approach."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"This is as addictive as previous Tarzan's stories. In this one the archenemy of Tarzan finally gets his desserts. You have to read it!"},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"\\"The Beasts of Tarzan\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs was published in May and June of 1914 in \\"All-Story Cavalier\\". The better known details of Tarzan and Jane are handled in the first two books, but this book seems to get less of a mention than those two, or even then the following book in the series. For myself, I think this book contributes a key factor to the legend of Tarzan, that of his mastery over many animals, and his ability to call them to his aid.At the start of this book, we learn that Rokoff has escaped, and by the end of the first chapter he has kidnapped Tarzan and Jane's son, as well as Tarzan and Jane, though Tarzan doesn't know that Jane has been taken. Rokoff takes Tarzan to a tropical location by boat, and forces him to sign over his fortune, before letting him off. Tarzan believes he is getting off in Africa, and so he believes he will quickly be able to make his way back to society and chase down Rokoff, but he soon learns that he is on an island.For a while, it looks like this book will somewhat mimic \\"The Return of Tarzan\\" in it being a series of events depicting Tarzan vs. Rokoff, or Tarzan vs. some kind of wild animal, but that is not the completely the case. Burroughs puts his wonderful imagination to use and puts forward the idea of Tarzan being able to force his will over some beasts, and indeed some humans as well, and that he can then call them to aid him, and that they can call him as well. So, while it is true that the book essentially deals with those same kinds of events, Burroughs manages to make them much less repetitive to the reader than they were in the first two books.Many of the weaknesses of the first two books still exist here, but to a lesser extent, and that is why I found this to be the best of the first three Tarzan novels. One of the oddities of this book is that it ends with our heroes being in much the same position as they were before. We do meet some new characters, such as Akut, the leader of a tribe of apes, and Sheeta, a panther which Tarzan manages to master, and a villain or two are eliminated, but other than that their situation is much the same when the story ends. Ultimately, the story isn't as repetitive as the previous two books, and Burroughs' new ideas help it feel fresh and new, so I am giving this a higher rating than the first two books of the series."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"Tarzan, aka Lord Greystoke, and his wife, Lady Jane Porter Greystoke, are happily ensconced in their London home with their newborn son when the wrathful and utterly monstrous Russian villains from the previous book (THE RETURN OF TARZAN), Rokoff and Paulvitch, hatch a scheme to wreak their vengeance on the ape-man and his family once and for all. The child is kidnaped, and the parents separately taken away - Tarzan is thrown off on Jungle Island off the west coast of Africa, there to make his way slowly back to the continent to find his wife and child, and to rid himself of his enemies once and for all. One would think that by this time the wily and seemingly resourseful villains would know that just shooting Tarzan in the head is the only way to get rid of him, but that wouldn't be much fun, would it?On the island Tarzan makes friends with a tribe of anthropoid apes similar to those that raised him, in particular their somewhat smarter chief Akut; later he also finds powerful allies in Sheeta, a half-tame panther, and Mugambi, a native African chief. Finally in this third book, the legend of Tarzan as movie- and tv-viewers were to know him is complete: now when he makes his terrible battle cry, the \\"beasts\\" of Tarzan are at his beck and call to do his bidding. He has truly become \\"Lord of the Jungle\\".The Jungle Island sequence aside, THE BEASTS OF TARZAN is something of a letdown from the previous two books; the plot is an example of what would become all-too typical in Burroughs - take away the hero's wife and have him chase the bad guys for the whole book. All of the major characters, good and bad, make dumb mistakes at various points upon which the plot hinges; isn't Tarzan versed well enough in the ways of human deceit by this point not to be duped into going down to the bad section of the docks at night, alone, just because a stranger tells him that he'll get his child back? Too many examples of smart characters acting stupid, and an abundance of coincidences, make this more than a little silly at times, and the pacing is ridiculously fast even by Burroughs' standards.On the plus side though, his writing does improve here; he manages to create some real pathos in the character of the \\"evil\\"-looking, but kind-hearted Swede who protects Jane in the middle of the book, and there's a striking passage near the end where Rokoff kills a young tribesman and steals his boat that has a real poetic quality to it - a real feeling that indeed, these African \\"savages\\" in their natural habitat are far better off than we cynical and greedy westerners. We also get to see Jane acting more resourceful and less the damsel-in-distress than before; this is the first time where she really seems to be an appropriate partner to her super-heroic husband.Still high-grade pulp entertainment, then, though perhaps the weakest overall of the first half-dozen or so books in the series."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"First off, if you are interested in the Tarzan series, you can get this book and the next one together in theTarzan 2-in-1 (The Beasts of Tarzan/The Son of Tarzan) (Tarzan the Classics) (v. 1)for about half the price.In this third Tarzan things start out with Tarzan settled in to English life. Of course, its not too long before he finds himself in the jungle again, this time accompanied by a motley crew of jungle animals. This book was not quite as good as the first two, though it was still quite entertaining. It also seemed to be a little shorter."},{"Title":"The Beasts Of Tarzan","review":"Tarzan, back in civilisation, soon has to leave again. The dodgy Rokoff is now again a free man, and continues to give Lord Greystoke problems.

However, the smallest creature can make a difference, as in the story the small snail helps his friend the whale and in doing so draws attention to the plight of endangered species and how each individual can make a difference to the world.I have also recently written a new children's book in which a young princess's curiosity about a forest leads her to exploring the forest and making some unexpected friends.

The writing is much more complex, the sentences are long and the story in itself is a bit too winding for my 2.5 year old boy. We hope to begin enjoying it in a year or so."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This book is OK but I can't help thinking that the author was influenced by another book, \\"Amos and Boris\\", which is a much more sophisticated and eloquent book. This book is probably better for younger kids who are not quite ready for a richer writing style."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"I'm always looking for good books for my grandkids, ages 3 and 20 months, and this one fits my criteria perfectly. It has a great message, rhyming words make it fun to read, and the illustrations are superb. It's one of their favorites."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This is a wonderful simple story, with rhyme. Both my 4 & 6 year old really enjoy it. They also like the Gruffalo by the same author.I would highly recommend this book for anyone's classroom or home library."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"We love her books so we were excited to get this over the holidays. This book is not silly like some of her other works but it is heart warming and lovely. Two unlikely friends, a snail and a huge whale explore the seas and the snail gets to prove that even someone small can do something big. I highly recommend this book for both the sweet rhyming story and beautiful illustrations."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"We received this book at a birthday party and fell in love with its sweet story. Now we give it as a gift to everyone else!"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This book was given to us, and I will admit the looks did not appeal to me. It was a flimsy paperback and the cover illustration made me think it was more an informational coloring book. Boy was I wrong! The story is long and windy, but very melodic and rythmic and I love reading it over and over. I had to explain some things to the children as they were unfamiliar with certain aspects of the story, but they enjoyed it and have asked for it again and again. It is not going to be hold the interests of a child who likes one line per page, but it does have full illustrations on every page, and when a child is ready for a little more of a story, they will love this one. I am so happy I was wrong about it."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"I can't say enough about this book that hasn't already been said. At 5 stars it sells itself.What I will add is that each time there has been an event or opportunity to share a book with other children besides my daughter, THIS is the book that is chosen.The morals of the story, think big, take a chance, even a small creature has value, you can always do your part to help (sometimes in a VERY big way!)even if you are small, friendship, the beauty of the world...all wonderfully demonstrated in rhyming verse.The pictures are wonderful as well and don't be surprised if you choke up and have to hold back tears at some points, it is that moving! I will also add that every time we have given this book as a gift it has become the child's new favorite book...and the parents as well."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"The illustrations are gorgeous and the students and I love to pour over them. The writing is poetic, lyrical, and I love reading this aloud.I would use this book for multiple purposes in the classroom (or at home). It would be excellent for a read aloud related to science. Some of the discussions could be related to ethics (the whale is impacted by human activity on the waters, he is beached by the changes in tides), discussion of what happens when one person/being fights for another and takes action, also highlights raising awareness on good citizenship. Also the wonderful adventure the snail and the whale go on, I can see this impact children's imagination and it comes out in their journaling and pictures.This is one of those gems that has all students enthralled in the story and reading over and over."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"Great story and keeps my son's attention throughout. Very adorable book about the adventures of a snail and a whale."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"I love this story and so do my sons (6 and 2 years old).

He will not get in the car without it and sits quietly in his carseat staring at the pictures. This is a first because he never asked for a book in the car before. Sometimes all I'll hear from the backseat is \\"the humpback whale\\" or \\"itchy foot.\\" The rhymes are fun, the story is cute and the illustrations wonderful. I highly recommend this book and intend to buy more titles from this author."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This book has become a fast favorite in our household since our son received it as a Christmas gift.

Always sorry to get to the end of it!"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This book, and others by Julia Donaldson are wonderful read aloud books. My grandson (4 years old) loves the way the author has fun with words and the story. The illustrator, Axel Scheffler, creates beautiful scenes with little creatures and interesting details that encourage kids to find new things on each page with every reading. Other books we enjoy include \\"Gruffalo\\", \\"Grufalo's Child\\", and \\"Room on the Broom\\"."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"My son is 6 years old and spends most of his time in North Carolina (I'm from Texas) and because of this, he has developed a very special southern twang, so certain words are just hilarious.Hearing him read \\"The SNAY-uhl and the WHAY-uhl\\" is just so darned cute, I don't even know what to do with myself!

What a great message for small children!"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"Love this book! My son is almost 3 and I've been reading it to him since he was a baby. He loves the rhyming and the pictures. He now points out the parrot, the turtle, dolphin, grizzly, bald eagle, speed boats, seagull, lighthouse, volcano, monkey, lightning - you get the idea. I had no idea what to read to an infant as a new mom and I loved this to give me some sort of a story to tell. I'm not a huge fan of those baby books - ball, sun, doll, etc. Sometimes it's a quick flip-through and other times, he wants to hear all the details. We also love the Gruffalo by same author and illustrator."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"A fab book! Short enough for a pre-bedtime read. The rhyming words encourage children to say the word out loud, which can help children learn to read. Nice pictures too."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"I love reading this book to my daughter as much as she loves having it read to her. It is perfectly illustrated and the little details on each page page will fascinate younger children. The rhythm of the text make it a joy to read aloud."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"When I read this book to one of my grandchildren I just had to get it for the others. The usual brilliant illustrations from Alex Scheffler plus the enjoyable and 'easy to join in' style of Julia Donaldson. Will spark an interest in broad horizons from an early age."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"I read 3 books every night to my almost-4 year old daughter (I love to read and share this love with her) and this is one of our very favorites. It is beautifully written, marvelously illustrated and just so very sweet. My husband loves to read it too. A book for children that makes even parents dream about travelling adventures on the back of the whale! Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"My 27 month old son and I really enjoy Julia Donaldson's books and this book is among our favorites. It was the first of her books that we read and we liked it so much that we thought to purchase her other books without looking at other reviews and we have not been disappointed. She is a great children's book author and knows how to keep her stories interesting and just the right length for their attention span(I started this book with my son when he was under two and instead of reading the printed text which would be too long for a two year old, I described each page since the illustrations tell the story themselves-I was able to keep his interest by adding a little bit of detail each time we read it.) The illustrations are wonderful and I feel like my son got exposed to the great vastness of this world by simply going on an adventure with the snail and the whale:-)"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This book is so awesome, my not yet to be 2 year old son has memorized it word to word. No matter how many times we read it in a day, he never gets tired of it."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"We love Julia Donaldson's books. Her stories are fantastic, and her rhyming flows so smoothly. Very easy to read aloud to the kids. This story in particular is one of my favorites because of how poetically everything is described. We'll be collecting all of her books!"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This is a great book and I love reading it to my daughter over and over.

The story is well written and a pleasure to read out loud, the pictures are beautiful, and the moral of this tale of two unusual travel companions is great. Most importantly: our son loves it, and so do I (which really helps considering how often I am called upon to read it to him...)."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"The Snail and the Whale is a modern classic and a true must-have for your child's library. A good friend gave it to my son when he was born and we didn't get around to cracking it open until he was about 18 months and it has been a firm favorite ever since. It is written beautifully and is a perfect bedtime story as it is so lyrical and soothing. I cannot recommend this one highly enough. I literally feel like we've been in a magical world after we are done reading!"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This book is nicely done, nice rhyming pattern and beautiful illustrations. The story is an important one, as it shows that those who are small are important to those who are big, and vice versa. We all need each other and all have something to offer each other. A timely book that helps kids see why everyone is important."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This is one of our all time favorites! The rhyming is great, the story is great, and the delightful illustrations lend themselves to additional discussion about what is transpiring on each page.When my son was 2-1/2 a friend lent us the UK version of this book, and it was an instant hit. It was the longest book he had ever sat through at the time, and his was completely captivated from the very first word to the last. At my son's insistent request I read this book 12 times the first day we had it (and would have sat through it more times if there were someone else to read it to him), and 4-12 times a day for the next six weeks. Six months later it is still in regular rotation. I recommend it highly.FYI, there are a few changes in the US addition, which we purchased, and my son corrects me if I don't use the UK language as that is what he initially memorized. Most of the changes are insignificant, but the one he doesn't like is on the second page.In the UK version it reads:The tiny sea snail sighed and sniffed,Then cried \\"I've got it! I'll hitch a lift!\\"This is the trailOf the tiny snail,A silvery trail that looped and curledAnd said, \\"Lift Wanted Around the World.\\"In the US version it reads:The tiny sea snail sniffed and sighed,Then cried \\"I've got it!

We have almost all of them now! The Snail and the Whale is one of her favorites and I highly recommend it! Great tale, fantastic drawings.....and, I suspect it will be a book that is of interest and fun for a few more years (she is not even 2 yet!)"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"Mum's opinion: The Snail and the Whale is a delight to read with the rhyming text and adventurous journey around the world. To pick two creatures so totally different in every respect is pure genius and works like a dream. Not sure who got the most pleasure from this--me reading it or the little one listening.Oliver's opinion: I was so excited to get this book as the title made me laugh. The snail is a cheeky little chap who wants to travel. When I first saw the whale I thought he was going to be frightening as he was enormous. But he's really kind and gives the snail a lift around the world. I felt sad when the whale beached but it all turned out good and the snail got to help the whale out. I can't wait for it to be Daddy's turn to read it tomorrow.Armchair Interviews says: Our young reviewer from England loves The Snail and the Whale. He's never been wrong yet so I suspect children will love this one. It's recommended for children ages 4-8."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"I bought this book for my son and we both loved it. The story is interesting and touching with an ending that shows how even the smallest creature can make a big difference. The illustrations are great as well. Overall, this is a wonderful story for kids of all ages and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"My family is very fond of all of Julia Donaldson's books, but The Snail and the Whale is our very favorite. Axel Sheffler's illustrations are whimsical (My son has noticed that most of the insects he draws have noses)and beautiful. I am especially fond of its rhyming, making it a delight to read. Most of all, I love the messages it contains. One of which is that the world is vast and wonderful and we should get out and experience it. Also, it stresses the importance of helping one another, and being kind to our environment. A big nod goes out to The Snail and the Whale and its creators for giving us a book which is not only wonderful to look at and read, but has a valuable message. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"This is one of those books that I could read every night and not get sick of. In fact, over the past three years I HAVE read it every night for weeks at a time and still love the flow of the text.My favorite lines include, \\"And she gazed at the sky, the sea, the land, The waves and the caves and the golden sand. She gazed and gazed, amazed by it all, And she said to the whale, 'I feel so small.'\\" The word \\"small\\" is in a smaller font than the rest of the text and is so appropriate for the two page spread that includes the tiny snail (barely visible) amidst a scene of snowy mountains, forests, bears, bald eagles, the sea.Perfect for teaching the concept that it doesn't matter how big or small you are, you ARE important and CAN be successful. As the snail sets off on his mission (I won't spoil it), the text reads \\"'I must not fail,' said the tiny snail.\\" GREAT lesson!Can you tell that we love this book?!?!?"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"I grew up with Dr. Seuss, Where the Wild Things Are, the Mr. Men, and Goodnight Moon. But when I picked up this gem at a gift shop in Pitlochry, Scotland, last summer, I immediately fell in love with the stunning drawings and moving story, told in impeccable rhyme and meter. I love that it shows children that there is a world beyond their own, where strange and wonderful creatures live. My son will be two next month, and this has been one of his favorite books for several months now. He'll ask for it several times a day, and, unlike all of his other books, I never tire of reading it to him.I hope Donaldsons other books are as good, because my son will be receiving several of them for his birthday!"},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"Utterly and completely enjoyable. I have been a big fan of Julia Donaldson since finding Room on the Broom. This one doesn't disappoint. It is the story of a Snail who decides that it wants to see the world, and the whale which picks it up - and where they travel too.Beautiful meter in the lines, as with all Donaldson's books, but in this there is definitely something whimsical in the words - it is so beautifully written, but with great good humour.The illustrations are amazing (as with all Shaeffers (sp??) work. I liked the little touches to the pictures, the boat next to the Snail in the first picture is the Spirit of Glasgow, which is Donaldson's hometown. Very fun and nice book which my children really enjoy too."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"My sons (1 and 5 yrs old)and I really enjoy this book as well as \\"The Gruffalo\\" and others by Julia Donaldson. The rhyming is fun and helps the story flow and I enjoy the lesson and/or wit behind each story. These are sure to be favorites for a long time."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"I picked this book up during a trip to Cape May, NJ and it quickly became my family's favorite. The cadence of the writing and the pictures gets my 3 year old's attention, and the underlying message is what gets mine. Even my husband grows quiet when I read it. The description of the fishes' \\"feathery fins\\" and sharks' \\"hideous toothy grins\\" is just perfect.A great lesson to be learned, one small act of courage can change anyone's life and can always make a difference."},{"Title":"The Snail and the Whale","review":"My 3-year-old grandson has asked to have this book read to him every night since I gave it to him.

When her mother and younger sister, return to her father in Columbo, we are invited into Judith's life, as she makes new friends, finds a new home and finally love.For those of you who love to get to know your characters inside and out, and get lost in the story, this is for you.If ever a book deserved a sequel it's this one."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"My rating may be deceptive as I would not have finished all 728 pages of this book if I had not enjoyed it. I was in the mood for a good WW II novel, but this is really a soap opera with a World War II backdrop. Coming Home is too long by half, filled with endless descriptions of everything: clothes, scenery, people, probably pillowcases and cooking pots. At scene painting, Pilcher is outstanding. She made me want to visit Cornwall. The scenes of English country life in the 1930s were idyllic -- too idyllic -- and the heroine is too goody-goody to be believed, but the scenes of loss and longing in wartime were effective. Pilcher is good at tugging on the heartstrings and she knows how to tell a story."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Being a re-reader, I have to say that Coming Home stands up to repeated readings, and the appeal of the main character, Judith Dunbar, does not fade. However, I seem to see the story in a different light than many people who have read and loved this book and ALL the characters in it. So here's my take on Coming Home.Judith Dunbar is introduced at the beginning of the story as a fourteen year old girl in pre-WWII Cornwall, who is about to be left at boarding school while her mother and younger sister depart to Ceylon to rejoin Judith's father there - a common even in the days of the British Empire, where men worked in foreign posts and their children were sent \\"home\\" to England at very young ages. And before long, I became aware that poor Judith, a bright, sensitive, considerate and capable girl, is surrounded by schmucks, who lean on her terribly and hold back her development.Judith's own mother is a completely useless weak sister, who is such a chicken that she's afraid to drive her own car. Judith's younger sister is a horrific spoiled brat that the reader wishes would be conveniently kidnapped. She has an aunt on her father's side who seems capable enough, but who is extremely obtuse when it comes to realizing that her \\"old family friend\\" is actually a pedophile, and who is also an inconsiderate and dangerous driver. Another aunt, on Judith's mother's side is supposedly meant to be an Auntie Mame type, but who is just irritating and abrasive, is incapable of even boiling an egg, and seems to do nothing but sit around, drink and try very hard to be outrageous.So when Judith escapes this gang via a timely death in the family and a friendship in boarding school, I thought \\"thank goodness the girl will get to know some people who are not completely dysfunctional idiots\\". How wrong I was.Enter the Carey-Lewis family. They take Judith under their wing at their estate, Nancherrow. On the surface, they seem very glamorous and kind. Under the surface, it's another matter.Judith befriends a girl with the absurd name of Loveday Carey-Lewis, who seems to be the character intended to be the independent, impudent spitfire of a girl - but who is actually annoying, stupid, stubborn, spoiled beyond redemption and utterly selfish. She's consumed with a completely self-centered desire to spend her life on her family's estate (probably because she realizes that she's useless otherwise and would never survive in the outside world where she isn't petted and adored for no good reason), and she does endless harm to herself and others in her determined quest to stay there.Loveday's mother, Diana Carey-Lewis, is something right out of an old thirties movie, complete with glamorous clothing, a big Bentley, a Pekingese that she drags everywhere, and an attitude that she is the bountiful lady who does everyone a favor simply by being alive. She is also a useless parasite. Married to a gormless man decades her senior, she is surrounded by servants and lackeys, and does nothing at all for herself, even letting her bloody dog out into the garden to take a leak! She spends considerable time on \\"delicious\\" jaunts to her house in London, leaving hubby and children behind, and spends her time there at nightclubs and \\"lunching clandestinely with another woman's husband\\". How charming. Diana has utterly spoiled her three children, and has handed their raising over to nannies and boarding schools. Diana seems to be a character that Pilcher set up to be admired, but I suspect in reality, Pilcher might just want the reader to feel uncomfortable with her, as Judith does when she first meets her, before she, in her inexperience, becomes overwhelmed by the veneer of glamour and elegance that Diana exudes over her useless true self.Diana's other children, Athena and Edward, are similar parasites. Athena spends her life doing nothing but letting men pursue her and collecting the spoils of their pursuit - diamond jewelry, and bottles of \\"expensive scent\\" with which she is always \\"drenched\\". She is yet another useless woman, incapable of doing anything but looking decorative. Even when she marries and has a child, she is still frivolous and idle, names her baby something absurd and generally doesn't seem to know or care that World War II is raging, except that it's all dreadfully inconvenient, those clothing rationing coupons you know and no scent available to be \\"drenched\\" in.Edward is a downright brainless cad, who is so superficial that he never stays friends with anyone for any length of time. Once he's presented someone to his family at their estate and claims them as \\"friend\\", he drops them and goes on to the next \\"friendship\\". His family and Judith worship him, and Pilcher seems to have tried to make him into much more than he comes across as, as she writes that he lightened the life of everyone who ever met him - but Edward's actions do not back up this statement, at all - particularly the way he ends up using and then dropping poor Judith. Thankfully, the obnoxious Edward comes a cropper, and is out of Judith's life.I can't be sure whether Pilcher deliberately intended to write a book where Judith first becomes enamoured of and admiring of these people and slowly comes round to seeing them and accepting them as what they truly are, or whether she was trying very hard to make exotic, eccentric characters that everyone would fall in love with, and missed the boat. So many readers claim that they \\"loved\\" the Carey-Lewis family, and I simply cannot see it. It seems obvious to me that by the time Judith has served in the navy during the war and has sustained considerable loss, she is on her way to being far more realistic and less easily dazzled by the likes of these extremely rich, self-centered people. At one point she deliberately makes a decision, and sticks to it, despite what Loveday Carey-Lewis would like, and thinks it's about time Loveday didn't get everything her own way. She also loses much of her admiration for Diana Carey-Lewis.So I see something different in this novel than most of the people who have reviewed it here. It's indeed a coming of age story, slow and a bit ponderous at times, but with enough movement of plot of characterization that the reader stays interested. Most importantly, despite the negative Carey-Lewis characters, there are enough minor characters who are decent, giving and capable people that the reader doesn't get overwhelmed with decorative and useless women and ineffectual or manipulative men. Judith's friend, Phyllis, is a rock of dependability; Mary Millyway, the Carey-Lewises' nanny, is a forthright and sensible woman who warns her in a timely way not to be sucked into the Carey-Lewis clan; her Uncle Bob is a wonderful capable and kind man, longsuffering too as he's stuck with Judith's hard-drinking and helpless Aunt Biddy; the decent and hardworking doctor that Judith finally learns to love is such a mensch that the reader just knows that everything between them will be all right.I had the feeling at the end of the book that Judith was well on her way to being her own person, and was no longer seduced by the glamorous lifestyle of the Carey-Lewises, and basically saw through their blarney and shallowness - just as she survived the war and learned just how little a person can survive with and still have a good and happy life.I would actually be interested in a sequel to this book, to see how things work out. Of course, the way of life the Carey-Lewises enjoyed collapsed almost entirely in England after the War, so that would be an interesting wrinkle. Like Judith, much of the working class who had labored for the ultra-rich survived the war and realized that they weren't about to be servants again and act as if their rich employers were God Almighty. There were pairings in Coming Home that are bound to end up badly, particularly the selfish and useless Loveday and her war-neurosis-case of a love interest. Someday Diana Carey-Lewis' elderly husband is going to kick off and leave her, incapable of even writing a letter without fussing about how hard it all is and such a chore, in charge of a large estate.Considering all these possibilities, and knowing that Judith was largely independent of the Carey-Lewis clan by the end of Coming Home, and would survive the radical changes that came to England after the War unscathed is very satisfying indeed - and it would make a durn good book too. Possibly Ms. Pilcher could put in a sequence of Loveday being tossed by a prize bull. That would be ultimately satisfying."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. Bought this for my Mother-in-Law as she has not read it. Very good price and fast delivery."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I was initially bored and impatient with the endless detailed discriptions of trivia and the slow moving, halting story line. It eventually dawned on me that the author was not telling a story but was painting a picture of the life of English aristocracy during the latter part of the 1930's and the war years and that the story was merely a vehicle to tie the parts of the picture together."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This book was in great shape for the minimal cost.

How she reflects on them and theirlife as commoners living in Singapore, keeps them and their valuesvery near and dear to her.While the scenery is such that you can reach outand pick the flowers in Aunt Lavinia's garden,or smell the smoke and wine on Judith'sfirst visit to a pub, the time spent there seems tolast forever. This occurs repeatedly throughout thebook even though almost every place you go withJudith is breathtaking.The author definitely overstays her welcome. Thisbeautiful but lengthy story could have been written in half the pages.I recommend that you definitely finish the book asJudith and Loveday, her percocious friend, become lovely young women.You'll be elated having travelled to such beautifulplaces but expect to be exhausted from a great trip.This would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This book \\"Coming Home\\" arrived on time...But some of pages the print is above the page and cannot be read --Plus the last page is missing!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I was on pregnant bed rest when I bought this book. My parents were upset with me, my fiance had run off, my three best friends were at college out of state. My comfort and solace was in this book which I devoured in six hours and have read God-only-knows how many more times. Her characters are well developed and they seem to step out of the book and become real. I cried over Edward's situation and rejoiced for Loveday and Gus and found Judith's determination and stamina to face difficult circumstances empowering and inspiring. The muses were definitely dancing for Ms. Pilcher when she wrote this book. Another pregnancy is looming and my new husband, upon finding this book so well read, has offered to buy her other novels for me if I have to go onto bedrest.

This proved much better than the TV version as a lot of the story had been missed out. About a young schoolgirl Judith Dunbar, who is from a middle class family in 1930's England. She is left at boarding school whilst her family are in Singapore. The story surrounds her growing up and her friendship with the Carey-Lewis family who live on Nancherrow estate in Cornwall.

I will read her books again and again."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"Excellent book to read. And this one is a hard cover first edition, which I am giving as a gift. Arrived quickly too. THANKS!!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I am a big fan of Rosamunde Pitcher and always enjoy her books since she really knows how to describe the place and individuals with few words with out being overly wordy. She always weaves a good story and the characters are always believable."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"After reading so many books, I did something I have never done before, and went to read \\"Shellseekers\\" again. I quickly remembered why I bought it in the first place! Bought her next3books. \\"coming home\\" grabbed onto my heart at once. Rosmunde Pilcher has got to be one of the best Authors there is. A young girl, left in a Private School, because of circumstamces by her Parents.This child would not let herself become a victim. Ms. Pilcher, handled this very fragile topic like she was holding a young bird in her hands. But with that velvety touch, and a bit of steel.I was drawn into this child's world, and watched her grow into a strong young woman. This is a book to be read and reread. It's not only Inspiring, but you won't be able to put it down. It showedme that Rosamunde Pilcher, is also a woman of velvet and steel. The ONLY bad thing about reading her books. is that they must end. I see Great Authors come and go, but another one like Ms. Pilcher, will NEVER BE!"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"What depth of character! Easy (but not quick 700 pages!) read & thoroughly enjoyable. Great book club selection. Pilcher does an amazing job of weaving many characters seamlessly together."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"The book came in very good quality but it did not have the cover as pictured. I would have like to have the cover."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"I couldn't decide what books to read when I have my surgery ~~ and I was browsing through my shelves when I saw this. I remember loving \\"Shell Seekers\\" and \\"September\\" ~~ so I thought, who can write better than Pilcher when you're groggy and tired? I took the book, read the first fifty pages and was hooked on it from the beginning ~~ Pilcher is a classic storyteller. And her descriptions of Cornwall is absolutely stunning. This book literally beckons you to sit and have a cup of tea, cozy up on the couch and with the radio playing softly in the background ~~ and this book will take you away.This book focuses on Judith Dunbar over a period of years ~~ before the WWII started and shortly after it ended. She was fourteen when her mother and younger sister went back to Columbo to rejoin their father, before his move to Singapore. Judith was sent to live at a boarding school where she struck up a life-long friendship with Loveday Carey-Lewis, a genteel young girl who loved horses and her home at Nancherrow. Judith becomes immersed in the Carey-Lewis family as well as with her aunts and uncle ~~ and falling in love ... Their stories swept over the years with trimuphs, tragedies amidst the backdrop of the war ~~ love, sorrow and joy. Dreams discovered and shattered ~~ it is a story of a time that has never been lived since then. It is about Cornwall and WWII.This is a beautifully written novel ~~ poetic and descriptive and lovely. It is also a romantic novel ~~ not a romance novel ~~ just incredibly romantic where it does gloss over the horrids of the war but realistic enough to pierce the heart over the terrors that some of the people had faced. It is also a lush novel ~~ full of thoughts and dreams and letters written in the old-fashioned way ~~ telling stories of lives bygone. It is just an incredible novel ~~ one that I am pleased to have in my possession. Pilcher is one of the few writers in my library that I collect ~~ her writing always beckon you home. This novel is just one of those that you just have to read to know what I am trying to say here.3-11-05"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"If you are a fan of family sagas, love cozy and comforting reads, admire protagonists who endure hardship and survive, then you will love this monumental work by Rosamunde Pilcher.Set in the days preceeding, during, and after World War II in Cornwall, London, and other other spots, the reader is introduced to Judith Dunbar at age 14. She is left at a girls' school in England while her mother and younger sister Jess go to join Judith's father in Singapore. The separation stretches on for years, and Judith grows through her teen years with the help of new-found friends, the affluent Carey-Lewises, but mostly survives due to her own indomitable spirit.There is so much to say about a book that goes on for nearly 1,000 pages, but for me the plot was secondary to the endearing characters who populate this book. From Judith to her bestfriend, Loveday Carey-Lewis, the inspiriing Diana, the haunting Gus, the stable Jeremy and the host of minor characters who come to life, this is a riveting read that takes you through the trauma of war and its effects on ordinary people living their lives as best they can. The book is filled with many happy moments and perhaps even more heart-breaking ones, but always there is hope and strong survival skills working to make things right in the end."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"There are some books that I know so well, I can pick them up and just start anywhere, anytime, and be whisked away without moving a step. Coming Home is just that.We meet Judith Dunbar, a 14 year old girl in 1935, as her mother and baby sister are preparing to leave her in an English boarding school and join her father in Singapore. For the next ten years, we follow Judith and her new-found family through love, death, and the outbreak of a war that will tear Judith's loyalties in two.Rosamunde Pilcher's worlds, as always, are filled with people who you would love to meet and consider friends. The families she writes about -- even the disfunctional ones -- are families you wish you could be a part of, just so that when you finally finish the last chapter, you don't have to leave them forever. (Or, you can just start the book again ... )"},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"It isn't often that an author such as Rosamunde Pilcher comes around. She writes in the narrative voice that literally coaxes you to go to the couch and curl up with a pot of tea and her novel. COMING HOME was the first Pilcher book I read and afterward I was captured as one of her biggest fans. Pilcher has a way with each of her books to capture her readers from the first page to the last. In any Pilcher novel the reader finds themselves relating to the main characters by feeling their pain and their happiness.In COMING HOME, this main character is Judith Dunbar who finds herself torn from her family due to World War II. Pilcher takes the reader to Cornwall and a festive amount of characters that Judith begins to know. They are an odd assortment: The best-friend the reader cannot do without, the romantic, the family atmosphere that Judith so craves---- and in end, the excitement involved with simply putting all these characters together in one story.After reading COMING HOME I found myself in love with Judith and her best friend, Loveday Carrie-Lewis. The entire novel was simply enchanting. Readers of Pilcher's are looking for a book written with class, a good narrative voice, and a happy ending.COMING HOME has all elements that a good book has---- well built characters, a big problem, a careful solution, romance, relationships that steadily build, and the change that all main characters' make from the first time you meet them, to the last. COMING HOME is a wonderfully classy read. All readers will find themselves in enthralled with Judith's life and all who are in it.At the end of each Pilcher novel you sigh because it's over, and you're running to get another. All Pilcher-readers find themselves loving her easy going, narrative voice which is completely refreshing. Pilcher takes on a voice in COMING HOME that makes World War II seem more bearable to read about, and all crisis's easier to deal with. If people could live their lives like Pilcher writes a novel, everything would seem just a little bit easier to deal with. After a long day at work or at school, COMING HOME is the perfect book to take a load off and just wrap up in a novel that will entertain the reader until it sadly comes to an end."},{"Title":"Coming Home Part 2 of 2","review":"This is my favorite book. I'm reading it again - again.My favorite thing about this book is the way you get to feel so close to all of the characters. You follow the life of one girl through WWII. It might sound a little boring but, believe me, this girl's life is anything but ordinary. She is left in a British boarding school while her parents are living in Singapore. She is 14 and starting school in an unfamiliar place. Eventually she makes friends with Loveday Carey-Lewis (silly name, I know) and this changes her life drastically.As Judith grows she encounters loss, love, and a creepy old guy. It's a book about growing up and, of course, coming home.Rosamunde Pilcher makes all of the characters seem so real. It is easy to picture them in your mind and even easier to feel for them. Judith is not the only character whose life you get caught up in. There are many characters who we can all relate to. Personally, I think I'm a bit like Loveday.Anyway, this book is a definite must-read."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},E={key:1};function D(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(t(!0),a(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const W=u(L,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-d20a3438"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/42.md","filePath":"drive/42.md"}'),q={name:"drive/42.md"},O=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,O as default};
